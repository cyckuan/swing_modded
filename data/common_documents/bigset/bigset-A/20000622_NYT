PHILLIES AGAIN BEAT METS IN LAST AT-BAT, 10-5 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pat Burrell and Jason Tyner were teammates on an
Olympic development team, and the two rookies remain friends. Tyner
has a fragile hold on a New York Mets roster spot, but Burrell's
situation is different. As Tyner said the other day, Burrell, the
Philadelphia Phillies' first baseman, is ``the man.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Mets now understand what Tyner means. For the
second game in a row, the Phillies beat the Mets in their final
at-bat at Shea Stadium, and Burrell played a major role both times.
Wednesday night, he hit a pair of home runs, the second off Armando
Benitez, in a 10-5 victory. On Tuesday, he hit a game-tying homer
off Benitez and the Phillies won in the next inning.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell, the No. 1 overall draft pick in 1998, homered in the
sixth inning to snap a 3-3 tie Wednesday night and then crushed a
grand slam off Benitez to blow the game open in the ninth. One
batter before the slam, the Mets reliever John Franco had walked in
the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have gone 9-8 in their last 17 games, but they have
held a lead in each of their defeats. The losses have been hard to
take _ a blown save, a missed scoring opportunity, a wild throw _
and Wednesday night's may have been the most bitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored three early runs off the Phillies' ace, Curt
Schilling. They gave that lead to their most reliable pitcher, Al
Leiter. Then the Phillies came back to take a 5-3 lead. Then the
Mets came back to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   Then Franco came into the game. Doug Glanville led off the ninth
with a single, a high chopper to second that skittered through the
infield when Edgardo Alfonzo could not bare-hand it. Ron Gant
doubled, and after a strikeout, Franco issued an intentional walk
and faced Kevin Jordan with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who had allowed only nine walks before Wednesday night,
walked Jordan on a 3-2 pitch to force in the tie-breaking run.
Benitez then entered to boos, the fans recalling his blown save on
Tuesday, and Burrell blasted his first career slam to left.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are in the midst of their longest homestand of the
year, a stretch of 13 games, with the first nine against sub-.500
clubs and the last four against the first-place Atlanta Braves. If
the Mets were hoping to gain ground, they lost a chance Wednesday
night. The Braves lost to the Cubs, and the Mets remain four and a
half games out of first.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lost for only the second time in Leiter's 14 starts.
Leiter, a left-hander, worked six and a third innings, allowing
five runs on eight hits and three walks. The Phillies put at least
one runner on base every inning, and Leiter never got into a
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart, Schilling, was not throwing as hard as he did
before off-season shoulder surgery. Schilling is a power pitcher _
he struck out 11 in eight innings to beat Atlanta last week _ but
his fastball was only in the range of 85 to 90 mph Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling made up for it with curveballs and sliders, and after
the second inning, the Mets could do little against him, managing
just three singles. Schilling gave up three runs on six hits in
seven innings, striking out five.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling struck out the first two Mets in the first inning, but
he walked Alfonzo and gave up a tremendous home run to Mike Piazza,
the Mets' catcher. Piazza, who also hit a two-run homer in his
first at-bat Tuesday, smoked his 20th of the season, the ball
striking a railing on the side of the second deck and caroming back
to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton nearly homered in the second, driving a pitch off the
fence in left-center for a double and sending Todd Zeile to third
with no outs. Zeile scored on a ground out by Tyner, but Leiter
fanned and Melvin Mora flied out, ending the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had a 3-0 lead, but they have led at some point in
every game since May 29, the day of Leiter's only loss.
</P>
<P>
   After the third inning Wednesday night, the Mets' lead was
history. With one out Glanville, the Phillies' leadoff man, rolled
a grounder to third. But Robin Ventura's throw pulled Zeile off
first, and Glanville was safe on the throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Gant doubled, a walk loaded the bases, and Mike Lieberthal, a
.429 career hitter off Leiter, doubled in two runs. Kevin Jordan's
sacrifice fly brought in the third run, tying the score at 3-3. Two
of the runs were unearned.
</P>
<P>
   After Burrell's first homer in the sixth, a line drive over the
left field wall, Gant contributed a bases-empty home run in the
seventh, increasing the Phillies' lead to 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   While the Phillies were figuring out Leiter, the Mets' bats went
silent off Schilling. Schilling can be one of baseball's dominant
starters, and if he were available, he would be attractive to any
contending team. The Phillies will almost certainly trade another
starter, Andy Ashby, but they have no plans to trade Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling has a complete no-trade clause, and though he said he
would waive it to play for a New York team, that does not change
the Phillies' thinking, a club official said. Schilling will make
$6.5 million next year, the last year of his contract, and if the
Phillies are going to contend next year, it is Schilling who will
front their rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez Out for Season
</P>
<P>
   Rey Ordonez, the three-time Gold Glove winner at shortstop for
the Mets, who has been out for three weeks with a broken forearm,
will have season-ending surgery on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles are scouting the Mets' farm system and are
discussing the idea of trading Mike Bordick to New York. For the
moment, though, the Mets will continue to use Kurt Abbott and
Melvin Mora at short.
</P>
<P>
   A pregame conversation with manager Bobby Valentine led Mora to
believe he will be playing more often. ``He said he likes the way I
play short and he said I know Alfonzo for a long time,'' Mora said.
``And then, as soon as you feel comfortable over there, the middle
of the infield is going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mora and second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo are from Venezuela,
and they have played together in winter ball. Valentine would not
characterize the conversation, other than to say he told Mora he
would be playing less often in the outfield. Mora has been used
infrequently in the outfield since Ordonez's injury on May 29. He
has started seven games at short; Abbott has started 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez was injured in Los Angeles while applying the tag on a
pickoff play. He had leaped into the air for a wide throw from
first baseman Todd Zeile, and his left forearm was exposed when he
came down to go for the tag. The Dodgers' F.P. Santangelo was
sliding headfirst, and his helmet crashed into Ordonez's arm.

YANKEES BOTCH IT IN BOSTON AS RELIEVERS OFFER NO RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It would not have mattered in the seventh inning
Wednesday night if the New York Yankees had Juan Gonzalez, Sammy
Sosa or both. It would not have mattered if they had fielded nine
superstars. Nothing else matters when pitchers do not throw
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees took a 5-4 lead into the bottom of the seventh for
David Cone, before the relievers Jason Grimsley and Mike Stanton
gave it away, walking five hitters in the half-inning _ four in a
row at one point _ and propelling the Boston Red Sox to a 9-7
victory. The disastrous relief prevented the Yankees from winning
the third game of this four-game series, and ruined any chance of a
four-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 36-30, a half-game ahead of the Red Sox (36-31).
The rookie Jake Westbrook pitches Thursday night for the Yankees,
against Boston's Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Cone has not won a decision since April, but it was his lead
that was turned over to the bullpen in the Boston seventh. Grimsley
allowed a leadoff single to Nomar Garciaparra, before walking Carl
Everett. Third baseman Scott Brosius made a diving stop on a
grounder by Mike Stanley, and threw to first for the first out of
the inning, with the runners advancing.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hatteberg grounded sharply to second and Garciaparra was
able to score the tying run. But Grimsley walked the pinch-hitter
Brian Daubach, and then Manny Alexander, loading the bases. Of the
15 pitches Grimsley threw in the inning, five were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton took over, but he walked Jose Offerman on four pitches,
forcing home Everett with the go-ahead run. When Stanton walked the
next hitter, Jeff Frye, to score another run, he whirled on the
mound angrily, furious, his mood worsened by the screaming Red Sox
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon lined a double over the head of Paul O'Neill, and two
more runs scored. At that point Stanton was removed. Like Grimsley,
he threw only five strikes among 15 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The five-run seventh by the Red Sox was more than enough to
offset a two-run homer by Bernie Williams with two out in the
Yankee ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Summer arrived here, pushed along by a strong wind that blew
over the stands along the first-base line and gusted over the
left-field wall and toward the Charles River; for pitchers trying
to keep fly balls within the confines of Fenway Park, the most
imperfect of storms.
</P>
<P>
   The gales came into play immediately. Offerman doubled to right
to lead off the Boston first, moved to third on a ground out and
scored on a wild pitch. Nixon then lifted a high fly to center
field, and Williams, the Yankees' center fielder, moved back
steadily onto the warning track, without any panic, reaching for
the wall with his right hand, leery of banging against the fence.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled up, reached up _ and the ball carried over his head,
ricocheting against the wall. Nixon sprinted round the bases for a
triple, and he eventually scored on a grounder to first. Boston
led, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Schourek shut out the Yankees through the first four
innings, but as the fifth inning began, he seemed uncomfortable on
the mound, kicking at the dirt in front of the rubber before and
after his first pitch. He walked the first two batters in the
inning, and with one out, Chris Turner _ the backup catcher who
always seems to contribute something when he plays _ dumped a
broken-bat single into short-center field, driving home Jorge
Posada.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox still led, 2-1. But O'Neill smashed a lead-off
double in the sixth and Hipolito Pichardo replaced Schourek. Two
batters later, Posada _ who played first base Wednesday night _
lined a single to right field, and O'Neill rambled around third
with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had good stuff, his fastball consistently reaching 89 to 90
mph; he finished with four strikeouts.

EDITORIAL: SHIELDING TOBACCO FROM A LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the House are engaged in a brazen effort to
protect the tobacco industry from a federal lawsuit. The House is
expected to vote today on an appropriations bill with a provision
that would make it practically impossible for the Justice
Department to finance its lawsuit against the industry. If this
provision survives, Congress will have allowed a powerful lobby to
stop legitimate federal litigation simply because it has bought the
allegiance of some members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Justice filed a civil suit against the industry last September
seeking to recover the more than $20 billion a year that the
federal government spends to treat people with smoking-related
diseases under Medicare and other federal programs. The suit also
asks for a permanent injunction against industry deceptions about
smoking's hazards. The states have already reached settlements
totaling $246 billion over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the billions involved, Congress refused last year to
give Justice $20 million to hire lawyers and experts. But the
department went forward by using $6 million from its general budget
and raising nearly $8 million from other agencies that oversee the
largest federal health programs.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected an earlier effort to prohibit one of the
agencies, the Department of Veterans Affairs, from helping to
underwrite the litigation. But the House leadership does not give
up easily. The Justice Department spending bill up for a vote today
would prevent the department from using funds from other agencies
to support lawsuits initiated by the government, including the
tobacco case. This latest tactic deserves another rebuff.

EDITORIAL: TIGHTER RULES FOR 527 GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   After an earlier setback, the drive to end the secrecy
surrounding a pernicious form of campaign fund-raising is gaining
in the House. Today a House subcommittee is to begin drafting a
bill that could stop shadowy political slush funds from raising and
spending undisclosed sums for campaign ads. A disclosure
requirement for these groups, which have been created under Section
527 of the tax code, passed the Senate two weeks ago. It fell short
in the House the next day because of promises that supporters of
disclosure would get a chance to vote on an alternative later. The
moment to cast such a vote has now arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The abuses of the Section 527 groups have spread this year,
blowing another hole in campaign fund-raising laws. Those laws were
largely obviated when the Justice Department allowed elected
officials and party organizations to use ``soft money'' to
circumvent longstanding limits on donations. But at least the
parties disclosed the donors. This year, Rep. Tom DeLay and others
have set up what they say are independent units that run ads
attacking candidates but do not have to make their donors known.
The most notorious example occurred in March, when secret donors
who later turned out to be supporters of Gov. George W. Bush ran
attack ads against Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Joining with Sens. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin and Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut, McCain got the disclosure requirement for
Section 527 groups passed in the Senate. Foes of reform struck
back, proposing an alternative bill that would require disclosure
of donors for a wide array of public affairs and charitable groups.
Their approach was actually tailored to repel lawmakers by making
it overly broad and punitive toward unions.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Michael
Castle of Delaware, both Republicans, are joining a Democrat,
Martin Meehan of Massachusetts, to push a bill to broaden the
disclosure requirements beyond the 527 groups without making it so
inclusive that it violates the constitutional right to privacy of
advocacy organizations. Their measure would impose disclosure
requirements only on groups that spend $10,000 or more per year on
ads that mention a candidate 90 days before a general election or
60 days before a primary. Organizations that sponsor campaign
advertising would have the option of setting up separate accounts
for that purpose. Donors for these accounts would have to be
disclosed, a requirement not applying to donors supporting other
activities.
</P>
<P>
   This approach has emerged as the best opportunity for reform in
the House. Other lawmakers are pushing for even broader disclosure
requirements. But they should take care not to undermine the bill's
bipartisan backing by doing anything one-sided or destructive of
the constitutional rights of organizations involved in political
activities. After so many disappointments, if Congress cannot even
stop the clandestine fund-raising infecting the process this year,
it will be consigning the election system to the dark pre-Watergate
days of corruption and backdoor financial dealings.  &QL;

VIOLENT MOB DEFIES LAPD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Staff Writer Alexa Haussler contributed to this report 
BY BETH BARRETT and ERIK NELSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Despite the presence of 600 police officers, a
mob surged down Figueroa Street after the Lakers' victory parade
Wednesday, stealing from vendors, smashing cars and store windows,
and terrorizing motorists and bus riders.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the worst violence, an MTA bus stopped in gridlocked
traffic under the Santa Monica (405) Freeway was attacked and
vandalized by as many as 50 people, according to riders and
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Police caught up with the destructive crowd by the Shrine
Auditorium - some 1.5 miles from Staples Center - and arrested
about 12 people for investigation of crimes including disturbing
the peace and assaulting a police horse, said LAPD Cmdr. David
Kalish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of what they were doing was just minor hooliganism as
they were leaving the event,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's massive police turnout and forceful reaction sharply
contrasted with Monday night, when the rowdy crowd burned cars and
smashed windows while the Los Angeles Police Department waited
before taking control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good show of force, and it was a different
crowd,'' said Lt. Horace Frank, an LAPD spokesman. ``People just
pretty much came and just celebrated the Laker victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalish stressed that despite the turnout of 250,000 people,
``the problems were relatively minor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I think our personnel performed admirably, did an
outstanding job and the event was successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The five passengers and driver of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority bus that was attacked saw the parade from
a different, more terrifying perspective.
</P>
<P>
   As their bus traveled north on Figueroa just before Venice
Boulevard, they watched a mob surging toward them shortly before 2
p.m. Witnesses estimated that between 20 and 50 people ran into the
street and began to destroy the bus, ripping apart the computer
system, breaking windows and rendering it inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   No police were in sight, they said, even though they were near
an automobile dealership vandalized after Monday night's
championship game, witnesses on the street and aboard the bus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the mob down the road, and then they attacked the bus
from both sides,'' said Margaret Sowma of Hancock Park. ``The bus
was tossed from side to side. I thought of the (1992) riot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid they'd kick the bus over; they started kicking it
with their feet,'' said Morrie Sanchez, who had delayed leaving a
meeting for a half-hour to avoid possible post-parade disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   The riders estimated that it took anywhere from five to 10
minutes before officers in riot gear rescued them.
</P>
<P>
   Two older women on the bus said they were going home from a
seniors meeting when the bus was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Bus driver Carlos Griffen said it was the worst violence he'd
seen in his 10-year MTA career. He hit the bus's emergency alarm,
but said police took 10 minutes to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish said that when Wednesday's violence began, police
scrambled to contain it but heavy traffic in the area made it
difficult to respond.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 50 people jumped onto the bus, said Elvia Rodriguez,
the receptionist at the Toyota dealership. ``Gangsters were doing
signs. There were no police,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the bus, the crowd turned a lighted-arrow lane-closure
marker on its side just as helmeted police officers arrived to
chase them away.
</P>
<P>
   As the same crowd continued south, young men jumped onto cars,
denting roofs and splintering windshields. At one point, the
hooligans rushed a catering truck and stole its contents.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the roving mob passed through, Naveed Ulhaq, 19,
of Torrance surveyed the smashed windshield and dented hood of his
silver Acura. About 15 feet behind the car was Alondra Sandoval,
20, of Ontario, whose compact sedan had a large indentation on its
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   At 21st and Figueroa, Tiffany Craft, an import-export manager,
looked out from the grating protecting the front door of Bisou
Bisou, a designer clothing company, and praised the way police
reacted to the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were actually awesome as far as protecting the buildings
in the area, but there were some things they couldn't prevent,''
Craft said.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed across the street to the facade of Alarms Depot
Inc., which had its narrow plate-glass storefront smashed in.
``That's sad, because their window had just gotten smashed Monday
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the vandalism occurred during the parade.
</P>
<P>
   As police chased away people who had occupied the roof of a
KCBS-TV (Channel 2) news truck across from Staples Center,
44-year-old Deborah Willis of Pacoima stood crestfallen next to her
white Toyota Camry.
</P>
<P>
   The car's windshield was broken and its roof, hood and trunk
looked as if they, too, had been used as a viewing platform for the
parade. ``I can't start it,'' she said mournfully as her son and
daughter huddled about her.

GALAXY'S VICTORINE STRUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ After a quick start that included a goal and
two assists in his MLS debut, a 4-0 victory over MLS champion D.C.
United on March 25, Galaxy rookie Sasha Victorine has struggled to
stay effective. He has only one point since, an assist against New
England, May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Victorine has been pushed around by physical defenders such as
San Jose's John Doyle, but Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said he's not
worried that his former UCLA standout will find his rhythm again.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said that breaking in as a striker is much tougher than
breaking in anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're young, the easiest place to step into is a
marker,'' said Schmid. ``A (defensive) marker just comes in and
shuts his guy down, you don't have the responsibility to come in
and make the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hardest to break in as a midfielder and especially a
forward. There's more demanded of you. Sasha, he's kind of going
through a curve, he's in a little bit of a valley, but I feel
confident he'll come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) If the MLS all-star voting was final, the Galaxy would
have six players on the West squad for the July 29 game in
Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy leads all MLS teams in voting. Cobi Jones (forward),
Mauricio Cienfuegos (midfielder), Robin Fraser (defender) and Kevin
Hartman (goalkeeper) lead voting in their positions. Defender's
Greg Vanney and Ezra Hendrickson are among the top four in
defensive votes.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) The Galaxy leaves on a crucial 10-day, three game road
trip this afternoon. They face MLS and Western Division leader
Kansas City on Saturday, followed by D.C. United (June 28) and
Dallas (July 1). The team returns to the Rose Bowl, July 4, against
Columbus.

NEW LEGACIES AWAIT IMPRINT OF YOUNG STARS 
</HEADLINE>

   SEATTLE _ Maybe Tiger Woods isn't the next Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's the next Bjorn Borg, the genius filled with grace and
ice-water execution who wakes up the morning of a major tournament
and finds, deep in his heart, the fire suddenly extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Six times in seven years, Borg won the French Open. Five
consecutive times Borg won Wimbledon. Tennis was a boom sport
during those long-haired 1970s, and Borg was leading the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's summer, with Wimbledon around the corner, you can
rattle the memory bank and see that famous image of the new king
Borg after his epic victory.
</P>
<P>
   He is kneeling on the worn grass at Centre Court, hands raised
to his savior-like face, his eyes rolling back in disbelief as if
to say no one can stop him. The only one who could was himself.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Borg eventually did.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Woods' intelligence and emotional strength are far
greater than Borg's, but what happens if Woods runs out of
incentive?
</P>
<P>
   He won't need more money. He doesn't have anyone to play
against, not David Duval or Sergio Garcia or Ernie Els. Soon, he'll
give us a round of 58, so that will be another milestone passed.
</P>
<P>
   And, at this rate, the 18 major titles that would match Jack
Nicklaus are considered a foregone conclusion. But does he have
some other mark in mind to distance himself completely from prior
champions such as Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Gene Sarazen or Gary Player?
</P>
<P>
   Amidst the awe inspired by this 24-year-old, one does question
how we are supposed to know what his legend and legacy is going to
be.
</P>
<P>
   This has become an intriguing season of comparing new champions
to old. It has happened time and again this summer, but are the
right factors being considered?
</P>
<P>
   Aren't Woods, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant products of a new
generation _ child prodigies bred in an era of television and
marketing, groomed to arrive at this lofty place?
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that changes the dynamics of who they are and what they
could become.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you have to consider that maybe O'Neal isn't the next
Wilt Chamberlain or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Shaq is just Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's big and a lot more lovable than most of his early
detractors gave him credit for. Maybe he's Shaq the champion this
week and Shaq ``Kazaam'' the next week and Shaq ``Three Rings is
Good Enough'' some time down the line.
</P>
<P>
   One championship, though significant, does not script his
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bryant, is it right to put him in a box that says he's
the new Michael Jordan and that the Lakers are the new Bulls, or
the reincarnation of the old Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   Please. How can these new Lakers, who will undergo changes this
off-season, since Glen Rice is not the perfect triangle-mate, be
talked about in the same breath as the Magic Johnson/Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar/James Worthy Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   But back to Kobe. Granted, being like Mike is a desirable box to
be put in.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe's voice sure sounds like Jordan's. His adidas commercials
are knockoffs of Air Jordan's soaring Nike ads. The young Lakers
star is as handsome as Jordan. His moves mimic the greatest
basketball player of all time.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something strange about watching Bryant perform
inside this Michael Jordan mold. We don't really know yet who this
21-year-old will grow up to be. On the court, in his heart, in his
mind. Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   His coach questions how comparisons to Jordan continue. Surely,
at this stage of his young career, Bryant can beam out the promise
of being like Mike, but this is an entirely differently person who
may never have the coldness, the will, the drive to approach what
Jordan became.
</P>
<P>
   And so what if Bryant does not get there?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the longer the comparison continues, the less likely we
will see who Kobe Bryant is becoming. Worse, the less likely it
might be that Bryant will establish his own image, his own way, his
own mark on the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. has long been called the next Willie Mays, the
next Hank Aaron, the Michael Jordan of baseball. The over-the-back
catches, the prodigious home-run production and the charisma have
warranted comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, back home in Cincinnati, Griffey is working
through a season that will ensure his career his uniquely his own.
</P>
<P>
   The need for comparison is understandable. It is a sign of
appreciation, of acknowledging we're watching something rare,
startling. But sometimes, it takes the test of time, the unfolding
of seasons and of a personality, for the real image to emerge and
lasting impact to be known.
</P>
<P>
   The splendor isn't in comparing what was. It's in watching what
is.

HOUSE PANEL ENDORSES REPUBLICAN PLAN FOR DRUG BENEFIT IN MEDICARE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for writethru with bill being approved) 
(EDS: Story is added started on The New York Times front page)  By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Ways and Means Committee approved
legislation Wednesday night to offer prescription drug benefits to
all 39 million people on Medicare, and Republican leaders said they
hoped the full House would vote on the bill within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The committee endorsed the legislation by a party-line vote of
23-14, with Republicans supporting the measure and Democrats
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of the committee,
said, ``Now is the time to add prescription drug coverage to
Medicare _ right from the start, our bill will give 5.5 million
low-income seniors a prescription drug plan at minimal cost.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., said the measure was ``basically
a hoax, a prescription for failure,'' because it did not guarantee
that elderly people would actually get drug benefits at an
affordable price.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, drafted by Republicans, the government would pay
subsidies to private insurance companies to encourage them to offer
insurance policies covering drug costs of the elderly. But the
government itself would not directly provide drug coverage, nor
would it purchase drugs or regulate drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday night, by a vote of 22-12, the committee
rejected a proposal by Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., that would have
authorized the federal government to offer a standard package of
drug benefits throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guarantee of any particular benefit that our
constituents will get if the Republican bill is enacted,'' Cardin
said. ``The Republicans say this would be an entitlement program,
but there is no specific benefit that seniors are entitled to.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for people who are elderly or
disabled, but generally does not cover drugs for people outside the
hospital. One-third of the elderly have no insurance to cover drug
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House Republican bill, the details of drug insurance _
benefits, premiums, co-payments and deductibles _ could vary from
one private insurer to another, so long as the total value was
equivalent to that of a standard policy defined by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Cardin's proposal encapsulated the differences
between the two parties. Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La., argued against
the Cardin proposal, saying: ``We don't want the government to
control health care. It has not done a particularly good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Republicans said it was unnecessary for the government
itself to provide drug benefits because private insurers would do
the job with federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Merck-Medco Managed Care, a unit of Merck &AMP; Co., the worldwide
drug manufacturer based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., said Wednesday
that it wanted to offer drug coverage under the House Republican
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Congress, Per G.H. Lofberg, chairman of
Merck-Medco, said, ``We would work to develop a prescription
drug-only plan that we could offer nationwide in competition with
others in what we expect will be a highly competitive market.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Cardin said, ``I don't know whether my constituents in
Maryland will have this Merck plan available to them five years
from now.'' Cardin said he feared that insurers would move in and
out of the market for drug benefits, just as health maintenance
organizations have moved in and out of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders said they hoped the full House would
pass their Medicare bill by the end of next week, when lawmakers
leave town for Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Tarplin, an assistant secretary of health and human
services who attended Wednesday's session of the Ways and Means
Committee, said, ``We strongly oppose this bill.'' On the House
floor, Democrats will have an opportunity to offer a proposal of
their own as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether a Medicare drug bill becomes law this year
_ and no one can be sure _ House Republicans said they hoped that,
by taking up the legislation, they could inoculate themselves
against attacks by Democrats exploiting one of the most potent
political issues in this fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill says that all Medicare beneficiaries would
have a choice of two or more private drug plans. If insurers did
not voluntarily enter a particular market, the government could
offer financial incentives to draw them in.
</P>
<P>
   But a critique of the House Republican bill, prepared by the
Clinton administration, said: ``Insurers are unlikely to
participate unless bribed. The new Medicare bureaucracy could
increase payments to insurers to bribe them to participate. This
will make insurers hold out to get higher payments.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the administration said, the Republican proposal
``relies on a flawed trickle-down theory that would end up
subsidizing insurers, not seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Republican
bill would cost $39.7 billion over the next five years and $158
billion from 2001 to 2010. Republicans said that beneficiaries
would pay premiums averaging $37 a month, or $444 a year, for drug
coverage under their proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republican leaders have not shown any sense of
urgency, though they acknowledge that millions of low-income
Medicare beneficiaries cannot afford the drugs they need. The
chairman of the Finance Committee, Sen. William Roth Jr. of
Delaware, a Republican in a tight re-election race, has said he
wants the panel to vote next month on comprehensive Medicare
legislation, including drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republican leaders are wary, fearing that the cost of
drug benefits could explode.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican bill defines a model drug insurance policy,
known as ``standard coverage.'' Under this policy, a Medicare
beneficiary would pay an annual deductible of $250 and would pay
half of the next $2,100 a year in drug costs. Most patients would
then be responsible for their own drug expenses, but the
beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs would be limited to $6,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, each insurer would negotiate with drug companies to
obtain drug price discounts comparable to those now secured by
large purchasers like hospitals and HMOs. Medicare patients would
get these discounts regardless of whether they had reached the
limits of their drug insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Ways and Means Committee voted, 23-14, to reject a
Democratic alternative very similar to a plan offered by President
Clinton. Democrats said their proposals would have cost $100
billion over five years, or 2.5 times as much as the Republican
bill. Democrats said that a large increase in anticipated federal
budget surpluses permitted more generous drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's debate focused on the proper role of government.
Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, said:
``Democrats are for an affordable, guaranteed benefit under the
Medicare program. Republicans want to basically privatize this
benefit, as they've always wanted to privatize Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep &UR; . &LR;  Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the
Ways and Means Committee, said: ``The Republicans have no
confidence in providing assistance directly to our aged. Rather,
they want to subsidize the private sector, the HMOs, the insurance
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they would offer what the elderly want: more
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Tillie Fowler of Florida, vice chairwoman of the House
Republican Conference, said: ``Unlike the Clinton-Gore plan, we
give all seniors and the disabled the right to choose an affordable
prescription drug benefit that fits their needs. Americans can
choose a Cadillac plan, or they can opt for a more affordable Honda
plan.''

   CUSTOM-FURNITURE (Undated) _ For anyone unsatisfied by the

or frustrated by the prices of vintage furniture, commissioning a

on a project smaller than a house or an interior. In some cases, it
solves a problem that couldn't be solved with existing furniture.
Commissioning custom work can be comparable to the cost and
delivery time of more expensive, mass-produced items. And it's
cheaper than antiques. By William L. Hamilton.

grandparents' sleeping porch, sheets thrown back exposing our
scrawny little bodies, the fetid darkness of a Washington D.C.
summer night visible through the screened walls of the porch. We
spent every summer sleeping on a screen porch in those days, when
air conditioning was an exclusive feature of the movie theater
downtown, nowhere in evidence in our home or the homes of anyone we
knew. The sleeping porch was something we looked forward to, when
the heat and humidity would finally build to the point that the
cots would be dragged out and once again we'd be exposed to the
elements _ cooled, if only slightly, by an itinerant breeze, sung
to sleep by the insistent nighttime chatter of cicadas. By Lucian

SHAW WILL SHARE CLOSER'S ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON - Jeff Shaw's arm and shoulder are healthy, but after he
allowed a solo homer to Houston's Jeff Bagwell on Tuesday, the
closer's spot isn't solely his.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said matchups will dictate whom he
uses to close games. The decision comes after Shaw blew his sixth
save in 18 chances when he allowed the ninth-inning homer to
Bagwell. The struggle was compounded when Shaw yielded a double to
Lance Berkman and walked Moises Alou before being bailed out by
rookie Matt Herges.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago Shaw blew a save against the Mets, and afterward
it was learned Shaw was experiencing weakness in the back of his
shoulder. He didn't pitch for a week, then returned in non-closing
situations before earning his first save in a month Sunday against
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still consider (Shaw) to be the prime guy, but I'm going to
look at the matchups and make sure the matchups are in his favor,''
Johnson said. ``I think he's been making progress. His previous
four outings were pretty good. Hopefully, he'll get back to where
he was, but I'm not going to just hand it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he thought about using Terry Adams to pitch the
ninth with the Dodgers holding a one-run lead in Tuesday's 9-6 win
in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Shaw) just didn't locate,'' Johnson said. ``He tried to throw
it away and he threw it right down the middle. I think it's
something where I'm still going to have to watch his workload,
watch the matchup. The matchup wasn't real good to begin with -
Bagwell was hitting .500 off him before, but being the masochist
that I am, I wanted to see where he was at.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz due today: When Jose Vizcaino arrived at Fenway Park to
greet his new Yankees teammates Wednesday, Jim Leyritz was still
packing up his gear. Leyritz, acquired by the Dodgers in exchange
for Vizcaino, is expected to be available for today's series finale
with Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has always said I'm an ideal National League player
because I can play everywhere,'' said Leyritz, who's batted .218
with a homer and four RBI for the Yankees. ``I haven't talked to
Davey about what my role is going to be, but I think, in the
National League with no DH, the double switches, hitting for the
pitcher, there'll be something for me to do pretty much every day.
I'm looking at it as an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz is to be paid $1 million this season while Vizcaino is
owed $3.5 million in the final year of his contract. The Dodgers
will pick up just shy of $1 million of Vizcaino's deal.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz has played with the Yankees, Boston, the Angels and San
Diego. He has 89 career homers, and eight in the postseason, but
none more memorable than his eighth-inning shot off Atlanta's Mark
Wohlers in the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, I just think he's not afraid of the pressure,
not bothered by big situations,'' said Dodgers ace Kevin Brown, who
played with Leyritz for the 1998 NL-champion Padres. ``He kind of
thrives on it. I think he's a good one to have, someone that enjoys
and thrives under those conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino was thrilled to arrive in the Yankees clubhouse, even
if it was on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the Yankees on TV Sunday, and I was saying, 'I
hope I get a chance to play in Yankee Stadium before I retire,' ''
Vizcaino said. ``Now I'm going to be wearing Yankee pinstripes.
It's a privilege to wear the uniform of the greatest organization
in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley return set: Though the timetable is a little slower than
he hoped, injured Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley will begin a rehab
assignment Friday in Triple-A Albuquerque with a targeted return
for Monday's series opener with San Diego.

LOS ANGELES: It's good craziness.'' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most fans only caught a glimpse or two of the stars because the
players were mixed in with other people on the buses. At Staples
Center, the sound system was poor and the viewing stage far away
from the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for most, it seemed to be enough.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neal shouted, ``Can You Dig It?'' the crowd erupted, as
they did when Kobe Bryant, the Lakers' dizzyingly talented,
21-year-old guard, said, ``We love you!''
</P>
<P>
   The day, many said, wasn't just about seeing the Lakers stars up
close. It was also about feeling good about Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Fans began to arrive by car, light rail, bus, and even bicycle
before 7 a.m., mingling with each other and the street vendors.
Many shared water or stories of past Lakers greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Martinez, a delivery driver in Rosemead, told his boss
he'd be back later, jumped on his bicycle and pedaled 23 miles with
a buddy to the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 12 years since we've seen this,'' said Martinez,
wearing his new, $69.99 Lakers jersey. ``That makes it just that
much more special.''
</P>
<P>
   Many passed the time at the arena listening to the Lakers band
and monitoring the parade, which began at the Department of Water
and Power headquarters on Hope Street, where about 3,000 people
heard Jackson and O'Neal predict a dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal then gave L.A. Police Chief Bernard C. Parks a check from
himself and the Lakers to pay for two $42,000 patrol cars destroyed
in Monday's melee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to say when we get one next year, we just want to be
safe and everybody to do the right thing because we're going to get
one next year,'' O'Neal told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The act of generosity had already rippled far ahead through the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq's paying for the police cars,'' said Johnny Razo of Los
Angeles, the man who tried to sell his cool spot under a skimpy
tree, and the word rippled along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we're Laker family,'' another man said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No color lines, peace,'' a third chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who endeared himself to the city both for his superhuman
basketball skills and his penchant for bestowing grand, yet
self-deprecating nicknames upon himself, added another to the
string.
</P>
<P>
   ``And from now on, I am no longer `the Big Aristotle,''' O'Neal
joked, playing to the crowd. ``I want to be known as `the Big
Shakespeare' because it was Shakespeare who said: `Some men are
born great, some achieve greatness, some have greatness thrust upon
them.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great doing this this year for the city and for
everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this for the city,'' agreed Jackson, who won six
championships with the Chicago Bulls before joining the Lakers less
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The team was showered with confetti from spectators sitting on
sidewalks, rooftops and balconies.
</P>
<P>
   At times, some fans had to be ushered back to the sidewalk by
officers in riot gear. A few people were handcuffed and taken away
from the parade route.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Bryant flashed peace signs to the crowd as
screaming celebrants snapped pictures and tossed T-shirts and caps
up to the players for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   As a skywriter wrote ``Lakers'' in the sky and the Lakers band
played ``We Are the Champions,'' people in the crowd at Staples
Center stood on their toes and screamed as the team finally arrived
nearly an hour late.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that the speeches were short or the players
hard to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see them on TV, but with the expensive Staples tickets,
you can't see them,'' Sean Telles, a college student from San
Gabriel, said. ``When you're here, you feel the energy, and it's
good energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Orozco of West Covina cradled his video camera as he sat
in a lawn chair and waited for the crowd to clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shot in the arm in terms of love,'' he said. ``The
city's getting together to celebrate.''

L.A. WHOOPS IT UP FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Staff Writer Eric Nelson contributed to this report 
BY BETH BARRETT, ALEXA HAUSSLER and RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal and his Lakers teammates lifted
the spirit Wednesday of a city starved for greatness onto their
shoulders for a few glorious hours that made everyone feel like
world champions.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating their first NBA Championship in a dozen years with
Los Angeles' largest-ever sports parade, the Lakers rode through
the heart of downtown on red double-decker buses as 250,000 or more
fans cheered themselves hoarse in a sea of purple and gold jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lakers took turns holding aloft their NBA Championship
trophy, the caravan inched its way to City Hall, where Mayor
Richard Riordan and other city dignitaries thanked them. Then, in
fits and starts, the parade crept along an 11-block route to
Staples Center, where a roaring crowd jammed parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Lakers,'' exulted Tyesha Anthony, a Chatsworth
resident wearing a Glen Rice jersey, who said she skipped work to
be at the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love them, because they're a team that works together and
that's what it's all about. They're what's uniting us now. They
give the city pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan proclaimed the Lakers ``a new dynasty,'' and Coach Phil
Jackson promised the championship will simply be ``the first of the
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   And MVP O'Neal, with all the raw power of his smashing dunks,
hit the joy of victory hardest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you dig it? Can you dig it? Can you dig it?'' he roared to
the crowd gathered at Staples Center. The crowd roared back.
</P>
<P>
   Police were on alert early, with more than 600 officers on foot
and dozens of others on motorcycles and horseback and in patrol
cars. Their massive presence contrasted with their passive stance
Monday night, when cars were burned and property destroyed after
the Lakers defeated the Indiana Pacers, 116-111, for the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was some violence after the parade and police moved
quickly against troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what takes the fun away from the sport,'' said Henry
Hernandez, 37, of Canoga Park, who saw one, then another, glass
bottle smash on the street near where he stood. ``I've been out
here since 5 a.m. and all of a sudden, you get somebody throwing a
bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   A relentless sun forced hundreds of people to seek medical
treatment for heat exhaustion, most of them elderly fans or young
children. Supplies of oxygen and ice were quickly used up, but most
problems were considered minor.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that dampened the sky-high spirits of the adoring
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Mestaz drove in from the Mojave Desert for his dad, who
died about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always used to talk to my dad about the Lakers, and though
he liked them, he'd always say, 'They'll never make it,''' Mestaz
said. ``When they won, my wife said, 'You owe it to your dad to
go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many people used a sick day, took a long lunch hour or skipped
school to join the throng with their cardboard cutouts of O'Neal,
Lakers banners, posters of the Lakers cut out of the Los Angeles
Daily News and various noisemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff and Liz Tanalega of Northridge said they were awakened
early by their 15-day-old daughter, Jeliza Rose, took one look at
each other and knew they had to drive to Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, 'Let's go!,''' Liz Tanalega said. ``We're such big
fans and it's such an experience being out here. There's so much
adrenaline. It's good craziness.''

RANGERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MISTAKE-PRONE TWINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ This is called a winning streak, and it's not
just a midsummer night's dream.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have seen it before, even if it has been a couple of
weeks. But it does happen, especially when the other team is the
one kicking the ball, dropping it or throwing it into the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins put on such a slapstick exhibition with
their defense last night, and the Rangers took full advantage of it
with a 7-5 victory at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to win a game, regardless of how you do it,''
shortstop Royce Clayton said. ``The object is to win, however you
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Twins errors, two by pitcher Bob Wells in one
record-breaking inning, led to three unearned runs, and shortstop
Cristian Guzman failed to handle Dave Martinez's one-hop smash in
the fifth inning, turning a potential inning-ending double play
into a two-run double. Put it all together and the Rangers were
able to win for the second consecutive game, a two-game winning
streak last accomplished June 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Esteban Loaiza, trying to maintain his tenuous
spot in the rotation, battled through six innings to get the
victory, his first since May 25. His offense and the Twins' defense
combined to give him a 6-4 lead through six innings, and the
bullpen combination of Mike Venafro, Jeff Zimmerman and John
Wetteland made it stand up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time,'' Loaiza said. ``We need to win games
after a bad \R1-8\S road trip. We just need to keep swinging the
bats and pitch the way we have the last couple nights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers weren't completely dependent on the Twins' futility
against starter Brad Radke. Designated hitter David Segui was
3-for-4 with three runs scored, and the Rangers received no less
than four two-out run-scoring hits: a double by Mike Lamb in the
second and singles by Clayton in the fourth, Ivan Rodriguez in the
sixth and Rusty Greer in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things we weren't able to do when we weren't winning
games,'' Clayton said. ``We were leaving runners in scoring
position and not getting the big hits. Tonight and last night we
were able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers would have been in deep trouble if the Twins had
played a little better defense, starting with Guzman in the fourth.
With Segui at second and two outs, he fielded Gabe Kapler's routine
grounder and proceeded to bounce his throw past first baseman Butch
Huskey. It ended up in the Rangers' dugout, allowing Segui to
score. That erased the Twins' 2-1 lead and, after Kapler went to
second, Clayton put the Rangers ahead with his single to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things happen, and you have to take advantage of it,''
Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins tied it in the fifth, but the Rangers went ahead in
the bottom of the inning. With runners at first and second,
Martinez smashed a one-hop grounder that caromed off Guzman's glove
and out to right-center field, allowing both runners to score.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got one more in the sixth when Wells, who relieved
Radke, dropped Kapler's popup for an error and later tried to pick
him off second with nobody covering. Kapler went to third and
scored on Rodriguez's single. Wells did throw out two runners on a
grounder and a bunt, giving him four fielding chances in one
inning, a dubious American League record for pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Another run scored in the eighth after Clayton led off with a
single. Pitcher Travis Miller picked him off first, but first
baseman David Ortiz threw wildly as Clayton went to second,
allowing him to end up at third. Greer, with his fourth consecutive
multihit game, drove him home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard the last two games and made the Twins make
mistakes,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got a long ways to go,'' Clayton said. ``But we
just need to play good, solid baseball. We've got a good stretch of
games at home, and we've played well at home so hopefully history
will repeat itself.''

IT'S NOT FUN TO BE AT THE YMCA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Bad Day, Definition No. 743:
<P>
   In the parking lot of the Marin YMCA Tuesday, a man backed his
car out of a handicapped-parking spot.
</P>
<P>
   Crash. He crunched into the left front panel of a parked,
late-model sedan. There was enough damage that the driver's car had
to be towed.
</P>
<P>
   While our guy was filling out a police report, someone ran out
of the YMCA building and told him he had an urgent phone call
inside _ from the San Rafael Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The SRFD informed our guy that his house was on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, our guy caught a break. It turned out that his
house was not ablaze. A field near his house was burning.
</P>
<P>
   But for a minute there, the guy had a great hard-luck story
going.
</P>
<P>
   TIGER WOODS kissed his U.S. Open trophy, a long kiss; it's a
good thing it wasn't a freezing cold day.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal kissed and hugged his NBA Finals MVP trophy,
and Laker teammate Kobe Bryant carried on with the NBA championship
trophy until you wanted to yell at the screen, ``Get a room!''
</P>
<P>
   Gives a whole new meaning to the term ``trophy wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``WE'RE STILL in business.'' That is the message of an ad in The
Chronicle placed by Stanford Hospital and clinics, currently
experiencing a nurses' strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucile Packard Children's Hospital ... had 43 women who
delivered new babies this past weekend alone,'' the ad brags.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Tileston wonders, ``Why is there no mention of the number
of  &UR; old  &LR; babies that were delivered?'' Age discrimination?
</P>
<P>
   And if the hospital is well-staffed, why did those 43 women give
birth alone?
</P>
<P>
   TOO MANY CARS in San Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Lakerize 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Invite a couple of busloads of Laker fans up here for a
celebration party. They would roll and torch a few hundred
vehicles. It's not vandalism, it's thinning the herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those aren't real Laker fans,'' city and team officials are
saying in Los Angeles about the rioters and vandals.
</P>
<P>
   Sure they are. Look at the pictures. They're wearing Laker
jerseys. They were out there in the arena parking lot, watching the
video screen, cheering the team on.
</P>
<P>
   So they  &UR; are  &LR; Laker fans. Stupid and mindlessly violent Laker
fans, but still.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not like L.A. doesn't have cars to burn.
</P>
<P>
   CAR STUFF: Allen Duzak spotted a car with a bumper sticker,
``Hang up and drive.'' The driver was reading a book. ... Yana
Murphy saw a woman driving a blue Audi, license plate ``INNIE.'' It
took Yana a second to figure it out. ... Walt Giachini says to stop
griping about the $3 toll on the big bridge and the $2 tab on the
others. He saw a Disney Channel documentary on bridges. A new
suspension bridge in Kobe, Japan, has a toll of $27. ... The Old
Homeboy suggests Toyota pull those TV commercials of Steve Young
driving around with hot-looking dates. Steve is married. Do
Toyota's ad people have concussions? ... And John Jamison was
trying to walk across Montgomery, but had to wait to allow three
red-light-running cars to zoom past. An elderly gent beside John
muttered, ``There oughtta be a law.''
</P>
<P>
   OVERHEARD near Union Square, one Delta flight attendant telling
another how she handled an in-flight emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-to-SFO flight was full, the attendants were busy
serving dinner when a passenger rang his call button and told the
attendant, ``My baked potato is bad!''
</P>
<P>
   Attendant: ``So I picked it up off his tray, gave it a couple of
good spanks and said, `Bad potato! Bad potato!' I put it back on
his tray and told him, `Sir, if that potato gives you any more
problems, you just let me know.' ''
</P>
<P>
   THAR SHE BLOWS: The suggestion here that it might be exciting to
watch authorities dispose of a beached whale carcass by blowing it
up with dynamite stirred the memory of George Seaman.
</P>
<P>
   George takes us back to about '55, when he was the gunnery
officer aboard a Coast Guard cutter in the Atlantic. The ship came
across a dead whale and George thought it would be a good target
for gunnery practice. The crew fired its 40mm guns at the whale.
They thought they might even be able to sink it.
</P>
<P>
   The shelling did nothing, although Seaman says it was a hoot.
Then the commanding officer decided the carcass was a navigational
hazard and ordered Seaman to blow it up with dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   George had no experience with dynamite. He and another crewman
rowed out to the carcass, chopped a hole in the top of the whale
with a fire axe and stuffed in the dynamite. But they didn't use
enough, and the explosion was nothing more than a muffled poof.
</P>
<P>
   So the commander ordered the cutter to ram the whale several
times, finally slicing it in two.
</P>
<P>
   Some questions remain:
</P>
<P>
   -- Doesn't every whale already have a hole on top?
</P>
<P>
   -- George  &UR; Seaman? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the book open with the line, ``Call me Ishmael
Caulfield?''
</P>
<P>
   -- In the movie version, will Shaquille O'Neal prevent a
Titanic-like disaster, shredding the carcass by standing on the
cutter's bow and shooting free throws at the dead whale?
</P>
<P>
   -- Were they sure the whale wasn't merely napping?

 COURT FINDS BIAS IN UNITED AIR'S OLD WEIGHT RULES  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a victory for thousands of women, a federal
appeals court ruled Wednesday that weight limits United Airlines
imposed on its flight attendants between 1980 and 1994 illegally
discriminated against women.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-to-1 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco
said the weight restrictions for women were ``far more stringent''
than those for men, resulting in unfair treatment. Employees who
could not meet the weight requirement were suspended without pay or
fired.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which could cost United millions of dollars, is a
long-awaited victory for as many as 16,000 former and current
female employees who were part of a class action suit against
United. The decision reverses a ruling by U.S. District Judge
Charles Legge, who dismissed the lawsuit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling in favor of the women, the appeals court said there is
no evidence that the weight requirements had any bearing on an
attendant's ability to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``United made no showing that having disproportionately thinner
female than male flight attendants bears a relation to flight
attendants' ability to greet passengers, push carts, move luggage
and, perhaps most important, provide physical assistance in
emergencies,'' wrote Judge William Fletcher in the court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, he said, ``United's discriminatory weight
requirements may have inhibited the job performance of female
flight attendants.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was one of several filed in the 1980s and 1990s
against the major airlines over weight restrictions imposed on
flight attendants. Some were settled, while others prompted
airlines to drop their policies. United voluntarily ended the
practice in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great victory for flight attendants and for women,''
said Ed Gilmartin, associate general counsel for the Association of
Flight Attendants in Washington, D.C. ``It will have a major impact
not only on airlines but other industries that try to use an
unequal or gender-based standard for occupational qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its ruling, the court said the plaintiffs can pursue
an age discrimination claim if they can prove that the weight limit
policy had a disparate impact on older employees. If so, the
decision could affect a number of men as well as women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the intent and effect to use these weight requirements
to eliminate older flight attendants,'' said San Francisco attorney
Edith Benay, who represented the women.
</P>
<P>
   Older flight attendants, Benay said, are more expensive for the
airlines because their salaries have increased and they use more
medical benefits for themselves and their children.
</P>
<P>
   Unless United appeals the decision, the case will go back to the
trial judge to determine damages, which could be in the millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Triaca, a spokesman for United, said officials at the
Chicago-based airline did not have any comment because they were
still reviewing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s and 1970s, large commercial airlines hired only
female attendants and required that they be unmarried, refrain from
having children and meet weight and appearance criteria. They also
had to retire by the age of 32 or 35.
</P>
<P>
   After airlines began hiring male attendants in 1971, they set
separate weight and height requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a group of women filed a class action suit, charging
that United discriminated against women and older flight attendants
by adopting a biased weight policy and enforcing it in a
discriminatory manner.
</P>
<P>
   United set its weight requirements by relying on a table of
desirable weights and heights published by Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co. But the court noted that United allowed men to have
the top weight in the large body frame category, while women were
limited to the top weight in the medium body frame category.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, women were required to weigh between 14 and 25
pounds less than their male colleagues of the same height and age.
For example, a 30-year-old woman who was 5 feet 7 inches tall could
not weigh more than 142 pounds, while a man of the same height and
age could weigh as much as 161 pounds. A 50-year-old,
5-foot-11-inch woman faced a maximum weight of 162 pounds, while
her male counterpart could tip the scales at 184.
</P>
<P>
   Benay said women would starve themselves for days, give blood or
use diuretics to meet the weight requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court rejected United's argument that its weight
tables were permissible as ``grooming'' or appearance standards.
</P>
<P>
   The court concluded that United's policy of applying
medium-frame weight limits to women and large-frame maximums to men
``is facially discriminatory and not justified'' as a requirement
of the job.

SPACECRAFT SPOTS EVIDENCE OF WATER ON THE RED PLANET
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Scientists monitoring images from a spacecraft orbiting Mars
are cautiously suggesting that craters in the planet's southern
hemisphere may have recently been seeping water into the planet's
surface and atmosphere.
<P>
   If the scientists' interpretation is correct, it could prompt
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to pursue more
intensive searches for life beneath the Martian surface, despite
the catastrophic failures of two relatively recent Mars missions.
</P>
<P>
   A fresh look at pictures from the Mars Global Surveyor has led
scientists to infer that fan-shaped depressions near the rim of at
least one Martian crater could be evidence for recent outflows of
water emerging to the surface very much the way underground springs
do on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Vivid images of the Martian surface, taken by spacecraft ever
since Mariner orbited the Red Planet in 1971, have revealed long
sinuous canyons that must have once been surging watercourses, and
flat plains that could have been vast lake beds.
</P>
<P>
   But if the planet's surface did in fact hold liquid water
billions of years ago, it has long vanished _ either deep
underground or evaporating into the thin Martian atmosphere and
then diffusing as vapor throughout the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Water has been detected on Mars, but only in the form of ice
trapped at the poles. With a temperature of more than 220 degrees
below zero on the surface, any Martian water that might emerge from
underground now would instantly turn to vapor.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Global Surveyor has been orbiting the Red Planet since
September 1997. The search for water _ a necessary ingredient for
life _ has been one of the main objectives of NASA's long-term plan
to explore Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Weiler, NASA's space science chief, in a discussion
earlier this month, reminded a meeting of the National Academy of
Sciences Space Studies Board that, ``Without water, there was no
life as we know it in the past, and there is no life now. It's all
about the water.''
</P>
<P>
   A full report on the Global Surveyor's images by some of NASA's
most expert team members was to be published in the journal Science
next week. The space agency had tried to keep the report secret
until a briefing next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But as word leaked out this week, officials said some of the
speculation was inaccurate, and they hastily rescheduled their
press conference to this morning. Editors of the journal Science
announced they will release the full paper publicly Thursday as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the space agency's headquarters refused to talk
about the water question Wednesday, but an announcement from the
agency's public affairs office said that Thursday's rescheduled
press conference will ``discuss the recent discovery of evidence
for liquid water on Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Malin, founder and chief scientist of Malin Space
Science Systems, which manufactures the Global Surveyor's high-tech
cameras, is the major co-author of next week's Science article, and
he will be featured on the panel at Thursday's press conference.
</P>
<P>
   So will Kenneth Edgett, Malin's staff scientist, who is a
co-author of the Science paper, while the lead-off panel member
will be Weiler, the space agency's associate administrator for
space science at NASA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   An indication of the importance NASA attaches to the report
Thursday is the list of the panel's other members: One is Michael
Carr, a planetary geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo
Park who has studied how major bodies of Martian surface water a
billion or more years ago could have sunk far beneath the surface
due primarily to volcanic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Bruce Jakosky, a geophysicist and director of the
center for Astrobiology at the University of Colorado. He is
currently studying the possibility of Martian life.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth panel member is James J. Garvin, a Mars Program
Scientist at NASA Headquarters.

TESTIMONY PUTS SKAKEL AT SCENE OF MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs for new 3rd and 4th grafs concerning testimony about Skakel
masturbating in tree) 
By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn._ A boyhood friend of Michael Skakel's testified
in court Wednesday that Skakel admitted years later that on the
night their 15-year-old friend Martha Moxley was murdered in 1975,
he was in the tree directly above where her body was found the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Andrew Pugh, said that Skakel, then also 15, had
``an attraction, an infatuation'' with Moxley. Pugh lived across
the street from the Skakels and around the corner from the Moxley
family in the exclusive Belle Haven section of Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   He testified on Wednesday that he believed that Skakel, a nephew
of Ethel Kennedy, had committed the murder. When he confronted his
old friend with that suspicion in a 1991 telephone conversation, he
said, Skakel denied that he had killed her but admitted that he had
been in the Moxleys' yard the night she died, masturbating in the
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh's testimony was similar to the story Skakel told private
investigators hired by his father in 1995. In that account, which
differs significantly from his original statement to the police in
1975, Skakel said that he sneaked out his window about 11:30 p.m.
and walked to the Moxley home, where he climbed a tree and tossed
pebbles at Moxley's window. When she did not respond, Skakel said,
he masturbated in the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh was one of the two final witnesses called by prosecutors
Wednesday in their effort to persuade a juvenile court judge to
refer the case to Superior Court, putting Skakel, 39, on trial as
an adult. He is now charged in the case as a juvenile. If convicted
as an adult, he could face 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's swift completion of its case in this
``reasonable cause'' hearing offered a striking contrast to the
investigation of the case, which dragged on for nearly a
quarter-century until Skakel's indictment early this year. The
hearing will resume next Wednesday with the defense witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual case against Skakel, in which an adult is charged
with murder as a juvenile, has already broken legal ground. It is
the first juvenile court proceeding fully open to the media and the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's final witness was Judith Kallen, an official
with the State Department of Children and Families. The prosecutor,
Jonathan C. Benedict, sought to demonstrate that the Connecticut
juvenile justice system has no mechanisms for dealing with a
criminal offender over age 18, suggesting that Skakel must be tried
as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   By law, inmates in juvenile detention must be released at age
18, she testified, adding that state officials now use
psychologists and other experts to determine whether a juvenile
defendant should be tried as an adult, focusing on the child's
chances of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   But Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, pointed out during
cross-examination that this case was like no other. He suggested
that the nearly 25-year delay in bringing the case to court had
provided state officials ``a crystal ball'' showing all they needed
to know about Skakel's chances of rehabilitation and becoming a
productive member of society.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman asked Kallen if that was sufficient evidence of
potential for rehabilitation. Under a 1975 law, one requirement of
transferring a juvenile case to Superior Court is a finding that
``the safety of the community requires that the child continue
under restraint for a period extending beyond his majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Kallen told Sherman that she did ``not have that kind of
expertise,'' adding, ``I have never had to look back at somebody's
behavior over a 24-year period.'' Sherman quickly replied, ``Not
until now.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sherman presents his case next week, Judge Maureen Dennis
will determine whether to transfer the case to Superior Court, to
allow a trial to proceed before her in juvenile court without a
jury, or to dismiss the matter entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has made it clear that the rules relating to a
``reasonable cause'' hearing allow her wide latitude, and she also
admonished both Benedict and Sherman, who have given frequent
interviews, to reread the ethics guidelines for lawyers about
talking to the media.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the first day of the pretrial hearing, two former
classmates of Skakel's testified that he confessed to the murder in
the late 1970s while at a school for troubled youths in Maine. One
of them, Gregory Coleman, completed his testimony Wednesday
morning. Coleman, who was convicted of a robbery in the 1980s, was
brought from a prison near Rochester, where he is serving a
yearlong sentence for criminal trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his testimony Wednesday came in response to questions
from Sherman about his requests for money and for help from
Connecticut officials. Coleman has received neither for his
testimony, though he acknowledged that he had made several mistakes
in his testimony before a grand jury in the Moxley case in 1998 and
that his abuse of drugs and alcohol over more than 20 years had
affected his memory.
</P>
<P>
   But Skakel's sister and brothers, who filled a first row in the
courtroom, seemed to pay most attention to the testimony of Pugh,
the former family friend. He said that he and Skakel had been close
when they were teen-agers, but had drifted apart after the Moxley
murder and had little or no contact during the 1980s. But in 1991
they bumped into each other at Christ Church in Greenwich, where
Pugh was attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed resuming their friendship, Pugh testified, but he
said he told Skakel in a subsequent telephone conversation that it
``could be difficult for me because I had some doubts as to his
involvement'' and asked if Skakel had committed the crime. ``He
said `No,''' Pugh testified. ``He told me that he had been on their
property,'' but that he had nothing to do with Moxley's death.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Pugh conceded that Skakel never
specified which tree he meant on the Moxley property, but the
witness said he believed it to be the tall pine in the Moxley yard
that he and Skakel had climbed frequently as children. Moxley's
body was found under it on Oct. 31, 1975, her head bludgeoned with
a golf club taken from a set that belonged to Rushton Skakel,
Skakel's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``That conversation kind of, shall I say, addled me slightly,''
Pugh testified Wednesday.

ERSTAD SAVES THE DAY FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- In the boxscore, the save went to Troy Percival. But
there was no denying it was left fielder Darin Erstad who truly
saved the Angels' 3-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals Wednesday
night before 16,169 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Percival entered the game in the ninth inning with two on and
one out and the Angels leading, 3-0, thanks to 8 &UR;  &LR; 1/3 scoreless
innings by starter Jarrod Washburn. But Percival, who blew a save
opportunity Tuesday night and another eight days ago, came in and
immediately gave up an RBI single to Carlos Beltran (the run
charged to Washburn).
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Jermaine Dye, who was the American League player
of the month in April. Dye didn't get all of a Percival fastball,
but got enough of it to reach the seats beyond the short fence down
the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   But before it could land safely in the hands of an awaiting fan,
Erstad fought off the fan for the ball and made the game-saving
catch, pulling the ball back into the field of play and robbing Dye
of a three-run homer. Percival retired Mike Sweeney on a fly to
right for his 18th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened to the `hometown' fans?'' Erstad asked.
``You get some interesting plays in the corner there. It was like a
war zone, you get to the wall and it's a free-for-all. I guess the
fans have as much right to it as we do. It's not enough you got to
catch the ball, you also got to fight the fans for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival had Erstad to thank for saving this one, but he didn't
think it would come to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a jam shot,'' Percival said of Dye's fly
ball. ``It didn't sound good (of the bat). But it was great to get
a great play by Ersty. I never thought it was going that far. But
nothing he does surprises me at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Percy made a great pitch,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.
``Believe it or not, he jammed him a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad also drove in all three Angels' runs, two on a
fifth-inning homer, and one on a seventh-inning groundout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the Darin Erstad show tonight,'' Scioscia said. ``This
guy comes up big anywhere on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Washburn (3-1) and Royals starter Mac Suzuki (3-1) sailed
through the first four innings. Each pitcher allowed only one hit,
and only one baserunner -- the Angels' Garret Anderson in the
second inning -- got as far as second base.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fifth, Adam Kennedy rolled a single through the hole
at short for a two-out single. Erstad then got the count in his
favor at 3-1 before hitting his 14th homer of the season to give
the Angels a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washburn continued to pitch almost flawlessly. The
only hits he allowed through eight innings were a line-drive single
to center by Sweeney in the second inning, and and infield single
by Beltran in the seventh. Beltran's single snapped a streak of 10
in a row retired by Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy keyed the Angels' third run of the game with a one-out
triple in the seventh. With the infield in, Erstad followed with a
chopper that bounced over the outstretched glove of Suzuki to
shortstop Rey Sanchez, allowing Kennedy to race home for a 3-0
Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn was allowed to go out for the ninth inning, unlike last
week when Scioscia took Brian Cooper out despite eight shutout
innings and a 2-0 lead. In that one, Percival gave up three runs in
the ninth, including a game-ending two-run homer by Fred McGriff.
</P>
<P>
   But Washburn had made only 87 pitches through eight innings, and
Scioscia said he felt comfortable sticking with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a couple of things,'' Scioscia said. ``One thing about
Cooper was in his eighth inning I didn't think his stuff was as
crisp. And I liked the matchups today with (left-handed hitting
Johnny) Damon coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had made only 80-some pitches, I would have been surprised
if I was taken out,'' Washburn said. ``But I wouldn't be
disappointed because that's Percy's job.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had a lump in his throat watching Dye's fly ball,
Washburn said: ``I don't know if it was a lump in my throat, but I
was pretty nervous. My heart jumped up. (Erstad) made a great
play.''

GOOSSEN MAY JOIN DE LA HOYA'S TEAM
</HEADLINE>

By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Not only is Oscar De La Hoya not retiring, he
apparently is looking for fresh help in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   A rematch of Saturday's Shane Mosley-Oscar De La Hoya fight will
take place in November or February, probably in Las Vegas, promoter
Bob Arum told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
</P>
<P>
   And Joe Goossen, the Van Nuys-based trainer, could work with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen said he was approached by someone associated with De La
Hoya about the possibility of taking over his training, although
Goossen declined to say who it was.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has been trained by the much-maligned Robert Alcazar
for most of his career, although several other trainers have come
and gone.
</P>
<P>
   Arum strongly implied that Alcazar is through.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was back, in all probability, the outcome would be the
same,'' Arum told the Review-Journal. ``You saw one guy (Mosley)
adjust midway through the fight, and you saw the other guy doing
the same thing round after round after round.''
</P>
<P>
   Goossen, who has guided several fighters to world championships,
would love the opportunity to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had won three straight fights, I wouldn't be saying
this,'' Goossen said. ``We're talking about a guy who has lost two
of his last three. It's obvious that when you're as gifted as he
is, something is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I would just say that it's time for Oscar to get some
leadership. He needs someone who can actually lead him into a
fight, someone with experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Goossen, known as much as anything for his ability to motivate
his fighters and give sound advice in the corner, has worked with
such champions as Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas, Michael Nunn and
current champ Joel Casamayor.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's one fight with Wilfredo Rivera that best applies
here.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen was in Rivera's corner when he gave Mosley all he could
handle in the new champ's first bout at 147 pounds in September.
Mosley won by a 10th-round knockout, but he had a more difficult
time with Rivera than he did with De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen said the almost-recklessly aggressive De La Hoya simply
fought the wrong fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what brought him to the dance,'' Goossen said.
``What it boils down to is this: Why is he trying to be a slugger?
Oscar's one of the best boxers ever to lace 'em up. No one ever
said he's one of the greatest (begin ital)sluggers(end ital) or
brawlers ever to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what he tried to do. When I saw it, I said to myself,
'Man, I wish I had an opportunity to train this kid.' ''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya spoke of retirement the night Mosley beat him by a
split decision but Arum said he now wants a chance to avenge the
disappointing defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The rematch clause in the original contract guarantees each
fighter $10.1 million for the rematch, Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fighters have yet to come to terms on a second
bout.

SHEFFIELD CARRIES DODGERS TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON - In spring training, Dodgers left fielder Gary
Sheffield talked about hitting 50 homers in a season, and it raised
a few eyebrows and caused a few eyes to roll.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sheffield's one of the leading candidates in the early
stages of the MVP race, and he's knocking baseballs all over the
place. He hit two solo homers, tied a career-high with four runs
scored and had four hits as the Dodgers rallied to beat Houston 7-6
Wednesday at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what about Sheff? Is he just picking us up and carrying
us on his shoulders?'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He's
beyond amazing to me. It's big hit after big hit. You almost expect
it every time up. It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's homer in the eighth broke a 6-6 tie, and after
bouncing off the light standard above the left-field roof, laid to
rest in the street.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sheffield's team-leading 23rd homer. He's hitting .361
with 63 RBI, and is in the midst of an unreal stretch. Sheffield's
hit in 11 straight games, during which he's batting .548 (23 for
42) with six homers, four doubles, 16 RBI and 14 runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just relaxed and healthy, and when I'm like that I don't
worry about my performance,'' Sheffield said. ``I knew (the second
homer) hit something, but I don't know what it hit. There's a lot
of things going on in this park, a lot of bars and walls and fences
and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's helped bring focus to a hectic time. Suspensions are
pending after a tiring day in which 14 of the roster players
attended an appeals hearing. The Dodgers also have dealt with
injuries to key starters through the first 11 weeks of the season,
but they have been able to hold things together.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that they entered the day two games behind Arizona in
the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (Eric Karros) and (Shawn) Green and the middle guys on
this team that are supposed to do something, we talked about when
things are not going well, that builds character,'' Sheffield said.
``We have to look at ourselves as individuals and find out what we
can do and reach back to help this team. Sometimes we don't have
that enthusiasm that we're trying to win this whole thing, and it
takes that one guy to take the lead and everybody else to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, along with Karros - his two-run homer in the seventh
tied it 6-6 - gave the Dodgers the win, but the bullpen did a
masterful job in cleaning up a messy Carlos Perez start to put them
in that position.
</P>
<P>
   Perez lasted just 3 innings, allowing six runs on seven hits,
and again bringing to mind the June 25 deadline in which the
Dodgers can send him to the minors. Certainly, that will be
discussed in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   However, Antonio Osuna pitched 2 innings of perfect relief and
the surprising Matt Herges (5-0) won for the second straight night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think not much is expected, so maybe that helps me
sneak up on people,'' Herges said. ``I know the league doesn't help
me, so that helps.''
</P>
<P>
   But this win for Herges was a little tougher than the night
before, in which he bailed Jeff Shaw out of a two-on, none-out
situation in the bottom of the ninth to force extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Herges threw three scoreless innings of relief. And
with Shaw again stripped of his exclusive closer's tag, Herges
pitched a perfect ninth to close out the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Herges is that one guy that I don't think anyone was
counting on to play that significant of a role up to this point,''
Karros said. ``He's been unbelievable.''

SPRING WEIGHS SCRAPPING MERGER PLANS OR SELLING KEY ASSETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sprint Corp. may face the choice of selling
all the company's Internet and long-distance assets, or calling off
its proposed merger with WorldCom Inc., people close to the
companies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Once an unthinkable alternative for the Westwood-based company,
which employs nearly 20,000 people in the metropolitan area,
dismantling the company and selling it in parts may be required to
overcome antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The long-troubled $129 billion merger, announced last October,
would join the second- and third-largest long-distance companies in
the country, and two of the top four Internet providers in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies would not discuss the matter on Wednesday. Any
decision to go forward with such a sale would probably require the
approval of both companies' boards of directors. Sprint's board
members declined to comment or could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Staff at the U.S. Justice Department have recommended that the
deal be blocked because it would concentrate almost 80 percent of
the U.S. long-distance industry under the newly merged company and
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of significant concessions from the companies _
beyond their stated willingness to sell Sprint's Internet business
_ senior Justice officials are reportedly inclined to oppose the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulators are not in a fixing mode,'' said Scott Cleland, an
analyst with Legg Mason Precursor in Washington. ``They didn't like
the merger. They want WorldCom and Sprint as competitors, not
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   On a second front, the European Commission reportedly is also
preparing to block the merger because the combined company would
control too much Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti
began a six-day visit to Washington, where he is reportedly
scheduled to meet with Justice Department antitrust chief Joel
Klein, Attorney General Janet Reno, members of the Senate's
antitrust subcommittee, and William Kennard, chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got to fight the war on two fronts, most reasonable
people would say it's not worth going forward,'' said Andy
Copenhaver, an antitrust attorney with Womble Carlyle in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Sprint's entire long-distance division, including
the Internet backbone, may assuage European and U.S. regulators,
allowing them to claim an outright victory in a politically
sensitive fight to preserve competition.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and WorldCom executives have dismissed suggestions that
concentration in the long-distance industry is an antitrust
problem. They see a highly competitive market now and think
competition will increase as the regional Bell companies get
regulatory permission to enter the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clash is that the companies can't realize that the
government has a different purpose than they do,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint and WorldCom are looking out and seeing a fiercely
competitive future. They don't like that future and want to
consolidate to preserve their margins. The government likes what it
sees: fierce competition that lowers prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up Sprint might also give WorldCom Chief Executive
Bernie Ebbers what he was after all along _ Sprint's fast-growing
wireless unit, Sprint PCS _ without the burden of integrating the
company's long-distance networks. The companies expected to save
$15 billion combining their respective networks and customer bases.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is to sell off Sprint in parts, a decision
already supported by WorldCom executives, according to a report in
the Financial Times on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of some 11th-hour alternative, Sprint's board
essentially faces two choices: Dismantle the company, possibly
renegotiating the $76 per share offer from WorldCom to reflect the
sale of long-distance assets; or scrap the deal, effectively
putting the company back on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a long line of potential buyers would be interested
in Sprint's Internet and long-distance businesses. And with a
limited supply of such networks, they could be worth significantly
more than the roughly $30 billion that investment bankers
calculated when valuing them during the initial merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   But selling the long-distance division to a third party would be
far from an easy financial decision for Sprint's board.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes could eat a significant chunk of any price that the board
would be able to realize for the long-distance and Internet
businesses. It's also unclear how the sale of the long-distance
business would be structured, as a simultaneous three-way
transaction, or Sprint selling the division and turning the
proceeds over to WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Such a sale also could have implications for Sprint's new $1
billion office campus in Overland Park, and it could throw the
lives of 6,500 area long-distance employees into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's board faces pressure to make the deal work.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the time and money already invested in regulatory
process, the company potentially faces a $2.5 billion breakup fee
if it pulls out of the deal with WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   The board could also face a raft of shareholder lawsuits
stemming from the accelerated vesting of employee stock options,
which took effect with the shareholder vote in favor of the merger
and gave employees a benefit it might otherwise have taken years to
accrue. Similar situations have prompted shareholder suits in
previous failed mergers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sprint Chief Executive Officer William T.
Esrey may be able to realize a higher price for the entire company
with a third party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really opens up a can of worms,'' said David Neil, an
analyst with the Gartner Group in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint needs both an international and domestic partner: an
international one to serve lucrative multinational business
customers, and a domestic one to bypass the regional Bell
companies' stranglehold on local lines.

GALAXY FORTUNATE TO GET A TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- It was hard to tell which was worse.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos' flop in the penalty area
in the final moments of Wednesday's match with Chicago. Or, referee
Tom Babadilla, who was actually sold by Cienfuegos' fall, awarding
the Galaxy a penalty kick in the 89th minute of a game the Fire
deserved to win for out-hustling and out-playing Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy defender Greg Vanney converted the penalty kick, enabling
the Galaxy to sneak away with a 1-1 draw after two five minute
sudden death overtime periods in front of 10,271 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The play started when Galaxy striker Luis Hernandez chipped a
pass for Cienfuegos. The little El Salvadoran tried to run past
Jesse Marsch, but Marsch's body and arm rubbed up against
Cienfuegos. Marsch actually tugged lightly on Cienfuegos' jersey,
but Cienfuegos fell down hard, drawing the game-tying call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a tough call at that point in the game,'' said
Chicago coach Bob Bradley. ``It's very frustrating because we feel
like we did play well tonight. What can you do? We're disappointed
we did not get the three points, but we're satisfied with the
effort we gave.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another night in which Galaxy striker Luis Hernandez
failed to score in his sixth straight MLS game since leaving
Mexico. Hernandez waved his hands like a politician, trying to draw
the attention of his teammates, but the Fire did a good job marking
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of players frustrated their not getting the ball
when they're asking for the ball,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid.
``That's something that we have to do better. But give them credit,
they did a good job on him (Hernandez) tonight. C.J. Brown marked
him and didn't give him a lot of space.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley offered his assessment of Hernandez. Earlier in the
week, Hernandez said the quantity and quality of passes he gets
with the Galaxy is not what he's used to getting in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quick and alert but it's always difficult when a player
comes to a team halfway through a season,'' said Bradley. ``I would
also say that the MLS is more difficult than people think. MLS
doesn't get that much respect in Mexico. I don't know why, we all
understand our league needs to grow, but if you look at the foreign
players in this league, a lot of them in an honest moment will tell
you this league is a lot better than anybody gives it credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chicago (9-7-2, 29 points), Josh Wolff hammered home their
lone goal in the 75th minute after a combination of passes from
Diego Gutierrez and Ante Razov. With the draw, the Galaxy (7-3-7,
29 points) managed to stay within striking distance of Kansas City
(10-2-4, 34 points).
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy visits the Wizards Saturday at Arrowhead Stadium, the
first of a three-game road trip. Schmid hopes to see more grit from
his bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coach told me once that a team that commits the most fouls
usually wins the game,'' said Schmid. Kansas City committed 21
fouls to the Galaxy's 11. ``Obviously we didn't committ very many
fouls because fouls represent a level of aggression. We need some
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to strike early, Hernandez dropped a pass back for Paul
Caligiuri in the 11th minute. Caligiuri sent a one-touch cross into
the middle of the penalty area. Peter Vagenas leaped, sending a
header straight at Chicago goalkeeper Zach Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   On a similar play, Chicago midfielder Peter Nowak curled a free
kick in the box, where Wolff snapped a sharp header to the right
side, but Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman dove to his left to make
the save.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking near the back of the net, Vagenas tried to finish a Greg
Vanney corner kick in the 38th minute. He picked the ball out of
the air, sending a left-footed shot off the side netting.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the half, Hernandez flopped to the ground,
trying to draw a penalty kick as Fire defender Carlos Bocanegra
cleared a pass away from Hernandez.

CONSIDERING SHADEGG'S FI
 NAL SOLU TION
</HEADLINE>

 BY E.J. MONTINI 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic (Phoenix) - President Bill Clinton is
scheduled to arrive today at Sky Harbor International Airport,
where spectators will gather in hopes of getting a glimpse at the
big black swastikas painted on Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a military color guard will salute the president with
stiffly held right arms, raised at an angle, and all through the
crowd there will be chants of, ``Seig heil! Seig heil! Seig heil!''
as Clinton disembarks.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, that doesn't hap pen. In which case
Congressman John Shadegg may want to rethink his recent remarks
comparing Clin ton to Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler was responsible for systemati cally annihilating 6
million Jews and others during World War II. Clinton is responsible
for deciding to system atically protect . . . some trees.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing, according to Shadegg, who represents Arizona's
District 4.
</P>
<P>
   He said of Clinton's recent decision to create Ironwood Forest
National Monument outside Tucson, ``I would draw a parallel to
Hitler. He eroded the will of the German people to resist evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman's comments were `'taken out of context,'' his
spokes man, John Pappas, told me Wednes day.
</P>
<P>
   Really? I asked.
</P>
<P>
   In exactly which context would it be OK to compare Clinton to
Hitler?
</P>
<P>
   `'Regrettably,'' he said, ``that refer ence was used.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more regrettably, Shadegg and his people didn't leave it
with a simple apology. Instead, they tried to explain it away, and
even went on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evil isn't the creation of a national monument,'' Pappas
said. ``But the evil is the flagrant disre gard of the law by this
administra tion, over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas said his boss believes it was illegal for Clinton to
establish the monument, since it includes land not under the
control of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the pattern of not following the law of this
administra tion,'' Pappas said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's enough to make Clinton a Hitler?
</P>
<P>
   It was a too much for a press aide to answer. After Pappas got
off the phone, Shadegg himself called.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president stepped outside the law (in creating the
monument),'' Shadegg said, ``I don't regret having pointed out this
is a violation of the law. Do I regret having publicly articulated
the Hitler parallel? Yeah. Because that's been construed that I
think the monument is evil, and I don't think that.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you think Clinton is evil, he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government acting outside the law is evil,'' he said,
``and I see a pattern of it in this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg is an ambitious man. When John McCain steps down,
Shadegg hopes to stand before the assembled voters of Arizona and
say, ````Ich bin ein U.S. senator.''''``
</P>
<P>
   In order for that to happen, however, he'll have to beat the
always-on-TV Rep. J.D. Hayworth. For that, he needs publicity.
Attacking Clinton gets it. Shadegg has done so once before,
refusing to attend the Clin ton's State of the Union address. He
did it again with the Hitler remark.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, he was way off base. But I guess when you're trying
to estab lish your very own political dynasty, you figure any
publicity is good publicity. Apparently, no one ever told the
congressman that two wrongs don't make a Reich.

<P>
   The Arizona Republic (Phoenix) - President Bill Clinton is
scheduled to arrive today at Sky Harbor International Airport,
where spectators will gather in hopes of getting a glimpse at the
big black swastikas painted on Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a military color guard will salute the president with
stiffly held right arms, raised at an angle, and all through the
crowd there will be chants of, ``Seig heil! Seig heil! Seig heil!''
as Clinton disembarks.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, that doesn't hap pen. In which case
Congressman John Shadegg may want to rethink his recent remarks
comparing Clin ton to Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler was responsible for systemati cally annihilating 6
million Jews and others during World War II. Clinton is responsible
for deciding to system atically protect . . . some trees.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing, according to Shadegg, who represents Arizona's
District 4.
</P>
<P>
   He said of Clinton's recent decision to create Ironwood Forest
National Monument outside Tucson, ``I would draw a parallel to
Hitler. He eroded the will of the German people to resist evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman's comments were `'taken out of context,'' his
spokes man, John Pappas, told me Wednes day.
</P>
<P>
   Really? I asked.
</P>
<P>
   In exactly which context would it be OK to compare Clinton to
Hitler?
</P>
<P>
   `'Regrettably,'' he said, ``that refer ence was used.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more regrettably, Shadegg and his people didn't leave it
with a simple apology. Instead, they tried to explain it away, and
even went on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evil isn't the creation of a national monument,'' Pappas
said. ``But the evil is the flagrant disre gard of the law by this
administra tion, over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas said his boss believes it was illegal for Clinton to
establish the monument, since it includes land not under the
control of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the pattern of not following the law of this
administra tion,'' Pappas said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's enough to make Clinton a Hitler?
</P>
<P>
   It was a too much for a press aide to answer. After Pappas got
off the phone, Shadegg himself called.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president stepped outside the law (in creating the
monument),'' Shadegg said, ``I don't regret having pointed out this
is a violation of the law. Do I regret having publicly articulated
the Hitler parallel? Yeah. Because that's been construed that I
think the monument is evil, and I don't think that.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you think Clinton is evil, he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government acting outside the law is evil,'' he said,
``and I see a pattern of it in this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg is an ambitious man. When John McCain steps down,
Shadegg hopes to stand before the assembled voters of Arizona and
say, ````Ich bin ein U.S. senator.''''``
</P>
<P>
   In order for that to happen, however, he'll have to beat the
always-on-TV Rep. J.D. Hayworth. For that, he needs publicity.
Attacking Clinton gets it. Shadegg has done so once before,
refusing to attend the Clin ton's State of the Union address. He
did it again with the Hitler remark.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, he was way off base. But I guess when you're trying
to estab lish your very own political dynasty, you figure any
publicity is good publicity. Apparently, no one ever told the
congressman that two wrongs don't make a Reich.

H&AMP;R BLOCH CO-FOUNDER TO RETIRE IN SEPTEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ H&AMP;R Block co-founder Henry W. Bloch, 77,
plans to retire as chairman after the firm's annual meeting in
September, the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The change will leave Block without a Bloch family member at the
helm for the first time since brothers Henry, Richard and Leon
Bloch founded a company in 1946 that ultimately became H&AMP;R Block.
</P>
<P>
   The diversified tax and financial services company also said it
earned $251.9 million, or $2.55 a share during the fiscal year that
ended April 30. The results were up more than 10 percent from a
year-earlier $215.4 million, or $2.14 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Those earnings landed at the upper end of a range that Block
executives had estimated earlier this month. At that time, Block
warned Wall Street analysts that the company would not achieve even
higher profits because of last-minute overstaffing in its tax
offices and e-commerce operations losses.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Bloch's retirement, the company outlined further
changes in senior management and on its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   - Frank L. Salizzoni, 61, the chief executive officer, will
become chairman, succeeding Bloch in September. He will then retire
as chief executive officer Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   - Mark Ernst, 41, president and chief operating officer, will
become president and chief executive, succeeding Salizonni. A
successor to Ernst as chief operating officer was not named.
</P>
<P>
   These management changes are part of a succession plan that
Salizzoni began working on soon after agreeing to become interim
chief executive in 1996, said Linda McDougall, company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   - Henry W.Bloch will resign from the board and become honorary
chairman. He and his brother Richard founded H&AMP;R Block in 1955 as a
successor to United Business Co.
</P>
<P>
   - Kansas City publisher Morton Sosland, 75, also announced he
was retiring from Block's board. He has served on the board for 37
years.
</P>
<P>
   - Block directors nominated Thomas M. Bloch, 46, and Rayford
Wilkins Jr. 48, president of SBC Communications Services, to
succeed Henry W. Bloch and Sosland as directors if shareholders
approve at the Sept. 13 annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bloch, whose father is Henry W.Bloch, worked for H&AMP;R
Block 19 years, including three as president and chief executive.
He left the company in 1995 to become a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Block once again reported increased earnings and revenues as it
has virtually every year since it became publicly traded. But the
results were more complex than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 49.1 percent, to $2.5 billion from a year-earlier
$1.6 billion. The improvement stemmed from increased volume at
Block's tax office and a diversification drive in which Block
acquired RSM McGladrey, a major regional business service and
accounting firm, and Olde Financial Corp., a nationwide discount
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Block's tax service operations reported a nearly 2 percent
increase in pretax profits to $320 million, on a 13.7 percent
increase in revenues. Block preparers handled a record 14 percent
of all the returns IRS received last season for a market share
record. The company also retained more repeat customers than in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings, however, didn't reach expectations because of
larger-than-expected losses in its e-commerce operations. The
company also suffered from overstaffing of tax offices for a
last-minute surge of filing that didn't occur, Salizzoni said.
</P>
<P>
   Block's other primary businesses turned in strong perfomances,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services operations, which include mortgage lending at
Option One Mortgage Corp. and, since Dec. 1, Olde Financial,
reported a 112.3 percent increase in pretax earnings to $129.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Business services, which since Aug. 1 include RSM McGladrey and
other accounting and financial services firms Block acquired,
contributed $17.1 million in pretax profits, a 140.3 percent
increase.

 MARINERS ROLL 7, HOLD ON TO BEAT DEVIL RAYS   (For use by New York
Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Given that the Mariners scored seven runs in the
second inning, winning this one probably should not have been as
difficult as it was.
</P>
<P>
   In the final accounting, however, Seattle beat Tampa Bay 8-5
Wednesday night, using some of that old Safeco Field alchemy to
transmute one big inning early, against nemesis Esteban Yan, and
lots of good relief pitching late, against one of the hottest teams
in baseball, into the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele started and collected his eighth win, but this was
clearly not Sele's finest outing. He walked four, matching his
season high. And after being gifted with a 7-0 lead, he had to be
taken out of the game in the sixth inning with the potential tying
run coming to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have all that offense to work with,'' Sele said.
``I didn't have my control tonight again, just like last time in
Minnesota. I've got to get back to a good rhythm, where I'm not
walking people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the kind of pitcher who can get by walking a lot of
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many pitchers who can. And one of the major
successes of the first 11 weeks of the season has been the
bullpen's ability to throw strikes and avoid the walks that
inevitably lead to big innings.
</P>
<P>
   Upon Sele's exit, the Mariners dipped liberally into their
ever-improving bullpen. Jose Paniagua, Arthur Rhodes, Jose Mesa and
Kazuhiro Sasaki all contributed heavily to the win, which clinched
Seattle's sixth consecutive series victory, tying the club record.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners haven't lost a series since dropping two of three
to Chicago at Safeco Field May 29-31, one major reason why Seattle
has been able to stay close to Oakland in the West with the A's
having won 17 of 20, including a three-game sweep of Baltimore, the
team that comes to town for four games starting Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't think we're playing as good as we can,'' said
shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who had one of two bases-loaded doubles
in the second inning. Rodriguez drove in two runs and John Olerud
followed with a three-run double as Yan succumbed to control
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yan got all of three outs. He walked five, hit a batter and saw
the first eight batters of the second inning reach base. The first
seven scored, and that would prove to be enough to win, although
Sele's tough night made the game closer than the Mariners would
have liked.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bullpen has been dominant enough that, unlike in past
years, there is no fear when the call goes to the pen.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua, whose work has been nearly flawless of late, took over
in a tough spot _ men on second and third with none out in the
sixth. Paniagua got three quick outs, although one run scored on a
medium-deep fly ball. That would be the end of the line for the
Tampa Bay offense.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua and Rhodes got the Mariners through the seventh, Rhodes
striking out pinch-hitter Bubba Trammell on three pitches as the
potential tying run. After the Mariners added a run on Rickey
Henderson's single in the seventh, Rhodes and Mesa combined to
pitch a 1-2-3 eighth inning, and Sasaki closed it out with a
scoreless ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The four shutout innings for the bullpen followed Tuesday's
effort, when Rhodes and Sasaki provided two shutout innings in a
4-3 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about matchups,'' Rhodes said. ``Lou (Piniella) has
the option to go to put guys in good situations, and tonight we all
pitched great.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Sele needed the help. After a streak in which he
went 5-0 in six starts, Sele has hit a bump in the road. He gave up
five runs in five-plus innings. In his past two starts he's walked
eight, after walking just 12 in the previous six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Porous defense behind him caused some of Sele's problems, but he
brought much of his grief upon himself. He walked the leadoff
batter twice. Both times that lapse resulted in a run.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Sele stuck around long enough to get the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had a score to settle with Yan. It was Yan, back on
May 20 at Safeco who, the Mariners felt, threw at Mark McLemore.
The second baseman was slapped with a five-day suspension for
having charged the mound, while Yan wasn't disciplined at all.
</P>
<P>
   Now Yan was pitching and McLemore was out of uniform, serving
the second of a four-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Mariners would admit to any vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to get a win,'' Rodriguez said. ``That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   They got that. And a little vengeance on the side, running Yan
out of the game in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's seven-run explosion was full of everything a team
wants at the plate _ except hits. Seattle had only two hits in the
inning, but both were bases-loaded doubles by Rodriguez and Olerud
that accounted for five of the seven runs.
</P>
<P>
   Bases-loaded offense has been a weak point for the Mariners this
year, but they came through once Tuesday with the sacks full, then
twice more Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of the season, it's going to balance out,''
Rodriguez said.

RANGERS' DAVE MARTINEZ FINALLY HAS IMPACT IN WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ With the possible exception of starting
pitcher Esteban Loaiza, who won for the first time since May 25,
it's doubtful if anyone was happier with the Rangers' 7-5 victory
against the Minnesota Twins last night than Dave Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The right fielder had the biggest hit in the game, a double that
drove in Rafael Palmeiro and David Segui to break a 3-3 tie in the
fifth inning. The ball was hit at Cristian Guzman, but was smacked
so sharply that it glanced off the Twins' shortstop and rolled into
the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was thrown out trying to stretch the hit into a triple,
but that scarcely mattered. What was important was that it was the
first time Martinez contributed to a victory since the club traded
for him June 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come to a new team, you want everything to go well,''
Martinez said. ``You hope you're not the bad luck charm.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez knew better than that. Even though the Rangers lost the
first six games after he joined the club, and even though he took
an 0-for-18 slump into yesterday's game, the veteran outfielder
knew things would change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of time,'' he said. ``I've been in this
game 141/2 years, and I've always hit. The same thing with this
club. They've won the division three of the last four years, and
they knew they were going to come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Martinez did hit in his first couple of games with the
team, but it didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   When general manager Doug Melvin swung the three-team deal with
the Florida Marlins and Chicago Cubs to land Martinez, the
outfielder with the .274 career average wasn't presented as the
final piece of the puzzle, but was expected to be a significant
contributor.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as he joined the club, victories became nonexistent.
He reached base in seven of his first 11 plate appearances in a
Texas uniform, but the club dropped all three games.
</P>
<P>
   As the losses continued to mount, Martinez began to reflect the
team. He stopped hitting.
</P>
<P>
   The club finally won on Saturday, the first victory in
Martinez's seven games with the club, but he couldn't even enjoy
that one much. He went 0-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers won again on Tuesday, but Martinez didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   When he struck out and grounded out in his first two at-bats
last night, his hitless streak reached 20 trips to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   He was afraid the streak was about to reach 21 when the ball
headed toward Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I hit it pretty hard, but I thought it was going to be
a right-at-him ball,'' Martinez said. ``When I saw it hit his shoe,
I was happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels real good. But the bottom line is that it feels good
to win two in a row.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Good manners prevail in Texas prayer ruling
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Called on to referee between two powerful religions, the U.S.
Supreme Court wisely chose to shield high school football in Texas
from gratuitous Christian praying.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, that's not exactly how the six-justice majority put
it.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens said, ``The
religious liberty protected by the Constitution is abridged when
the state affirmatively sponsors the particular practice of
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   And in this case, involving the small Santa Fe school district,
Stevens could have gone further and written ``aggressively''
instead of just ``affirmatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to sly claims that its pre-game prayers were private
student utterances, district officials supervised a school election
to choose the student prayer leader, provided the PA system, laid
on faculty oversight and, in effect, assembled the audience. A
practice that so explicitly encourages public prayer cannot, as the
court found, be ``properly characterized as 'private' speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The result _ and it is impossible not to suspect that for some
the intent as well _ was to intimidate any present who believed
differently or not at all or who simply preferred their
Christianity in rather different form.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is such an outcome idle, worst-case speculation. The courts
found the religious atmosphere of the community so potentially
dangerous they allowed a Mormon family and a Catholic family to
file their legal dissent anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   The necessity for that protection is itself a powerful argument
for keeping governments out of the proper realms of faith, but
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, on behalf of the court's
hard-right minority, accused the essentially conservative majority
of issuing a ruling that ``bristles with hostility to all things
religious in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the ruling only extends _ logically and not at all
surprisingly _ the established security of the village common from
sectarian warfare and the wanton exercise of religious
marjoritarian muscle. That was the clear purpose and is, by now,
the traditional understanding of church-state separation.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff has been, in addition to the not inconsiderable boon
of civil peace, a prosperity of religious conviction and practice
in this country that is unequaled by any comparably situated
nation.
</P>
<P>
   You know, constitutional matters aside, there is another,
humbler but vital concern at play here, too: plain good manners.
</P>
<P>
   While most religions welcome converts and many seek them
actively, this impulse to push prayer into public venues is almost
exclusive to conservative, evangelical Christians and if that suits
the purpose of affirmation, it is also proselytizing, and is meant
to be.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is to either force other faiths to jump into an
evangelical battle that is unnatural to them and start fighting for
the microphone or to suffer the unwelcome proselyzation
(proselytizing) dumbly. Simple good manners would not put friends
or neighbors into that kind of bind.

make for an odd couple: the hulking, balding aviator who preferred
stapling to buttoning his shirts; the dapper little
extraterrestrial with the mop of golden curls and what seems an
extensive wardrobe for someone who hails from an asteroid the size
of a house. Where the Little Prince religiously tends his planet,
his creator was a champion procrastinator. (If the wreckage found
off the coast of Marseille this spring, weeks before
Saint-Exupery's centennial on June 29, proves to be that of his
lost World War II airplane, it will be one of the first occasions
on which he has turned up on time.) The Little Prince is a
determined walker; Saint-Exupery _ the toast of every cabdriver in
Paris _ was allergic to exercise. He had no use for nature. Yet the
two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always so. Reviewers of 1943 assumed the novel's
narrator _ the downed pilot who befriends the Little Prince and
elicits the story of his travels _ was Saint-Exupery. This was as
much the publisher's doing as anything else; the oddball volume was
advertised everywhere as ``a story of St. Exupery and the desert.''
Inadvertently the author assisted in the conflation; in its April
26, 1943, issue, Time reported that he had ``last fortnight left
the U.S. for active service against the Axis in Africa.'' Weeks
later, after having bent a few rules, and to his immense
satisfaction, he began flying again with his old reconnaissance
squadron. His publisher celebrated with a press release, one that
ended in a postscript: ``Although he is in the general neighborhood
where the Little Prince appeared to him, he has not seen him
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Exupery's friends saw a good deal of the Little Prince,
however. The author waved the book around proudly, boyishly, as if
handing over a kind of personal manifesto. He demanded reader's
reports from those who asked to borrow a precious copy. (The volume
was not published in occupied France, where all of Saint-Exupery
had fallen out of print, and was banned in North Africa.) His
letters are punctuated with versions of the flying figure, soon
grounded and disconsolate, as Saint-Exupery was himself to be,
having clumsily damaged an $80,000 airplane in the middle of a war.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the spring of 1944 did he manage to talk his way back
into active service, in a plane into which he did not fit, that he
could not comfortably fly, communicating with the control tower in
a language he did not speak. Over the next months he knew every
kind of near disaster. He experienced engine trouble and landing
difficulties, he fainted in flight, he was pursued by enemy
aircraft, he battled a fire on board. Any one of his 1944 missions
could have been his last.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, 1944, he disappeared, under circumstances upon which
has swelled a great grassy knoll of literature. In much the same
fashion as the Little Prince, Saint-Exupery vanished into thin air.
This was enough to assure his legend. (Insofar as he died for his
country, his was also a death that extended the French copyrights
in his work for an additional 30 years.) ``The Little Prince'' read
differently in France in 1945, where it was published after the
liberation, than it had in America in 1943; to the French reader it
amounted to an eerie chronicle of a death foretold. The mystery
surrounding the disappearance has only enhanced the myth. From the
Titanic to the Loch Ness monster, we cannot resist the appeal of
the large object that slips suddenly from view.
</P>
<P>
   Clinching the equation of author and character, beckoning to the
mystic interpreters, is the curious matter of the sunsets.
Saint-Exupery met his end weeks after his 44th birthday. The Little
Prince lives on a planet so small that he is able to watch the sun
set 44 times a day. Case closed for the suicide contingent. There
is only one small problem. The Little Prince indeed witnesses 44
sunsets in the Katherine Woods rendering, as it seems he will
continue to do in Richard Howard's sparkling new translation of the
novel, published this month. But in French the sun fades from the
Little Prince's view as it always has: 43 times.
</P>
<P>
   Books have lives _ ``The Little Prince'' has had at least two,
and on the occasion this week of Saint-Exupery's centenary is about
to enjoy another _ and they have legacies. As J.M. Barrie's massive
oeuvre has been eclipsed by the shadow of Peter Pan, so has
Saint-Exupery dissolved largely into the author of a children's
classic. The volume has been as kind to his royalty account as it
has been detrimental to his reputation; the successful children's
book writer is one of those thankless half-breeds, like the
academic celebrity, the child star.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Exupery's fall from literary grace begins with ``The
Little Prince'' in his native country, where he is the Norman
Rockwell of letters. His offenses are legion. As one French
apologist has it: ``He manages to eschew Cartesian thinking, to
sidestep the subtlety of our rhetoricians, to rise above our
Talmudic taste for criticism _ in short, to escape all of our
national vices.'' Most maddeningly, Saint-Exupery refuses to
subscribe to schools; he slips through nets. This was, after all, a
writer who won both the Academie Francaise's fiction prize and the
American Booksellers Association's nonfiction prize for ``Wind,
Sand and Stars,'' who got himself condemned as a Vichyite and
banned for singing the praises of a Jew all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is perfect,'' sighs the Little Prince's fox, trading
on his creator's wisdom. Even on a good day the road to immortality
has been as convoluted for Saint-Exupery as was the mortal one. In
1992 the Banque de France resolved to feature an aviator on one of
its new bills. A poll was conducted; France's most celebrated flier
was determined to be Jean Mermoz. Mermoz was a stellar and
unflappable pilot, a better pilot than Saint-Exupery, but he also
happened to have a few unfortunate ideas about fascism. Under a
Socialist administration he hardly qualified as banknote material.
Saint-Exupery profited from his disaster and today graces the
50-franc note by default. Which did not guarantee that his name
would be spelled correctly on the original issue of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Just as each generation embraces its favorite flier, so have we
had several Saint-Exuperys. This is not surprising; for years the
French biography of record was Pierre Chevrier's 1949 ``Antoine de
Saint-Exupery,'' a volume beside which Edmund Morris' ``Dutch''
looks slavishly literal. Pierre Chevrier was none other than Nelly
de Voge, Saint-Exupery's longtime mistress. Dashing into a phone
booth, she emerges as ``un ami'' whenever she needs to enter her
text. Needless to say, Saint-Exupery's wife, Consuelo, is mentioned
only in passing.
</P>
<P>
   Posthumously, Mme. de Saint-Exupery is enjoying her revenge.
Reworked by a critic, her memoirs _ bearing the seductive belly
band ``Le Manuscrit Retrouve de la Femme de Saint-Exupery'' _ have
become a best seller in France. (They were not so much recovered as
finally released by her executor, who _ appropriately for the woman
who advertised herself as the model for the Little Prince's
melodramatic rose _ happened also to be her gardener.)
</P>
<P>
   Consuelo's pages ``topple the statue of our hero, supplying
damning evidence for the prosecution,'' trumpeted L'Express,
although the ``memoir'' reveals very little that is new. A portrait
of marital bliss was not to be expected from the party whom
Saint-Exupery crisply informed, ``If you're not here I can't think,
and if you talk I can't write.'' Two additional volumes devoted to
Consuelo join her own in Parisian bookstores this month. Both take
as their basis the idea that ``The Little Prince'' is the story of
a man's struggle with his marriage, which it is, every bit as much
as it is a volume that read backward reveals that the Lindbergh
baby was acting alone in Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the other shoes drop slowly. Now we have Consuelo,
but sometime down the road we will have another piece of the story,
the intoxicating love letters Saint-Exupery wrote Nelly de Voge.
(``They will not be published until after you are dead,'' she
informed this biographer, 45 years her junior.) Additional
documents will reframe that publication; the man who expounded so
eloquently on duty was perfectly capable of confessing his love to
two different women on the same afternoon. All the same, a
consistent image emerges. ``Pierre Chevrier'' tells of
Saint-Exupery having forced Benzedrine down her throat so that she
might read his new pages with unflagging attention. What should our
hero do in the course of his first evening with Consuelo but ply
her with sedatives? Small wonder the man has not often been allowed
to venture out with a biographer unchaperoned.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Saint-Exupery's heirs have sought to protect him from
the indignity of a barnacle-encrusted P-38 rising from the ocean.
Can the myth survive the solution to the riddle of Saint-Exupery's
death? What happens when his fate and the Little Prince's no longer
coincide? Does the book lose its allure, in all the 95 languages in
which it is published? Once again we are on the verge of answering
those questions.
</P>
<P>
   The identity bracelet fished from an inlet off Marseille in 1998
appears to be authentic; the airplane parts currently under
investigation turned up only a mile away. Saint-Exupery may not
slip through the net this time. All the same, the question of how
he went down may never be solved; it is highly improbable that he
was shot from the sky. It seems that the essential will remain
invisible to the eye, and Saint-Exupery will remain as maddeningly,
irresistibly elusive as ever.
</P>
<P>
   For his part the blue-booted Little Prince has never stood so
solidly on this planet. The dolls are in stores already.

   Rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound
together as Antoine de Saint-Exupery and his Little Prince. They
make for an odd couple: the hulking, balding aviator who preferred
stapling to buttoning his shirts; the dapper little
extraterrestrial with the mop of golden curls and what seems an

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Here's to you, my naked Mrs. Robinson
 &HT;    For release June 25, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confession No.1: I'd never heard of Jerry Hall until a week or
so ago.
</P>
<P>
   Confession No. 2: My knowledge of today's obstreperous rock
music world is extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
   (Parenthetical Confession No. 3: My music appreciation lapsed
with the deaths of George Gershwin and Cole Porter, and is only
occasionally revived through something done by Andrew Lloyd
Webber.)
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Hall's fame, I have read, is that she is the ex-wife of
rocker Mick Jagger and is a model. I assume that although it was
not mentioned, Ms. Hall also is an actress; why else would she have
been chosen to replace Kathleen Turner beginning July 31 in the
London production of ``The Graduate''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe because she's agreed to do a nude scene. You don't
have to be much of an actress to stand on stage in your
all-together, just uninhibited.
</P>
<P>
   I saw Ms. Turner last month in the London play at the Gielgud
Theater. I didn't think she was so hot _ either as an actress or as
a nude.
</P>
<P>
   When the great actor Sir John Gielgud died several weeks ago, I
attributed it, in addition to his advanced age, to the fact that
this fatuous scene was being put on in the West End theater named
in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Graduate,'' an acclaimed 1967 film with no nude scene has
been resurrected as a fast-paced stage comedy _ with nudity. It has
been playing to sellout audiences since it opened in April,
principally because the 45-year-old Turner spends 20 seconds
catching the London evening chill on stage -- in the shadows, I
might add.
</P>
<P>
   This is a shame because, to me, the play would have been an
artistic success without the nude scene, and without Turner as the
carnal Mrs. Robinson. Nevertheless, the nudity has been selling the
tickets, getting the headlines and will be continued by the
43-year-old Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The scene could be done in a full slip and be just as funny.
Yes, it's a funny scene, thanks to the antics of the young,
mortified-by-middle-aged-nudity male lead Matthew Rhys. But that
apparently is not what sells tickets.
</P>
<P>
   What is marketable is what is acceptable these days. If the
public fills the house because there's a nude scene and only
two-thirds fill it without one, the nude scene prevails.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite similar to how other domains are being marketed. A
Time Magazine writer, James Poniewozik, recently reported his
earlier firing by an online publication was because of something
called ``page views.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Poniewozik, the tenure of writers and the judgment
of material is based on how many ``hits'' or ``page views''
articles receive on the Web. If an online publication posts, say,
five stories -- ranging from 10 Ways to Please Your Spouse in Bed
to How to Improve Your Child's Reading Skills and there is a
predominance of ``hits'' on the sex story, then future stories will
deal more with that area, and writers will be judged (and employed)
based on what kind of stories they bring in. (''Another education
piece, Faversham, and you're fired!'')
</P>
<P>
   How much stronger would be sales for ``The Taming of the Shrew''
might we had been able to see Petruchio peel Katharina on the night
of her ultimate submission?
</P>
<P>
   I wonder had Hall held out to do her scene with some manner of
attire whether the producers would have accepted her, and whether
ticket sales would have dropped. We're not going to know, at least
not until the initial reviews of her ``appearance'' hit the London
tabloids at the first of August.
</P>
<P>
   Likely, it will be similar to that of Turner in April, when a
London tabloid began: ``Kathleen Turner, the Hollywood film star
who started off in Body Heat and has never lost the art of sexual
provocation, made an absolutely sensational London stage debut last
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, it referred to her wafting around the stage clad in
little more than sex appeal. In the film ``The Graduate,'' Anne
Bancroft was cited for her acting ability. (And Mike Nichols got an
Oscar for direction.) That's the difference between then and now. I
expect Jerry Hall to emulate Turner rather than Bancroft. That's
probably why the house will continue to be sold out.
</P>
<P>
   And so you should ask, why did I buy tickets to see Kathleen
Turne

 &HT;    NEW PLAY EXAMINES THE TWO FACES OF NAZI ARCHITECT, SPEER

<P>
   LONDON _ How can an apparently honorable man take part in an
unspeakable evil and then find a way to live with himself?
</P>
<P>
   This is the central question of ``Albert Speer,'' a new play in
London that pursues its unsettling answers through a 3 1/2-hour
examination of the confessions and equivocations of Nazi leader
Adolph Hitler's pet architect and armaments minister.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Trevor Nunn, the play is based on the successful
1995 biography by Gitta Sereny, ``Albert Speer: His Battle with
Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sereny, an Austrian-born Briton, wrote the 720-page book nearly
20 years after a three-week interview she had with Speer, who died
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his high position in the Nazi regime and his
willingness to write about his experiences, Speer long has been an
important figure in the effort to understand the inner workings of
the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the confessional and analytical nature of his books,
he has been widely regarded as ``the good Nazi.'' He maintained to
his death that he was unaware of the Holocaust until after the war.
</P>
<P>
   However, this assertion has come under attack in recent years by
Sereny and other writers who doubt that Speer could have been so
comfortably ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   This perspective is embraced by playwright David Edgar, best
known to Americans for his adaptation of Dickens' ``Nicholas
Nickleby'' in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar explores the Speer story in two acts. The first represents
Speer's version, a portrayal that is faithful to his books,
``Inside the Third Reich'' and ``Spandau Diaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene opens with Speer's reporting to Spandau prison in
Berlin to begin the 20-year sentence handed down during the
Nuremberg trials. In the background of the scene are Nazi war
</P>
<P>
   criminals dangling by their necks _ a fate escaped by Speer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an intelligent rendering of Speer by Alex Jennings, the
first act is stolen by Roger Allam's mesmerizing Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Allam plays the Fuehrer as an intensely charming prophet with a
grand vision of a strong, pure Germany that will need _ and here's
where the young architect Speer comes in _ a spectacular new
capital on the magnitude of ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler comes across as an engaging, good listener with Old World
manners and a gift for flattery. He casts a Faustian spell over the
ambitious young Speer and elevates him to be the second most
powerful man in the Reich.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Speer tries to explain how Hitler's charismatic
appeal worked on intelligent, stable Germans _ such as Speer:
``Eighty million people didn't follow him because he was evil but
</P>
<P>
   because they thought he was extremely good!''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Sereny describes an emotional even ``erotic''
relationship between the two men. Hitler saw the handsome young
Speer as the Aryan of his warped dreams. To Speer, Hitler was the
father-figure he never had. In the play, Speer's own father regards
his son's role in the Reich with icy contempt.
</P>
<P>
   This theme unfolds as a dark love story that only begins to
unravel in the horror of the last years of the war when Hitler's
loathsome insanity becomes obvious even to Speer.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of revelation comes during one of the play's most
memorable moments. Hitler _ now clearly disjointed and drained _
sits slumped against Speer's white model of the majestic dome that
he designed as centerpiece of the imperial Reich capital that never
was.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler rages at the cowards and inferiors who failed him in his
quest to rid the world of the ``Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy.''
Speer, at last recognizing Hitler for what he was, bravely resists
the Fuehrer's final demand that he destroy Germany to deprive the
weaklings left behind with any means to recover from the war.
</P>
<P>
   Act 1 closes with a chilling 1943 speech made by Heinrich
Himmler, the Nazi SS leader who directed the program of mass
killing. Himmler reveals the full horror of the ``Final Solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The second act, which shows Speer after his release, shifts from
Speer's account of what happened and begins to chip away at his
story.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the play, Speer is portrayed not as sinner
seeking redemption but as a man seeking comfort in denial.
</P>
<P>
   Described by one character as a ``rent-a-penitent,'' Speer makes
the university and bookstore circuit dogged always by questions
about his role in the Reich. The questions in time overcome his
comfortable and practiced responses.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he is forced to confront himself and the ghost of
Hitler in dreams that allow him no escape from his reality.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he confesses that he must have known _ even though
he could never bring himself to acknowledge what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed, and turned away from what I sensed,'' Speer says
with horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert Speer'' is scheduled to run through July 8. For

</P>
<P>
   Speaking as someone who has written almost entirely
pessimistically about Russia for the last 10 years, I found
something distinctly cheering about the recent arrest and release
of businessman Vladimir Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the action itself _ right down to the decision to
imprison Gusinsky in the notorious Butyrka prison, home to several
generations of Soviet political prisoners _ was reprehensible. It
was also exactly the sort of thing that the more apocalyptic Moscow
observers most feared might take place under the Putin regime.
</P>
<P>
   While Gusinsky, like the rest of the oligarchs who now own much
of the Russian economy, no doubt deserves to be investigated, it
isn't at all clear that he deserved to be investigated first.
</P>
<P>
   For one, he was one of the few among them to run something
recognizable as a legitimate business, and his TV empire was one of
the few in Russia to show something recognizable as news. If
someone had been looking for thieves among rich Russians, there
were more apt targets.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, his arrest was clearly connected to the fact
that his TV stations and his newspapers have been among the few to
be critical of President Putin, even going so far as to back
Putin's rival, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   No, the arrest itself was not cheering: It was clearly intended
as a threat to anyone who might care to oppose Putin in the future.
But the response to it, contrary to what might have been expected,
was surprisingly vigorous.
</P>
<P>
   Both centrist and liberal politicians denounced the arrest, in
public, on television _ and they were joined by novelists, theater
directors and other members of the intelligentsia.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent journalists wrote angry articles, among them the
admirable Yevgenia Albats, who furiously accused the government of
picking on Gusinsky for being Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 17 prominent businessmen signed a protest petition.
Gusinsky's lawyers immediately appealed the arrest, and the
prosecutor's office was forced to use what was described as a
``legal loophole'' to explain why it was keeping Gusinsky for three
days without charging him.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was not exactly a widespread public outcry _ most
of the Russian public is probably delighted to see any rich man
arrested, for any reason _ there was, nevertheless, an open,
energetic response on several fronts, from a variety of different
people with different motives. A mere 15 years ago, such a response
would have been impossible, even unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   In the Soviet Union, government prosecutors did not bother to
explain why they were holding anybody for three days without
charging them; privately hired lawyers did not defend the state's
victims; angry intellectuals were not interviewed on television;
independent journalists published nowhere, except in the
underground press.
</P>
<P>
   We have come a long way since then, and that is, occasionally,
worth celebrating. For this, in fact, is one of the few genuine
achievements of the Russian people in the past decade: It is at
last possible to say that there is beginning to be something like a
genuine Russian civil society.
</P>
<P>
   Weak, fragmented and uncoordinated, more closely resembling the
Central Europe of the 1970s rather than the Western democracies (or
even the Central European democracies) of today, this new Russian
civil society is nevertheless collectively articulate enough to get
its point across in public, and powerful enough to force the thugs
in Putin's government at the very least to explain themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, none of those doing the shouting appear to be
remotely afraid or intimidated. It is a good sign for the future:
This is one genie that will be tough to put back in the bottle.

   SEOUL _ When Christopher McCarthy, a 22-year-old American
soldier, escaped from U.S. military custody after he was accused of
murdering a South Korean bar hostess for refusing sex with him, it
fed the belief among South Koreans that Americans believe they're
above the law.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was apprehended eight hours later and was sentenced by
a South Korean court this month to eight years in prison. However,
that incident was the latest in a series of events, including the
surprisingly successful summit between North and South Korea, that
has stoked calls for less interference from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a very strong anti-American sentiment
right now, but I think it's growing,'' said Jung-Hoon Lee,
professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul.
``The summit contributed to it because of its focus on independence
and autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reunification of the two Koreas is seen by some South Koreans as
an issue that can be resolved by Koreans only.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kim Jong Il's new look ... (showing) he can be friendly,
smile, be jovial, a very confident leader, (some people) feel, we
can do some business with this guy and Americans only serve as a
possible roadblock,'' said Lee. ``So that sort of feeds on
anti-American sentiment that was already there. There's a sense
that we should do this alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have always been factions in Korea _ especially
among the left-wing and the younger generations - who believe U.S.
troops should go home.
</P>
<P>
   Massive student demonstrations in the 1970s and '80s are
characterized as anti-American but were more directed at the
military dictators who ruled South Korea, said Lee. But because of
the military alliance between the two countries, the United States
was seen as tolerating or approving of the dictatorships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many students still feel Korea is being used by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States thinks of Korea as their colony,'' said Soo
Jin Park, a 25-year-old student at Yonsei University. ``Not on
paper, but by the way they act, Koreans get that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the 37,000 American troops in Korea should leave
``because we're not at war and I see no reason for them to stay in
Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   While such sentiments are common on university campuses,
analysts agree they do not represent the mainstream view in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a growing belief _ even among people who would
identify themselves as pro-American and have no desire to see
American troops withdraw _ that Washington needs to treat Korea as
more of an equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, I must say Korea is controlled by the United
States in many ways,'' said Rev. Young Joon Cho, pastor of Chung
Dong First Methodist Church in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Pagoda Park in downtown Seoul is filled with elderly men playing
chess, practicing calligraphy or just passing the time. In one
corner, a retired sociology teacher who would give his name only as
Mr. Kim is holding court with an audience of at least a couple
dozen, lecturing on U.S.-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States shouldn't look down at Korea,'' he said.
``We're not the Korea of 50 years ago. They should respect Korea as
a full sovereign country and let us solve our own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Foreign Ministry believes it is ready for an adjustment
in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, our relationship has been one of dependence on
U.S. aid,'' said Sung-Hwan Kim, deputy director of the Ministry's
North American bureau. ``Now I feel we're equipped with the
requirements (for a more equal partnership).''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. recognizes that the relationship is an evolving one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea has changed from the poorest country in the world in the
fifties and sixties to one of the richest,'' said a U.S. official
based in Korea who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There's a
constant need to re-evaluate the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the displeasure towards Americans stems from the Status
of Forces Agreement, which in part governs how U.S. soldiers who
commit crimes or wrongdoings in Korea are handled. From little
things, like not paying traffic tickets, to violent crimes, such as
murder, Koreans feel Americans get away with too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (American soldiers) are outside of their campus, they are
not restricted by Korean law, and that's not right,'' said Byung
Chan Son, who owns a small energy consulting firm in Seoul.
``Korean people are very unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the agreement is currently being renegotiated, as it
periodically is. Kim of the Foreign Ministry said Korea has
proposed several changes, such as requiring indicted American
soldiers to remain in Korean custody instead of American military
custody and requiring American military facilities _ where air and
ground pollution are not subject to regulations _ to adhere to
basic environmental guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the United States must make an effort to ... give the
Korean public at least an appearance that it respects Korea, treats
Korea as an equal partner and that there's a balance in the
bilateral relations,'' said Lee.

TO WIN AGAIN

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Alfredo Mondragon is from a Mexico so far removed
from modern times, he doesn't know his age and he can't express why
he supports this country's Institutional Revolutionary Party _ the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just what we do,'' the Mazahua Indian from rural Mexico
state said. He stood motionless in soiled work clothes among a
throng of 100,000 cheering for the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   High school teacher and union member Flavio Bernal, on the other
hand, has no trouble defending his party with a militant's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico we live with social peace that the PRI has
guaranteed,'' the 31-year-old Guadalajara resident said, pumping
his fist. ``We know the party has made mistakes, but we don't give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian peasant and the earnest teacher _ both bused to
Mexico City for a recent rally _ are just two faces of a vast quilt
of support that helps sustain the PRI, the world's longest ruling
political party. For 71 years the PRI (pronounced, ``Pree'') has
controlled this country's presidency and most other political
offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI faces its toughest test ever when Mexicans elect
their next president on July 2. Its candidate, veteran government
economist Francisco Labastida Ochoa, is locked in a bitter fight to
the end with Vicente Fox Quesada, a former Coca-Cola executive and
rancher who has mounted the most effective opposition campaign in
Mexico's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I entered politics in 1988, my mission has been to
drive the PRI from Los Pinos (the Mexican White House),'' said Fox,
candidate of the conservative National Action Party and coalition
Alliance for Change. ``Mexico can't live with the PRI anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven decades in power _ and half the population in
poverty _ the PRI has a lot of incumbent baggage to carry. If it
loses the election, most political analysts agree, the party would
slide into crisis and jettison its national leadership. But don't
expect it to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``That party has a structure and breadth nobody is going to give
up,'' said Mexico City analyst Joel Estudillo.
</P>
<P>
   The party's boosters argue that while Mexico may be riddled with
problems, the party rose from ashes of the 1910 Mexican Revolution
and managed to turn a feudal backwater into an industrial,
oil-producing nation. The party's enemies, however, say the PRI has
perpetuated corruption and enriched an elite. They blame the party
for forcing millions of Mexico's poor to emigrate to the United
States, and plunging the country into repeated economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Among its detractors, the PRI is often scornfully referred to as
``the system'' or ``the official party'' or simply, ``the
dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Its core support, some analysts say, is now only about 30
percent to 35 percent of Mexico's 58.7 million voters. But a
well-known leftist candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is also running
for the presidency, so the opposition vote is split, which helps
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this divided opposition vote, most opinion polls
show that Fox and Labastida are in a dead heat now among likely
voters. Fox is trying to syphon votes from Cardenas and both are
fighting for the undecided, which could be as much as 20 percent of
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has enormous advantages in this war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the party is pointing a shotgun and firing
everywhere,'' said Mexico City political analyst Edna Jaime. ``It's
using everything possible to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has sought to project a ``new PRI,'' more democratic and
more willing to engage in fierce but fair competition with rivals.
</P>
<P>
   For this election, the PRI hired cutting-edge U.S. campaign
strategists, like James Carville, President Clinton's advisor, to
help poll voters and fashion messages. The Austin, Texas-based
Public Strategies Inc., which shapes communications for campaigns,
has assisted in developing international relations.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, when it appeared that Fox was dramatically gaining
ground, the party also called in some controversial old-fashioned
party leaders to join the cause. At least one advisor, Manuel
Bartlett, has a reputation for strong-arm tactics. It's never been
proved, but many Mexicans even think he engineered outright fraud
in the 1988 presidential race to give the PRI the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win an election you have to be inclusive,'' said Javier
Trevino, a Harvard University-educated international affairs
advisor to Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign needs everyone in the party on board to help,
Trevino said, and election rules are so tight today nobody can
commit fraud at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the election we are going to continue to transform the
PRI,'' he added. ``But first we have an objective, which is to win
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   A key part of that strategy remains the PRI's traditional
network of ``corporatist'' organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Over seven decades, the PRI has built a web of pro-party unions
and associations that incorporate farmers, oil workers, industrial
workers, industrialists and government employees into the party's
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   True believers say they support the party because of its rebel
roots and flexible, mixed ideology, borrowing from socialism and
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of my family died in the revolution,'' said Victor
Montelongo, an organizer for a PRI farmers' group in Guanajuato
state.
</P>
<P>
   Some sympathizers say they don't trust anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil you know is better than the devil you don't,'' said
Rosa Espinoza, a secretary with the Mexican Confederation of
Workers, a massive pro-PRI union.
</P>
<P>
   And many support the party because it means perks in a poor
country.
</P>
<P>
   Government workers often receive housing subsidies, loans and
other benefits to offset low salaries. Poor people who seize land
to build houses on are incorporated into the PRI's ranks by local
party bosses, who help them obtain public services or tap into
electrical lines for free power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a great political culture of patronage,'' said
Jaime, the political analyst. ``The PRI hasn't been a military
dictatorship. It's been authoritarian but also inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mexico's political system has modernized in recent years and
opposition parties have begun to run more municipalities and
states, the PRI's patronage structure has begun to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist anymore,'' Jaime said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's final big rally in Mexico City on June 18 was packed
with people from PRI-affiliated groups, including unionized
teachers bused in from Jalisco, oil workers from Veracruz,
government workers all of stripes, and farmers and Indians from
Puebla and the state of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International poll of 1,330 likely voters surveyed
between June 10 and June 19 found Labastida had a 53-to-29-percent
advantage over Fox in rural areas, which are about 30 percent of
the electorate. The poll also found Labastida now has a three-point
lead over Fox, who, in a poll by the same company in May had a
five-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mexico's peasant farmers, who are on the lowest rungs of
the educational ladder, still regard the PRI and the government as
synonymous. They feel they owe the party their vote _ the PRI
distributed land after the revolution _ and they are grateful for
the few cash benefits the federal government gives them as
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grandparents voted for the PRI and so do we,'' said
Rosario Parra, 49, a Nahuatl Indian who was bused by the party from
rural Puebla to the PRI rally in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI has given us things like Procampo (cash subsidies for
farmers) and Progresa (a new program that offers cash for the
poorest of families),'' Parra added.
</P>
<P>
   A special watchdog congressional commission has filed at least
seven complaints with Mexico's Attorney General, charging that
evidence strongly suggests that the PRI is coercing votes using
these federal programs and turning some government workplaces into
virtual campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the state-run oil company Pemex and a federal
family-welfare office, for example, have complained that managers
are under pressure to recruit votes for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Another PRI campaign practice _ passing out free gifts of food,
bags of cement and other goods _ is not necessarily illegal if
these goods are privately supplied. But charges are pouring in to
watchdog groups that state and local officials are supporting these
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Labastida campaign is firing back, arguing that no charges
have been proved, and that Fox of trying to discredit the campaign
process because he could lose.
</P>
<P>
   At his Mexico City rally, Labastida said: ``Only those who
already sense defeat proclaim anticipated fraud, which only exists
in their imagination or because of their sense of desperation.''

   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Barely big enough for nine computers, Zoni
Internet Service offers Syrians an on-line window to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   A marker board lists cloaking sites, like ``besilent.com''.
Customers use them to get around firewalls to ``hotmail.com'' and
other mail systems blocked by the Syrian government's server.
</P>
<P>
   But, even more significant than the fact that Zoni gets away
with this, is that many other sites do not appear to be impeded by
the government at all.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can go to the Amnesty International homepage to read
up on torture in Syrian jails. They can get most newspapers and
news magazines on-line anywhere. They cannot get sites from Israel
but they can call up the Israeli Embassy Website in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Zoni is one of at least three non-government Internet shops
opening in the last nine months in Damascus. Tucked away on the
fourth floor of a dingy office building, it has the feel of
something slightly illicit but is brimming with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Syria, many things will change,'' says 32-year-old
owner Yamor Alzoni, a bearded, practicing Muslim on the crest of
his country's Internet wave.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Syrian government is for it or not _ and the signals
are mixed _ Internet use is slowly expanding in a country known for
slow change and controlled speech.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Syrian officials are showing a hesitancy typical of
authoritarian regimes confronted with a new technology. They don't
want to be left behind by the on-line world, but they seem intent
on trying to chaperone and manage their people's activity there.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians must have government licenses to get a password for
using the Internet. Officials say there are only about 7,000
Internet-licensed hook-up ``points,'' including those in schools or
other places with multiple users, for this country of more than 17
million.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the country's phone system has not been able to handle
more Internet users, officials limit the licenses to institutions
and the elite, like professors or business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Zoni's clients are largely foreigners checking E-mail messages.
The US$6.50-per-hour fees deter most Syrians. The country's per
capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1998, the last year
available, was estimated at just US$2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Further slowing Internet use, there's a gray area for Syrians
hoping to get on-line from home.
</P>
<P>
   Saadalla Aghad Kalaa(cq all), head of the media committee for
the government-backed Syrian Computer Society, said the country is
not ready yet to plunge into unfettered home Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the Internet at home is something that could hurt this
traditional society,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Syrians can use the Internet at home, he hesitates and
says in his precise English, ``It is not forbidden, but it is not
allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria has begun loosening some controls on information.
Television satellite dishes were in effect legalized, albeit
slowly, in the mid-1990s. They sprout up by the thousands on
apartment-block rooftops in the city that claims to be the oldest
continually lived -in capital on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The computer society is headed by Bashar Assad, son of, and
likely successor to, the late Syrian President Hafez Assad. His
patronage has raised hopes that he will welcome the new computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Kalaa said the society and government have 200 computer training
centers around the country and expect to license more than 200,000
Internet hook-ups next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Syria is famous for restrictive, socialist-style planning.
</P>
<P>
   While other countries thrive off the freedom and spontaneity of
Internet use, Syria dribbles out the licenses. It tries to herd
users _ may of whom have computers at home _ into post offices,
schools or other centers where the Internet is available.
</P>
<P>
   Kalaa hosts a weekly television show that demonstrates the uses
of computers and the Internet. But, he says callers to the show
have a regular complaint: ``Why are you showing us this if we can't
use it at home?''
</P>
<P>
   Kalaa says it is a balancing act, trying to introduce the new
technology without angering older-generation Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them, 'Even if you cannot use it, you must not stop
it,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Alzoni, the Internet shop owner, said government officials have
now denied him permission for a second branch. He believes it is
more out of the government's desire to control Internet monopolies
than any desire to restrict information.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that he's also been told that he cannot run an Internet
``cafe.'' Government departments keep a close eye on cafes and
coffee shops, places where people can gather and conspire. That
seemed to bother officials more than the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   So, Alzoni said, he called his business an Internet ``service''
and kept it open.

 &HT;    NEW PLAY EXAMINES THE TWO FACES OF NAZI ARCHITECT, SPEER
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ How can an apparently honorable man take part in an
unspeakable evil and then find a way to live with himself?
</P>
<P>
   This is the central question of ``Albert Speer,'' a new play in
London that pursues its unsettling answers through a 3 1/2-hour
examination of the confessions and equivocations of Nazi leader
Adolph Hitler's pet architect and armaments minister.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Trevor Nunn, the play is based on the successful
1995 biography by Gitta Sereny, ``Albert Speer: His Battle with
Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sereny, an Austrian-born Briton, wrote the 720-page book nearly
20 years after a three-week interview she had with Speer, who died
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his high position in the Nazi regime and his
willingness to write about his experiences, Speer long has been an
important figure in the effort to understand the inner workings of
the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the confessional and analytical nature of his books,
he has been widely regarded as ``the good Nazi.'' He maintained to
his death that he was unaware of the Holocaust until after the war.
</P>
<P>
   However, this assertion has come under attack in recent years by
Sereny and other writers who doubt that Speer could have been so
comfortably ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   This perspective is embraced by playwright David Edgar, best
known to Americans for his adaptation of Dickens' ``Nicholas
Nickleby'' in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar explores the Speer story in two acts. The first represents
Speer's version, a portrayal that is faithful to his books,
``Inside the Third Reich'' and ``Spandau Diaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene opens with Speer's reporting to Spandau prison in
Berlin to begin the 20-year sentence handed down during the
Nuremberg trials. In the background of the scene are Nazi war
</P>
<P>
   criminals dangling by their necks _ a fate escaped by Speer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an intelligent rendering of Speer by Alex Jennings, the
first act is stolen by Roger Allam's mesmerizing Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Allam plays the Fuehrer as an intensely charming prophet with a
grand vision of a strong, pure Germany that will need _ and here's
where the young architect Speer comes in _ a spectacular new
capital on the magnitude of ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler comes across as an engaging, good listener with Old World
manners and a gift for flattery. He casts a Faustian spell over the
ambitious young Speer and elevates him to be the second most
powerful man in the Reich.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Speer tries to explain how Hitler's charismatic
appeal worked on intelligent, stable Germans _ such as Speer:
``Eighty million people didn't follow him because he was evil but
</P>
<P>
   because they thought he was extremely good!''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Sereny describes an emotional even ``erotic''
relationship between the two men. Hitler saw the handsome young
Speer as the Aryan of his warped dreams. To Speer, Hitler was the
father-figure he never had. In the play, Speer's own father regards
his son's role in the Reich with icy contempt.
</P>
<P>
   This theme unfolds as a dark love story that only begins to
unravel in the horror of the last years of the war when Hitler's
loathsome insanity becomes obvious even to Speer.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of revelation comes during one of the play's most
memorable moments. Hitler _ now clearly disjointed and drained _
sits slumped against Speer's white model of the majestic dome that
he designed as centerpiece of the imperial Reich capital that never
was.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler rages at the cowards and inferiors who failed him in his
quest to rid the world of the ``Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy.''
Speer, at last recognizing Hitler for what he was, bravely resists
the Fuehrer's final demand that he destroy Germany to deprive the
weaklings left behind with any means to recover from the war.
</P>
<P>
   Act 1 closes with a chilling 1943 speech made by Heinrich
Himmler, the Nazi SS leader who directed the program of mass
killing. Himmler reveals the full horror of the ``Final Solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The second act, which shows Speer after his release, shifts from
Speer's account of what happened and begins to chip away at his
story.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the play, Speer is portrayed not as sinner
seeking redemption but as a man seeking comfort in denial.
</P>
<P>
   Described by one character as a ``rent-a-penitent,'' Speer makes
the university and bookstore circuit dogged always by questions
about his role in the Reich. The questions in time overcome his
comfortable and practiced respon dreams that allow him no escape
from his reality.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he confesses that he must have known _ even though
he could never bring himself to acknowledge what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed, and turned away from what I sensed,'' Speer says
with horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert Speer'' is scheduled to run through July 8. For
tickets, call 011-44-207-452-3000

   SEOUL _ When Christopher McCarthy, a 22-year-old American
soldier, escaped from U.S. military custody after he was accused of
murdering a South Korean bar hostess for refusing sex with him, it
fed the belief among South Koreans that Americans believe they're
above the law.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was apprehended eight hours later and was sentenced by
a South Korean court this month to eight years in prison. However,
that incident was the latest in a series of events, including the
surprisingly successful summit between North and South Korea, that
has stoked calls for less interference from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a very strong anti-American sentiment
right now, but I think it's growing,'' said Jung-Hoon Lee,
professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul.
``The summit contributed to it because of its focus on independence
and autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reunification of the two Koreas is seen by some South Koreans as
an issue that can be resolved by Koreans only.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kim Jong Il's new look ... (showing) he can be friendly,
smile, be jovial, a very confident leader, (some people) feel, we
can do some business with this guy and Americans only serve as a
possible roadblock,'' said Lee. ``So that sort of feeds on
anti-American sentiment that was already there. There's a sense
that we should do this alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have always been factions in Korea _ especially
among the left-wing and the younger generations - who believe U.S.
troops should go home.
</P>
<P>
   Massive student demonstrations in the 1970s and '80s are
characterized as anti-American but were more directed at the
military dictators who ruled South Korea, said Lee. But because of
the military alliance between the two countries, the United States
was seen as tolerating or approving of the dictatorships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many students still feel Korea is being used by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States thinks of Korea as their colony,'' said Soo
Jin Park, a 25-year-old student at Yonsei University. ``Not on
paper, but by the way they act, Koreans get that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the 37,000 American troops in Korea should leave
``because we're not at war and I see no reason for them to stay in
Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   While such sentiments are common on university campuses,
analysts agree they do not represent the mainstream view in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a growing belief _ even among people who would
identify themselves as pro-American and have no desire to see
American troops withdraw _ that Washington needs to treat Korea as
more of an equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, I must say Korea is controlled by the United
States in many ways,'' said Rev. Young Joon Cho, pastor of Chung
Dong First Methodist Church in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Pagoda Park in downtown Seoul is filled with elderly men playing
chess, practicing calligraphy or just passing the time. In one
corner, a retired sociology teacher who would give his name only as
Mr. Kim is holding court with an audience of at least a couple
dozen, lecturing on U.S.-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States shouldn't look down at Korea,'' he said.
``We're not the Korea of 50 years ago. They should respect Korea as
a full sovereign country and let us solve our own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Foreign Ministry believes it is ready for an adjustment
in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, our relationship has been one of dependence on
U.S. aid,'' said Sung-Hwan Kim, deputy director of the Ministry's
North American bureau. ``Now I feel we're equipped with the
requirements (for a more equal partnership).''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. recognizes that the relationship is an evolving one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea has changed from the poorest country in the world in the
fifties and sixties to one of the richest,'' said a U.S. official
based in Korea who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There's a
constant need to re-evaluate the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the displeasure towards Americans stems from the Status
of Forces Agreement, which in part governs how U.S. soldiers who
commit crimes or wrongdoings in Korea are handled. From little
things, like not paying traffic tickets, to violent crimes, such as
murder, Koreans feel Americans get away with too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (American soldiers) are outside of their campus, they are
not restricted by Korean law, and that's not right,'' said Byung
Chan Son, who owns a small energy consulting firm in Seoul.
``Korean people are very unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the agreement is currently being renegotiated, as it
periodically is. Kim of the Foreign Ministry said Korea has
proposed several changes, such as requiring indicted American
soldiers to remain in Korean custody instead of American military
custody and requiring American military facilities _ where air and
ground pollution are not subject to regulations _ to adhere to
basic environmental guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the United States must make an effort to ... give the
Korean public at least an appearance that it respects Korea, treats
Korea as an equal partner and that there's a balance in the
bilateral relations,'' said Lee.

   MEXICO CITY _ Alfredo Mondragon is from a Mexico so far removed
from modern times, he doesn't know his age and he can't express why
he supports this country's Institutional Revolutionary Party _ the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just what we do,'' the Mazahua Indian from rural Mexico
state said. He stood motionless in soiled work clothes among a
throng of 100,000 cheering for the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   High school teacher and union member Flavio Bernal, on the other
hand, has no trouble defending his party with a militant's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico we live with social peace that the PRI has
guaranteed,'' the 31-year-old Guadalajara resident said, pumping
his fist. ``We know the party has made mistakes, but we don't give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian peasant and the earnest teare and breadth nobody is
going to give up,'' said Mexico City analyst Joel Estudillo.
</P>
<P>
   The party's boosters argue that while Mexico may be riddled with
problems, the party rose from ashes of the 1910 Mexican Revolution
and managed to turn a feudal backwater into an industrial,
oil-producing nation. The party's enemies, however, say the PRI has
perpetuated corruption and enriched an elite. They blame the party
for forcing millions of Mexico's poor to emigrate to the United
States, and plunging the country into repeated economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Among its detractors, the PRI is often scornfully referred to as
``the system'' or ``the official party'' or simply, ``the
dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Its core support, some analysts say, is now only about 30
percent to 35 percent of Mexico's 58.7 million voters. But a
well-known leftist candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is also running
for the presidency, so the opposition vote is split, which helps
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this divided opposition vote, most opinion polls
show that Fox and Labastida are in a dead heat now among likely
voters. Fox is trying to syphon votes from Cardenas and both are
fighting for the undecided, which could be as much as 20 percent of
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has enormous advantages in this war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the party is pointing a shotgun and firing
everywhere,'' said Mexico City political analyst Edna Jaime. ``It's
using everything possible to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has sought to project a ``new PRI,'' more democratic and
more willing to engage in fierce but fair competition with rivals.
</P>
<P>
   For this election, the PRI hired cutting-edge U.S. campaign
strategists, like James Carville, President Clinton's advisor, to
help poll voters and fashion messages. The Austin, Texas-based
Public Strategies Inc., which shapes communications for campaigns,
has assisted in developing international relations.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, when it appeared that Fox was dramatically gaining
ground, the party also called in some controversial old-fashioned
party leaders to join the cause. At least one advisor, Manuel
Bartlett, has a reputation for strong-arm tactics. It's never been
proved, but many Mexicans even think he engineered outright fraud
in the 1988 presidential race to give the PRI the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win an election you have to be inclusive,'' said Javier
Trevino, a Harvard University-educated international affairs
advisor to Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign needs everyone in the party on board to help,
Trevino said, and election rules are so tight today nobody can
commit fraud at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the election we are going to continue to transform the
PRI,'' he added. ``But first we have an objective, which is to win
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   A key part of that strategy remains the PRI's traditional
network of ``corporatist'' organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Over seven decades, the PRI has built a web of pro-party unions
and associations that incorporate farmers, oil workers, industrial
workers, industrialists and government employees into the party's
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   True believers say they support the party because of its rebel
roots and flexible, mixed ideology, borrowing from socialism and
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of my family died in the revolution,'' said Victor
Montelongo, an organizer for a PRI farmers' group in Guanajuato
state.
</P>
<P>
   Some sympathizers say they don't trust anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil you know is better than the devil you don't,'' said
Rosa Espinoza, a secretary with the Mexican Confederation of
Workers, a massive pro-PRI union.
</P>
<P>
   And many support the party because it means perks in a poor
country.
</P>
<P>
   Government workers often receive housing subsidies, loans and
other benefits to offset low salaries. Poor people who seize land
to build houses on are incorporated into the PRI's ranks by local
party bosses, who help them obtain public services or tap into
electrical lines for free power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a great political culture of patronage,'' said
Jaime, the political analyst. ``The PRI hasn't been a military
dictatorship. It's been authoritarian but also inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mexico's political system has modernized in recent years and
opposition parties have begun to run more municipalities and
states, the PRI's patronage structure has begun to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist anymore,'' Jaime said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's final big rally in Mexico City on June 18 was packed
with people from PRI-affiliated groups, including unionized
teachers bused in from Jalisco, oil workers from Veracruz,
government workers all of stripes, and farmers and Indians from
Puebla and the state of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International poll of 1,330 likely voters surveyed
between June 10 and June 19 found Labastida had a 53-to-29-percent
advantage over Fox in rural areas, which are about 30 percent of
the electorate. The poll also found Labastida now has a three-point
lead over Fox, who, in a poll by the same company in May had a
five-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mexico's peasant farmers, who are on the lowest rungs of
the educational ladder, still regard the PRI and the government as
synonymous. They feel they owe the party their vote _ the PRI
distributed land after the revolution _ and they are grateful for
the few cash benefits the federal government gives them as
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grandparents voted for the PRI and so do we,'' said
Rosario Parra, 49, a Nahuatl Indian who was bused by the party from
rural Puebla to the PRI rally in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI has given us things like Procampo (cash subsidies for
farmers) and Progresa (a new program that offers cash for the
poorest of families),'' Parra added.
</P>
<P>
   A special watchdog congressional commission has filed at least
seven complaints with Mexico's Attorney General, charging that
evidence strongly suggests that the PRI is coercing votes using
these federal programs and turning some government workplaces into
virtual campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the state-run oil company Pemex and a federal
family-welfare office, for example, have complained that managers
are under pressure to recruit votes for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Another PRI campaign practice _ passing out free gifts of food,
bags of cement and other goods _ is not necessarily illegal if
these goods are privately supplied. But charges are pouring in to
watchdog groups that state and local officials are supporting these
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Labastida campaign is firing back, arguing that no charges
have been proved, and that Fox of trying to discredit the campaign
process because he could lose.
</P>
<P>
   At his Mexico City rally, Labastida said: ``Only those who
already sense defeat proclaim anticipated fraud, which only exists
in their imagination or because of their sense of desperation.''

 &HT;    U.S. WATCHING MEXICAN ELECTION CLOSELY, EXPECTS LITTLE CHANGE IN
RELATIONSHIP

 &HT;    With MEXICO-PRI-$ADV25.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The party that has governed Mexico for seven
decades has become as familiar to U.S. policymakers as the litany
of difficult issues dividing the giant neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   If the ruling party is tossed out in July 2 presidential
elections, though, American officials would quickly praise the
result as a healthy development in Mexico's democratic evolution, a
badly needed breath of fresh air for the rough-and-tumble politics
south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, turning the tables on 71 years of one-party
rule in Mexico would present new challenges to the United States,
even as it opened the door to a whole new chorus of long-stifled
political voices across Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be happy to have a new party, because there would be new
elites,'' said Mexico expert Louis Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, with those changes would come complications, countered
Robert Leiken of the Brookings Institution, a Washington think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten into the habit very much,'' he said, ``of
dealing with the ruling party.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, of course, the U.S. government takes no sides in
Mexico's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government must deal with whomever is elected, whether
the victor is Francisco Labastida Ochoa, banner carrier of the
long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish
acronym, PRI; or opposition candidate Vicente Fox Quesada, of the
National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican people will vote and make their own decision,''
President Clinton told reporters earlier this month, when Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo (of the PRI) paid a visit to the White
House for his 11th bilateral meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the answer is little different.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Labastida nor Fox has promised any significant departure
from policies that have led to increasingly close ties between the
United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. diplomats and senior administration officials insist
that the bricks and mortar of U.S.-Mexico relations _ NAFTA, twice
yearly cabinet-level meetings on key issues and ongoing cooperation
on more than a dozen issues ranging from narcotics trafficking and
environmental concerns to illegal border crossings and water rights
_ are strong enough to withstand an overturning of the old
political order in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty about our relationship with Mexico is that it goes
so deep, from the local, federal and regional levels,'' said Mike
Hammer, a Latin American expert with the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``A change at the top will have some effect,'' Hammer said,
``but it won't alter what's already in place.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that U.S. policymakers aren't watching
Mexico's elections closely. An overthrow of the PRI, after all,
could have potentially huge impacts on the United States, simply by
dint of the deep and wide nature of U.S.-Mexican relations.
</P>
<P>
   The ties that bind the two nations are tightly woven.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the North American Free Trade Agreement wed the
two nation's economies, two-way trade between the United States and
Mexico hit $197 billion in 1999. That accounted for nearly 10
percent of this country's total global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 60 percent of the cocaine, as well as much of the
marijuana and heroine, consumed by Americans flows into the country
through Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And American drug users pump more than $50 billion into the
narco-trade each year. Much of that winds up in Mexico, where it
stokes a ring of crime and corruption at the root of death,
destruction and the undermining of Mexican democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And, with Americans and Mexicans making 300 million legal border
crossings each year, not to mention illegal smuggling and
immigration, it's getting harder all the time to distinguish
between Mexican problems and American ills.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop of growing integration between two very
different countries that just happen to be neighbors, Mexico
analysts in this country have long regarded Mexico's one-party rule
as a mixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it's brought stability _ of a sort _ to a
country with which the United States shares a 2,000-mile-long
border.
</P>
<P>
   That's no small achievement, given the vast disparities between
the two countries, the pernicious influence of druglords in Mexico
and the history of political violence and repression across much of
Central America and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   And the PRI has provided a known entity to U.S. policymakers.
They'd had years to get to know Zedillo. A Yale-trained economist,
Zedillo had held two cabinet positions under Mexico's former PRI
leader, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, by the time Zedillo
took office in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's political predictability, though, has come at a price,
beginning, said Goodman, with a lack of imagination and energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just have one set of decision-makers, you end up in
paralysis,'' said Goodman, dean of international studies at
American University in Washington. ``That's been a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The impact has gone far beyond questions of good governance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Zedillo's efforts to root out corruption and bear down
on drug kingpins, Mexico has made little headway against violent
and well-funded druglords.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the Mexican government) has not disrupted the activities
of the major drug cartels,'' the State Department reported three
months ago in its annual review of international counter-drug
efforts. ``Chronic problems of corruption, weak police and criminal
justice institutions, budget constraints and severe poverty in
rural areas where drug crops are cultivated hamper Mexico's ability
to combat drug trafficking effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   One-party rule hasn't helped, said Leiken, author of the
forthcoming book, ``Melting Borders,'' a look at the Mexican
community in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main impediment to change, in terms of corruption, is the
lack of alternacy in power _ the kind of immunity and impunity that
that has created among important political figures,'' he explained.
``When you have a one-party system, it lends itself to that.''
</P>
<P>
   A Fox victory wouldn't wipe out Mexican corruption, certainly,
nor would it run off the druglords.
</P>
<P>
   A government shake-up would, however, present a new
administration with the necessity to start with a clean slate. At a
minimum, that would force organized crime to dance the risky ballet
involved in courting contacts in a new government.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself could be a stride in the right direction for two
countries so dependent on each other in the drug war, as in so many
other endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's certain, said Goodman, no matter who wins on July 2:
``We really need them, and they really need us.''

<P>
   Camilla Parker Bowles is playing it safe.
</P>
<P>
   The mistress of Prince Charles was expected to adopt a higher
profile following the couple's first public appearance together in
London in January 1999, and her much-publicized trip last fall to
New York, where she was feted by everyone from Brooke Astor to her
favorite decorator. Social queens were all prepared to turn Parker
Bowles and the heir to the British throne into the next hot couple
on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Well, forget it. The Prince of Wales and Parker Bowles are
continuing with the same low-key approach they adopted when they
renewed their affair 13 years ago. They're seen in public more
often and are regularly photographed by the paparazzi at the
theater or opera, two of their many mutual passions. But they
aren't about to become the next Duke and Duchess of Windsor,
grabbing social invitations wherever possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things haven't changed that much, because I don't think they
want them to change much,'' one acquaintance says, as always
insisting on anonymity. ``I don't think Camilla wants to be out on
the party circuit every night. That doesn't interest her.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the couple is aware that the mere mention of the
name Camilla still generates antagonism among a large section of
the British public.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year she was voted the person the British would
least like to spend Valentine's Day with _ along with William
Hague, the balding, shrill leader of the Conservative party.
</P>
<P>
   Unfair as it may be, Parker Bowles still gets blamed for the
breakup of the fairy-tale romance between Prince Charles and Diana,
Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and observers insist that for this reason it's unlikely
Charles, 50, and Parker Bowles, 53, will ever marry. No matter,
they essentially live together like husband and wife already.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Bowles, who doesn't bother to keep a place of her own in
London, stays at Charles' apartments in St. James's Palace, except
in hunting season, when she spends more time in the country to ride
with the Beaufort Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   If Charles has an official evening engagement in London, Parker
Bowles will invite friends to the palace for dinner or go to their
homes. Her grown children, Laura and Tom, also pop into the palace
to see their mom.
</P>
<P>
   The couple spends most weekends at Charles' Highgrove estate,
where Camilla is the undisputed hostess. She now spends little time
at her own country house, Ray Mill, 16 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Their friends remain the same as always, including the Edward
van Cutsems, the Earl and Countess of Shelburne, actor Stephen Fry
and antiques dealer Piers von Westenholz and his wife, Jane, with
whom Charles and his sons, William and Harry, recently went skiing
in Klosters, Switzerland (along with the von Westenholzes' two
beautiful teen-age daughters, Violet and Victoria).
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles and Camilla live the life they always have and the
same one as their peers _ shooting weekends, fishing weekends,
holidays structured around the school term and friends to dinner,''
a friend says. ``It's a very low-key lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike with Diana, whose every step was chronicled ad infinitum,
little of Parker Bowles' comings and goings is actually known. She
and Charles didn't go on vacation together publicly until last
summer, when they took their children on a Greek Islands cruise,
although they'd had other, more private holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Bowles regularly sees Charles' sons in the privacy of the
palace or Highgrove but has rarely been seen with them away from
home. One of the most recent times was when Harry watched her ride
with the Beaufort Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been absorbed into the family,'' a friend says. ``When
Charles and the boys are at Highgrove, or the boys are at home in
London, it's the four of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the low profile, Parker Bowles is hardly oblivious to
her public image. She and Charles are much more open about their
relationship among even casual acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more telling, Parker Bowles has become much more
conscious of her appearance, now favoring Valentino and Antony
Price, chic shoes with two-inch heels, the ubiquitous pashmina or
scarf and simple diamond jewelry, some of it presents from Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She dresses like what she is _ an affluent, well-bred,
middle-aged Englishwoman who is expected to look smart, not
fashionable,'' a friend says.
</P>
<P>
   But big questions remain. When will Parker Bowles, Charles and
the boys be seen in public as one big happy family? Will she be
invited to the Queen Mother's 100th birthday celebration in August?
And when will she be photographed with the Queen?
</P>
<P>
   Many speculate that William's 18th birthday on June 21 _ Charles
is hosting a dinner before William gets to go off with his friends
for a wilder bash _ might provide an opportunity for the young
future king and his father's paramour to be photographed together.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Queen Mother's party, observers say there's a 50-50
chance Parker Bowles will attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that Camilla decides to go on holiday with her
children,'' a friend says. ``But she could be invited. The Queen
Mother has seen her on numerous occasions. The Queen Mother dotes
on Charles.''
</P>
<P>
   The British press plays up the fact that the Queen continues to
refuse to receive Parker Bowles. But friends laugh off those
reports, slyly saying that no one really knows what the Queen does
in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Queen has known Camilla for over 30 years,'' one says.
``It's perfectly possible that she goes to see Charles at Highgrove
and Camilla is there. No one would know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, friends say, it doesn't matter whether the Queen
ever formally recognizes Parker Bowles' role in her eldest son's
life. The Prince and Parker Bowles are a couple, period.
</P>
<P>
   They no longer skulk about and, most important, they're no
longer desperately seeking public approval of their union.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the feeling that they've done what they can to make
people view them as normally as possible,'' a friend says. ``Now
they're just going to let things take their course.'' &QL;

   Confession No. 2: My knowledge of today's obstreperous rock
music world is extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
   (Parenthetical Confession No. 3: My music appreciation lapsed
with the deaths of George Gershwin and Cole Porter, and is only
occasionally revived through something done by Andrew Lloyd
Webber.)
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Hall's fame, I have read, is that she is the ex-wife of
rocker Mick Jagger and is a model. I assume that although it was
not mentioned, Ms. Hall also is an actress; why else would she have
been chosen to replace Kathleen Turner beginning July 31 in the
London production of ``The Graduate''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe because she's agreed to do a nude scene. You don't
have to be much of an actress to stand on stage in your
all-together, just uninhibited.
</P>
<P>
   I saw Ms. Turner last month in the London play at the Gielgud
Theater. I didn't think she was so hot _ either as an actress or as
a nude.
</P>
<P>
   When the great actor Sir John Gielgud died several weeks ago, I
attributed it, in addition to his advanced age, to the fact that
this fatuous scene was being put on in the West End theater named
in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Graduate,'' an acclaimed 1967 film with no nude scene has
been resurrected as a fast-paced stage comedy _ with nudity. It has
been playing to sellout audiences since it opened in April,
principally because the 45-year-old Turner spends 20 seconds
catching the London evening chill on stage -- in the shadows, I
might add.
</P>
<P>
   This is a shame because, to me, the play would have been an
artistic success without the nude scene, and without Turner as the
carnal Mrs. Robinson. Nevertheless, the nudity has been selling the
tickets, getting the headlines and will be continued by the
43-year-old Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The scene could be done in a full slip and be just as funny.
Yes, it's a funny scene, thanks to the antics of the young,
mortified-by-middle-aged-nudity male lead Matthew Rhys. But that
apparently is not what sells tickets.
</P>
<P>
   What is marketable is what is acceptable these days. If the
public fills the house because there's a nude scene and only
two-thirds fill it without one, the nude scene prevails.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite similar to how other domains are being marketed. A
Time Magazine writer, James Poniewozik, recently reported his
earlier firing by an online publication was because of something
called ``page views.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Poniewozik, the tenure of writers and the judgment
of material is based on how many ``hits'' or ``page views''
articles receive on the Web. If an online publication posts, say,
five stories -- ranging from 10 Ways to Please Your Spouse in Bed
to How to Improve Your Child's Reading Skills and there is a
predominance of ``hits'' on the sex story, then future stories will
deal more with that area, and writers will be judged (and employed)
based on what kind of stories they bring in. (''Another education
piece, Faversham, and you're fired!'')
</P>
<P>
   How much stronger would be sales for ``The Taming of the Shrew''
might we had been able to see Petruchio peel Katharina on the night
of her ultimate submission?
</P>
<P>
   I wonder had Hall held out to do her scene with some manner of
attire whether the producers would have accepted her, and whether
ticket sales would have dropped. We're not going to know, at least
not until the initial reviews of her ``appearance'' hit the London
tabloids at the first of August.
</P>
<P>
   Likely, it will be similar to that of Turner in April, when a
London tabloid began: ``Kathleen Turner, the Hollywood film star
who started off in Body Heat and has never lost the art of sexual
provocation, made an absolutely sensational London stage debut last
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, it referred to her wafting around the stage clad in
little more than sex appeal. In the film ``The Graduate,'' Anne
Bancroft was cited for her acting ability. (And Mike Nichols got an
Oscar for direction.) That's the difference between then and now. I
expect Jerry Hall to emulate Turner rather than Bancroft. That's
probably why the house will continue to be sold out.
</P>
<P>
   And so you should ask, why did I buy tickets to see Kathleen
Turner? Good question. Hypocritical prurient interest, I guess,
just like everyone else.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: IS IT DUMB TO SHUN SMART CARDS?
 &HT;    Moving in the (k) commentary and (f) financial categories.

   WASHINGTON _ Folks stare when I enter or leave Washington's
Metro system without breaking stride. The gates swing open because
I carry a broadcast-type smart card with an antenna and a memory
bank that debits the fare.
</P>
<P>
   Recent advances in miniature radio technology make it possible
for people to have similar smart cards that embed their medical and
insurance history on a chip. The medical card could then be
``read'' when you visited your doctor's office or a hospital
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   You could carry other ``proximity cards'' programmed to open
office doors, feed parking meters, pay expressway tolls or grocery
bills, trigger calls at pay phones, check out library books, or
enable automatic teller machines worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, if this comes to pass, you might get the feeling
that you were packing too many smart cards. A technically feasible
solution would be to acquire just one super-smart card chock full
of essential and occasional services for both work and play.
</P>
<P>
   But what if such an omnibus device were to be lost or stolen?
Wouldn't such an event lift the chilling prospect of ``identify
theft'' to a fearsome level?
</P>
<P>
   Once again, 21st century technology has answers. Cards can be
programmed to respond to a secure biometric identification system,
like a fingerprint, a unique speech pattern or even the retinas of
your eyes. Any attempt to monkey around with security codes would
cause the cards to self-destruct while sending an alarm.
</P>
<P>
   So, if these new smart cards are all so great, why haven't they
become an integral part of our digital culture?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that even smart technologies often need lots of
incubation time. The Washington Metro card, for example, is still
being used sparingly, although it will also soon be available to
riders on the London Underground and in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper reason is that a technology that lets you store your
full-blown identity on a microchip smacks of a universal
identification system spawned by an Orwellian Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Some totalitarian states require internal passports. But a
democratic society has yet to successfully implement a national
identity system. The Australian government tried it in 1987, and
the South Koreans tried it a decade later. Both attempts failed
after triggering widescale protests by privacy-minded critics.
</P>
<P>
   That's why universal smart cards, while clearly beneficial,
should always remain as a voluntary contract between the issuing
authority and the individual user. As a practical matter, the most
likely path that such smart cards will take in the new economy is
through successive upgrades of the 1.75 billion credit cards that
have already issued by Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
</P>
<P>
   If government has a role, it is to ensure that the huge body of
individual and collective data that smart cards can generate about
personal aspects of our lives are not abused by predatory
commercial ventures or by the government itself.

 &HT;    Death penalty on trial
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When several Black Panthers showed up with assault rifles
outside the Republican convention in Houston last Friday, someone
with a perverse sense of humor could have described it as a
gun-rights demonstration. Or a right-to-life rally.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the gun-toters were there protesting the scheduled
execution of Gary Graham, who now goes by the name of Shaka
Sankofa.
</P>
<P>
   The guys were scary looking, but the Houston cops didn't seem
fazed. They seemed to realize it was a way to get on television.
</P>
<P>
   And it worked. Some news folks otherwise wouldn't have shown up
_ certainly not in helicopters, which hovered like hummingbirds _
and other TV newsfolks shifted their focus from the ho-hum dealings
inside the convention hall to the dramatic video outside.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush's run for the presidency is putting
Texas' death penalty on trial. And the convention to celebrate
Bush's choice to carry the national GOP banner provided a
made-to-order backdrop for the execution protests.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, with Texas Senate President Pro Tem Rodney
Ellis of Houston sitting in the governor's chair because Bush was
out of state campaigning and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry was in Europe,
Bush acquiesced to demands that Ricky McGinn's execution be
postponed for 30 days for new DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case had requested the new test. And even
though the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and the Board of Pardons
and Paroles turned down the appeal on divided votes, Bush _ who has
maintained that all of the 134 convicts put to death on his watch
were guilty _ said if DNA evidence can prove guilt or innocence of
a person on death row, ``we need to use it.'' Texas is no
namby-pamby, hand-wringing state when it comes to the ultimate
penalty. The state gained worldwide publicity during the nasty
gubernatorial campaign of 1990 between former Gov. Mark White,
then-Attorney General Jim Mattox and then-Treasurer Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   What got the publicity was an ad, produced by Ray Strother, that
had White ominously walking past a series of huge pictures of
convicts who had been executed while he'd been governor. What
precipitated it had been Mattox's talking about attending
executions as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   And these were Democrats _ who are less likely to support the
death penalty. A February 1999 Texas Poll showed 88 percent of
Republicans favor the death penalty, compared with 65 percent of
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gary Graham case, the lone witness on whose
identification Graham's conviction rested broke many years of
silence last week to reiterate that she is positive Graham was the
man who gunned down businessman Bobby Lambert outside a grocery
store.
</P>
<P>
   But those protesting Graham's execution say:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  She was the only one of six witnesses who identified Graham.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Graham's trial attorney, who presented no defense for his
client, failed to call the other five.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Graham's four alibi witnesses were never called.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ballistics tests did not match a gun Graham was carrying
when arrested.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lambert's widow has asked that Graham not be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Whether one agrees with the death penalty or not, Graham's case
underlines yet again larger questions about whether it is fairly
applied in Texas and whether defendants are afforded adequate legal
representation.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is being discussed in Congress from both sides of
the aisle that would expand rights of the accused to DNA testing.
Another bill with sponsors from both parties would increase money
to states to hire defense lawyers for poor defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, perhaps the question to be asked of Gov. Bush is not
whether he is convinced Graham is guilty. Graham may well be.
</P>
<P>
   The question should be, ``If you were accused of a murder, your
defense attorney had failed to bring forth the information listed
above, but you were still being denied a new trial and were going
to die, how would you feel?''

 &HT;    Before it's over, insects are going to rule
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Lord, the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one good thing about a drought, which doesn't
outweigh the harm it causes in lost crops, dying lawns and trees,
hungry livestock and a general pessimistic attitude among people
used to seeing the clouds open on a regular basis: There are fewer
bugs.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know for sure if the drought is over here behind the
Pine Curtain, but my rain gauge has measured more than six inches
through the first half of this month, and annual rainfall is back
to average for the first time in three years. It's rained so much
that a perfectly healthy oak tree in my backyard toppled over from
the roots and crashed through my neighbor's fence last week, the
victim not of drought but of saturated ground.
</P>
<P>
   My wife does not understand this rain-gauge thing. Men run down
to the Big Discount Store and buy a rain gauge first thing when
they move into a new house. They tack it up on the fence and
religiously slog through the muck to see how much it rained. As if
it matters, she says. But it does matter, though only in the sense
of being a topic of conversation, not something about which one
actually has any control. Still, you stick a menagerie of men in a
room after a rain, and the first topic of conversation will be:
</P>
<P>
   ``I got six-tenths of an inch out at my place last night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really! I only got a tenth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, I got nearly two inches. Nearly lost the dachsund out
there trying to take his evening constitutional. Little fella was
dog-paddlin' for all he was worth.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what we men do: Keep track of Mother Nature's vagaries.
Rain gauges are cheap entertainment, rarely costing more than $3,
about the price of a bodice-ripping video rental, not that I have
anything against bodice ripping.
</P>
<P>
   With the rain and constant warm weather brought about by too
many unmufflered autos burning a hole in the ozone layer, comes the
bugs. (Anybody who doesn't believe in global warming hasn't lived
in the South, where winter has become a season completed at most in
a long weekend. It used to at last at least a week.)
</P>
<P>
   Being the month of the summer solstice, the June bugs, those
pesky Yankee beetles, are in full force, gleefully committing
suicide in such innovative ways as:
</P>
<P>
   Kamakazi-bombing into one's mouth as it cracks open for a gulp
of a favorite libation.
</P>
<P>
   Ingratiating themselves between your eyeball and your glasses
until you make an appointment for lasik surgery just to prevent
such episodes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Or inserting themselves further inside your ear canal further
than deemed safe by the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants are in their heyday. These are the bugs from hell.
Nothing kills them, I believe. I have tried every chemical known to
man, and after years of scientific experimentation have concluded
that:
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals on the market are designed to force fire ants to get
stoned, have a party, trash out their present mound and move five
feet away a few days later. Sort of like college students.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to have even a semblance of control over fireants
is to vary the treatment, using Amdro one week, Dursban the next,
boiling water on the third week, maybe Agent Orange on the fourth,
and my favorite _ setting the lawn mower blade low and scalping the
little demons _ the next. If you're not much into owning a lawn
that looks like the 16th fairway at Pebble Beach, a bit of kerosene
and a match will do wonders for your psyche if not for your
landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   A word to the wise. Don't use gasoline. It's tempting but
dangerous. I speak from experience, having once doused a large
mound in a pasture and then set it on fire using a piece of rope
soaked in lighter fluid. I never realized that dirt would burn, or
leave such a large hole. For a few minutes, I thought I had created
a new eternal torch.
</P>
<P>
   Boiling water is significantly less flammable but a lot more
trouble. Hauling buckets from the stove to the yard is a pain, and
there's that risk factor again if you stumble.
</P>
<P>
   The only effective deterrent against mosquitoes I've found is
cigar smoke. The cheaper the cigar, the better. Forget bug zappers,
which provide great entertainment but only attract the bugs, since
of course they enjoy light. ``Off'' may work but smells bad and
feels yucky. A Prince Edwards cigar, or better yet a Swisher Sweet
will keep mosquitoes and all other living creatures away, including
your wife.
</P>
<P>
   You could always just stay inside, but where' s the fun in that?
Besides, don't forget about the fleas, flies and those water bugs
big as squirrels, all of whom just love air-conditioning.

 &HT;    Once again Texas prisons are bursting at the seams
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ An article in The Wall Street Journal offers some
unsettling news about Texas prisons. The Texas Department of
Criminal Justice is already out of room and there will be at least
3,500 more inmates than beds in state prisons by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gov. Ann Richards, the state jumped headlong into a
prison-building program that cost $1.7 billion. But now, even with
a capacity of 152,000 beds, the prison system is bursting at its
seams. Estimates are that by 2005 the state will be renting space
in county jails for an additional 14,000 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by the Criminal Justice Policy Council,
the state agency that tracks prison populations, the reason behind
the burgeoning inmate population is that the state is allowing
fewer paroles and inmates are serving longer sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The agency says short of building yet more prisons, the state
could at least slow down the growing inmate numbers by reducing
prison time for nonviolent criminals and sending parolees who
violate minor rules to halfway houses instead of prison.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way to run a prison system?
</P>
<P>
   Even Gov. George Bush's efforts to keep Death Row cleaned out
can't keep up with what is a tidal wave of offenders flowing into
the prison system.
</P>
<P>
   While building more prisons takes care of the situation for a
few short years, the state and the taxpayers cannot continue to
foot the bill on a problem that goes much deeper than merely
finding enough beds for lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have the answers, but it is not so farfetched to
imagine that at some point, the best solution will be to build a
wall around the state and for those of us not yet convicted to get
out.

IBM CREATES 1-GB MINIATURE HARD DRIVE FOR POCKET PCS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plunging deeply into the world of pocket-sized personal
computing, IBM on Tuesday will introduce a version of its tiny
Microdrive hard drive with a storage capacity of 1 billion bytes of
information.
</P>
<P>
   The new drive, which is the size of a book of matches, is a
milestone in the evolution of magnetic storage, IBM executives
said, because it surpasses the same 1-gigabyte barrier the
company's original refrigerator-sized 3380 hard drive surmounted in
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller size and accelerating density of magnetic storage
systems is one of the remarkable stories of Silicon Valley. Disk
storage is now increasing at a rate faster than the legendary
Moore's Law improvement rate of the semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors
that can be squeezed onto a silicon chip doubles roughly every 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   When the first 340-megabyte Microdrive was introduced a year
ago, it had a storage density of 5.04 billion bits per square inch.
The current drive, which will ship commercially in September, has
increased that density to 15.2 billion bits per square inch. The
higher density means the tiny new drive is within 10 percent of the
most advanced IBM storage products now on the market, said John
Osterhout, the marketing director for IBM's storage business.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that it expects about one-third of the market
for the new drives to be as storage devices for digital cameras. A
1-GB drive, which fits in the same storage slot as a flash memory
card, could hold up to 1,000 high-resolution photographs, a
thousand 200-page novels, or nearly 10 hours of high-quality
digital audio music, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that another third of the market will be as a
backup and data-transfer medium for notebook and desktop computers.
But in the future the company is most interested in an array of new
markets based on hand-held computing devices, like personal digital
assistants and advanced digital cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of IBM Monday rose $6.375, to $120.125 .
</P>
<P>
   To make its disk drives more attractive for the coming market in
wearable computers, IBM said it had increased the shock resistance
of the newest generation Microdrive, which will sell for $499, to
the ability to withstand a 1500-G shock. That is the equivalent to
a drop from a normal office desk onto a medium thickness carpet,
Osterhout said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has added tiny rubber bumpers to the corners of its newest
drives to add to their reliability.
</P>
<P>
   One company that has already built a version of a tiny personal
computer based around the Microdrive is Tiqit Computers, a Palo
Alto, Calif., company started by Vaughan Pratt, a Stanford computer
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes a palm-sized computer that it advertises as
the world's smallest system that can run operating systems such as
Windows 95, Windows NT and Linux. The tiny computer, which
currently has 486-class processor manufactured by Advanced Micro
Devices, is 5 cubic inches and weighs 3.3 ounces. The Tiqit
Matchbox PC is priced at $1,495.

ON THE WEB, ONE STOP FOR DEATH SERVICES  
 WEB SITE CHALLENGES CHAT-ROOM STATUS QUO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the Web portal to the great beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to heavenlydoor.com! Find a funeral home or cemetery
near you!'' reads the greeting on the home page of
HeavenlyDoor.com, which has been busily signing deals to offer
one-stop shopping for a complete line of death-related services.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week it announced deals with SympathyFlowers.com;
Classicmemorials.com; Mooney &AMP; Co., a provider of sympathy and
cremation cards; and the Funeral Fine Art Collection, which
according to the news release offers ``high-end urns.''
</P>
<P>
   The deals enable the partners to sell their wares on
HeavenlyDoor.com's site, in exchange for up to 40 percent of the
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The company was formed in November and went public in January,
and so far it has mainly offered a free online service linking
people who want to plan funerals _ in many cases, years before
anyone actually dies _ with one of the 100 funeral homes it has
signed up as members.
</P>
<P>
   But as last week's deals indicate, the company is expanding into
transactions. Helen Maynard, HeavenlyDoor's senior vice president,
said the company was discussing similar arrangements with insurance
companies, airlines and hotels. Starting in September, the company
plans to offer Heavenly Store, an online supermarket of
funeral-related services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious jewelry, ash-scattering services _ there are just so
many facets of the funeral industry that people don't automatically
think of on their own,'' Maynard said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a business-to-business play in the works, too. By
autumn, HeavenlyDoor hopes to have an electronic marketplace up and
running that will hook funeral homes up with makers of caskets and
embalming fluids and with other vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard said HeavenlyDoor.com planned to negotiate discount
contracts for its funeral-director members and hoped to make money
in transaction fees.

   Web Site Challenges Chat-Room Status Quo
</P>
<P>
   Few marketing gimmicks challenge the status quo as much as
im-ur.com, the brainchild of Jonathan Shem-Ur, an Israeli former
journalist turned Web entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist on the traditional chat room, Shem-Ur is producing a
site with 4,000 discussion areas, sections where anybody can post
opinions, offer advice and engage in debate on assorted subjects.
Every day the comments posted in each area are displayed in the
format of a newspaper's editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   The more an opinion is read, the more prominently the opinion is
displayed in the daily forum.
</P>
<P>
   The site also takes an unusual approach to advertising:
Participants will see ads only if they want to, rather than being
barraged with banner ads on every page. To view an ad, the reader
clicks on a ``relevant ads'' logo.
</P>
<P>
   The site officially started last week, but without advertising
at first. The company said it wanted to build its audience before
trying to sell ads. Shem-Ur says he wants to turn the Web into a
great town square, much like an ancient Greek agora, where people
can air their opinions freely. He said the standard Internet chat
room, plastered with banner ads, was too chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   For a celebrity spokesman, Shem-Ur has hired Judge Joseph
Wapner, formerly of television's ``The People's Court,'' who is now
wielding the gavel on ``Judge Wapner's Animal Court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could always have your say in my court,'' Wapner said in a
statement released by the company. ``And that's what im-ur.com is
all about _ having your say.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Will advertisers agree to have their say the
im-ur way?

A COMPLETE FINANCIAL PICTURE ON ONE SITE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATRICK MCGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Banks and brokerage firms are racing to offer the newest new
thing in online financial services: a single place where customers
can find up-to-date information about all of their accounts at a
range of institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, big financial firms saw this innovation,
known as account aggregation, as a threat to their customers'
privacy and financial security. But now, fearing an onslaught of
competition on the Internet, they are embracing it as a convenience
for customers and a powerful tool for building their own business.
Instead of warning against the service, banks are now telling their
customers to be wary of obtaining such services from anyone but
them.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Bank, hoping to get a head start on its
traditional competitors, is expected to announce Monday that it is
teaming up with a year-old Internet-based company called Yodlee.com
to introduce free account-aggregation services later this year for
Chase's 30 million online customers. Other major banks and
brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and the PaineWebber
Group, are considering offering similar services through Yodlee or
one of about a dozen other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new services are expected to be free to consumers,
at least initially.
</P>
<P>
   These firms are reacting to the Internet-based businesses that
are offering account aggregation with the hope of serving as a
financial home page for consumers. Ameritrade Holdings, which
operates a popular online brokerage, has been offering account
aggregation at its Onmoney.com site on the Web, and earlier this
month, America Online announced an alliance with Yodlee to provide
a similar service for AOL's 22 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, fewer than 300,000 people have registered for account
aggregation, which compiles a variety of information from different
sources, from savings and checking balances at a bank to the value
of stocks and bonds in brokerage accounts to the frequent-flier
miles customers have accumulated with airlines. But financial
industry executives predict that many more people will sign up for
the service as major firms demonstrate their acceptance of the
technology behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Using a process known as ``screen scraping,'' companies like
Yodlee gain electronic access, usually overnight, to their
customers' accounts at various financial institutions and download
them into a central file. In the morning, a user can log in and get
a current snapshot of her finances on one computer screen, or even
on the screen of a hand-held device like a Palm Pilot or a wireless
phone.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off for that convenience is that customers must
surrender the electronic passwords to all of their financial
accounts. That is an exchange that some privacy advocates warn
against. Even purveyors of the service acknowledge that most people
are uneasy about disclosing that information, especially to a
company they had never heard of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing for someone to go to a start-up with an unusual
name like Yodlee and ask them to keep all of their personal
financial data,'' said Anil Arora, chief executive of Yodlee, based
in Sunnyvale, Calif. ``It's another thing to go to a company like
Chase that you already use as your primary financial company.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Zimmerman, a senior vice president of Chase, said that in
a survey, about 45 percent of consumers said they would use an
account-aggregation service if it were provided by a financial
institution they trusted. ``We know that not everyone is going to
use this tomorrow, but we think customers want this service and the
time is right for us to take a leadership position in offering
it,'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Account aggregation could prove very valuable to banks like
Chase. Financial institutions want a complete picture of their
customers' finances. They want to know what assets _ and debts _
their customers have elsewhere, both to protect themselves and to
create opportunities to sell more products, like credit cards,
loans and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   When its customers start using account aggregation, Chase will
get a peek at their outside holdings, like a brokerage account at
Merrill Lynch or use of an American Express card, and will be able
to use that information to create solicitations to them. Chase will
apply its own standards for privacy and security to the service,
even though it will be operated by Yodlee, Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   If customers do not want to receive pitches for credit cards or
other products, he said, they can choose to be removed from mailing
and calling lists. ``You have the right at any point to say, `Do
not call me, do not make me an offer,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial industry executives say that using account
aggregation as a tool for aggressive cross-selling could backfire.
``The firms that approach it that way are going to lose,'' said
Marten Hoekstra, director of marketing at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, financial firms should treat account aggregation as a
necessary convenience that all customers will soon demand and as a
critical offering to cement relationships with customers, he said.
Within a few years, brokerage firms will be using this innovation
to offer to advise customers on the management of all of their
assets, whether they are held in banks or at competing brokerages,
Hoekstra said.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber is negotiating with Yodlee and several of its
competitors, but it has not settled on a partner for the account
aggregation services it plans to offer because the technology has
not been perfected, Hoekstra said. ``It's a must-do as soon as it's
reliable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch already offers an early version of account
aggregation, for a monthly fee, to its wealthiest customers, those
with at least $5 million invested at the firm, through Greentrak, a
small, private company in New Rochelle, N.Y. The new management
team for Merrill's brokerage operation is considering whether to
offer a simpler form of account aggregation, through an
Internet-based service like Yodlee's, to all of its customers,
according to people at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who's in the financial services area wants to try to
own the total financial relationship with clients,'' said Lon
Massingil, executive vice president of Greentrak. ``That's the race
that's going on now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As Microsoft prepares to announce its Next
Generation Windows Services initiative this week, an influential
computer scientist is circulating a thesis that challenges Bill
Gates' vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Microsoft Corp. plans to describe its most
radically new computing strategy since December 1995, when Gates,
the Microsoft chairman, announced the ``embrace and extend''
strategy to expand the company's dominance of desktop computing to
include the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will now push to shift the locus of computing off the
desktop altogether _ and out into a ``cloud'' of large server
computers located on the Internet. But the goal is the same as the
one laid out five years ago: maintaining a central role for
Microsoft's software.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, an influential critic is arguing that
Microsoft's new strategy may be a defensive plan that misjudges the
computer industry's future direction, that rather than moving to an
increasingly Web-centric model, computing is instead becoming
decentralized, with the key information distributed among millions
of desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds as if Microsoft is scared and defensive,'' the
critic, David Gelernter, said in a telephone interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has based its reputation on refusing to lead and
always following, and once again they're behind the wave here,''
said Gelernter, a respected Yale University computer scientist.
``More and more people are coming to understand that the power of
desktop machines is enormous and is largely wasted when you spend
your time browsing on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelernter's argument is spelled out in ``The Second Coming _ a
Manifesto,'' an essay published last week in the German newspaper
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and posted on the Edge, a
technology forum on the Web (www.edge.org).
</P>
<P>
   Gelernter's critique has some influential supporters, including
Danny Hillis, a computer scientist who recently left Walt Disney's
Imagineering research group to form a new company, Applied Minds;
David Ditzel, a computer designer who is the founder of Transmeta
Inc., a Silicon Valley microprocessor company; and Rodney Brooks,
director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's criticisms of our current computing environments are
eloquently stated, and I think widely shared,'' Brooks wrote in a
recent comment posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's head of research, Rick Rashid, countered that
Gelernter was taking an academic, long-term view of computing that
might have little relevance for the current software market. ``It's
fairly predictable that David would be saying this,'' said Rashid,
a Microsoft senior vice president. ``This has been his mantra
throughout his career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Second Coming,'' a 10,000-word essay, contends that rather
than remaining a world that Microsoft or any company might
dominate, computing is actually shifting to a world in which data
and computer processing will be increasingly spread across
thousands, if not millions, of interconnected computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information travels through a sea of anonymous,
interchangeable computers like a breeze through tall grass,''
Gelernter wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Rashid said Gelernter's criticism did not reflect the degree
to which data was already being distributed across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's already happening,'' Rashid said. ``There is already a
sea of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has pointed to Passport, a current e-commerce service
offered by the company, as the best example of what the Next
Generation Windows Services architecture will be like. Passport, a
program that verifies the identities of computer users when they
surf to a new site, is a clear example of the way data is now
flowing through the Internet between computers that are only
loosely coupled, Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passport actually encompasses a huge amount of distributed
computing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Gelernter's vision of a distributed computing
future is likely to be an accurate in the long term. He noted that
there had been a long tug-of-war between the ideas of centralized
and decentralized computing.
</P>
<P>
   Gelernter, who was seriously injured in 1993 by a mail bomb from
the so-called Unabomber, is a well-known computer scientist. His
credentials include his 1991 book ``Mirror Worlds,'' which forecast
the arrival of the World Wide Web and described a future in which
computing would make it possible to simulate virtually any aspect
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   As a software designer during the 1980s, Gelernter developed a
programming language known as Linda that was designed to spread
computations across hundreds of thousands of computers, harnessing
them into one distributed machine. Similar systems are now common
in the world of supercomputing.
</P>
<P>
   But distributed computing has been slow to arrive in the
mainstream computing world, and Gelernter places the blame for the
lack of innovation to a great extent on the absence of a new
computing vision from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that Microsoft's Windows 98 and Windows 2000
software is derived from the Apple Macintosh and the Unix operating
systems, which he derides as fragile, decades-old technologies that
lock away much of the power of computing from nonexpert users.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the bulliest pulpit in the world,'' Gelernter said
of Microsoft, ``but what have they done with it?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the features most responsible for America Online's
success has been the buddy list _ the small box on the computer
screen showing a user which friends are logged on and available for
an instant online conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is testing the power of buddyship even more.
Monday it will introduce AOLTV, the centerpiece of the company's
AOL Anywhere strategy to move beyond the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   AOLTV, like Microsoft's WebTV, is a black box enabling people to
surf the Internet on their television screens. But with only 1
million subscribers after three years, Web TV has been a
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   So AOLTV, in contrast, is being marketed for its use to existing
America Online members who want to keep access to their e-mail,
chat rooms and buddy list while watching television.
</P>
<P>
   Push one button on the AOLTV wireless keyboard, and the same
buddy-list window from the PC-based service will appear in
translucent letters over the television image. One more click can
start a chat with someone, whether they are on AOLTV or on their
computer, or soon, on their AOL-enabled cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Want new friends? Push a different button, and you're in a chat
room with people watching the same show. The TV image, reduced,
remains in a corner of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   America Online says that many people have computers in their
family rooms so they can chat while watching television, and AOLTV
will make this easier.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also gambling that prospective customers are willing
to pay $249 for a set-top box, made by Philips, and connect it to
the cable box and the video recorder, as well as to a phone line.
Subscribers will also have to pay an additional $15 a month if they
are already AOL members or $26 a month if they are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of a stretch that chat and instant messaging will
drive all these people to attach another box to their television
set, said Josh Bernoff, an interactive-television analyst with
Forrester Research. ``Fifteen dollars is a lot of money, plus it
uses another phone line, and the value people are getting is
relatively low.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Schuler, the president of AOL's interactive services, is
unapologetic about the price. ``AOL is a premium product,'' he
said. ``We don't sell AOL on price.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuler said he expects it to catch on with consumers slowly,
selling a few hundred thousand units in the first year. ``If you
look at the history of consumer electronics, it takes 10 years for
a new platform to become established,'' he said. ``If this category
was started with WebTV, we're only two years in.''
</P>
<P>
   And he acknowledges that there are better ways to deliver this
service than by putting another black box on top of the television
set. AOL has already announced a deal to combine AOLTV with the
TiVo video recorder and another to incorporate it into the set-top
box used to decode the DirecTV satellite system.
</P>
<P>
   With America Online buying Time Warner, there are plans for a
version built into that company's cable television boxes. Cable,
but not satellite, offers the advantage of two-way communication,
eliminating the need for another phone line.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, AOL will simply try to sell the existing
Philips box through Time Warner's cable unit.
</P>
<P>
   But Schuler says that even the current configuration will have a
following among families where several children have developed the
habit of chatting online with their friends so much that fights
erupt over access to the computer. For the more affluent of these
households, he reckons, an additional phone line and the AOLTV
service may be a better way to keep the peace than buying another
computer.
</P>
<P>
   With the audience likely to be small for the foreseeable future,
America Online has not sold any advertising yet, but it has built
in lots of potential for commerce. There is a shopping channel.
There is the ability for broadcast networks to add shopping content
to their programs, splitting revenue with America Online. (Click to
buy Oprah's book club selection, for example.) And ads are
sprinkled through an elaborate, searchable on-screen program guide.
America Online figures the biggest buyer will be TV networks trying
to attract viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also created ``channels'' on sports, weather and
news that mix text information, advertising, and a small video
window. It plans to auction off the rights to television networks
to be the featured program.

HUMAN GENOME TREASURE MAP POINTS THE WAY TO DNA GOLD
</HEADLINE>

 By TIM RACE   
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon, perhaps within days, researchers expect to announce
completion of the decadelong project to map the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   If you hadn't already been paying attention, both Business Week
and The New Yorker recently produced major articles on J. Craig
Venter, the scientist-entrepreneur who broke from the public
science orthodoxy a few years ago and started a commercial race to
finish the treasure map. (Business Week, in its captain-of-industry
feature, declared a ``genome gold rush'' and explained its election
of Venter to cover-photo status this way: ``Well, Craig, you've
earned it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Whether Venter's enterprise, the Celera Genomics group of PE
Corp., finishes first, or whether the $3 billion publicly financed,
international Human Genome Project somehow wins at the wire,
completion will be a significant milestone _ not only for molecular
biology, but for computer science. And for business, of course.
Stand by for the New Genomics to become the next big thing in the
New Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by extensive computer processing power, the genome
researchers have been engaged in what is essentially a giant
software project. Sequencing the human genome, as the task is
known, involves sifting through the 3 billion units of DNA at the
heart of every human cell to identify the 80,000 or so genes that
define all inheritable physical and behavioral traits. This
identification process is not the same as decoding, however. For
even after all those genes have been identified, each one still
needs to be translated to determine its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Think of each gene as a snatch of encrypted software _ a set of
instructions that tells cells which proteins to produce in order to
make, repair or regulate some part of the human body. To
researchers, each gene initially seems like a piece of encrypted
e-mail. Simply knowing that there's a gene in the In Box isn't
enough; somebody has to unscramble the code to understand what the
gene actually means.
</P>
<P>
   So this first phase is only a starting point. But eventually,
sequencing the human genome is expected to give medical researchers
the knowledge to devise new techniques for diagnosing, treating and
even preventing all sorts of diseases in which genetic differences
play a role _ whether purely physical afflictions like cancer or
mentally manifested ones like schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some useful data has emerged from this effort, as the
mappers have published various gene sequences _ the coded text of
individual genes. An early leader in translating genomic data into
actual drugs is Human Genome Sciences, a Rockville, Md., company
that is currently in human trials with two gene-based therapies.
One is meant to protect the body's blood-forming cells during
cancer chemotherapy; the other is being tested as a wound-healing
agent.
</P>
<P>
   How soon these, or other gene therapies, might reach the market
is hard to predict. But the business and investment worlds, eager
to find the next hot market, are prepared to celebrate the gene
kings in the same way they've feted the Internet titans.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that the chairman and chief executive of
Human Genome Sciences, William A. Haseltine, recently shared a
stage with Steve Case, chairman of America Online, at a dinner held
by the prestigious Economic Club of New York. The organizers,
presumably, have already figured out that the New Economics and the
New Genomics are adjacent steps on technology's ever-ascending
spiral staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine allowed as much. After Case delivered a speech about
the Net as ``a massive social phenomenon,'' Haseltine took the
podium and said, ``I couldn't do the work I do today without the
advances that have been made in computation.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Haseltine, speaking without notes, laid out a number of
issues in genomics that _ even if he didn't explicitly draw the
parallels _ have their computing and Internet counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the harnessing of genes and proteins as a new
medicine, whose benefits he described in new-economic terms as ``a
new and scalable form of productivity.'' He spoke of the
public-policy goal of ensuring ``uniform access to the new
medicine,'' a phrase that echoes the goals of advocates who seek
equal Internet access for all.
</P>
<P>
   And, making clear that whether the code is digital or genetic,
business is business, Haseltine argued that ``protection of
intellectual property in its multiple forms is crucial.'' In this
newest chapter of the Information Age, the data continues to have
intrinsic value.
</P>
<P>
   A reason Venter and Celera hurried to complete their own human
genome database was so they could sell that information to other
researchers. Likewise, Haseltine, a former business partner of
Venter's, has sought to stake a commercial claim by patenting his
company's gene work. So far, Human Genome Sciences has applied for
more than 7,500 human-gene patents and has been granted more than
130.
</P>
<P>
   To his Economic Club audience, Haseltine patiently explained
that gene patents make no ownership claim on each individual's
personal DNA chemistry. The patents, he said, cover only specific,
applied knowledge about human genes. He said such knowledge
resulted from considerable money and effort, which would not be
expended without the lure of a commercial payoff.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounded reasonable. And it sounded like the same
capitalism that has long driven advances in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Haseltine addressed the Economic Club only a few
hours after a federal judge ordered the breakup of Microsoft. Is it
irony, or symmetry, that genomics is reaching its big milestone at
the same historic moment that the government wants to break up the
world's most powerful software company?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is being censured for the way it has wielded market
power over the desktop operating system. Will some other company,
someday, be investigated for its market power over the genome _ the
basic human operating system?
</P>
<P>
   The one certainty is that the gold rush is on. Business Week
says so. And now, any Nasdaq investor who saw selling pet food over
the Internet as the apotheosis of technology should get ready: Be
prepared to gaze in slack-jawed wonder at what computers and DNA
software compilers are about to let us in for.

 &HT;    Send audio e-mail files to friends
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to send a voice message as a .wav file via e-mail. I
have a PowerMac G4. Can you tell me how to record one?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mrs. J. L. Ricketson, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Many people are into sending their voices through the
Internet these days. Simple audio files seem to be an easy way to
pop off a quick message to a friend. I've seen a few of the
Internet postcard sites. They make it easy to send along a voice
message with your virtual card.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You can really get into this audio stuff. There are all
kinds of file types, different ways to record voice, music and
more. You can also convert files to the format you desire, and you
can create lists of audio that can be digitally altered to your
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: OK, OK. Let's keep it simple. So, you wanna say ``hey'' to
your friend? A WAV (pronounced ``wave'') file is an uncompressed
computer recording. It can be heard by anyone using a Mac or PC. I
downloaded Ultra Recorder 2.4.1 (members.aol.com/ejc3/Ultra.html).
It's a Mac shareware application ($20). I also tested SoundBuilder
2.0.3 (freeware from MacWorld downloads). Both of these apps let
you record your voice quickly and easily. Once you record your file
with a standard microphone, it's a no-brainer to convert it to
Windows WAV and send it to a PC friend.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Yeah, I created several little annoying voice WAV files
within seconds. I told jokes, said ``hi'' and made weird little
noises.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I have a beautiful new background on my desktop, but I can't see
it because of all the icons. How can I remove icons from the
desktop? I still want the programs. I'll just go to ``Programs'' to
get them. I can't seem to find the answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ April Cleman
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Sounds like you need to do a little spring cleaning and
organizing. It can be confusing and scary if you do not know what's
what on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: I'm the resident expert on how to manage a messy desktop.
I haven't seen my desktop picture in years. In order for me to find
files, I close my eyes and play pin-the-tail on the computer
screen. One thing I have learned on a Mac is that your desktop can
take a hike (become corrupt) and you can lose all your data. I'm
still recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Some people will never learn. An easy way to deal with this
is to create a folder on the hard drive (could be the C drive for
PC, Macintosh HD for the Mac). Next, alias or shortcut the folder
to the desktop. Then save your files, downloads and other documents
to that folder. If the desktop become corrupt, you only lose the
alias, not the contents of the folder.

 &HT;    Camping gadgets make the great outdoors that much greater
 &HT;    By Leigh-Anne Jackson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The call of the wild doesn't chime in to the
tune of ``La Cucaracha.'' It appeals to your desire to break free
from your cubicle's confines and actually rough it. But since so
many of us have been domesticated by our cells, pagers, Palm Pilots
and laptops, there's that initial fear that our ``roughness''
amounts to lounging in the backyard hammock without sunscreen or
citronella. Fear not the flora and fauna of that forest or state
park. Who says the return to nature has to be one of complete
asceticism? Armed with a few discreet gadgets, you can escape the
city limits without venturing too far outside your own personal
comfort boundaries. Compiled here is a survival guide for that
high-maintenance camper whose heart's in the right place, but whose
feral instinct requires a AA battery or two.
</P>
<P>
   CALLING ALL CAMPERS
</P>
<P>
   To avoid those ``Blair Witch''-style separation anxieties and
consequent spooked-out search parties, keep in touch with your tent
entourage with a Kenwood Freetalk F.R.S. two-way radio ($149.95;
www.altrec.com). This modern take on the walkie-talkie comes with a
two mile transmit radius, a call ringing feature and scrambling
capabilities for the super sleuth in you.
</P>
<P>
   MOTHER NATURE'S SPY
</P>
<P>
   If you're reluctant to leave behind the homebound trappings of
your voyeurism _ ``Behind the Music,'' ``Real World,'' ``Who Wants
to Be A Millionaire'' _ The Sharper Image's 10-30x25 Compact Zoom
binoculars ($199.95; www.sharperimage .com) offer a
behind-the-scenes look at what's going on in that hot spot known as
nature. The lenses have a ruby coating for UV protection while
you're bird watching or deer spotting. And their ability to zoom
your view from 10 to 30 times can help in your surveillance of rare
botanics or pesky interlopers.
</P>
<P>
   DEPTH SENSITIVITY TRAINING
</P>
<P>
   Some cast their lures for the meditative aspect of fishing;
others, because they're hungry. If appetite quelling is your key
motivation, try the Garmin Fishfinder 240 ($364; www.garmin.com).
The on-screen display tracks both weak and strong underwater fish
signals and offers depth sensitivity so you can nab your prey
regardless of where they might be swimming.
</P>
<P>
   TIME AND TEMPERATURE
</P>
<P>
   Don't embark upon your impossible missions without these
all-in-one essentials. The conveniently hands-free Suunto Vector
Wristop Computer ($189.95; www.austinoutdoors.com) displays an
altimeter, barometer, compass and . . . oh yeah, it also tells
time. Brunton's Sherpa Atmospheric Data Center ($154.95;
www.austinoutdoors.com) tells time and gives hikers and rock
climbers their positional altitude, the temperature, barometric
pressure, wind speed and wind chill. Available at Austin Outdoor
Gear and Guidance.
</P>
<P>
   KEEP A SUNNY DISPOSITION
</P>
<P>
   With the Oregon Scientific Weather Forecaster ($65;
www.austinoutdoors .com), you can anticipate the forces of nature,
whether it's showers or severe temperatures. The monitor keeps
campers abreast of local forecasts for up to 24 hours. It even
features an alarm that sounds when storms are on the horizon. If
only TV meteorologists were this reliable. Available at Austin
Outdoor Gear and Guidance.
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that tree really does look familiar. Keep your pride intact
with the Garmin GPS 12 Map ($360; www .austinoutdoors.com), a
sure-fire guarantee that you won't have to ever ask another soul
for directions. The handheld navigator offers moving interstate
maps, a trip timer with speed calculations and a feature that
retraces your steps. It's also compatible with data from MapSource
CDs ($117), travel cheat sheets with intricate coastline, lakeway
and recreational area details. Accessories available at Austin
Outdoor Gear and Guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Storyy. We monitored nightly the stoic blob that was the Davidians'
bullet-riddled home. We all knew what we saw.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd that none of us was called as an expert this week as
the civil trial on the matter began in federal court. Instead, the
court summoned those who actually were there.
</P>
<P>
   This trial will get closer to the truth than our cathode-ray
truth tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in court it only took a few minutes to start shedding
light on pieces that all the world's satellites apparently couldn't
put together for the masses:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Davidians set their own building on fire April 19. It may
not have been ``the'' fire. Or it may have been one of several.

 &HT;    Buying a car online
 &HT;    By Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it came time for Julie Smith to buy a new car,
she wasn't sure exactly what she wanted. But she was sure she
didn't want to haggle over the price.
</P>
<P>
   After researching vehicles in publications such as Consumer
Reports and looking at them up close on dealer lots, the inside
sales representative for McKesson HBOC turned to the Internet to
price and purchase her 2000 Lexus RX 300 sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole buying experience was great. I didn't have to
dicker,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She went first to Edmunds.com, a site that has car-buying tips
as well as the dealer invoice for pricing a vehicle. There Smith
found a link to Autobytel.com, a car-buying service that puts
prospective buyers in touch with local dealers for a no-haggle
price on the vehicle they want, from color choice to option
packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not have been the best deal, but I was getting a decent
price,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience is being shared by an increasing number of car
buyers who may feel intimidated by the car-buying process or who
want the convenience of car shopping from home.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of all used-car shoppers used the Internet
for assistance during the shopping process, according to an August
survey by J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the transaction, another Power study
showed the number of auto dealers working with online buying
services has doubled in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Cyber Dialogue, an Internet consulting company, found
that 21 million people used the Net last year to get data on new
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 8.4 million reported that they bought vehicles, but
170,000 did so directly over the Internet, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, it seems, another dot-com company is adding a new
tool to the buyers' workbench. You'll find ways to find, price,
finance, insure and take delivery of a new or used car.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the first question a prospective buyer should ask:
Do I want a new or used vehicle?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is important. If you're buying a new car you must go
through a dealer. With used cars, there are varying paths to choose
from.
</P>
<P>
   With new cars, state franchise laws require a dealer to be part
of the process, but there are no prohibitions on buying new cars
via the Internet or even from out-of-state dealers, noted Bill
Morie, president of the Georgia Automobile Dealers Association, a
trade group for new-car dealers. In most situations, Internet
buyers will sign the papers with a dealer in their area.
</P>
<P>
   Car buyers are embracing the Internet for buying all sorts of
things, noted Gayle Troberman, director of marketing for
Microsoft's CarPoint buying service. ``It's the first place to go
to get information at their fingertips and feel comfortable about
the money they are spending.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, price isn't the only factor, she said. ``They want
to get the right car for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet allows consumers to make comparisons between makes
and models, determine what tradeoffs they have to make and get a
fair price, which may not always be the absolutely lowest price,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dealerships in the past have been more resistant to the Internet
than some other retailers. Despite the extensive consolidation
going on in the industry, most dealerships are owned by individual
entrepreneurs, many of whom have been in the auto business for
decades and are reluctant to accept new ways of doing business.
Still, there are some innovators.
</P>
<P>
   One who has embraced the Internet is Mark Bowen, general manager
for Hyundai, Subaru and Oldsmobile for the Ed Voyles automotive
dealership group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best thing that ever happened to honest car
dealers,'' he said. ``The Internet has done for car selling what
the Model T did. It's that big.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers can find the dealer's invoice amount easily, including
the base price and options packages. ``Everything's out there. Why
should we play games?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   From Internet traffic that was next to nothing last year, Bowen
says about 40 percent of his Subaru customers and nearly a third of
those looking at Hyundais have made contact online.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership between the sites and the dealers is the key,
Bowen said: The Internet provides the contacts; the dealers provide
the cars.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers in the J.D. Power survey reported that customers who
used an online service saved an average of $490 on a new car,
compared with traditional showroom shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, online customers usually are quoted a lower price
up front without having to make an offer, the survey added.
</P>
<P>
   While the Voyles dealership is not a no-haggle environment,
Bowen insists he's providing a fair price, usually a fixed amount
over the dealer invoice, to Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online services are particularly effective for shoppers
who feel intimidated by salespeople and want to find a dealer that
is willing to give them their best price right upfront,'' said
Chris Denove, J.D. Power's director of automotive
retail/distribution analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Most car-buying sites have links to other sources of
information, including Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com), a popular
price guide for used cars, as well as reviews of new and older
vehicles and model comparisons. Many include links to financing and
insurance services. Manufacturers' sites also provide pictures,
specifications and options packages, along with the manufacturers
suggested retail price (MSRP, also known as the sticker price).
</P>
<P>
   But few vehicles are sold at the sticker price unless they are
in high demand or have a no-haggle tradition like Saturn. Instead,
buyers expect to begin their negotiations from the lower dealer
invoice price. That figure is a common feature on Edmunds.com and
many other buying service sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even that is not the dealer's cost for the vehicle because it
doesn't factor in ``holdback,'' an amount that the manufacturer
rebates to the dealer once the vehicle is sold. The refund is meant
to help offset the dealer's expenses for keeping the vehicle in
inventory. There also are other charges, including freight, dealer
back-office fees, sales tax and state title fees. There may also be
consumer or dealer rebates.
</P>
<P>
   Once customers have gathered information on price, style and
options _ and maybe even arranged financing _ they may be directed
to a dealer's own Web site or e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of franchised new-car dealerships have
Internet sites, according to the National Automobile Dealers
Association. Of them, 93 percent allow customers to send e-mail,
order online or obtain financing. Of those without sites,
two-thy,'' said Denove.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Internet shopping process isn't perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports recently conducted research on five referral
sites. The magazine reported that only 35 percent of its panel of
1,056 online shoppers received a price quote within two days. When
they did get a quote, it wasn't always for the exact car specified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going online is a terrific way to do auto-related research,
but you can't kick the tires through your computer monitor, and you
can't slide behind the wheel with your mouse,'' said Lou Richman,
the magazine's finance editor.
</P>
<P>
   A test drive before ordering is still a good idea. ``The best
time is when the consumer has narrowed down the choices to two or
three cars,'' advises Alison Wagonfeld, Greenlight.com's vice
president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SHOPPERS SAY
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports conducted a panel of 1,056 online car shoppers.
The findings are reported in the April issue of the magazine:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly a quarter of the shoppers, 22 percent, were told they
would have to visit the dealership for a firm price.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only two of three dealers who responded said they had the car
in stock or could get it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Overall, quoted prices were 5 percent to 10 percent below
manufacturers suggested retail prices, reasonably competitive for
some models but pricey for others.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 60 percent who got a price quote said they would
consider shopping in the future on the sites they tested.

 &HT;    Learn to draw your favorite cartoons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   www.cartooncorner.com _ Learn the secrets of animation from
cartoonist Emmett Scott. For the beginning artist, there is an
easy-to-follow tutorial on the basics of drawing characters. He
starts with drawing the four parts of the face that show emotion:
eyes, eyebrows, eyelids and mouth. The site also features single
panel cartoons, cartoon strips, short poems, rhyming stories,
hidden pictures and word games. Most of the time, the site
encourages participation, either by drawing, solving a riddle,
rhyming or making props like paper hats or maracas. Also, the site
explains the difference between kinds of cartoons: animation, spot
drawing, editorial cartoons and caricatures.

   www.goosehead.com _ See what all the hype's about and visit the
popular teen content web site created by 15-year-old California
native Ashley Power (apparently, her real name). Ashley offers
relationship au to be a genius to see how an accidental call like
that could be downright awful under the wrong circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Most people seem to have more cellular airtime than they have
something to say. Now I get calls from friends, driving in their
cars, who want to ask me if I've seen the latest model of the Ford
Explorer, or to muse about what they plan to have for dinner. Now
that free long-distance calling is part of most plans, I keep
hearing from folks all over the country who want to tell me about
the traffic jam that they've encountered in Cincinnati or about
their dog's medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is a wonderful thing, but it's just about to bore me
to death.
</P>
<P>
   So today, at the risk of hurting your feelings, let's talk about
how to act right. Think of it as Husted's Rules for Cellular
Etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 1. If you are so busy that you have to make and take calls
on the golf course, in the movies and other places where decent
folk are trying to get away from it all, then you are too busy to
have fun. Stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 2. Turn the danged thing off when you go to church, the
movies or a play. That weird nee-nah, nee-nah sound frightens
children and annoys adults.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 3. Unless you are having a really interesting conversation
_ something that could be turned into a soap opera _ don't have it
within my earshot.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 4. If you really don't have anything to say and simply
enjoy making calls, get a job as a motel switchboard operator.
</P>
<P>
   And please, if you disagree, send an e-mail. Don't call me using
your cellular phone.

 &HT;    Origami meets two-wheeler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Riding a bicycle is one of the most
energy-efficient ways to get around, but using a bike to travel is
sometimes impractical. Perhaps the route is too long or too steep,
or perhaps you don't have a secure place to stash your bike. The
Montague Corp.'s line of folding bicycles may help you get around
some of those obstacles. The Montague CX 21-speed Comfort Bike
($450; www.montagueco.com), one of the company's newest models,
comes with either an 18- or 20-inch aluminum frame. It weighs 30
pounds and folds to 36 inches by 28 inches by 12 inches. Montague
says its bikes are full-size vehicles that fold down to half their
size in less than a minute without the use of tools. To fold a
Montague bike, the rider loosens a quick release bolt to remove the
front wheel. Two quick-release bolts on the seat post are then
loosened, and the rear wheel swings around to fold over the middle
of the bike frame. Other models include a mountain bike, an
off-road bike, an urban bike, an electric bike and a tandem bike _
all of which fold for easy storage.

 &HT;    WordPerfect vs. Word brouhaha keeps churning
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The uproar created by my discovery and disclosure of a
sinister underground network of DOS users has now evolved into a
frontal attack upon my choice of word processors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a management consultant for a wide variety of large and
small firms and I have to be equally proficient in Word and
WordPerfect,'' writes Mike Atchison.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my favorite things to do with Word-centric writers _
such as you appear to be _ is to challenge them to reproduce a page
out of any publication, and I'll do the same page in WordPerfect.
I'll beat them by almost 20 percent every time.''
</P>
<P>
   As I said last week in regard to a similar offer from the
redoubtable Miz Becker of Denver, I'm not accepting challenges
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find WordPerfect 9 to be just as easy to use and much faster
with complicated layouts. By the way, it still has the great
`reveal codes' feature that Word users never get a chance to
appreciate.''
</P>
<P>
   Here Atchison makes the same assumption as Becker did in last
week's column. It has obviously not occurred to either of them that
there may be some of us who don't want to be confronted with codes.
</P>
<P>
   Having a word processor that will reveal its codes implies that
the user wants to fiddle with them. This in turn inevitably implies
that the user knows what the codes mean. I don't know what they
mean. I don't want to know what they mean. I don't want to be one
of those men Who Knew Too Much.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to another, potentially more serious, issue with the
whole idea of a word processor that reveals its codes. It smacks of
Bring Your Child to Work Day at the National Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   What is a code for, if not to keep secrets? A word processor
that will blab its secrets to any Tom, Dick or Geeky who happens to
click his mouse in the right place is a low, treacherous thing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, obviously, is an outfit that knows how to keep a
secret, and it has instilled this sterling trait into its word
processor. I applaud that.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes J.B. McKoy, to compare Word unfavorably with
WordStar:
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of Word's bloatedness, I have yet to find the simple
but very useful block copy function in it that was present in
WordStar 18 years ago,'' he writes. ``This function allowed you to
mark the upper left and lower right corners of any block of text in
the body of a document, and copy it. There have been many times
I've wanted to just take a chunk of a page in Word, but it requires
you to take entire rows instead. This means a lot of manual work to
get the piece you wanted in the firsrchniques, probably involving a
pair of pliers and a hypodermic full of sodium pentothal, would
persuade Word to reveal its codes on the subject.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ www.aOnline.com _ Web portals catering to
specific ethnic groups are increasing in number, and some of them,
like aOnline.com, are creating hotbeds of online communities and
providing updated news and entertainment for monitories. This site,
catering to Asian-Americans, offers news, resources and original
columns.
</P>
<P>
   www.campchaos.com/cartoons/napsterbad _ Warning: lots and lots
of bad language here. This page features the extremely popular
animated cartoons featuring fictional incarnations of Metallica's
Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield railing against their mortal foe,
Napster. ``Napster _ Bad!'' is becoming a Web cult classic.
</P>
<P>
   www.mamma.com _ Search engines are notoriously flaky sometimes,
but mamma.com prides itself on accuracy. While that in itself is
probably not enough to earn a link, we can't help falling in love
with the site's mascot, a animated, matronly gray haired woman who
reminds us of Aunt Bea and the farmer's wife from the film,
``Babe.'' We love mamma.com, but more to the point, we love Mamma.

 &HT;    Perfect Dark is a perfect follow-up
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Long awaited and, frankly, long overdue, Perfect Dark ($50;
www.nintendo.com; for the Nintendo 64) is finally here. The
follow-up to the smash hit ``Goldeneye 007'' _ which still is
praised as the best first-person sneaky shooter on any console _
Perfect Dark surpasses its predecessor with sophisticated
artificial intelligence, superior lighting and sound effects and
``secondary firing'' features for some 35 weapons _ all the while
remaining true to the immersive, story-driven gameplay of the James
Bond game. Lead heroine Joanna Dark is a stealthy, secret-agent and
tactician with a license to kill, which she uses extremely
liberally. Blocky and hazy graphics are easily forgiven as players
are immersed in an intricate series of commando mission of seek and
discover, sneak and destroy, and tiptoe through a rampage.
Alternately, gameplay includes a variety of multiplayer modes;
co-operative mini-missions, flat-out death matches or variants. A
lot of game, and well worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   For those who need constant Sim-stimulation, there is Sim City
3000 Unlimited ($40; www.simcity.com; for Windows), an expanded,
colossal version of the 1999 game. New features include a new set
of buildings _ Asian and European _ new scenarios, new disasters
(plague of locusts, anyone?), seasons, customizable trees and
terrain, and an architect tool that lets you design your own homes
and buildings. While some of us still prefer the more personal,
addictive ``The Sims,'' Sim City 3000 fans will get a dose of new
things with the game, although the price may be steep for what it
essentially the same game with a few new extras. Luckily, owners of
the original game can get a $10 rebate if they buy Unlimited before
June 24.

 &HT;    A DVD for the dollar-conscious
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Still leery about this new-fangled DVD technology? Leer no more.
Konka has sidled into the home entertainment market with the
KD1800U DVD deck ($199; www.konkausa.com), an ``affordably'' priced
unit that, nevertheless, still offers picture and sound quality
notably superior to a high-end VHS player. Respectably functional
with standard DVD features _ remote, multiple language options, CD
and S-Video compatibility, various screen sizes and ratios _ the
KD1800U has a fresh and stylish appearance, sleek and silver, which
belies the fact it's a low-end component. By the time this sexy
thing gives up the ghost, high-end DVD players will be similarly
priced, which makes the KD1800U the perfect starter DVD machine.
Still leery? You're still playing 8-track tapes, too, aren't you?
</P>
<P>
   'FIGHT CLUB' DVD A REAL PUNCH IN THE NOSE
</P>
<P>
   Disenfranchised, disgruntled and ultimately disassociated guys
from the IKEA Generation start a bare-fisted brawl society in order
to vent all that world-weary angst. Then things get interesting.
Then, when things start to get a little weird, they get extremely
weird. Targeted directly at the 30-year old male-without-an-outlet
demographic, Fight Club Special Edition DVD ($35; www.foxdvd.com)
is hemorrhaging with extras: optional feature length running
commentary _ thoughts and anecdotes from actors Brad Pitt, Edward
Norton, Helena Bonham Carter and director David Fincher, for
example, as well as craft secrets elucidated by the production
crew. This edition also includes a second DVD gushing with extra
footage, behind-the-scenes clips, beguiling stills and concept art
gallery, and much more. Also featured for the first time is the new
``THX Optimode'' that allows for individual calibration of audio
and video to optimize one's home theatre performance.

 &HT;    An online grocery trip proves less than perfect
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I got a call on the weekend from a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it,'' she said. ``You've got to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is a new Internet grocery delivery service. ``It'' had
dominated a good portion of the conversation at a local coffee
house where three of us were attempting to knit together wits that
had been thoroughly unraveled by the Pandora's box that is the end
of school.
</P>
<P>
   We were swapping notes on summer plans when the conversation
took a sharp right. Commiserating on the upcoming need for more
food to feed children suddenly home all day led to tales of
``why-I-hate-going-to-the-supermarket.'' (The group consensus was
that food shopping is like housework, a necessary evil doomed to be
repeated and repeated and repeated.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' said my friend, ''maybe not if you do it on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   We were skeptical. Would it really save time? Could you find
everything you need? What about preferred brands? (Morris the cat
could take lessons from my son in finicky eating.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As we talked I realized a sea change had occurred. As little as
a month ago, my friend had little to no interest in the Internet
beyond its ability to help her son with his homework. When I asked
for her e-mail address so I could send her some sites to look at
for summer camps, she couldn't remember it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she was raving about the joy of online grocery shopping.
The difference, of course, was that this use of the Internet had
function and meaning, immediate meaning, in her life. One
time-consuming weekly chore _ a physical trip to the grocery store
_ could be eliminated. She had a permanent weekly list saved on the
site to which she could add and delete items. Yes, some items were
more expensive, but some were cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was tempting. I'd tried a couple of sites about a year ago,
and the list of products was so long and unwieldy that I stopped
four or five items into my shopping. It was too mind-numbing. But
maybe it was worth another try. I'd been hearing scattered reports
from lots of people:
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy dog food and toilet paper in bulk and just have it
delivered to your house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I get all my prescriptions online. It beats standing in line
at the drugstore.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon standing in line at the supermarket at the
precise moment that everyone else in a 25-mile radius decided to
shop persuaded me to give it another try.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, I logged on. First good sign _ it didn't take
45 tries to come up with a user name that wasn't taken and, most
importantly, that I could remember. The whole process took about
15-20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I settled in to do my shopping. I confess I didn't read the all
instructions. (I'd blocked out time but not that much.) It was
still a little cumbersome, but much less so than the earlier sites
I'd shopped on. About sixty-five percent of the time I found my
preferred brand, and I wasn't certain what the ``store brand'' was.
It did appear that using the site would become easier with
increased use.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from my friend, I saved pertinent items on a weekly
list as I did my shopping. A little over an hour later, I was
nearly done. ``Not bad,'' I was thinking. ``I could get used to
this. Call up my weekly list, add, subtract. ... I'm outta here.''
</P>
<P>
   And I was, just not as I had planned. The server died and my
carefully almost completed virtual shopping list was gone.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, that's technology.

 &HT;    Sites teach how to understand Internet lingo, with Netiquette
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've used the Internet to get your daily horoscope,
to do marketing research for work, to check the weather for your
picnic next Saturday. Now it's only logical that you use the Net to
find out about the Net.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start at a site that helps you learn the language of the
Internet. Before long you'll be speaking of TCP and IP and port
surfing with the big folks. Just drop in at Surf Lingo at
www.zdnet.com/yil/content/surfschool/lingo/lingotoc.html and you'll
soon know the language from Arpanet (the precursor to the Internet)
to zmodem (a now outdated data transfer method).
</P>
<P>
   A slightly more technical guide is the Internet Encyclopedia at
freesoft.org/CIE/index.htm where you'll learn about the technical
operation of the Net. It's a searchable database, and you'll find
help on almost any technical term, but you may come away as
confused as you arrived. For instance, here's the beginning of the
explanation of subnetting: ``Engineers gradually realized that the
original class-based addressing design was too inflexible for many
applications. In the mid-1980s, subnetting was introduced as an
extension to the original scheme. ... For example, 255.255.0.0 is a
standard class B subnet mask, since the first two bytes are all
ones (network), and the last two bytes are all zeros (host). In a
subnetted network, the network portion is extended.''
</P>
<P>
   The good thing is that you really don't have to understand
subnetting to impress others, just cut and paste several of the
explanations into the report your boss wants about the challenges
ahead for your company in e-commerce and you'll be an instant
Internet expert.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that most newcomers notice, almost immediately, is
that there is a different set of rules for polite behavior on the
Internet. When one of those rules is violated (something as simple
as typing in all capital letters), new users are almost certain to
hear about it, sometimes in a rude and abusive way. While that in
itself isn't great Internet etiquette, there are ways to avoid
these confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to learn the culture and etiquette of the Internet is
at a site called Netiquette at www.albion.com/netiquette/. If you
want a quick and basic course, there's a link to a section called
``core rules,'' but if you want even more, if you have aspirations
to become the Emily Post of the Net, then there is a link to a
complete guide to Netiquette too.

<P>
   Most old hands at the Net will be glad to see that _ included in
the complete guide _ there is a strong admonition not to pass on
electronic chain letters, or to naively send along dire warnings of
viruses that never lived outside phony e-mail warnings.

   Now that you know how to behave and can speak the language,
you'll want to visit a comprehensive site called Learn the Net at

training and now it's time for advanced work. This is a site that
offers more depth and discusses some of the lesser known areas of
the Net such as newsgroups and listservs (which are discussion
groups carried on by e-mail _ make sure you read about them before
joining one, since you can end up with more e-mail than a normal
person would wish for).

 &HT;    Yahoo's treasures prove it's not just a search engine
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Well, here's a surprise from our friends at Yahoo
Internet Life magazine (www.yil.com). In its July issue listing 10
Internet essentials, Web portal Yahoo is the number one pick for
searching the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it's become much more than just a directory, Yahoo
remains the first place to look for Web sites on a particular
topic,'' the blurb for Yahoo says, along with the disclaimer
``(Yahoo) is our licensing partner but we're editorially
independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   But affiliation or no affiliation, Yahoo (www.yahoo.com) still
topped a list of essential Web sites that included a lot of sites
that actually are pretty useful, such as weather.com, tickets.com,
Excite's newstracker (nt.excite.com) and Careerbuilder's mega job
search (www.careerbuilder.com).
</P>
<P>
   So there is an off chance that maybe Yahoo Internet Life isn't
taking the easy way out by picking its licensing partner as the
best place to search the Web. It might be time to take a second
look at Yahoo and see how much service and utility it provides for
its legions of users.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is the oldest, the biggest and without a shadow of a doubt
the most jam-packed Web portal online. It's also one of the most
popular.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tom Filo and Jerry Yang founded Yahoo in the mid '90s, a
crop of really good Web portals such as Lycos, Snap and Excite have
cropped up offering a wide variety of features and services in
addition to just plain old Web searching.
</P>
<P>
   There are also great sites like Google that simply let you
search, no shopping, no stock quotes, just searching. So even
though Yahoo is no longer the only game in town, it's still one of
the most popular sites on the Web. After America Online, it's the
second most popular site on the Web, with approximately 49 million
unique visitors in April, according to Web measurement firm Media
Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   When people talked about Yahoo, they used to call it a search
engine, but Yahoo's very testy spokespeople always insisted that
Yahoo was much more than that, and, upon close inspection, it is.
Like it or not, Yahoo is a category killer when it comes to wading
through and ultimately finding the needle in the enormous Internet
haystack.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to Yahoo's success is in the way it tries to organize
the Web, not just by category and subject but by country and
special interest areas for news hounds, sports fans, and financial
wizards. Name y section (finance.yahoo.com) is a search/information
engine that is strictly devoted to financial news and information.
Links to almost every financial site imaginable, a partnership with
Reuters, and the ability for users to track their own stock
portfolios make YahooFinance one of the best financial portals on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is a global concern, as anyone who scrolls down to the
bottom of the start page will see. There are many other Yahoos in
many other countries and languages. This is one feature of Yahoo
that more Web searchers should take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   A search for ``Gladiators'' star Russell Crowe doesn't turn up
much on the American site, but a visit to Yahoo Australia and New
Zealand has reams of information about the Australian Oscar
nominee, including information and digital downloads of his very
obscure, very alternative rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Web users have already discovered Yahoo mail, a free
Web-based e-mail service, while many more use Yahoo to keep up on
current events with its news sections that attack national and
international news with the sort of depth of coverage you could
search for on your own if you had at least half a day and a
complete knowledge of the Web. Yahoo also has auctions and shopping
areas, but they're not the real reason people go to Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   But that said, users who visit Yahoo Travel shopping for
airfares will find that its online partner, Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com) may suggest a substantially cheaper fare to a
nearby city. It's the value-added bonus of alliances like this one
that keep users coming back to Yahoo to do a lot more than search.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Yahoo is all about searching the Web and organizing
a seemingly endless stream of information into easy-to-find,
easy-to-digest bites. Yahoo organizes the Web in such a way that no
matter what obscure bit of information you want to find, it will
find a way to bring it to you.

&HT;     BROKERAGE TO OFFER UPGRADED INTERNET SEARCH ENGINE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN    c.2000 San Francisco Examiner   SAN
<TEXT>
FRANCISCO _ In what may be the closest thing yet to a computer
engaging in intelligent thought to answer a user's question, a new
technology will help Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. customers collect
investment data on the company's Web site.
<P>
   One step beyond search sites such as Ask Jeeves, which take a
user's question and respond with a list of Web sites that may
provide an answer, the technology, developed by iPhrase
Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., allows users to type in a
question and receive a tailored answer based on the system's
interpretation of the phrasing and a search of relevant databases.
</P>
<P>
   When Bob Sofman, a senior vice president of Schwab's electronic
brokerage, tried the system out, he typed: ``Compare the P-to-E
ratios for the top five chip manufacturers and biotech firms.'' The
answer, in seconds, was a table created by the program comparing
both fields, ranked in order of largest ratio to least.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it had done was create a dynamic table in response to my
inquiry,'' Sofman said. ``It was remarkable, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   The same question typed into askjeeves.com offered results
varying from U.S. Census statistics and information on business, to
Britannica.com's entry on biotechnology, places to learn about the
math topic ``ratio and proportion,'' as well as this unlikely
result: ``Where can I buy snacks from an on-line store?''
</P>
<P>
   The service will be free to schwab.com users when it becomes
available in the fall. Sofman said Schwab had interviewed 20 to 25
companies before settling on iPhrase, home to several former
scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Terms of
the contract were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   IPhrase, which also has an office in San Mateo, has attracted
$11 million from venture capitalists, including Sequoia Capital,
Greylock Management and Charles River Ventures. The company says
its goal is to provide more acutely tailored search engine
capabilities, rather than the throwing-darts results that sometimes
prevail on the Internet.

 &HT;    ALBRIGHT URGES 'FLEXIBILITY' TO CHINESE LEADERS ON TAIWAN ISSUE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By JULIE CHAO 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In what is likely to be her last visit to China as
Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright urged top Chinese leaders to
resume dialogue with Taiwan, saying flexibility was better than
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   In a marathon series of meetings in here in Beijing Thursday,
Albright said the United States is eager to see a lowering of
tension between mainland China and the island of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's newly-elected president, Chen Shui-bian, said Tuesday
he would like to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin in a summit
much like the one that took place between leaders of North and
South Korea last week.
</P>
<P>
   China, however, has continued to insist that Taiwan recognize
the ``one China'' policy, meaning that Taiwan is part of China,
before any talks can take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly more will be gained through flexibility and appeals
to shared interest than could possibly be achieved through efforts
to intimidate,'' Albright said about the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said China doesn't feel is has enough information
about Taiwan's new president, and is still trying to figure him
out. ``They are questioning, basically, who he is, what his motives
are, how he's going to operate,'' Albright told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to China is her first since March 1999, and marks a
slow but steady improvement in relations between the two countries,
which hit a low last May following the U.S. bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said the bombing, which killed
three Chinese nationals, was accidental, but Beijing has not fully
accepted its explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp differences remain in the areas of human rights and Tibet,
Albright said. Although Beijing and Washington have resumed
bilateral dialogue in several areas since last May, human rights is
one area where conversation has remained at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   While the talks were wide-ranging _ covering everything from
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to
environmental protection and peace in the Middle East _ the other
main purpose of Albright's visit was to discuss the Korean
peninsula, where the leaders historic summit buoyed hopes for
unification of North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said China and the United States share common goals in
Korea, such as wanting to see the reunion of divided families and
long-term peace. But top aides say the Clinton administration will
continue to explore an expensive missile defense program as a
shield against a North Korean missile attack _ which Beijing fears
could neutralize its tiny nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to arriving in Beijing, Albright's said she hoped to hear
first-hand from Chinese officials about North Korea's reclusive
leader, Kim Jong Il, who made a secret trip to Beijing just before
the summit. However, if Albright gleaned any additional insight
into Kim's thinking, she did not reveal it to reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She indicated only that, while the summit was historic, it was
merely a first step towards genuine peace on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be rightfully termed as naive to think everything has
been dealt with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the success of the Korean summit, questions have arisen
about the continued need for the 37,000 American soldiers stationed
in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   However, Albright indicated troop withdrawal was not on her
agenda with South Korean officials, whom she is meeting in Seoul
Friday and Saturday, nor did the subject come up with Chinese
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much agreed our troops on the peninsula are a
stabilizing factor,'' she said. ``It's clear that's not an issue
for discussion (in South Korea).''
</P>
<P>
   The hastily arranged visit to China, her fifth as Secretary of
State, included lunch with her counterpart, Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan, afternoon meetings with Vice Premier Qian Qichen and
Premier Zhu Rongji, and an evening meeting with President Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Albright is scheduled to meet with some American
businessmen, visit an Internet cafe, then fly to Seoul, where she
will stay less than 24 hours.

RIDING A COMPUTER-GENERATED WAVE STRAIGHT TO THE BOX OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN RAFAEL, Calif. _ Like a pilot at his controls, Stefen
Fangmeier sat at the video console in a darkened meeting room at
Industrial Light and Magic, a pioneer in the business of creating
special effects for movies. Arrayed behind him on four rows of
ratty couches and metal chairs were a dozen or so computer
animators and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes appeared one after another on the room's oversize
monitors, some just a few seconds long, others perhaps 30 seconds:
huge ships lumbering through heavy seas, impossible waves washing
across colossal decks, flashes of lightning, roaring torrents of
wind and mist. Watching the same scenes on a satellite video hookup
at the Warner Brothers lot in Burbank, the director Wolfgang
Petersen and the cinematographer John Seale saw the parade of
visual-effects images slide soundlessly past.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shot, I don't know,'' Petersen said. ``It's a lot of
flashing lightning in a very short time. It's too much. Maybe you
can tone it down or take that second flash out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fangmeier is the visual effects supervisor on Petersen's new
film, ``The Perfect Storm,'' which is to open on June 30. It is the
largest and most ambitious computer-effects project Fangmeier has
undertaken at Industrial Light and Magic, part of George Lucas'
moviemaking empire. With its complex fluid dynamics and
computer-intensive water effects, the film is even more demanding
than ``Jurassic Park,'' with its digital dinosaurs, or ``Twister,''
with its virtual cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-generated special effects have been at the center of
moviemaking for more than two decades now, especially in the kind
of thunderous blockbusters that tend to dominate the summer. Even
so, this is turning out to be a particularly ambitious and perhaps
pivotal summer for them. Never have so many big summer movies been
so centered on such effects.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley Scott has said that one of the chief reasons he decided
to direct ``Gladiator'' was that the latest generation of
sophisticated effects made it possible to recreate second-century
Rome in towering and vivid detail. Disney's ``Dinosaur,'' with its
groundbreaking combination of realistic, computer-generated
creatures and live-action backgrounds, is a showcase for
sophisticated effects.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Emmerich's Revolutionary War drama, ``The Patriot,'' can
spread itself across a broad canvas, with flotillas of masted ships
and spectacular armies of thousands, by relying on technology that
can transform a few hundred redcoats into a horizon-choking
multitude. Sony's Digital Human Project, an attempt to push and
dissolve the boundaries of computer animation, was what made it
possible for the director Paul Verhoeven to attempt, in the
forthcoming ``Hollow Man,'' to bring an invisible man to the screen
in a way, beg your pardon, that has never been seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using computer effects just for the sake of using them is not
very interesting,'' said Emmerich. ``But where they are very useful
is in helping you to make things very big, or to do things like
make your skies match in shots that were filmed on different days.
We could not have done `The Patriot' the way we did it without the
computers.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of filmmakers, it seems, have gone beyond big
stunts and bigger explosions and have awakened to the newfound
ability of computer-effects specialists to transport audiences to
dazzling places, be it some vanished historical epoch or the
swelling crest of a 100-foot wave.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the meeting room Fangmeier ran the ``Perfect Storm''
scene again, stopping and starting, the digital boat jerking back
and forth in the roiling seas until the image was frozen at last on
the second flash of lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean this one?'' Fangmeier asked. Seale, sitting next to
Petersen in Burbank, leaned forward and studied the screen. ``Yes,
yes,'' he said, ``the one where it looks like it has legs.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Petersen and Seale said, was that the shot did not
look real: it was too bright, too vivid. It would break the
audience's concentration, pull them out of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Fangmeier studied the shot. There were no voices of objection
from the technicians and animators in the room behind him. Finally
he nodded. ``Yes, we can take that out if you like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the viewing session Petersen said: ``The computer effects
in `Perfect Storm' were the most important thing in the telling of
this story. Otherwise we never could have done it. We could never
have shown what it was like to be in 100-foot seas, not in a way
that would satisfy audiences in the year 2000. Who can go out and
shoot in 100-foot waves? We all would have been killed. And that
good old device of using water tanks and miniatures? No way.
Audiences just will not buy it in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The enormous success, creative and financial, of ``Titanic'' in
1997 has been the prime generator for this boom in realistic
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Those dozens of people falling off the back of the upended ocean
liner _ some real actors on wires, some digital creations, crashing
and tumbling together in the same shot _ brought a vividness to
visual effects that filmmakers have been expanding and improving
upon ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does is, it allows you to create more spectacular
images and more spectacular combinations of things,'' said Andrew
Millstein, who heads Disney's Secret Lab, the studio's in-house
computer animation and effects unit where ``Dinosaur'' was born.
``I think there are some filmmakers, more and more of them, who
fully understand the power of the tools. Our job, in a way, is to
create a new way to view reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of creating the water effects for ``The Perfect
Storm'' began with John Anderson of Industrial Light and Magic, an
expert in fluid dynamics, using new software that effectively
builds a virtual ocean, many miles wide, inside the computer.
Computer-generated ships were later added to the seas and given
various weights and physical characteristics. As the animators
worked with the new software and tried to make the results look
realistic, they quickly realized that water behaved very
differently at different points on the wave and under different
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   They created and named more than a dozen different kinds of
water, from crest foam (the white churn at the top of a wave) to
chopper wash (the pebble-in-a-pond circles created by a helicopter
hovering above the water).
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of these behave very differently,'' said Habib
Zargarpour, assistant visual effects supervisor on the film. ``You
have waves that turn into foaming, blobby chunks, then into sea
foam, then into mist. To me that's the most difficult thing to come
up with, the look of a splash.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the live-action sequences were shot in an enormous water
tank on the Warner Brothers lot. The actors (George Clooney, Mark
Wahlberg and others) were atop a re-creation of the Andrea Gail,
the doomed vessel featured in the best-selling book, built on the
true story on which the film is based.
</P>
<P>
   The boat sat on gimbals that could toss, turn and upend it while
several cameras filmed the tumult from fingerlike cranes around the
periphery. Thousands of gallons of water could be spilled from
overhead tanks while wind machines raged and the actors were
blasted across the deck.
</P>
<P>
   A computer in the gimbals, meanwhile, recorded every inch of the
ship's movement and relayed it to the computers at Industrial Light
and Magic. Visual effects technicians there could attempt to match
the real ship's movement to the roster of waves they had in their
virtual ocean. Then they could tweak the effect even more. Does the
wave not look terrifying enough at 60 feet? OK, make it 75.
</P>
<P>
   Then the visual effects shots _ there are about 336 in the film
_ were shown to the director and cinematographer at the daily
satellite conferences known as ``the transmission,'' at which
everyone discussed whether a shot seemed to be working.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his comments Wolfgang will often say things like, oh, this
looks too computer-generated, or it looks like a model, or it
doesn't somehow look real,'' Fangmeier said. ``So we go back and we
fix it. It's my job to figure out how to change it to make it look
real.''
</P>
<P>
   For Petersen, the world of filmmaking has changed so much since
he shot some of the water scenes in his 1981 submarine adventure,
``Das Boot,'' in a water tank with miniatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The progress they have made in generating totally believable
environments and people, it's all so vastly improved,'' he said.
``I have no idea how they do it. It's a mystery to me. In this film
some of the shots are of actors on the set, and some are of
computer-generated actors on a computer-generated ship. Sometimes I
look at a shot, and I have to ask them, is this something we shot,
or is this you?''
</P>
<P>
   All of which has spurred him creatively, Petersen said, forcing
him to enlarge his ambitions and rethink his vision for this film
and for films he hopes to make in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you feed the computer, it's basically limitless what you
can do nowadays,'' Petersen said. ``You can create worlds. You can
do whatever you want.''

   BEIJING _ In what is likely to be her last visit to China as
Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright urged top Chinese leaders to
resume dialogue with Taiwan, saying flexibility was better than
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   In a marathon series of meetings in here in Beijing Thursday,
Albright said the United States is eager to see a lowering of
tension between mainland China and the island of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's newly-elected president, Chen Shui-bian, said Tuesday
he would like to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin in a summit
much like the one that took place between leaders of North and
South Korea last week.
</P>
<P>
   China, however, has continued to insist that Taiwan recognize
the ``one China'' policy, meaning that Taiwan is part of China,
before any talks can take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly more will be gained through flexibility and appeals
to shared interest than could possibly be achieved through efforts
to intimidate,'' Albright said about the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said China doesn't feel is has enough information
about Taiwan's new president, and is still trying to figure him
out. ``They are questioning, basically, who he is, what his motives
are, how he's going to operate,'' Albright told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to China is her first since March 1999, and marks a
slow but steady improvement in relations between the two countries,
which hit a low last May following the U.S. bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said the bombing, which killed
three Chinese nationals, was accidental, but Beijing has not fully
accepted its explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp differences remain in the areas of human rights and Tibet,
Albright said. Although Beijing and Washington have resumed
bilateral dialogue in several areas since last May, human rights is
one area where conversation has remained at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   While the talks were wide-ranging _ covering everything from
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to
environmental protection and peace in the Middle East _ the other
main purpose of Albright's visit was to discuss the Korean
peninsula, where the leaders historic summit buoyed hopes for
unification of North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said China and the United States share common goals in
Korea, such as wanting to see the reunion of divided families and
long-term peace. But top aides say the Clinton administration will
continue to explore an expensive missile defense program as a
shield against a North Korean missile attack _ which Beijing fears
could neutralize its tiny nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to arriving in Beijing, Albright's said she hoped to hear
first-hand from Chinese officials about North Korea's reclusive
leader, Kim Jong Il, who made a secret trip to Beijing just before
the summit. However, if Albright gleaned any additional insight
into Kim's thinking, she did not reveal it to reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She indicated only that, while the summit was historic, it was
merely a first step towards genuine peace on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be rightfully termed as naive to think everything has
been dealt with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the success of the Korean summit, questions have arisen
about the continued need for the 37,000 American soldiers stationed
in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   However, Albright indicated troop withdrawal was not on her
agenda with South Korean officials, whom she is meeting in Seoul
Friday and Saturday, nor did the subject come up with Chinese
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much agreed our troops on the peninsula are a
stabilizing factor,'' she said. ``It's clear that's not an issue
for discussion (in South Korea).''
</P>
<P>
   The hastily arranged visit to China, her fifth as Secretary of
State, included lunch with her counterpart, Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan, afternoon meetings with Vice Premier Qian Qichen and
Premier Zhu Rongji, and an evening meeting with President Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Albright is scheduled to meet with some American
businessmen, visit an Internet cafe, then fly to Seoul, where she
will stay less than 24 hours.

WEB SITES WOO ASIAN AMERICANS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Checking out Asian American Web sites isn't just
a hobby for Nelson Wong, it's ``a passion.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco native figures he spends about 20 hours a week
surfing sites that are produced by or for the most wired ethnic
group in the United States: Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And on his own site, AArising.com, probably the oldest of them
all, Wong has posted links to some 2,500 sites. They range from
individual ``blogs'' _ a new Net contraction for personal e-zines,
or ``Web logs,'' that offer comment on everything from TV shows to
cars to love _ to the high-profile commercial venture aOnline.com,
which was recently launched by nationally known aMagazine.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Wong is the prime target for a new crop of
commercial sites like aOnline.com, Click2Asia.com,
AsianConnections.com, AsiaDera.com and Onna.com that are eyeing
profits in the diverse marketplace of Asians online.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, he says, nobody has hit the target.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're trying to make money at it, they may be barking up
the wrong tree,'' said Wong, a 33-year-old Web designer who lives
and works in San Francisco. ``I don't see anything out there that's
a moneymaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Yang, founder and chief executive of aMagazine and
aOnline.com, hopes to change that. He knows commercial Asian
American sites that have come and gone, but he believes the time is
right for a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sitting on something that is either going to be a gold
mine or a land mine,'' said Yang, who is moving the headquarters of
his 10-year-old company aMedia Inc. from New York to San Francisco
in August.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Asian Americans are the most wired
``community'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Two leading Internet research firms, Forrester Research Inc. and
Jupiter Communications Inc., both say 69 percent of Asian American
households, about 2.2 million total, are online. According to
census estimates, there are about 11 million U.S. residents of
Asian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued last week, Jupiter said the online
penetration of Asian American households should jump to 84 percent
by 2005. By comparison, about 54 percent of all Caucasian
households were online this year, a percentage that should jump to
76 percent in 2005, the Jupiter report said.
</P>
<P>
   And in an April report, Forrester Research said 61 percent of
Asian American households have made a purchase online, and in the
last quarter of 1999, they spent an average of $331 online. Latino
and Caucasian households spent $254 online during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, though, is that the term Asian American does not
refer to a singular entity, but a variety of people of various
ethnic backgrounds, cultures and interests from countries
throughout the Asia-Pacific Island and South Asia regions, such as
China, Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and India.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian American community is probably the toughest to
target as a homogenous community because they are so diverse,''
said Ekaterina Walsh, a Forrester Research analyst who has followed
Asian American Web sites for several years.
</P>
<P>
   But Yang believes the time is right for a Web site that creates
more of an Asian American community. He believes his new
aOnline.com Asian American Digital Network, formally launched
earlier this month, will become a ``virtual hub'' for everything
from ``advertising to political organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to go where Asian Americans are, and where we are is
the Internet,'' Yang said. ``Our goal is to create a consumer
market for Asian Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Yang's aMedia Inc., which is moving into a 20,000-square-foot
office at Market and Sixth streets, is hoping to build on the
success of its 10-year-old flagship aMagazine, a bimonthly
publication with about 200,000 subscribers that tracks culture and
politics in the various Asian American communities. The company has
also ventured into book publishing with titles ``I Am Jackie Chan:
My Life in Action.''
</P>
<P>
   Yang is cognizant that a number of Asian American portals have
tried and failed. A prime example is the defunct Channel A of Los
Altos, Calif., which started as a news and information site but
became a retail site to generate revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see why people would come back repeatedly and buy a
set of `Yan Can Cook Chopsticks,' '' said Yang, who hired Channel A
co-founder Steven Chin, a former San Francisco Examiner reporter,
as aOnline's Web development director.
</P>
<P>
   For aOnline.com, Yang hopes to draw readers by combining the
print magazine's content with original Web features on subjects
like imprisoned Los Alamos nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee or a report
on violence against Asian Americans on college campuses. The
company is beefing up its staff of editors, writers and
free-lancers from eight last year to nearly 40 this year, Yang
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, aOnline wants to become the hub in a network of Asian
American community groups by offering Web production services to
groups like the Organization of Chinese Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And aOnline hopes to increase its audience with entertainment,
especially with Internet music becoming one of the hottest
activities on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Yang said the company is negotiating to buy an independent
record label and plans to create a ``digital studio'' that will
spotlight Asian American artists and filmmakers through streaming
video and audio. That will be important as more consumers switch to
high-speed broadband Internet connections, both in the United
States and abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia itself is not yet a consumer market for broadband media,
but within two years, Asia is going to be the single largest
Internet market in the world,'' Yang said. ``They'll need something
to fill those fat pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition among Asian American portals is already heating
up, each offering a potpourri of news, features and entertainment
to entice Asian and Asian American Web surfers, although only two
had sufficient traffic for Web research firm PC Data Online to
report.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' Click2Asia.com, for example, launched in August
armed with investors that include Gareth Chang, chairman of Asian
broadcaster StarTV. Along with wire service news from Asia, the
site last week offered Asian music videos, clips from a supermodel
contest and an interview with actress Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which has advertised on billboards, saw traffic jump
from 109,000 unique users in April to 376,000 in May, reaching
about 0.5 percent of the total number of Internet users, according
to PC Data Online.
</P>
<P>
   The other site, AsianAvenue.com, launched in 1997 in New York,
had 170,000 unique users in May, up from 111,000 the month before.
AsianConnections.com, of Newport Beach, offers articles by famed
former Rolling Stone editor Ben Fong-Torres and popular TV chef
Martin Yan. And last week, visitors would have found links to
exclusive video interviews with ``Mission: Impossible 2'' director
John Woo and ``Shanghai Noon'' star Jackie Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Some are targeting a narrow audience. Onna.com, a San Francisco
company that had a ``soft launch'' of its site in May, hopes to
attract an audience from the 6.4 million Japanese-speaking women
living in Japan who use the Web, said founder Hiroko Shimo.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose name translates to ``woman'' in Japanese,
decided to base operations locally because technology investors and
marketers who want to reach the target audience are here, Shimo
said.
</P>
<P>
   AsianScene.com Inc. of San Francisco, which says it has counted
about 700,000 unique users since its launch in August 1998, targets
``generation Y Asians of ages 15-25'' with information about
everything ``from car shows to parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Startup AsiaDera.com of Fremont, Calif., also wanted to target a
specific audience, the Filipino American market, said founder
Armand Cacacho.
</P>
<P>
   But Cacacho, whose main business is construction management,
said that in a time when big dot-coms are failing, he feels the
pressure from investors to show the site can generate money and not
just eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   So the site now sells toys, and Cacacho is working on deals with
real estate agents to list homes. AsiaDera.com also offers free
Internet access and long-distance Internet phone service and
features video from television networks in the Philippines, Hong
Kong, Singapore and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules have changed,'' Cacacho said. ``If you don't have
sales, you don't have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And Forrester's Walsh said she so far has not seen anything to
indicate that Web sites targeting Asian Americans will make money.
She said aOnline might have a chance because, like African American
media company BET.com, it can leverage the drawing power of its
print publication.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, she said sites have to target a specific group
to succeed, and Walsh said even Onna.com's focus isn't narrow
enough. She said ethnic Web sites that are as narrowly focused as
one for 16-to-28-year-olds who like a certain type of music might
stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why there's more of an explosion of noncommercial
``blogs'' that deal with such topics as lifestyles, imported cars
and Asian American fashion models, said AArising's Wong, who adds
about eight to 10 new links every three days on his site, launched
in the now-ancient Web days of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find them much more compelling,'' Wong said. ``That's where
the biggest growth has been, but it's not necessarily where you're
going to make any money.''

 &HT;    New Web effort helps monitor chronic diseases
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick quiz: true or false?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the U.S. population suffers from some form of
chronic disease: asthma, auto-immune problems, birth defects,
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to chemical changes in the environment _ industrial
solvents, tobacco smoke, pesticides, smog _ are believed to foster
development of some chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   There is no national system for tracking the occurrence of most
chronic diseases, and no statistical means of comparing
environmental problems with rates of chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Answers: True, true and true _ and deeply problematic.
Infectious diseases, from HIV/
</P>
<P>
   AIDS to tuberculosis to E. coli O157:H7, are monitored by local
and state health departments and the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Though the CDC tracks a number of chronic
diseases such as asthma and cancer, there is no comparable local or
state structure feeding it more detailed data.
</P>
<P>
   A Web-based effort has set out to change that. Health Track
(health-track.org), a joint project of the Pew Charitable Trusts
and Georgetown University, is an elegantly designed,
easy-to-navigate site with a definite point of view: that chronic
disease problems should be monitored nationally and locally, and
that the Internet provides the means to do it. The effort, which
recently began national newspaper advertising, offers downloadable
research reports, links to national organizations and scorecards on
local environmental conditions.

CYBERPRIVACY CATCHES THE EYE OF CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANNE E. KORNBLUT   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of piecemeal proposals to safeguard
personal information on the Internet, Congress is beginning to
seriously address the concept of ``online privacy.'' It is
considering an array of legislation that could dramatically
increase the rights of consumers who release personal details into
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 privacy bills are pending in the House and Senate, and
the idea of privacy, registering in the polls as a top concern
among Americans, is also making its way into the presidential
debate. Democrats and Republicans are touting the same goal:
Reassuring the public that private information, from CD purchases
to medical records, will not be misused.
</P>
<P>
   Although few expect any laws to pass this year _ and skeptics
view many of the current efforts as part of an election-year ploy _
the proposals have begun gaining momentum in recent weeks, through
congressional hearings, federal studies, and informal political
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Republican champions of e-commerce, including
legislators who oppose a sales tax on the Internet, are
contemplating whether new laws are needed to control the
trafficking of consumer information online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that some of the practices on
the Internet are not what most Americans would want done with their
private information,'' said Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John
S. McCain, an Arizona Republican who held privacy hearings last
week and is shaping online privacy legislation of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The current political debate divides along deceptively simple
lines: Should consumers have to ``opt out,'' informing companies
that they would rather not have their personal information divulged
elsewhere? Should online companies have to ask permission first,
requiring customers to ``opt in'' to a consent agreement that frees
their information for use in the public domain? Or should the
current system, in which information moves through cyberspace
virtually unrestricted, remain intact?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the political issue is broader and more complicated,
affecting information exchanges on and off the Internet. Also, it
is fertile political ground, touching on common anxieties among
average Americans about what happens when they share their names
and interests.
</P>
<P>
   Direct-marketing firms have always kept dossiers on consumer
habits in order to target people for specific products. The
Internet makes that process easier and more immediate. Consumers
who browse the Web now have their habits tracked, thanks to small
files known as ``cookies'' that are transferred from certain Web
sites to the consumer's computer hard drive while the user is
online. The cookies create a roadmap of the user's online browsing
habits, allowing companies to compile information on what the
consumer is interested in looking at and buying. Although cookies
can be removed from a user's hard drive, people who intentionally
disable their computer's ability to accept cookies are often denied
access to some Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The information gathered by using cookies allows advertisers to
know whom to pursue, an efficient marketing device that industry
leaders say is part of what keeps the Internet free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a great deal is at stake for online companies, some
of which have based their success on the ability to gather consumer
information freely in cyberspace. Many leading online firms say
they are worried about consumer confidence enough to help them
ensure their privacy , and see political motivations behind the
current flurry of privacy discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Even some companies that would be largely unhampered by federal
regulation are not convinced it would work. Daniel Jay, chief
technology officer of Engage, an Andover firm that has developed
privacy software allowing online marketers to track consumers
anonymously, said it would be ``preferable to figure out how to do
it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer that a combination of technology and
self-regulation is the only practical solution,'' Jay said. ``How
do we hire enough policemen to police the Net?''
</P>
<P>
   That position leaves many legislators in Washington pulled by
opposing forces: consumers, who say they favor greater protections,
and Internet companies, which insist they cannot flourish in a
regulated environment and promise to eventually protect consumer
privacy themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, at least, most legislators say they support privacy
protections. The two leadiing presidential candidates have come out
in favor of the general idea of privacy in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, is a
self-described ``privacy rights person,'' according to a spokesman.
Vice President Al Gore has been more explicit about his views.
According to an account of his meeting with the New York Times
editorial board meeting last week, Gore said consumers should be
able to expect that personal information ``will remain private
unless they affirmatively give up that right,'' a strict
interpretation of the current privacy bills under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Gore held a press conference to announce
that he would ``protect personal privacy'' by making the sale of
Social Security numbers illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush plans to unveil a detailed privacy platform by November.
</P>
<P>
   But the political debate is often muddied because all sides say
they want privacy rights for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   How to achieve that is the dilemma for many legislators,
especially because the answer may involve technological advances on
the Internet, a medium most politicians have only begun to
understand themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of confusion,'' said Robert Ellis Smith,
publisher of Privacy Journal, a Providence, R.I. newsletter that
examines privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest fear politicians have. Politicians say, `Oh
my gosh, I don't understand the Internet, I don't want to be
charged with killing it,' '' said Representative Edward J. Markey,
Democrat of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators, including Markey, have advocated federal
privacy regulation for years. Many also believe privacy rules
should vary, depending on what information is at stake. Release of
financial and medical records, for example, has drawn intense
attention.
</P>
<P>
   One financial services bill in particular has come under
scrutiny: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill of 1999, which approved giant
banking mergers, but also gave consumers the option of opting out
of information-sharing agreements. Under the bill, a bank that
merges with an insurance firm would be allowed to pool the checking
account information of its customers with the new subsidiary,
unless individual customers actively request the bank not disclose
such details.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates see that system as weak, placing too much
burden on customers to read confusing legal notifications and
locate opt-out features on a Web site. To toughen the standard,
several bills, two of them sponsored by Markey, have been
introduced: bills requiring an opt-in model for banking and medical
records.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several states, including Massachusetts, are
considering enacting privacy laws to safeguard consumers while
Congress continues its debate. But advocates of stricter privacy
protections at the state level say that a federal standard would be
preferable to a hodge-podge of state laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boundaries, in our world, are sort of irrelevant lately, with
the global economy,'' said Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Jane
Swift, who supports an opt-in model for the most sensitive records.
</P>
<P>
   Swift, who prides herself on being a champion of privacy rights,
this year served on a Federal Trade Commission panel that led to
one of the most scathing congressional reports on the lack of
online privacy. Saying that only 20 percent of online companies
conform to four commonly accepted standards _ notifying consumers
of how information will be used, giving consumers a choice in the
matter, making security practices clear, and allowing consumers
access to their own records for correction or deletion _ the FTC
recommended that Congress act on privacy legislation. That report
has added momentum to the political privacy debate.
</P>
<P>
   The debate seems to be everywhere in Washington these days. Two
hearings were held in Congress last week. Dozens of privacy bills
are expected to be unveiled before the end of the year. Among them
is a proposal by Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachussetts,
to require a minimal effort by companies: disclosing privacy
policies on Web sites. Kerry's proposal also calls for a 12-month
privacy commission to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, companies like Engage are continuing to develop
software to keep consumer identities separate from their marketing
habits, a practice that allows targeted advertising without
compromising privacy. Nearly a dozen Web sites have sprung up
solely to provide privacy to consumers, allowing users to surf the
Web through a third-party site that shields their identities.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry leaders hope the delay in Washington will buy
enough time for online companies to solve the privacy issue
themselves. But the growing political drumbeat is unlikely to
subside before November, and privacy advocates are hoping that will
draw support for legislation by next year. They also believe the
concept of privacy will become increasingly easy for Americans to
understand, even if the technology involved is not.

&HT;     POLITICAL PARTIES HOPING TO LURE VOTERS TO LOG ON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By KIM COBB    c.2000 Houston Chronicle   If an Internet
<TEXT>
service provider furnishes a door to the World Wide Web, the
doorkeeper also has the opportunity to influence the opinions of
those who travel through it.
<P>
   With that in mind, the national committees for the Democratic
and Republican parties are trying to attract Web surfers to
Internet portals that launch computer users onto the Web through a
kind of partisan filter _ Web pages tailored to deliver party
messages wrapped around the usual links to news, sports and chat
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   When the Democrats unveiled www.freeDEM.com June 8, party
officials stressed that their Internet access and e-mail services
would be free to anyone, regardless of party affiliation
(advertising on the site pays for the service). The Democrats
crowed that freeDEM would help bridge the so-called ``digital
divide'' between those who can afford to get on line and those who
can't.
</P>
<P>
   But the party's primary goal is to reach out to uncommitted
voters, to expose people to the Democratic message who might not
otherwise seek it.
</P>
<P>
   Log on to freeDEM, and the message at the top of its red, white
and blue page is, ``brought to you by the Democratic National
Committee.'' Links to the Democratic National Committee, the Gore
presidential campaign and other Democratic sites are featured
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   But the lion's share of the site is nonpolitical _ the links to
general interest news, shopping, weather, sports and finance that
the average computer user demands.
</P>
<P>
   The comparable Republican site looks similar, but users of
www.GOPnet.com pay a monthly fee for its Internet access service.
GOP officials say the GOPnet site is designed to serve as an
on-line community for the party faithful, not as a recruitment
tool.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, GOPnet is more overtly partisan, its content chosen
to spotlight Republican issues. The GOP site features commentaries
by Republican congressional leaders and even takes jabs at the
opposition through links like ``Gore Gaffes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some theorize the advent of such sites could be a powerful tool
in connecting voters to candidates, like television did in the
1960s. But the trick is generating interest in politics when
Internet browsers have so many other trails they can follow.
</P>
<P>
   Users of both sites can ``customize'' certain selections to
reflect their personal interests, but a certain percentage of
political ``spin'' will be delivered or offered as links to every
user. And users of both sites get the same promise: no political
mail and no solicitations for funds, unless the user requests it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between the Republicans and us is they're not
trying to get as many people on line as possible, they're trying to
raise as much money as possible,'' said Democratic National
Committee Chairman Joe Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC is not trying to ``wire'' everyone in the United States,
countered RNC deputy chief of staff Larry Purpuro, because the
private sector is doing a pretty good job of it. And a majority of
Republicans are already on line, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We launched GOPnet in Silicon Valley in January,'' said
Purpuro. ``The Democrats are only seven or eight months behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew countered that the Web sites should not be judged as
competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always want to make it look like a horse race _ who's got
the best site, who was there first,'' Andrew said. ``What's
important is: Are you reaching the audience you want?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reform Party officials are also investigating the use of a
similar political portal to reach their audience but won't make a
decision until after their national convention in Long Beach,
Calif., in August, a party spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies providing the Internet connections to subscribers
at freeDEM and GOPnet are what's known as ``affinity'' providers,
who design portals aimed at specific slices of the Internet
population. Instead of building a subscriber list from the ground
up (the competition is already pretty fierce), affinity providers
approach existing organizations and associations and build portals
designed to appeal to their members.
</P>
<P>
   For example, iBelong, the Internet service provider for freeDEM,
also provides similar portals for the AFL-CIO and National
Federation of Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first presidential election in the Internet age,''
said Bob Viney, who supervises the freeDEM page for iBelong. ``As
Joe Andrew said: Think back to the '60s when Kennedy first used
television. We're really at the same kind of transformation of the
election process. It will forever be different ...because of the
power of the Internet to connect voters and candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would be difficult for either freeDEM or GOPnet to make
major inroads in molding public opinion because of the vast number
of choices people have in a diverse communications marketplace,
said Tom Patterson, professor at Harvard University's JFK School of
Government.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has been conducting surveys on Internet use and
election politics during the current campaign cycle. He finds that
while large numbers of Americans are on line, few are using the Web
to keep abreast of politics.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone survey of 1,000 adults conducted May 3-7, 75
percent who described themselves as Republicans said they had
Internet access either at home or at work. Sixty-four percent of
independents reported having access, compared with 57 percent of
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But only 9 percent of Republicans said they had acquired
information about the presidential campaign from the Internet in
the 24 hours preceding the May survey. Seven percent of Democrats
said they'd used the Web to research the presidential campaign, as
did 4 percent of Independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's underestimated about the Internet is if you're not
interested in public affairs and politics ... you may take a quick
glance (at a site) but you don't stay,'' Patterson said. ``And I
think that's the real challenge that faces people on the Internet.
Not providing access, but building interest.''

&HT;     VISIT TO AMERICA OFFERS A TASTE OF THAILAND

<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ For all Aziz Ponary Mlima knew, the fried
tofu and spring rolls served at the cocktail party were
quintessential American fare. After all, this was his first trip to
the United States and he had only seen the John F. Kennedy Airport,
downtown Schenectady and points in between.
</P>
<P>
   A native of the East African nation of Tanzania, now with the
Goteborg University in Sweden, Mlima was one of more than 200 of
the world's top economists attending the North American
Productivity Workshop, held recently at Union College. The opening
banquet of the three-day seminar, as Mlima would learn somewhere
between the hors d'oeuvres and first entree course, was not
American food, but authentic Thai cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Providing a six-course, 13-dish Asian repast as the opening
meal, was one of many ways organizers at the small private college
made a bookish seminar and trip to Schenectady attractive to the
attendees from all parts of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Suthathip (Lek) Yaisawarng, chairwoman of the college's
department of economics, co-chair of the event and a native of
Bangkok, spent hours with the school's dining services staff
teaching the finer points of cooking with ingredients such as black
fungus (mushrooms) and makrood (kaffir lime leaves).
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked to cook when I was child,'' said Yaisawarng, standing
in the giant white tent erected for the feast in front of the Nott
Memorial on the Union campus. ``I didn't know that I'd need to come
back to it, and in such quantities!''
</P>
<P>
   But early in the evening, dinner was proving to be a highlight
of the workshop.
</P>
<P>
   As a group of Union professors played Dixieland jazz, attendees
juggled glasses of wine or bottles of beer and jostled each other
for plates of fish cakes with cucumber sauce. They conversed in
English, but the language came with a variety of heavy accents,
including German, French, Australian, Arab, and even Southern. The
delegates hailed from at least 30 countries, including New Zealand,
Bangladesh, Hungary, Belgium and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Cocktail hour was followed by a soup course, which, though
plenty spicy for some, was tame by Nostratollah Nafar's standards.
Nafar, a professor at Allameh Tabatabai University in Tehran, Iran,
added ground chili peppers by the tablespoon to his bowl.
</P>
<P>
   More familiar with both Asian and American cuisine than Mlima,
Nafar explained, ``Chinese food not hot, it's sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   It is important that people eat together, meet socially and form
personal relationships at events like this so when they get into a
session, they are more likely to open up and make the conference
more productive, said Yaisawarng.
</P>
<P>
   If Mlima was disappointed to not be dining on New York strip
steaks and New England clam chowder at his first major feast in
America, it didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   As the servers brought bowls of lime sorbet between entree
courses, Nafar exclaimed, ``Here's American food _ ice cream!''

A RUTHLESS TIGER LEADS A LONG BATTLE AGAINST SRI LANKA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ Few have seen him, but a nation fears him.
</P>
<P>
   He learned military strategy from West Point manuals, at secret
Indian training camps, and from Clint Eastwood videos. He
cultivated savage endurance by poking pins under his nails, and
schooled himself to be merciless by torturing insects to death with
needles.
</P>
<P>
   He commands cultish devotion from followers, although most have
never met him. Their reward for accepting a suicide mission is a
first and last supper with the man they call Thavalar, ``The
Leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Short, pudgy-faced, and smiling in a photo on a Web site for his
cause, Velupillai Prabhakaran may not look like a mastermind of
assassinations of presidents, prime ministers, and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But Prabhakaran, a 45-year-old guerrilla leader who is fighting
for a homeland, or eelam, for the Tamil minority on this island, is
as ruthless and elusive as Cambodia's Pol Pot, and as inspiring to
his followers as Cuba's Che Guevara. It has been years since he
granted any journalist an interview.
</P>
<P>
   His 5,000 to 10,000 male and female guerrillas have been a
relentless, untamable adversary for Sri Lanka's military of 120,000
to 140,000 soldiers. Even their enemies say the Tigers are stronger
now than at any time since the Tamil separatist movement was
founded in 1972. Sri Lanka's armed forces, meanwhile, seem to be at
their most beleaguered.
</P>
<P>
   Since late last year, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have
overrun army bases and seized artillery, have gained ground in
northern and eastern Sri Lanka, and have launched suicide bomb
attacks, such as one that blinded the president in one eye and
killed a Cabinet minister, police officers, and dozens of
bystanders in December.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the rebels nearly captured Jaffna, the northern city
at the heart of the would-be Tamil state, after they lost it to
government forces five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Sri Lankan military officials say they have not been more
worried in 17 years of this war between the Hindu Tamils and the
largely Buddhist Sinhalese, whichhas claimed more than 62,000
lives. Since the Tigers abandoned peace negotiations and broke a
truce five years ago, Sri Lanka's president, Chandrika Kumaratunga,
has vowed to ``wage war for peace.'' But the government's refusal
to carve up this island country, the size of West Virginia, to
create a Tamil state has hardened Prabhakaran's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Quite possibly the most disciplined and well-funded guerrilla
force in the world, the Tigers are described by diplomats as more
systematic and callous than the Irish Republican Army, more willing
to die for their cause than the Middle East's Hezbollah. Outlawed
as a terrorist organization in the United States and India as well
as in Sri Lanka, the Tigers have become among the biggest
nongovernmental arms buyers in Southeast Asia. Supported by
donations from Sri Lankan Tamil emigres and revenue from commercial
enterprises, the Tigers are also alleged to have profited from drug
trafficking, though that has not been proved.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the main reason for the movement's effectiveness is
neither money nor weaponry, but blind dedication to an idea, and to
the man behind it.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, many Tamils have nursed deep resentment against
perceived discrimination and persecution by the majority Sinhalese.
But the ``Tamil cause'' is complex and nuanced, and by no means do
Prabhakaran and the Tigers represent all Tamils, who make up 18
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Ceylon Tamils, who claim roots on the island for 1,500 years,
tend to want an independent homeland, while so-called Indian
Tamils, whose ancestors came to work on tea plantations in the
1800's, tend to favor national unity. Even among those who want a
Tamil state, many are appalled by the Tigers' methods and bemoan
that people on both sides are susffering needlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prabhakaran is single-minded, like a horse with blinders on.
He cares more about the Tigers than about the Tamil cause,''
Dharmalingam Sithadthan, president of the Peoples' Liberation
Organization of Tamil Eelam, said sadly. A former Tamil militant
who joined the democratic opposition, Sithadthan is on the Tigers'
hit list, he said, ``because anyone who opposes the LTTE is
considered a traitor to the Tamil cause.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Growing rebel support &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Tamil militants were a fringe movement of
radicals and Marxists. But in 1983, the cause began gaining wider
support after authorities allowed rampaging Sinhalese mobs to kill
hundreds of Tamils and to firebomb thousands of Tamil businesses
and homes in retaliation for a Tiger attack that killed 13
Sinhalese soldiers. In the years since, the Tigers have honed a
almost-religious dedication that would be hard for any army to
match. A Sri Lankan cabinet minister put it simply: ``We fight to
live. They fight to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Each fighter _ about half are women _ is given a nom de guerre
and forbidden to smoke, drink, or have sex. They are permitted to
marry at age 23, but only after five years of service. They take a
vow to die rather than be captured and wear cyanide capsules on
strings around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Prabhakaran's Tigers systematically wiped out
rival groups of Tamil militants as well as moderates who favored a
political settlement. Tamils seen as traitors were lynched.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he feels somebody is thinking against him, the next moment
they are eliminated. The LTTE feels there must be only one
leadership, and Prabhakaran doesn't want anybody who's stronger
than he is,'' said K. Suresh Premachandran, secretary general of
the Eeelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front and a former
militant who fled Jaffna after the Tigers killed hundreds of
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Premachandran said the government has unwittingly built support
for the Tigers by ignoring the demands of Tamil leaders like
himself who laid down arms to join the political mainstream. ``If
the government wants an alternative to the LTTE, they should treat
democratic Tamil parties better. People now believe the government
only understands the language of war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, meanwhile, have created a virtual global corporation
to fund that war, including about 11 cargo freighters, according to
a leading shipping insurer. They operate 45 offices in more than 40
countries _ more than the number of Sri Lankan embassies.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers reputedly raise more than $1 million a month from
voluntary and pressured contributions from many of the more than
500,000 Tamils who fled Sri Lanka after the 1983 riots. After Tiger
fighters overran a key army base in April, elated Tamils are
reported to have made $80 million in congratulatory pledges and
gifts, including a BMW from a supporter in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A former Sri Lankan Air Force commander, Oliver Ranasinghe,
acknowledged that accidental killings of civilians by government
bombs have driven many Tamils into the arms of the Tigers. ``That's
our fault . . . there are mistakes made because we don't have the
proper equipment,'' he conceded. But the LTTE, he asserted, places
its camps close to villages to use Tamil civilians as human
shields. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Politicians blamed
</P>
<P>
   Ranasinghe and others complain that the war has been mismanaged
by politicians who tied the hands of the military. Purchases of
desperately-needed weapons have been delayed, he and other
commanders said. Several arms dealers said the purchases have been
haphazard in times of crisis, leaving Sri Lankan forces with
mismatched equipment and bargain-basement models.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian leaders retort that they had to delay or cancel arms
deals because corrupt officers were taking a cut. They have also
limited military purchases in order to maintain social programs
that have endowed this country with some of the highest rates of
literacy and life expectancy in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   The recent Tiger victories are also hard to explain entirely as
a matter of inadequate government weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The army took nearly a year to gain control of huge swath of
land in the north, but it lost it in four days of Tiger assaults
last November. An even bigger shock came two months ago with the
Tiger victory at Elephant Pass, a key base blocking the neck of the
Jaffna peninsula that had been declared impregnable by US special
forces advisers, according to military sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, with an estimated 1,800 guerrillas, managed to rout
as many as 12,000 soldiers by cutting off their water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Low morale is a natural outgrowth of a war that seems unwinnable
against an opponent willing to die and take no prisoners, said
Paikiasothy Saravanumuttu, executive director of the Centre for
Policy Alternatives. ``Does the average Sri Lankan soldier really
know what he is fighting for?''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Sri Lanka is holding its ground, following
emergency arms purchases last month and a full-court press to hold
Jaffna. But long term, the pendulum is likely to swing. That has
some here saying the international community should pressure Sri
Lanka to offer an autonomy package to Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't kill them, you have to deal with them, and if you
have to deal with them, you can't set the terms alone,''
Saravanamuttu said.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there is no sign that the government will grant the
Tigers' demand for a homeland _ or that Prabhakaran will accept
anything less.

STUDENTS ENJOY FREE TRIP TO ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHOSHANA LONDON SAPPIR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ At the age of 19, Julie Aronow-Frieden, a theater
student at Northeastern University, has traveled to places as
remote as Uzbekistan, India, Turkey and Thailand, but had never
felt the desire to visit her religious homeland, Israel. Halfway
through a 10-day, all-expenses-paid trip aimed at reconnecting her
to her Jewish roots, however, Aronow-Frieden is thinking about
joining the Israeli Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt I had to sweep my religion under the carpet,''
said the freckled native of Tempe, Ariz., during a tour of Israeli
national monuments in Jerusalem. ``I hardly knew any Jewish people.
I always felt alone. Here I feel completely connected. I can't even
describe it. I don't have to feel ashamed anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Aronow-Frieden is one of 8,000 students to date who have been
the beneficiaries of an ambitious $210 million, five-year program
by Jewish philanthropists, the government of Israel and Jewish
communities worldwide, whose goal is to spur a Jewish revival by
providing a free educational trip to Israel for every Jewish person
between the ages of 15 and 26.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Birthright Israel,'' the program is a response to the
assimilation of Jews worldwide into secular societies, which has
been accompanied by a sharp decline of Jewish affiliation in the
last decades. A key statistic that alarms Jewish community leaders
is the rate of intermarriage, which some studies say exceeds 50
percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for many kids this is the last Jewish hope,'' said
Michael Steinhardt of New York, a retired investment manager who
co-sponsors Birthright with Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of
Seagram Co. ``Ten intensive days can really change lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In Aronow-Frieden's case, they certainly might.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a friend who went to Israel and served in the army,''
she said, wiping her face as sweat mingled with tears of emotion.
``I used to make fun of him. Now I want to do it too. I picked up a
brochure. I would like to come next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, launched last December, has sparked controversy in
the Jewish community worldwide and in Israel. Critics wonder
whether a crash course on Jewish identity can really curb the
historic tides that pull Jewish youth towards assimilation. The
critics ask whether the funds could be more effectively applied to
existing educational programs, or to establishing new ones.
Israelis have questioned the government's contribution of $70
million when there are many needy people in their own country.
</P>
<P>
   World Jewish Congress Chairman Isi Liebler called the Birthright
Israel concept ``bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That Jews are in deep trouble in the Diaspora, especially in
America, goes without saying,'' he wrote in the Jewish World
Review. ``Devoted, well-meaning American Jewish philanthropists,
desperate for solutions, have mistakenly adopted the quick fix: a
free trip for every youngster to overcome all of the problems of
Jewish identity and miraculously generate a Jewish renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   Birthright officials said their follow-up evaluations have
already shown the program to be a great success: some 10 percent of
participants in the first round of trips last winter, which brought
5,000 students, plan to come back to Israel this summer. The Hillel
organization, which provides Jewish social and educational programs
on college campuses across the United States and in other
countries, has had to expand quickly to accommodate a sharp rise in
interest, and large numbers of Birthright participants have
enrolled in Jewish studies courses when they returned to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to me the money is not wasted if even 10 percent
of these kids get involved,'' said Steinhardt, who would like to
bring some 200,000 young Jews to Israel in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-day tours, which draw on a long tradition of Israel tours
for young Jews, are carefully designed to provide balanced doses of
education, fun, and spiritual awakening ``to get students thinking
about their Jewishness and to fuse education with recreation,'' in
the words of a Birthright brochure. No Birthright trip is complete
without meetings with young Israelis, who, in their late teens and
early 20s, are likely to be in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting Israelis our age and seeing their passion for their
country really brought it all home for me,'' said Makenzie Mazin,
22, another member of the Northeastern group. ``I never once
thought about coming to Israel. But seeing those soldiers, and kids
who immigrated from Ethiopia, and people praying at the wall has
made me want to know more about my Jewishness.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazin is just the kind of young Jew Birthright seeks to attract.
To qualify for the trip, applicants have to be Jews who have never
been on a peer-trip to Israel. Priority is given to those who are
not affiliated with any Jewish organization. Seventy-five percent
of participants are from North America.
</P>
<P>
   Birthright recruits applicants through letters to Jewish
students, conversations with Jewish professors, posters, e-mail,
and word of mouth. A key word in the pitch is ``free.''
</P>
<P>
   Birthright adopts an inclusive definition of ``Jewish,'' a
deeply divisive question within the Jewish community. According to
Israeli law, which follows the Orthodox doctrine, Mazin, for
instance, does not qualify. Her father is Jewish and her Catholic
mother ``converted, but not ceremonially, just in her faith,''
Mazin said. Israel considers only the child of a Jewish mother or
someone who converted according to religious law to be a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say they do not probe applicants' Jewish backgrounds
and are aware that a high number of participants are children of
mixed marriages, which is exactly the phenomenon the program seeks
to combat.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Meltzer, director of Hillel at Northeastern, who
accompanied the 22 students on the trip, considered the impact the
trip might have:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, they'll think twice before dating someone who is
not Jewish.''

&HT;     SOY SAUCE: MORE THAN JUST TABLE DRESSING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SANFORD NOWLIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just for a moment, forget lemon grass, hoisin sauce and
fermented black beans. Put fish sauce and five-spice powder in the
back of your mind as well.
</P>
<P>
   The first Asian seasoning most Americans have any exposure to is
soy sauce, a staple on virtually every Chinese restaurant table and
in most kitchen cupboards.
</P>
<P>
   It has been around in the United States since the 1800s, making
it one of the least exotic, yet also one of the least understood,
Asian ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Soy sauce comes in different varieties _ some spiked with added
flavors such as mushroom, for example _ in different strengths, and
in varying degrees of quality.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding this essential Asian ingredient is an important
step to unlocking the cuisines of the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can taste the differences between red wines you can
taste the differences between soy sauces,'' said Barbara Tropp, a
California restaurateur and author of the ``China Moon Cookbook.''
``If it's good soy sauce, it tastes round _ not just salty _ and,
like wine, has a good beginning, middle and finish.''
</P>
<P>
   The origins of soy sauce date back more than 2,500 years, making
it one of the world's oldest condiments.
</P>
<P>
   The prehistoric people of Asia preserved meat and fish by
salt-packing them, which drew out the moisture. The resulting salty
juices from the meat were then used to season foods or form the
base for sauces or soups.
</P>
<P>
   Later, with the rise of Buddhism, and its vegetarian diet, the
need arose for an alternate condiment to take the place of the
salty, meaty sauce. That substitute, developed by Chinese monks,
was a salty paste of fermented grains, which eventually evolved
into soy sauce and spread through much of the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Today, quality soy sauces are prepared, much as they were
hundreds of years ago, by combining soybeans and wheat with a
special mold, then fermenting them with water and salt for several
months. At the end of the process, the liquid is separated from
solid materials, filtered and bottled.
</P>
<P>
   That fermentation process gives soy sauce depth, mellowness and
flavor-enhancing qualities, making it much more than simply a
substitute for salt, as many Western cooks treat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly adds character to the sauce,'' said Dan Miller,
administration manager for sauce-maker Kikkoman's U.S. production
facility in Walworth, Wis. ``That's one of the advantages to our
product. It not only has its own flavor but enhances the flavors of
the foods that are being prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all soy sauces undergo a natural brewing process, however.
</P>
<P>
   Low-quality sauces, generally produced in the United States, are
chemically created and forgo the lengthy aging process.
</P>
<P>
   Those sauces, which use adjunct ingredients such as hydrolyzed
vegetable protein and caramel coloring, lack the depth of taste of
traditionally fermented soy sauce, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The taste of these sauces often is harshly salty, chemical and
overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can really tell the difference,'' said Ming Tsai, host of
the Food Network's ``East Meets West'' and owner of the Blue Ginger
restaurant in Wellesley, Mass. ``Fermented soy sauce smells
pleasant and slightly sweet; the other kind smells like a chemical
factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Tropp says: ``It's the difference between a bottle of
moonshine and a bottle of Mondavi.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly used quality soy sauces are Japanese and
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   In Chinese cooking, the two principal types of soy sauce are
categorized as light and dark. Confusingly (at least for Western
chefs), light soy sauce is often labeled ``superior soy,'' while
the dark is labeled ``soy superior.''
</P>
<P>
   Light sauce, which is the saltier of the two, is lighter in
color and thinner. It's used more frequently in cooking stir fries
and other dishes and as a table condiment.
</P>
<P>
   Dark soy sauce is aged longer and contains molasses, giving it a
darker color and more pungent smell. Dark soy sauce is usually
reserved for use in braised and barbecued dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese recipes sometimes call for mushroom- or shrimp-flavored
soy sauces that are generally available at Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Japanese soy sauce is less salty and often sweeter than
its Chinese cousin.
</P>
<P>
   And like China, Japan also produces other soy sauce varieties
such as a wheat-free variety called Tamari. Another is white soy
sauce, a delicately flavored, amber-colored variety that's heavier
on wheat than soy.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese cookbooks and chefs caution against using Japanese
soy sauce in Chinese recipes and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   However, many Asian chefs in the United States _ including those
who work in Chinese cuisine _ stand behind the Japanese brands,
saying they tend to have better quality control and therefore a
more consistent flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Kikkoman, the soy sauce with the largest U.S. market share, is
the overwhelming favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kikkoman is usually my favorite because it's less salty,''
said Nicole Routhier, the Houston-based author of ``Foods of
Vietnam.'' ``The Chinese and Vietnamese varieties can be very
potent and overpowering. Kikkoman has a more balanced flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Tropp said those who insist on buying a Chinese sauce might try
the Pearl River Bridge brand available at many Asian groceries. But
even that has been ``fraught with difficulties'' of inconsistency,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tsai said he doesn't buy the argument that Japanese soy
sauce shouldn't be used in other types of Asian cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's like saying `don't use California wine in a
French recipe,''' Tsai said.

LENO'S INNER CHILD INDULGES IN RARE CARS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ The man cannot contain the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Leno opens the door to a 1956 Chrysler Imperial to show off
a really unusual automotive option _ a record player built into the
dashboard _ and the boy within him jumps out. Blue eyes sparkling,
he bursts into hearty song: ``Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild
frontier . . .''
</P>
<P>
   In their day, the records that fit the dashboard phonograph
could be purchased only from Chrysler, and Leno has been able to
acquire only two: the Davy Crockett theme song and music from the
movie ``The Pajama Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it Jay's Playhouse, two enormous garages near the airport
here that hold his fabulous and eclectic gathering of things
automotive: classic cars, souped-up cars, muscle cars, sports cars,
old race cars, motorcycles, petrobilia, automobilia, toys, posters,
badges.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a public place. Here one finds the private side of the
public man. When he is not on the set of the ``Tonight'' show, or
doing a standup routine in Las Vegas, this is where he likes to
hang out. He comes here almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go out to eat. I don't go out to clubs,'' says Leno,
dressed in his perpetual private-time outfit of denim shirt and
jeans. ``This is what I like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   David Brownell, former editor of Hemmings Motor News magazine,
the bible for auto fanatics, says Leno is doing what he likes quite
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay's got some of the best examples of desirable cars and
motorcycles in the country,'' says Brownell, and they range from
classically restored or preserved to mechanically unique.
</P>
<P>
   Leno walks to a 1934 Rolls-Royce Phantom II, its chassis fitted
with a wood-and-metal body that looks like a giant open cockpit
racer. It is powered by a 27-liter Merlin aircraft engine that
cranks out 1,000 horsepower. It is a car, he says, that ``starts to
walk around on you'' once you get it up over 120 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez, that's fast,'' he says of the car. It will not be the
last time he uses the phrase in a tour of his immaculate garages.
</P>
<P>
   This is where he comes to dwell in a quiet place, paradoxically
finding relaxation amid the thundering and thumping engines and the
metal-on-metal cacophony of a garage.
</P>
<P>
   He comes to tinker and tune, to talk technology with some of the
specialists with whom he has surrounded himself to help maintain
and preserve rare cars, and to relive childhood fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all the cars I used to read about when I was a
kid,'' he says, acknowledging that he never dreamed he would
someday be able to own them. But through talent, hard work, and
good fortune, they are his.
</P>
<P>
   They are the tangible dreams of a boy who grew up in Andover and
who once worked prepping new autos at Foreign Motors on
Commonwealth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   He's owned cars and motorcycles since his teens when, he says,
he worked at a McDonald's and at the garage while other kids played
sports. He sometimes owned several vehicles at a time, even then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had the stuff,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he has much more stuff. But he doesn't call what his
garages house a collection. He will not call himself a collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of pick them up here and there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And don't ask him how many cars and motorcycles he has, or what
they are worth. Because this is not about numbers to Leno.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be, people would come up to you and ask, `What is
it?' '' when you had a special car, Leno complains. ``Now they ask,
`How much is it worth?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Leno's penchant for autos is well known, particularly in the
world of aficionados. Some people, he says, have tried to use his
name, implying that he was interested in what they were selling, to
drive up their prices to other buyers. He has heard reports of Leno
sightings at auctions, hat pulled down, jacket collar rolled up, as
he quietly bid up the prices.
</P>
<P>
   But he buys mostly through clubs and collectors, he says. He is
not out to drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   To Leno, cars are about fun and function: everything he owns, he
drives. Or they can be about pedigree, as in a Stutz racer with a
proven track record, or about mechanical challenge, such as fitting
a V-12 Jaguar engine into an XKE that originally had a V-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all interests me,'' he says. ``I like stuff that's
technologically interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   He walks to the side of a 1925 Brough Superior motorcycle that
had been raced on the Isle of Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were the Vincent Black Shadows before there were Vincent
Black Shadows,'' he says, referring to the legendary British
motorcycle of the 1950s that came with instructions to shift into
high gear at 110 miles per hour. He's got several Broughs, a whole
parcel of Vincents _ including an ugly and rare shrouded Vincent
Black Knight _ and other motorcycles: Harley-Davidson, Triumph,
Ducati, Agusta, and Henderson among them.
</P>
<P>
   The car collection is impressively eclectic: Bugati, Duesenberg,
Stutz, Jaguar, Bentley, Stanley, Baker Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Perched among the Duesenbergs is an aerodynamic Duesenberg
coupe, its flowing lines in sharp contrast to the solid,
rectangular look of most of its mates. In the old days, when you
bought a Duesenberg, you bought a ready-to-roll chassis. You went
to a coachmaker for the body. The scion of the Eli Lilly drug
empire had this aerodynamic coupe constructed; it is a huge
automobile, though it only seats two people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing it was good for was running over poor people,''
Leno laughs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 1924 Bentley whose 3-liter engine has been replaced
with an 8-liter. It has had twin turbochargers added and is now a
500-horsepower charger, faster than Leno's Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going that fast in something 80 years old,'' he says in
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   There's a 1957 Buick Roadmaster, a 1955 Packard Caribbean
looking like a Creamsicle, and a 1966 Dodge Coronet with a 426 Hemi
engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't stop, it doesn't corner,'' he says of the Dodge,
and you need not finish the next sentence for him: ``But, geez,
it's fast.''
</P>
<P>
   His ``offices'' at the garages are more like playrooms: couches,
chairs, pictures, posters, collectibles, and toys everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He stops to show off a toy. It is a re-creation of a drag-strip
staging area. A Plymouth Barracuda sits at the light. Leno flips a
switch. An announcer introduces the car and driver and the crowd
cheers. Suddenly, the body of the Barracuda rises, revealing the
driver and the engine, which spits what looks like flames from its
exhausts. The body lowers, the staging lights run through to green,
the engine roars, and the 'Cuda rises in a wheelie.
</P>
<P>
   Leno cackles, seemingly as happy with this toy as he is with
each car, each motorcycle, in his garages.
</P>
<P>
   Back out on the garage floor _ a Vegas appearance is coming up
in hours _ he looks around a final time during this tour of his
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like Mia Farrow,'' he says of the actress who has adopted
many children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I like. I like saving cars.''

AT FIDELITY, THE YOUNG TAKE THEIR PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching Fidelity Investments moving its executives around is a
lot like following an entertaining chess match.
</P>
<P>
   There is usually more than one motive for everything and
observers always wonder what the plan is two or three moves ahead.
Analysis is muddled by divided opinions and is often wrong in
retrospect. That never stopped us.
</P>
<P>
   One safe observation about the latest developments at the
world's largest mutual fund company: the slow but certain
generational shift taking place in the senior ranks of Fidelity's
management.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than a younger manager moving into the job of an
older executive. New chief operating officer Robert Reynolds, 48,
is different in experience, corporate background, and people he
would consider professional contemporaries than the man leaving
that post, James Curvey, 65.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, another of Fidelity chairman Edward C.
Johnson's longtime lieutenants, J. Gary Burkhead, retired and was
replaced by Gail McGovern, 48, as head of the company's retail fund
sales and brokerage operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there is a thought process to involve some younger
people in the very high levels of the company because we're going
to be around for a long time and you need the people to run it,''
Reynolds said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Amid some of these changes, the most interesting question
surrounds Johnson's daughter and whether she will step into a more
prominent role at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Abigail Johnson, 38, has worked as a fund manager and executive
in other capacities at Fidelity. But whether she ever wants to
succeed her father, who turns 70 this month, as chairman and would
take on more important interim roles remains an open question.
</P>
<P>
   As executive chairs are shuffled this week, Curvey is stepping
aside as chief operating officer but hardly fading away. By moving
back to his old post overseeing Fidelity's venture capital and
other private investment operations, he keeps control of some of
the company's most valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Fidelity's principal business and image as an investment
management firm, a large part of the company's value is tied up in
telecommunications today.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity owns a controlling interest in British-based COLT
Telecom Group PLC worth roughly $14 billion. Fidelity's stakes in
similar but less developed telecommunications companies in South
America and Asia could be big hits in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Curvey moved into the chief operating officer role three years
ago when Fidelity was in serious trouble and he is due considerable
credit for improving the company's position.
</P>
<P>
   Huge sums of money flowing into mutual funds during the last
three years certainly helped float every boat in the industry. But
Fidelity had been hurting badly in 1997 and might not have been
able to take advantage of the flood of customer cash flow without
better management.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pozen, the corporate lawyer who took over management of
the company's actual investment arm at the same time, could claim
at least as much credit for fixing Fidelity. He stemmed the nonstop
defection of Fidelity fund managers and restored stability in a key
part of the business that had appeared dangerously rocky.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the current changes, Pozen stands out as an intriguing
character. He seems to have been around Fidelity in important roles
forever and part of the older generation, but Pozen is only 53
years old and undeniably ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pozen and Curvey were given titles as vice chairmen
Wednesday. So was Reynolds. In a corporate culture that tends to
get the most out of managers by pitting one against another, the
possibilities of their arrangement are intriguing and geometric in
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds didn't arrive on Fidelity's Devonshire Street doorstep
Wednesday. He came out of a banking trust background 16 years ago
and started selling similar products at Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   His career was boosted by the chance to get in on the ground
floor of the fund industry's biggest catalyst of the last decade:
the defined contribution retirement plan business.
</P>
<P>
   He got Fidelity's unit off the ground in 1989 and today those
401(k) plans and other retirement vehicles are the single largest
source of new customer cash at Fidelity, just like they are at most
big fund companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now Reynolds will run a lot more, including Fidelity's brokerage
operation and other business lines that are new to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about the opportunity,'' he said. ``I've been
here 16 years. I know Fidelity and I know the business.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, we're waiting for the next move.

FIBER-CEMENT _ A NEW SIDING FOR A NEW AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Homo sapiens appeared many millennia ago, he sought shelter
in a cave.
</P>
<P>
   Then, growing bolder, he built a house of straw. Then came
stone, then more sophisticated adobe and fired brick.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, wood truimphed, and ruled, with masonry for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The wood, painted many colors, was wonderful, until the paint
started to peel. Then, tired of the chore and cost of painting, man
turned to (horrors!) fake siding, not to solve the problem but to
cover it.
</P>
<P>
   First there was asphalt, which was like putting roof shingles on
walls. It was ugly. Then came asbestos cement, a good cover, but
not pretty. It was hazardous when asbestos fibers were released.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, when aluminum again became plentiful, came
the tinmen, the sharpies who sold the nation a bill of goods:
aluminum siding. Neither was that pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the ultimate assault on our long-suffering houses:
vinyl siding. This too was ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Like all fake siding, each product was considered the be-all and
end-all when it came out. It would last forever. There was no
maintenance. It was beautiful(?).
</P>
<P>
   And, like all fake siding, each had its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   So the beat goes on, looking for a better product, a better
substitute for wood (save the wood!), a better fake siding, and a
way to make a buck.
</P>
<P>
   James Hardie Building Products, Inc. of Mission Viego, Calif.,
has come up with the ultimate: fiber-cement siding _ clapboards and
other horizontal boards, vertical boards, stucco panels, and
shingles. It just might be the be-all and end-all.
</P>
<P>
   While it may imitate cedar and other wood, it is its own
material, and looks pretty good, far better than other fake siding.
It has to be painted, but the company says the paint will last
longer than on wood, with a minimum of peeling.
</P>
<P>
   It is basically concrete, a cementitious (cement-based) material
consisting of Portland cement, ground sand, cellulose fiber, select
additives and water. It is interesting that such a modern product
still contains wood, in the form of cellulose, like the cellulose
insulation used today.
</P>
<P>
   These materials _ Portland cement (made from limestone),
cellulose (scrap wood and paper), and sand _are in ample supply and
not endangered. And, the company adds, the product contains no
asbestos, glass fibers, or formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   The Hardie shingles, shingle panels, and lap siding are
virtually the same thickness as the shingles and clapboards they
are simulating, and are attached to the house the same way wood is.
Vertical boards are 516 inch thick, not as thick as the boards they
simulate, but just as strong, and are applied the same away as wood
boards.
</P>
<P>
   We talked to Freddy Scharf, technical supervisor at the
California headquarters, who said the cellulose in the Hardiplank,
Hardipanel, and Hardie Shingleside gives the material flexibility
and nailability.
</P>
<P>
   You can nail it just as you can nail wood, he said, with no need
to predrill, and nails can be driven to 3/8 inch from the sides.
You can't countersink the nails but you can drive them flush with
the material, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the boards are rigid and heavy enough to lie flat no
matter where they go, and even lap siding can be blind-nailed; that
is, nailed at the top so that the next board above will cover the
nails. Such boards will continue to lie flat.
</P>
<P>
   All shingles and shingle panels are blind-nailed: the
fiber-cement boards are the first boards that can be blind-nailed.
</P>
<P>
   Scharf said the various sidings can be applied on new or old
houses, and are also designed for the do-it-yourselfer. But he
added that the company recommends not putting its product over old
shingles or clapboards, but over level and even sheathing. So old
material should be removed first.
</P>
<P>
   The siding comes in several styles: lap siding (clapboards) with
wood grain or smooth; beaded lap siding; Colonial rough-sawn or
smooth lap siding, which looks like horizontal siding spaced with
grooves; individual shingles; shingle panels; stucco vertical
siding; and vertical siding, grooved or ungrooved.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber-cement siding must be painted. Most of the siding comes
primed with a latex primer, which requires only two coats of a
100-percent acrylic or water-based topcoat, said Scharf. Some
shingles are not primed; in that case they can be primed with an
alkaline-resistant (water-based) primer before painting. A solid
color latex stain can be substituted for the paint, Scharf said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the siding has a limited warranty of 50 years. Some
shingles are guaranteed for 30 years. The company said that the
paint lasts so long you probably won't paint again until you're
ready to change colors.
</P>
<P>
   The fiber-cement is stable, and will not expand and contract the
way wood and vinyl can.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber-cement technology is only about 10 years old, but has
grown precipitously in that decade, so much so that some stores are
having trouble keeping up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Hardie also makes trim boards for fascias, eaves and soffits,
and backerboard for ceramic tile floors and walls.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you and I can buy these materials at stores and put them up
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Hardie company has been working with cement since it started
in 1883 in Australia. It inaugurated fiber-cement products in 1990
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Today the company's production capacity exceeds 700 million
square feet annually, and will grow to 900 million soon. If it
takes 2,500 square feet of product to cover a typical house, those
700 million square feet represent 280,000 houses.
</P>
<P>
   That'll give vinyl a run for its money.

IS BRITISH TELECOM PULLING AN AL GORE ABOUT HYPERLINKS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The lads at British Telecom finally cleaned out their closets
the other day. And there, amid old biscuit tins and burnt-out
vacuum tubes, they stumbled across a chunk of solid gold. Or fool's
gold. Time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   If you're reading this on the World Wide Web, you probably got
here by clicking a hyperlink, a spot on the Web page that lets you
hop to some other spot on the Internet just by clicking a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperlinks are vital to the working of the Web. We could make do
without them; there are lots of other ways to find stuff on the
Internet. But it was the application of hyperlinks that made
Internet use simple enough for 5-year-olds and journalists. It was
the hyperlink that transformed the Internet from a geeky curiosity
to a prime mover of the world's economy.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? British Telecom owns the hyperlink, or thinks it
does. During a recent search through its 15,000 or so patents,
company lawyers came across US Patent Number 4,873,662, applied for
in 1980, granted in 1989. It's a patent for an ``information
handling system and terminal apparatus therefor,'' and I've got to
admit that the system sounds quite a bit like hyperlinking.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody at BT noticed the same thing. Now the company has begun
contacting American Internet providers, to discuss the size of the
royalty checks. Ironically, only American companies are targeted,
because similar BT patents in other lands have all expired. The US
patent was issued much later than the others, and will remain in
effect until 2009.
</P>
<P>
   The news has a lot of Web site owners planning a reenactment of
the Boston Tea Party, and vowing never to pay the British company a
dime. But BT's royalty raid will likely have no effect on Internet
commoners. BT has no intention of seeking cash from people with
hyperlinks inside their Web pages. ``That would be nonsensical,''
said BT spokesman Simon Craven.
</P>
<P>
   Not very lucrative either. But America Online, Earthlink,
Microsoft Network _ those are companies with real money. BT may
also try to collect fees from makers of the software people use to
design their hyperlinked Web pages. ``What we're looking for,''
says Craven, ``is a reasonable royalty based on revenues that
others enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   They might be looking for quite some time, if American firms dig
in and fight. ``I think British Telecom has some serious explaining
to do,'' said Colorado patent attorney Carl Oppedahl.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, why did the company wait so long before asserting
its patent rights? Craven says that it really wasn't worth
bothering about until 1996 or so, when the Internet began to put on
weight. But that's still four years ago. ``Laches'' is a Latin word
meaning ``use it or lose it.'' It's also a principle of patent law,
says Oppedahl. Hold off too long on enforcing your patent, and it
dies.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another bit of legal jargon: ``prior art.'' This refers
to whether a technology really is original. A live patent dies fast
and hard if it turns out that others had previously come up with
the idea, and put it to use. It took only a few minutes' scouring
of the Internet to find evidence that BT was late to the concept of
hyperlinking.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Engelbart always was quick on the uptake. He's credited
as the inventor of the computer mouse. In the 1960s he was also
tinkering with a data management system he called NLS.
</P>
<P>
   If you drop in at Engelbart's Web site at www.bootstrap.org,
you'll see that NLS seems to embody the basic ideas found in the BT
patent. Sure looks like prior art to me. Then there's Engelbart's
pal Andries van Dam, a professor at Brown University. He and
Engelbart were shopping hyperlinked databases to companies like IBM
in the late 1960s, according to a document on display at the Brown
University Web site. Van Dam went on to a similar system of his own
called FRESS that was humming away at Brown during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. van Dam is traveling and hasn't reviewed the BT patent, but
he declares: ``I would be amazed if they had come up with something
sufficiently unique to support a patent claim.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing will likely be settled by the true masters of
the Internet _ lawyers and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Internet service providers may just shrug and pay up.
What do they care? They'll pay serious cash before this case is
closed.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is whether it'll go to their legal teams, or
our cousins across the pond.

IN TEXAS CASE, EYEWITNESS ROLE GETS A HARD LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The case against Gary Graham, the latest in a
series of Texas death-row inmates to test Governor George W. Bush's
judgment with a claim of innocence, is notable not because it is
unique, but because it is so typical.
</P>
<P>
   As with most of the more than 600 men and women nationally who
have been executed since the death penalty was revived in 1977,
Graham was found guilty and sentenced to death without the
scientific certainty provided by DNA testing of physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Bush or his appointees on the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles intervene, Graham was ordered executed on the kind of
evidence that typifies most criminal cases: a single and unwavering
_ but controversial _ eyewitness identification.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Graham case returns the death penalty debate to where
it stood before the laboratory magic of DNA came upon the scene,
and where it still stands in most cases today _ with a very human
system displaying both its strengths and shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by chanting foes of capital punishment on a campaign
swing through California this week, Bush vowed to ``uphold the law
of the land,'' but gave no further indication of how he might rule
on Graham's appeals for a stay of execution.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the case of Ricky McGinn, who won a 30-day reprieve from
Bush this month so that DNA tests could be conducted, the killer
left no blood, hair, or semen in the Graham case. Bobby Lambert,
the victim, was shot in a bungled hold-up in a supermarket parking
lot, and the police did not find any physical evidence linking the
murderer to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   There was no DNA to damn Graham, or save his life. No
fingerprints. No hair to be matched. No confession. No forensic
firearms tests.
</P>
<P>
   There is Graham, a 17-year-old on a cocaine-fueled crime spree
at the time, who by his own admission spent the two weeks that
followed Lambert's murder staging 10 robberies and shooting two
victims in parking lot hold-ups.
</P>
<P>
   And there is Bernadine Skillern, who says she saw Graham come up
behind Lambert in a Safeway parking lot one May night in Houston in
1981 and put a .22 caliber pistol to his head. She was sitting in
her car, some 30 to 40 feet away, and leaned on her horn to scare
the gunman away. She heard a shot, started up her car, and pursued
the killer before her terrified children persuaded her to give up
the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Mr. Graham shoot and kill Mr. Lambert on that parking
lot in 1981,'' Skillern, now 53, told reporters at a Houston press
conference last week. ``That has not changed. That is not going to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in another of the dueling press conferences in Texas by
supporters and opponents of the death penalty in the last 10 days,
a rape victim from North Carolina traveled to Texas to tell the
press about the fallibility of eyewitness testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Thompson was 22 when she was raped in 1984. She
intently focused on her rapist's features _ and still accused an
innocent man of the crime. The man she identified as her assailant
spent 11 years in jail before DNA tests cleared him in 1995. In the
course of the investigation she was shown a photo of her real
assailant, and said it was not him. ``Eyewitnesses can make
mistakes,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is not alone. Participants in a 1996 study by the US
Department of Justice examined 28 cases where innocent men were
convicted of serious crimes only to be absolved by DNA evidence. In
these cases, which included three of the eight cases where death
row inmates have been freed by DNA testing, ``eyewitness testimony
was the most compelling evidence,'' the study concluded. ``Clearly
. . . these eyewitness identifications were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambiguities exist in the Graham case, too. His lawyers note that
several other witnesses failed to support Skillern's
identification, and that the police initially showed Skillern a
photo lineup of five men, in which Graham was the only one who fit
her description of a killer without facial hair. Skillern was drawn
to Graham's photo, and then picked him out of a live lineup the
next day _ a suggestive sequence of events that tainted her
identification, said his attorney, Richard Burr.
</P>
<P>
   The Graham case offers fodder to those who contend that the
United States has gotten carried away with enthusiasm for capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But Joshua Marquis, a member of the board of directors of the
National District Attorneys Association, said that the adversarial
justice system remains a sound forum on which juries and judges can
weigh matters like eyewitness testimony and circumstantial evidence
and make sound convictions short of scientific certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``DNA can be a marvelous forensic tool, but it is not a magic
bullet,'' Marquis said. ``We must never forget the other, massively
larger part of this risk-benefit analysis _ the thousands of truly
innocent victims who die at the hands of criminals that the legal
system has failed to hold accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country we have an incredibly elaborate appellate
system that recognizes that police, prosecutors, judges, and juries
are not infallible,'' he said. ``Opponents . . . are attempting to
reshape the discussion in the form of a new urban myth: that our
justice system is growing increasingly reckless in its zeal to
execute and, worse yet, that significant numbers of innocents are
ending up on death row. This is a myth in search of a crisis that
doesn't exist.''

 By RICHARD HIGGINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silly, you say, a free Web site that can turn the lyrics of the
Marine Corps Hymn into a dialect called Swedish Chef: ``Frum zee
hells ooff Muntezooma tu zee shures ooff Treepuli.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, to render it in Elmer Fuddese: ``. . . to the shaws of
Twipowi.''
</P>
<P>
   And being silly was all a New Hampshire man was aiming for when
he created the Dialectizer page two years ago. It will turn any
text, including Web pages, into one of seven pseudo dialects.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Samuel Stoddard has become enmeshed in an Internet
free-speech battle. Last month, he shut down the Dialectizer page
after corporate lawyers raised the threat of a copyright lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an outpouring of support from around the country and
offers of donations for legal fees, Stoddard, who lives in
Somersworth, N.H., has reopened an altered version of Dialectizer
on his entertainment Web site, Rinkworks.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started doing this because I thought it was pretty
amusing,'' said Stoddard, 26, a software engineer for a computer
networking company in Durham, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intended to tackle the First Amendment. I'm glad I'm
in this, though, because it's interesting. It just wasn't the fight
I counted on having.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard started Dialectizer two years ago as a parody of
legitimate Web translation sites. It is one page on Rinkworks.com,
which includes film reviews, science fiction features, and lots of
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can type in text or an entire Web page to be translated
into seven fake dialects: Redneck, Cockney, Elmer Fudd, Swedish
Chef, Pig Latin, Moron, and Jive.
</P>
<P>
   The page became more popular than Stoddard imagined, with 7,000
to 8,000 hits a day and as many as 10,000 hits on peak use days.
The traffic jammed his servers. Overall, Rinkworks.com has about
100,000 visitors a day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dialectizer relies on basic programming, performing ``search and
replace'' functions according to translation rules that Stoddard
developed and occasionally refines for an extra ounce of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dialects are works in progress,'' said Stoddard, whose
``office'' is no more than a Pentium Pro desktop computer in the
family room of his house in Somersworth, just north of Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote Redneck and Moron from scratch, but the others I
picked up and modified from the Web,'' who gets part-time help from
a friend, Dave Parker. ``They were thrown out there as freeware.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble began when people started translating entire Web pages
into the dialects. Some Web site developers and companies were not
only not amused, but they began protesting.
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard agreed to block the translation of any Web sites that
complained. By April, he had done so for 10 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in early May, he got a letter from a lawyer for the Bank
of America. Not only did the lawyer, Larry Jones, want the
translation of the bank's Web site blocked, but he raised the
possibility that Stoddard was committing copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their threat was the last straw for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stoddard said he is confident that he was not breaking
any law, proving himself right could be expensive, and on May 10 he
shut down Dialectizer.
</P>
<P>
   That proved equally unpopular _ but to a different crowd.
Outraged techies and other supporters of Dialectizer, alerted by a
piece on Slashdot, a Web site created by anticopyright computer
programmers, responded by attacking the ``corporate bullies'' who
saw copyright problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of this e-rage, he was getting one e-mail a
minute. Several of those e-mails are in the Slashdot archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that corporations are using the threat of a lawsuit
to force individuals to conform to their dictates just frosts my
butt,'' wrote ``Geekbird'' on May 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time for a round of Lawyer Skeet Shooting,'' said another
message.
</P>
<P>
   Others described how much fun they had had translating documents
like Microsoft copyright announcements into Redneck.
</P>
<P>
   Yet others attacked Stoddard for closing down the site, with one
person saying someone should ``shoot the loser wimp who runs the
Dialectizer for caving in to folks at Bank of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was overwhelmed by the response,'' said Stoddard.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stoddard said he had been gradually losing interest in
Dialectizer, the response ``fired me up.'' On June 5, he brought
the page back up _ this time with an expanded legal defense of
Dialectizer and a prominent notice that any Web site can be
blocked. The revised site also includes a link allowing
organizations to block their own site.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the Bank of America attorney, said through a spokeswoman
that he was satisfied with the fact that the company was able to
block its site from being parodied.
</P>
<P>
   But the threatened suit might have been hard for the bank to
win. Jon Grossman, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in
copyright law, said the Dialectizer probably would fall under
protection from copyright law offered to parody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems clear to me that what we are offering is protected by
law,'' said Stoddard, noting that courts have not found
``derivative parodies of works'' to be copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the people who are objecting are taking
themselves and their work a little too seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since reopening the site with instructions about blocking,
things have become more civil, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he received a request for a site to be blocked, and
``it was refreshing to see it worded in a civil, professional
manner. The requests for site blocks I got before had a much
angrier tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that only gives Stoddard more time to fend off
another controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of Dialectizer, he said he has received e-mail
from people who find the translations into Jive to be racist and
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard disagrees and has put a lengthy disclaimer on the Web
page stating that acknowledging ``cultural differences'' does not
mean discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we will ever conquer racism,'' it states, ``is
not by suppressing those differences but by cherishing them,
bringing them out into the open in such a comfortable and
nonthreatening way that we become at ease enough with them . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Angry e-mails and letters from lawyers aside, the support he has
received _ and the higher profile his Web site has gained _ have
encouraged Stoddard, who nurtures hopes of being a filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The increased popularity has also brought offers to buy
Rinkworks.com, but Stoddard is not interested in selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life's passion is here,'' he said. ``I've really tried
to harness everything I care about. So I'm not going to sell. It's
a lot of work, but I'd rather keep doing it as a passionate
hobby.''

SHAS REMAINS IN COALITION GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The linchpin Shas political party retracted its
resignation from the government Thursday, leaving Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's broad coalition battered but intact to head into a
critical stage of peacemaking with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave the prime minister, first of all, the umbrella that he
has a government,'' said Shlomo Benizri, a Shas official and the
health minister. ``And that with this government, he will be able
to travel to the United States in the near future, within two
weeks, to continue with the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ross, the U.S. peace envoy, arrived for meetings here
Thursday and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will follow next
week as part of the Americans' intensifying effort to lay the
foundation for a successful retreat-style summit meeting in July.
The goal of that meeting would be a final peace agreement and an
end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, although a partial
solution is considered more feasible.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a year of tense co-existence with the leftists in
Barak's government, Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party, succeeded in
forcing the leftist Meretz Party out of the Cabinet so that Shas
members could remain.
</P>
<P>
   Meretz's three ministers quit their posts on Wednesday night.
The three included the education minister, Yossi Sarid, a staunch
secularist who has become Shas' nemesis. Meretz will stay in the
government to support the peace effort that it champions, but it
relinquished its ministries, essentially opting out of its
hard-fought battles with Shas, to end the uncertainty about whether
the government would survive.

   ``The prime minister agreed, maybe against his true wishes, to
give up Meretz, and Meretz agreed to lie down over the fence for
him,'' Sarid said, invoking an image in which one soldier throws
himself over the barbed wires so that others can walk over him to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did not try to persuade the Meretz ministers to stay,
although he said that their departure hurts both them and him. ``I
regret that we have reached this stage, but appreciate Meretz'
concession and continue to see Meretz as a natural partner,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Soon, Barak will learn whether the political crisis has been
worth it: whether Shas backs the peace effort, too. He included
Shas in his government, and withstood its full-time balkiness, in
order to have the party's backing for a peace deal with the
Palestinians. But that support is not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The specific issues in contention between Shas and Barak
concerned the finances and oversight of the religious party's
indebted school system and the legalization of its pirate radio
stations, which have been nicknamed ``the holy channels.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Shas' rabbis instructed their politicians to resign
from the coalition last week, they also cited Barak's plan ``to
forsake'' the West Bank. There is a deeply embedded resistance
inside the party to territorial concessions, despite a one-time
ruling by Shas' spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, that it is
valid to give up land if it serves to end the violence and save
Jewish lives.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's party, One Israel, ``has not discounted the possibility
that in a month or two, if he presents an agreement with the
Palestinians, Shas will stick a knife in his back,'' Yossi Verter
wrote in the Haaretz newspaper Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But Benizri cautioned Israelis against assuming that Shas was
``a satellite faction of the right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sarid, who is also the Meretz leader, his
resignation will have ``saved the government and maybe even the
peace process'' if Shas backs the prime minister. ``But if this
step of ours, which is so unusual, does not help, no one can put
the blame on us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Formed a year ago, Barak's broad coalition was his effort to
learn from the mistakes of his mentor, the late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, and to forge a national consensus for his
peacemaking. But the rifts between various segments of Israeli
society go very deep, and they are probably even more intense at
the leadership level. Instead of bridging differences, the broad
government has seemed to exacerbate them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A demonstration of the deep-seated enmity between Sarid and Eli
Yishai, the Shas leader, played out like hostile theater in the
Israeli parliament on Wednesday. Sarid mocked what he said was
Yishai's weakness as a party leader, repeatedly saying: ``Try to
refrain from lying. I know it's not easy.'' Yishai accused Sarid of
persecuting Shas in an obsessed way, and referred to him as
``wicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the bickering, Barak sighed. ``You hear the
argument,'' he said, ``and you really understand why when the
teacher in the second grade sees her pupils misbehaving she says to
them, `This isn't the Knesset, get a hold of yourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis have been disgusted and disillusioned by the
political crisis. Nahum Barnea, a senior columnist for Yedioth
Ahronoth, compared the politicians' displays of rage to a recent
rash of impulse murders. ``The ministers are no better than the
drivers who kick each other to death because of a quarrel over the
right of way at a traffic light,'' he said.

THE EIGHTH CONTINENT 
Life, Death, and Discovery in the Lost World of Madagascar 
By Peter Tyson 
Morrow, 368 pp., $27.50 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Madagascar is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   So many formerly exotic destinations for Western travelers have
become all theme park and tented luxury. But not the Great Red
Island. It effortlessly retains the romance of the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Thrill-seeking ecotourists still don't brave it in great
numbers. But biologists, archeologists, paleontologists, and even
paleoecologists flock here, drawn by its endless natural riddles.
</P>
<P>
   Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world. A
biodiversity hotspot, it is, like Darwin's Galapagos Islands, a
living laboratory unlike any other place on the planet. Some 250
miles off the east coast of Africa, this Texas-sized island split
off from other land masses 160 million years ago. Over all this
time, plants and animals evolved here in isolation. And today, you
can find creatures and vegetation that exist nowhere else on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this is the most species-rich spot in the world.
Eighty-three percent of Madagascar's wildlife is unique, including
8,000 of its 10,000 plants species. This is the place to find those
Dr. Seuss-like primitive primates, the lemurs. And chameleons and
orchids beyond measure.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, there's not all that much in the current general
literature about this incredible place. With ``The Eighth
Continent,'' Peter Tyson, a science writer and online producer for
PBS's ``Nova,'' goes a long way toward filling the gap. And he does
it with a sense of urgency, since 90 percent of Madagascar's
original vegetation is gone _ one of the worst cases of destruction
on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson visited Madagascar four times between 1993 and 1997,
tagging along with scientists on a mission: a herpetologist
cataloguing the amazing array of reptiles; a paleoecologist
searching for clues in the disappearance of the island's bigger
animals thousands of years ago; a primatologist trying to save
lemurs and negotiate the complicated politics of conservation; and
an archeologist digging for answers to a very basic question: Where
did the people of Madagascar come from?
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is at his best when he's on the ground in Madagascar,
roughing it in a very rough place, and weaving into the story its
curious natural history. On one outing, Tyson peels back a strip of
bark to find ``a seething mass of tarantulas, scorpions, and giant
hissing cockroaches.'' Two kinds of vines make walking in the
forest miserable: one with fish-hook barbs grabs at your legs;
another kind causes a painful, burning sensation on contact with
the skin. It is often unbearably hot _ in the 100s. Insects swarm
around the exposed orifices of trekkers.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is traveling where few other Westerners ever have. In one
village, he is only the fourth ``vazaha,'' or light-skinned
foreigner, to have visited in living memory. And not everyone is
happy to see him. Some still believe that vazaha want to cut their
hearts out.
</P>
<P>
   In another enclave, Tyson learns an amazing trick _ how to get
past the thousands of fine spines that guard the fruit of the
prickly pear. The Malagasy driver captures a fly, holds it close to
the fruit by the wings, and lets ``its scrabbling feet pull out the
cactus spines.''
</P>
<P>
   A thorough researcher, Tyson packs this book with solid
information. Why did the 10-foot-tall flightless elephant bird,
gorilla-sized lemurs, and pygmy hippos go extinct right around the
time humans came to the island perhaps 2,000 years ago? The answer
isn't as simple as you might suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson investigates tales in remote regions of the continued
existence of the pygmy hippo. The Malagasy language is filled with
impossibly long words, but this hippo has one of the best names
going: kilopilopitsofy (pronounced ke-loop-ee-loop-ee-tsoofy).
</P>
<P>
   But too often, instead of integrating the exciting present with
the complex past, Tyson walls them off from one another in chunks
of text connected by artless transitions. Some of the writing is
downright odd: Looking into the night sky, he describes ``the stars
like stabs of harmless needles,'' for instance. And take this
clumsy introduction to a fact: ``You may not know, so I'll tell
you: There are no large, ground-dwelling lemurs in Madagascar.''
There are too many formers and latters. Too many Malagasy have
``wet eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tyson navigates this place of astounding taboos and
little-understood natural history with confidence. And he covers an
amazing amount of terrain with a scholar's love of detail.
</P>
<P>
   All that information and it only makes this place more
intriguing. As Tyson himself says, ``As research on Madagascar
continues, the mystery only seems to deepen.''

 &HT;    Black-white portrayal of two sides at Mount Carmel won't wash
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What were you doing on the day of April 19, 1993?
</P>
<P>
   Probably watching the Branch Davidian compound burn on TV.
</P>
<P>
   This makes you an expert _ and us a nation of them. After all,
we saw fire, and footage of the botched ATF raid in February. We
monitored nightly the stoic blob that was the Davidians'
bullet-riddled home. We all knew what we saw.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd that none of us was called as an expert this week as
the civil trial on the matter began in federal court. Instead, the
court summoned those who actually were there.
</P>
<P>
   This trial will get closer to the truth than our cathode-ray
truth tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in court it only took a few minutes to start shedding
light on pieces that all the world's satellites apparently couldn't
put together for the masses:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Davidians set their own building on fire April 19. It may
not have been ``the'' fire. Or it may have been one of several.
Attorney Mike Caddell essentially conceded in the trial's opening
day that the Davidians set a fire in the gym that adjoined living
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   If an incendiary FBI grenade found outside the compound could
become Page 1 news across the country _ minus any evidence that it
contributed to the blaze _ what does this revelation deserve?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  David Koresh raped little girls. This is not news, thanks to
DNA. But now it's under oath. Surviving Branch Davidian Rita Riddle
was matter-of-fact about it in court: Koresh bedded and in some
cases impregnated minors. Michele Jones gave birth when she was 14.
``Willing'' or not, Michele was raped.
</P>
<P>
   That changes the complexion of the ``summer camp'' Caddell
touts: go-karts, sing-a-longs. At Camp Koresh, the director had his
way with the campers.
</P>
<P>
   Did this justify a guns-blazing battle in which many would die?
No. A thousand times no. But that's not the issue before the court.
(The underlying issue could have, should have been settled, and
peacefully, with Koresh's arrest when out buying guitars or flexing
his Camaro's pistons.)
</P>
<P>
   The issue before the court now is negligence. All said and done,
there is more negligence shared by both sides than there was
smoldering ash.
</P>
<P>
   Did ATF agents fire indiscriminately into the building? To be
honest, that's an odd question to ask about one who is being fired
at. Does this excuse the raid as carried out? Not even close. The
ATF blew its cover. Even under cover, a SWAT approach to a heavily
armed group harboring innocents runs counter to every notion of
hostage rescue.
</P>
<P>
   It may be impossible to figure out who shot first. However, the
first ``shot'' bystanders say they heard came not from a gun but
from a flash-bang grenade, a scary-as-heck diversionary device. If
I were hell-fire loaded for Armageddon and heard such a boom, I'd
probably fire away, deciding it was my day to die.
</P>
<P>
   These are matters suitable for a court. Was the ATF more
interested in showing off noisy toys than making a peaceable
arrest?
</P>
<P>
   As for the ensuing disaster by fire, the court is asked to
consider the rushed conclusion to this terrible episode. The United
States has waited months, even years, to free hostages safely. It
didn't take the same care with Koresh's hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Did it consider the potential that kerosene lanterns toppled
over by armored vehicles might cause an inferno? That a prairie
wind might have made it unsurvivable? Or that a mass suicide might
ensue to give a wounded prophet the last word?
</P>
<P>
   Why the rush? This almost matches up with the shuttle Challenger
disaster in the way officials rushed matters to the launching pad
with bad conditions, without reason, and with disastrous
consequences watched by the world.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom is the proper place for answering these questions,
while the rest of us test our expertise.

HARVARD CLOSES IN ON NEW NIEMAN CURATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a series of fits and starts, in part precipitated by the
decision of leading candidate John Carroll to become editor at The
Los Angeles Times, Harvard may be close to naming a new Nieman
Foundation curator to replace retiring Bill Kovach.
</P>
<P>
   While the school has kept a pretty tight lid on the process,
names being bandied about include Roy Guttman, international
affairs writer and Pulitzer prize winner for Newsday, and Robert
Giles, a senior vice president at the Freedom Forum, a foundation
devoted to journalistic principles and free speech. (Both Giles and
Guttman could not be reached Wednesday.)
</P>
<P>
   Another wrinkle developed recently when some Nieman alumns who
belong to the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ)
decided to come up with minority candidates for the job. According
to Newsday columnist Sheryl McCarthy, they included Ellis Cose,
columnist and contributing editor at Newsweek, Les Payne, assistant
managing editor at Newsday, and Jerelyn Eddings, director of the
Freedom Forum's African Center.
</P>
<P>
   NABJ president Will Sutton says he sent a letter to Harvard
president Neil Rudenstine indicating, among other things, that the
organization was interested in having a diverse search committee
for a new curator and ``having a diverse pool of candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddings and Payne also could not be reached Wednesday. Cose says
McCarthy contacted him about a month ago, and he gave her
preliminary permission to submit his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what has transpired since then,'' he says. ``I
haven't heard a word.'' He, and everyone else waiting for the puffs
of white smoke to rise out of Harvard Yard, probably won't have to
wait much longer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to various theories, the search for a new Boston
magazine editor to replace Craig Unger will focus on (choose any
combination): a) a local editor who really understands urban Boston
so that the magazine can shake its stubborn image as a suburban
service book b) a star editor who can attract talent and, c) a
female editor who could shake up the place.
</P>
<P>
   It's early in the selection process, although owner Herb
Lipson's appearance in Boston this week means things are starting
to heat up. And names of potential editor candidates _ some
logical, some fanciful _ are beginning to surface in media circles.
Here, in no particular order, are some who get mentioned in the
gossip, rumors, and innuendo (including some who may have no
interest) not only for the top job, but for the executive editor
job just vacated by John Strahinich.
</P>
<P>
   From The Boston Globe, associate editor Ande Zellman and
business columnist Steve Bailey. From the Boston Phoenix, editor
Peter Kadzis and Nancy Gaines, who handles the Stuff and
Stuff(at)Night publications. From the Boston magazine family,
contributing editor Mark Leccese and former staffer Stephen
Rodrick, now a contributing editor at George magazine. From Yankee
magazine, managing editor David Gibson. Add in Sandra Shea, an
ex-Phoenix features editor and assistant managing editor at The
Philadelphia Daily News, and Mark Starr, Newsweek's Boston bureau
chief who drew major interest from Boston magazine the last time
the editor's job was open.
</P>
<P>
   Given the preliminary stage of the search, all these candidates
should be considered long shots at this point. The Globe called all
of them Wednesday, and most were not talking. The interesting
question is whether Lipson can pluck a new editor from the
relatively thin ranks of Hub talent or whether he'll end up turning
south to New York or Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Raising an issue some in the Beltway have wondered about, the
new issue of Brill's Content has a story quoting New Republic owner
Martin Peretz, saying he would keep the magazine if his good friend
Al Gore won the presidency, but ``might sell it if he's not
elected.'' Peretz told Brill's he was speaking ``very casually,''
but might this foreshadow a change of ownership after more than a
quarter century?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once every four months, I hear a real cockamamie story about
it,'' says a New Republic spokeswoman.``Everything we know suggests
Marty is not going to sell the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We know what she's selling. Number of times the image of Oprah
Winfrey appears in the new (second) issue of her O, The Oprah
Magazine: 12. Number of times it appears if you count the tearout
subscriptions cards: 19.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWBURYPORT, Mass. _ Andre Dubus III is standing in a vacant
lot. It is an unremarkable piece of property, formerly occupied by
a mobile home and plagued by mosquitos that breed in its marshy
core. But the shady 2-acre site, purchased with the proceeds of his
most recent novel, is the first land Dubus has ever owned. After a
lifetime of unpaid-rent notices and sagging porches, it looks to
him like the lush meadows of Tara.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last, the po' kid gets land!'' Dubus shouts triumphantly at
a cluster of pine trees. He strides quickly through the knee-high
grasses, detailing the farmhouse he plans to build for his three
children. There'll be a wraparound porch here. A small home for his
in-laws there. He pauses at a massive gray rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock, I own you!'' he exults. ``I own this rock!''
</P>
<P>
   Spooked by his voice, a rabbit scurries into sight. Dubus turns
in mock pursuit, calling, ``Hey, rabbit! You're my rabbit. Get to
work. Go plant something, rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a singular moment in a life that has not been easy. After
two decades of laboring in the shadow of his famous father Andre
Dubus, the celebrated short-story writer and essayist whose 1991
book ``Broken Vessels'' was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize, of
seeing his own works routinely credited to the elder of the two,
and of turning away the middle-aged ladies in their floral hats who
flock to the podium to congratulate him for something he did not
write, Andre Dubus III has come into his own. Last year, Dubus's
novel, ``House of Sand and Fog,'' was named a finalist for the
National Book Award and there is talk of a film based on it. That
his success comes mingled with the pain of his father's death _
Dubus the elder died two days after the book was published in
February 1999 _ somehow does not come as a real surprise to one who
considers hardship life's natural state. Dubus and his brother,
Jeb, built their father's coffin out of pine the night after he
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray to him every day,'' Dubus, 40, said softly. ``And then
I say OK, Dad. OK! You can come back now. I get it you are dead.
You can come back now. OK?????''
</P>
<P>
   Like any man who bears his father's name, much less one who
shares his profession, Dubus's relationship with his father was
flammably complex. Add to a combustible mix the fact that the older
Dubus left home when his son was 10 _ Dubus would marry three times
_ and the stage was set for some classic hostility.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't materialize, much. Dubus is a steadier soul than was
his volcanic father. While he has wrestled with a certain anger at
his father throughout his life, for the most part the two men
remained comrades. They drank beer together. They played poker and
watched the pay-per-view fights. It was the confusion that others
had about their names that grated so. Like when their books were
mingled together on library shelves. Or fan mail intended for the
father routinely landed in the son's mailbox. Or when the online
service Amazon.com credited all books by Andre Dubus to the father.
And it all got a little worse after Dubus was hit by a car in 1986
while helping a pair of stranded motorists and was crippled for
life, thus attaining a near-iconic status that seemed to dwarf the
son all the more.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that when Andre Dubus III got a phone call from a
local reporter last year telling him that ``House of Sand and Fog''
had been named a National Book Award finalist, he suspected a
terrible mistake had been made. Other finalists, he sooned learned,
had been called by the award foundation itself. Why not Dubus?
Obviously, they had intended the award for his father, ``but my
father was dead. So who are you going to call? Not the dead guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The prestigious award was indeed for the son. Award officials
say the phone calls just hadn't caught up with the press release.
Either way, the moment was a telling reflection of Dubus's lifelong
grappling with his weighty name, one that continues even with the
publication of his third book.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a name like Andre Dubus III, you are forever
linked to your father and it's a pain,'' declared Dubus, a muscular
figure with a touch of gray at his longish sideburns. ``I've been
on my own since I was 10. I can't stand my name. I can't stand the
III. People expect the rich boy riding around on Daddy's coattails
when it's just not true. Well . . . I didn't even get the big
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Dubus the father, whose gritty stories of working-class
New England and lyrical essays won a host of awards and are ranked
by some on the top shelf of American letters, was a man's man. He
was a flamboyant ex-Marine with a full beard and a commanding
voice. He was shy. He was a man of unthrottled passions, who kept
one eye on the ladies and another on God. He died at 62, thrice
divorced, the father of six.
</P>
<P>
   The son is moved by equal, if somewhat more tempered, energy. An
actor at heart, he speaks in large, declarative sentences shot
through with expletives and exclamation marks. He is in relentless
motion whether remodeling with the tools that float in the back of
his battered mustard 1984 Toyota or penciling his essays and
fiction in black-and-white notebooks on the unheated third floor of
the family's rented half-house or serving as a male ``flesh prop''
in the modern dance troupe the Exit Dance Theater, of which his
wife, Fontaine, is artistic director. Above all he is a father (two
boys, one girl, no Andres) who is at home a lot, cooking eggplant
parmigiana and reading Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre's lack of fatherhood has made him one of the best dads I
have ever seen,'' declared his mother, Pat Dubus, director of the
battered women's program HAWC in Salem, who lives in nearby
Amesbury. ``He works at it very hard.
</P>
<P>
   Dubus's father moved across the Merrimack River from the
family's home in Haverhill to the Bradford College campus in
Bradford in 1969 and taught there for 18 years, at times secluded
from his children by his writing. But the younger Dubus has used
the flexibility of a writer's schedule to spend as much time with
his children as possible. In years past, Dubus supported himself
doing carpentry but has increasingly relied upon teaching writing
at Emerson and Tufts. Although the $75,000 he has earned from
``House of Sand and Fog,'' has eased the financial pressure a bit,
Dubus is religious about his daily schedule. There's three hours of
writing in the morning. Teaching in the day. A several-mile run or
weight workout in the evening. And in between there's Austin, 7,
Ariadne, 4, and Elias, 3. Two of Dubus's siblings live in Amesbury,
a third is in California, while his two half-sisters by his
father's third wife live in Andover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I hear Andre say all the time is that he wants
the composition of his daily life to be the composition of his
overall life so that each day reflects the larger truths of his
life,'' said his brother Jeb Dubus, 39, a carpenter and painter.
``He thinks very hard about what the next true thing should be. He
wants to find the truth in himself and others.''
</P>
<P>
   And also in his writing. Dubus's first two books _ a collection
of short stories called ``The Cage Keeper and Other Stories,''
published in 1989, and the novel ``Bluesman,'' published in 1993,
are peopled by working-class characters, drifters and dropouts, the
abused and the abject. So, too, ``House of Sand and Fog,'' is a
story of unrooted souls: an immigrant, a recovering drug addict,
and a sheriff's deputy, brought together over a house. Reviewers
who had paid modest attention to Dubus's first books glowed sagely
that the third had to do with the immigrant experience, with
visions of the American Dream. But Dubus says all he wanted was to
get to the truth of the story that lay within him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace Paley said, `We write what we don't know we know,' and I
think that is very true,'' said Dubus, seated in a corner of the
Irish bar The Burren in Somerville. ``I have found when I try to
say something in particular it kills the fiction. It seems to me
the art is surrendering to the self and becoming another. There's
something deeply religious about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubus fought long and hard not to be a writer partly because he
knew it would be hard, but also because the admonitions of his
childhood echoed in his memory. ``We all had to be quiet so Daddy
could write. You know, Daddy is writing,'' Dubus recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Born in California, where his father was stationed as a Marine,
Dubus and his family moved half a dozen times before they headed to
Bradford in 1966 and ended up living in the then-hardscrabble city
of Newburyport and later Haverhill. With his father soon gone and
his mother working nights as a nurse's aide, Dubus and his three
siblings had plenty of opportunity to get into trouble, and they
used it. Picked on by the neighborhood toughs, Dubus, the oldest of
the boys, turned to boxing and gained a reputation as a fighter and
a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single mother in poverty is a recipe for disaster,'' Dubus
says of his childhood.

JAGUAR XKR HAS CATS WORKING UNDER THE HOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a pair of hood louvers and a mesh grille can
make.
</P>
<P>
   They distinguish the Jaguar XKR from the XK8. But that's really
just eye candy. Add a supercharger, give the rear deck an
insouciant little flip, let it crouch on Z-rated Pirelli tires
mounted on 18-inch wheels, and you've got a much quicker Cat.
</P>
<P>
   Opt for the convertible and you've got a drop-top that will run
with many Porsches and is more fun than any open-air Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   All this and a classic front end that holds the lines and
lineage of the XK series of Jags from the 120 on down. If its lines
are lacking at all, it is only that the flip at the tail could have
been even a bit more insolent, and a flexing bulge to the rear
fenders would have made the crouch look even more intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the XKR swathes you in leather from seats to wheel. The
seats are stiff everywhere your body touches them _ stiff in a
good, supportive way, right up to the high headrests. The front
buckets are adjustable in myriad ways and front legroom is
plentiful. The rear seat, meant for two, is really not suitable on
long trips for adults or even large children. It sits too low and
legroom is cramped at best. Great place for groceries or luggage
when two are on board, however.
</P>
<P>
   The ergonomics are simple with stems on the steering column
controlling wipers and lights and gauges behind the wheel grouped
tightly and easy to read while driving. Controls at center dash _
for audio and climate _ are a bit too small and can be distracting
to use while rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The optional ($2,400) navigation system was a bit disappointing
in that it seemed to lack many of the secondary roads that have
already been added to other systems _ I'm thinking Mercedes, Acura,
and Lincoln, specifically. The generations of navigation systems
are coming and going in rapid succession and it behooves makers of
luxury cars to keep up with the most complex.
</P>
<P>
   Storage is limited _ particularly if the rear seats are
occupied. Bins in the doors are small and the center console bin is
quite shallow. The trunk has moderate space, but two on a trip
using the rear seat and trunk for luggage would be in fine shape.
</P>
<P>
   The view from the driver's seat is classic Jag _ all nose.
</P>
<P>
   So point the nose and go.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, you think Porsche, you think 'Vette.
</P>
<P>
   That's as in silky like a Porsche, muscular like a Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike a Porsche, which seems to lower itself to the ground
as you feed its horses, the Jag lifts its nose as it surges
forward. And unlike the 'Vette, it does not push you back in your
seat so much as pin you down and into it.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the surge that sends two tons of convertible (about 300
pounds more than the coupe version) hurtling down the road is a
370-horsepower, supercharged, 4.0-liter V8. Feeding on almost 400
lb.-ft. of torque, it cranks 0-60 in just over 5 seconds. I did not
get the convertible onto an abandoned airport runway, as I did the
coupe, but that car went from 80-100 miles per hour in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   For all its power, it managed to deliver 16 miles per gallon _
about one m.p.g. less than the coupe, maybe owing to the extra and
the aerodynamic drag of the ragtop.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of the convertible top: Its fit, from the inside,
looked amazingly tight. One passenger thought he was in a hardtop,
the fit appeared so seamless. Yet on the road, there was a fairly
constant, low-level wind sound and I could not figure its source.
That is, until I took the Jag through a brushless carwash. At the
upper front corners of both the driver and passenger side windows,
water came flowing in. It makes sense that if water can find its
way through whatever gaps lurked there, so could wind.
</P>
<P>
   But back to driving performance. To handle the XKR's quickness
and speed, the underpinnings best be good. Start with 18-inch
wheels _ they look positively dominant on this low-slung car. Add
those Pirellis and they handle that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   They held on long, carved turns like the rig was on rails. On
snaps through corners they seemed to dig in. In the coupe, I
noticed a slight weight shift to the rear in the tightest of
corners. It was slightly more pronounced in the convertible, which
by nature of being topless is bound to flex a bit more, but even
with the soft top, this is a highly responsive car.
</P>
<P>
   It fights body roll, yaw, squat and dive with _ cute in a Jag,
CATS _ its Computer Active Technology System. CATS monitors speed,
steering wheel position, and brakes and adjusts the stiffness of
the shocks to compensate. Feed CATS with stiff springs, stiff
antiroll bars, traction control, and you've got a scampering,
surefooted Cat.
</P>
<P>
   If I have one major criticism of this car, it's the shifter. The
automatic mode seemed to shift up when it should (though sometimes
earlier than I would like), while the manual option really isn't
that at all (as in a Porsche, for instance) as it seems to hold
back on your decisions, trying to make up its own mind despite what
you may have decided.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The ease of raising and lowering the convertible roof. No
manual latches. One button does it all.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The AM radio. Where is it written that all European cars must
have AM radios with poor reception?

&HT;     TEXAS' `ELDER STATESMAN' COMES OF AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ As Gov. George W. Bush dominated the Texas
Republican Party in the late 1990s, Sen. Phil Gramm was moving
toward the status of elder statesman.
</P>
<P>
   And at the GOP's state convention in Houston last weekend, Gramm
embraced the role, delivering the most significant, farsighted
speech of anyone who set foot on the stage during the three-day
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who has two years remaining in current term (his third),
told the 7,400 delegates who attended the final session of the
convention that the GOP must stay true to the core issues working
Texans care about. And opposition to abortion was not on the list.
Free enterprise, individual freedom and responsibility were the
issues that Gramm cited.
</P>
<P>
   The omission was significant; Gramm could have raised the roof
by playing to the party's religious-right activists, who packed the
convention and approved a platform far to the right of most voters
and elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the state party platform is much closer to maverick
South Texas Rep. Ron Paul's worldview than it is to that of Bush,
the likely Republican presidential nominee. Bush, who skipped his
home state convention, wants the national party to have a more
moderate platform while keeping its steadfast opposition to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm didn't pander in his speech to the convention. Instead, he
issued a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' senior senator took the expected shots at Democrats, but
he said Republicans should learn a lesson from the Texas Democratic
Party's dissipated condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago in Fort Worth, the Democrats met in a phone
booth. They assured us two weeks ago that they were going to be
back,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Democrat Party will not be back because in its current
incarnation it would not be welcome. I say this not to gloat about
the fact that we're the majority party now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a lesson in all this. No political party has a
monopoly on vision or truth. God's not on our side. It's up to us
to be on his side.''
</P>
<P>
   The mention of God was Gramm's biggest applause line despite the
fact it fell short of the ``God's Official Party'' sentiment some
activists embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm continued, ``The Democrats became the minority party in
Texas the old-fashioned way. They earned it. They turned their
backs on working Texans, and Texans turned their back on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And let's take a warning. We're the majority party today
because we're the party of opportunity and freedom. We're the party
of the open door. And as long as we represent those basic values of
free enterprise and individual freedom and responsibility, as long
as we stand for those things, Texans will stand with us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a comment that seemed designed for single-issue activists,
Gramm said, ``If you have views that are important to you, stand up
and speak out on their behalf, but let's keep the Republican Party
focused on those who do the work and pay the taxes and pull the
wagon in this state.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as long as they are our primary concern we will be the
majority party. We will govern. And families in Texas will be
limited only by the size of their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're about. That's why I'm proud to be a
Republican,'' Gramm concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's message should spur social conservatives with a narrow
agenda to reflect on their need for the traditional wing of the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm has said he will seek a fourth term in the Senate in 2002,
although his plans are frequently the subject of speculation as the
growing legion of GOP officeholders looks for new heights to
conquer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he runs again, Gramm isn't touring the state
these days in the never-ending campaign style he once embodied. He
presents a more mellow persona than he did before losing his bid
for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And his speeches are lot more interesting than they used to be.

CARS THAT WERE STARS START WITH A '67 MUSTANG 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The premiere-night party was in full swing as I
stepped off the escalator and spotted her far across the room.
Sheathed in tight silver that clung to every curve, she dominated a
room full of movie stars. Nice set of headlights, great bumpers.
Overhead lights danced off her body with every turn she made.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage was there. So were Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall,
Jon Voight, Billy Bob Thornton, and many, many older men of
Hollywood who had kindly brought their nieces with them to the
premiere and later, this party, for the new movie ``Gone in 60
Seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   I only had eyes for Eleanor _ a customized 1967 Ford Mustang
GT500 KR _ the choicest of the 50 prime cars that Cage, Jolie,
Duvall, and cohorts are forced by bad guys to steal in this remake
of a 1970s cult film. I approached Eleanor, watched her spin on the
giant turntable, and wondered: Will she go down with the great cars
we've seen in the movies and on television? Will she assume a place
at the top of my list of favorites?
</P>
<P>
   Would she make your list?
</P>
<P>
   Here's mine as I pick through a genre that includes trashy
television such as ``Charlie's Angels'' and ``The Dukes of
Hazard,'' B movies including ``Hot Rod Gang,'' ``Teenage Thunder,''
and ``Chopper Chicks in Zombie Town,'' and some better film fare
and cult classics such as ``Vanishing Point'' and ``Two Lane
Blacktop.''
</P>
<P>
   --The yellow, 1932 Ford 5-window coupe hot rod that Paul Le Matt
drove in ``American Graffiti.'' Classic street-rod looks though
built as a film car. Also loved Harrison Ford's 1955 two-door
Chevrolet. Quiz: Where was this car seen in an earlier movie?
Answer below.
</P>
<P>
   --Steve McQueen's 1968 Mustang GT 390 from the great chase scene
in ``Bullit.''
</P>
<P>
   --And speaking of Mustangs, how about Robert Urich's black 1966
Ford Mustang fastback from the television series ``Spenser for
Hire''?
</P>
<P>
   --And dreadful though the show was, I still remember the Mustang
II Cobra that Charlie's Angels tooled around in.
</P>
<P>
   --``Vanishing Point'' featured what is certainly one of my
favorite film cars, Kowalski's 1970 Challenger R/T Hemi. I have
read that if you watch closely at the end, the filmmakers
substitute a Chevrolet for the Challenger just before it hits the
bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   --``Starsky and Hutch''? That was a 1976 Ford Grand Torino with
a 460 V-8 in which the blow-dried pair pursued the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   --They had beer, cigarettes, a full tank of gas; it was dark out
and they were wearing sunglasses. So Jake and Elwood Blues _ Dan
Akyroyd and John Belushi _ hit the road in their 1974 Dodge Monaco
440. But not to worry. It was a cop car.
</P>
<P>
   --I have to include it because it may be the most famous movie
car ever built _ George Barris's Batmobile. Barris took a 1955
Lincoln Futura _ built in Italy by Ghia to Lincoln-Mercury design _
and turned it into the Batmobile in 1966. Before that, as the
Futura, it had been seen in the movie ``It Started With a Kiss,''
starring Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   --I leave out the ``Back to the Future'' DeLorean because that's
a car that never should have been built in the first place, much
less used as an example of where the automotive future might take
us.
</P>
<P>
   --Remember Mel Gibson's ``Mad Max'' movies? I include his 1973
Australian-built Ford Falcon XB Coupe for the impact it had on
future movies. I'd like a dollar for every movie that followed in
which filmmakers took old cars, sprayed them flat black or primer
gray, and crashed them around in some desert. An entire genre was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Others of note?
</P>
<P>
   The 1969 Charger R/T 440 of ``Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry'';
Banacek's Barris-custom AMC AMX; the more than 100 1969 Dodge
Chargers that were reportedly wrecked in the making of ``The Dukes
of Hazard'' television series; Nash Bridges's 1971 Hemi Barracuda;
the modified 1968 Oldsmobile Toronado that Mannix drove; the 1958
Plymouth Fury, malevolent and furious, from the Stephen King movie
``Christine''; the AMC Pacer from ``Wayne's World,'' so perfect as
Queen blasts from its sound system.
</P>
<P>
   The quiz answer?
</P>
<P>
   On an ``American Graffiti'' Web site _
kathyschrock.net/graffiti/ _ it is reported that the 1955 Chevrolet
driven by Harrison Ford was a composite of two earlier 55s used in
the movie ``Two Lane Blacktop,' which featured James Taylor and
Dennis Wilson roaming America and eventually racing for titles with
Warren Oates in a 1970 GTO.
</P>
<P>
   Add those to my list, too. But on this night, Eleanor stole my
heart _ both Eleanors. I say both, because as I left the party, her
silver image still dancing in my mind, I came across another
Eleanor, the 1973 Mustang Mach I from the original ``Gone in 60
Seconds'' from 1974.
</P>
<P>
   This Eleanor looked forlorn _ battered at the edges, paint job
sloppy and touched up, hanging on like an aging starlet. Hollywood
can use you that way.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 NEWBURYPORT, Mass.: ... his childhood.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dubus set off. He roamed from Bradford College to the University
of Texas in Austin, from which he graduated; to the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, where he studied Marxism for four days; to
Colorado, where he worked as a corrections officer for several
months; to New York, where he studied acting; and finally moved
home and settled on writing. He wrote his first story,
``Blackberries,'' at age 21 to impress a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never chose writing. It chose me,'' said Dubus. ``Because
when I finished the story I had this incredible feeling. All the
rage was gone. It was epiphanous.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was still Andre Jules Dubus and there were two of them.
It was confusing. Which one of them wrote that story about the fat
girl, anyway? people would ask. Perhaps his father helped him out?
The answer was no, ``never even asked the old man what a semicolon
was.'' Seething at the confusion, Dubus would sometimes eye the
trucks of father-and-son teams speeding by and think, ``How sorry I
felt for those (guys), you know, Ralph and Sons. I mean, couldn't
you get your own truck, man???''
</P>
<P>
   Dubus had long wanted to confront his father about his
childhood, ``to tell him that it sucked not having a father
around.'' But just as he was ready to do so, his father was struck
by a car on Interstate 93. His left leg was amputated and his right
so shattered that he needed a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
After the rage, Dubus became a reflective, some say easier, man.
Dubus shaved his father every morning. He mowed his lawn. He and
his brother Jeb built a series of wooden wheelchair ramps around
his father's Haverhill home. And he spotted his father as he
fumblingly learned to lift weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Andre was extremely proud of little Andre,'' recalled Pat
Dubus. ``He was big and muscular, all those things big Andre never
thought he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Andre remembers the last time he saw his father. It was a
snowy winter night a year ago February, a few days before he died,
and Big Andre had invited him over to watch boxer Oscar De La Hoya
on TV. The two men sat late into the night, sipping brandy, as
Dubus told his son stories about his childhood and his own father.
Finally, the son said, ``he kissed me on the lips and I said, `I
love you.' The last thing I saw was him sitting at the top of the
ramp, his profile outlined in the snow.''
</P>
<P>
   The junior members of Ralph and Sons may have had obvious
benefits thanks to their father, but assessing the significance of
being a famous writer's offspring is harder to gauge. The
conventional wisdom in the publishing industry is that writers'
children may get noticed because of their names, but their work
will only survive if it can stand on its merit.
</P>
<P>
   When Alane Salierno Mason, an editor at W.W. Norton, received
the manuscript of ``House of Sand and Fog,'' it had (unbeknownst to
her) been rejected by 22 publishers. Mason, an ardent fan of the
elder Dubus, says she was skeptical but quickly changed her mind as
she read. ``I kept thinking, `this is the real thing,' '' said
Mason.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a long time in coming. Dubus worked on the book for
four years. Three of those years he wrote by pencil sitting in his
car in the Oak Hill cemetery next to the worn headstone of Hylas T.
Wheeler (died in 1866). (``The police don't bother you if you're
writing in the cemetery. They think you're writing to your
grandmother.'') The fourth year he spent typing the 22 notebooks he
had filled. When his father finished reading the book, he called
his son and told him it was ``Shakespearean.''
</P>
<P>
   With reviews trumpeting Dubus's ``elegant writing'' and
``gripping plot,'' ``House of Sand and Fog'' was published on Feb.
22 and Dubus set off on a 11-city tour. Two days into it, he was
standing in the lobby of a San Francisco hotel about to go to a
reading when the phone rang. His father had died of a heart attack.
Dubus headed East and the tour was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed such a tragic irony that when he had finally come
into his own limelight and the spotlight was firmly focused on him,
his father died,'' said Mason. ``He was almost being upstaged at
the most impossible time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubus said he feels no resentment, just the throbbing ache of
his loss. It has been more than a year since his father died and
while Dubus thinks of him daily, life is moving on. His father's
house has been sold. Dubus is making plans for building his own
home and hopes to pour the foundation this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Up on the third floor where he writes, Dubus pulls on a set of
untethered earphones to muffle the sound of his children playing
below and is hard at work on two pieces, although he will not say
about what. The confusion still happens. Not long ago a Seattle
newspaper ran his father's picture alongside a review of ``House of
Sand and Fog.'' But it happens a lot less than it used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like he's made his own name, finally,'' said his
wife, Fontaine. ``You know, he actually meets people who don't know
he had a father who wrote.''

BRAD BAKER'S MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE RED SOX FARM SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAGERSTOWN, Md. _ The heat index was over 100 degrees. Another
day, another stop in this bottom rung of steps toward The Show.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Municipal Stadium, only the diehard fans and regulars
are willing to come out to see the Hagerstown Suns battle the
Augusta GreenJackets in a Single A South Atlantic League game.
</P>
<P>
   The GreenJackets arrived early Saturday morning, after an
all-night bus ride from Asheville, N.C. They would stay two more
days before getting back on the bus for the 9 1/2-hour trip back to
Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   It is very much the world of Crash Davis and the other
characters of ``Bull Durham,'' with one exception, said Brad Baker
with a smile and a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no women meeting us when we get off the bus,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, Baker is starting his journey toward Fenway Park. Less
than two months into his first full professional season, everything
is new and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the bus all night coming from Asheville,'' said
Augusta manager Mike Boulanger, who has spent nearly three decades
watching prospects come and go. ``And he comes up to me and he
says, `Man, I love this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Baker is slightly more than a year removed from Pioneer Valley
High School, a regional school in Northfield, Mass. His girlfriend
is back home in Bernardston, finishing up her junior year at
Pioneer Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were the hot couple,'' said Baker with a smile
and a laugh, remembering things like senior proms and homecoming
parades.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Baker is the hot pitcher in the Red Sox' minor league
system. The righthander won seven of his first eight decisions, was
the Red Sox' minor league pitcher of the month for April, and made
the South Atlantic All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Heady stuff for someone who seems to be working on a ``How I
Spent My Summer Vacation'' project.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is something different about Baker. Baseball is a
business, a career, and he realizes that.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to pitch Monday night, so he is in his normal
day-before-the-game routine.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the third row behind home plate in a blue sports
shirt, khaki shorts, and sneakers, Baker charts pitches, checking
speed with a radar gun that sits in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go over the hitters anyway,'' he said. ``But just
getting to know what certain hitters like helps.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baker concedes he is still living a fantasy. A year ago, he came
out of Pioneer Valley with a hot reputation and a scholarship offer
to play baseball at the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I was considering,'' said Baker with a smile,
picking through a buffet breakfast at the Tortuga restaurant,
adjacent to the Ramada Inn where the GreenJackets have hunkered
down for the weekend. ``But then the Red Sox picked me.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that more than matter of factly. Pitching in Fenway was
a dream of a boy who grew up in the sheltered environment of
Leyden, Mass., a rural enclave just north of Greenfield. For Baker,
it was more than that. It remains a cocoon of comfort. The center
of town is a Baker enclave, with parents, a brother, a sister,
grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins all within shouting
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandparents live right next door,'' said Baker, who
acknowledges that on summer nights when there is nothing else going
on, it is also the heart of Red Sox nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summer, when we are home, chances are the game is going
to be on somewhere in the house,'' said Vicki Baker, who has
watched with pride as her oldest son has moved beyond the family
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Baker can recall the day in June last summer when he did receive
the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just sitting there with my family and friends fooling
around,'' said Baker. ``I always joked that the Red Sox would pick
me. This time when the phone did ring and it was them, I couldn't'
speak for a minute. I wanted to cry I was so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had selected Baker as a supplemental first-round
pick. Suddenly, everything was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Fagnant had scouted him and we had seen him in a high
school tryout,'' said Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, a
fellow native of Western Massachusetts. ``We try and emphasize
signing kids from New England. He had a good competitive makeup
with a good talent, a good fastball, and a good curveball. He was
also mature for his age.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker has always been mature, dating back to his days in Little
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I first saw him,'' said Pioneer Valley baseball
coach Dex Ross. ``He just stood out, not only for his ability, but
for his poise.'
</P>
<P>
   By the time, Bradley was in eighth grade, he had developed into
a poised pitcher with potential. ``He came up to me and said he
wanted to try out for the varsity,'' said Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said it was more of a whim than anything. ``I just wanted
to see if I could do it,''he said. ``I said if I don't make it,
fine. I just want to see where I stand.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the team, although he concedes he was more awe-struck
than anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game I pitched, I walked out on the mound and
thought to myself, `Those guys are men,' '' he said when he looked
at the juniors and seniors in the opposing Mohawk Valley lineup he
beat, 7-4, in his first game.
</P>
<P>
   Baker progressed through high school. By the time he was a
junior, he started to seriously consider a career beyond high
school. ``When he played with the New England Mariners and started
traveling, we thought this could be a possibility,' said Vicki
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   But it was more than pitching. It was his work ethic. His
attitude. ``If I had any problems with anyone, Brad would the one
to step in and make them toe the line,'' said Ross. ``It's just the
way he was. He knew what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The routine seldom varies. Sleep in, although Baker conceded he
was up before 9 each morning, before his teammates threaten to
boycott him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go out and get a nice dinner, go out to the ballpark, play a
game, and do it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   It's been that way every day since April. Seldom is there a day
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules say that if you have to travel more than 500 miles,
you get a day off,'' said Baker, who shows no signs of wear.
</P>
<P>
   Baker says he has blinkers on in terms of his career. Sure, he
wants to go to The Show and play in Fenway for the Red Sox. But for
now, he is happy where he is, doing what he is doing. The Red Sox
say he will be in Augusta all season, and probably the
Instructional League in Florida after that.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Baker. He likes where he is, sharing an
apartment with some teammates a long drive away from the first tee
at Augusta National Golf Club, home of The Masters each April.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Southern Division roster in the South
Atlantic All-Star Game, but did not play in Tuesday's game. Halfway
through the season, he has become the GreenJackets' ace. He is 7-2
after 14 starts, with 66 strikeouts and 19 walks in 70 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this game 29 years,'' said Boulanger, ``and he
got the look of the great ones when they were 19. He's wise beyond
his years and he's got unbelievable work habits. All I can say was
that he was raised right.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, whose fastball tops out at 93 miles per hour, has already
started to pick up the nuances of his profession, learning that
throwing strikes is not nearly enough to be successful at the next
level. He has to pick out parts of the strike zone. The thing he
wants to work on in the Instructional League is improving his
pick-off move and holding runners on.
</P>
<P>
   He is diligent in his routine, from charting pitches the day
before the game and making mental notes, to getting in his running
during his other off days.
</P>
<P>
   He is already somewhat of a celebrity because he is on a
baseball card. He says, with amusement, that can be found on eBay,
currently selling for a bargain price of $1.04.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, it's been a constant upward curve. He was bounced
early May 1, getting knocked out after two innings against
Piedmont, the top team in the Northern Division. ``I had trouble
getting the ball down,'' said Baker. ``The manager comes up to me
in the dugout and says you've thrown 50 pitches in two innings,
given up five hits and six runs. I think you can call it a day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't argue with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker didn't argue much that Monday night in Hagerstown when he
was chased after three innings. The Suns got to him for six hits
and three earned runs in what turned into a 15-7 loss by the
GreenJackets. Baker was not charged with the loss because Augusta
came back to tie the game before a ninth-inning explosion gave
Hagerstown the win.
</P>
<P>
   But appearances like that have been rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now this is fun,'' he said. ``There are no negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 19, he is pitching in the Red Sox organization, and he has
a plan and a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't even been homesick,'' said Vicki Baker, who sits
around with the family on nights her son is scheduled to pitch,
trying to find broadcasts of the game on the Internet. ``He doesn't
miss us a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he does. There is still part of Brad Baker that goes back
to Leyden, where he can hunt and fish and share dreams with his
buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back there last fall and they said I've changed,'' said
Baker, who concedes that hanging out with 22- and 23-year-olds has
changed some parts of him.
</P>
<P>
   He is smart enough to realize that, at this level, baseball is
an individual sport as well as a team game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is checking their stats, comparing them to other
people in the organization,'' he said. ``That's what how they judge
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker also knows the people making the decisions on Yawkey Way
are making other judgments as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream is to get to Fenway,'' he said, picking up his
clipboard and radar gun and heading to the clubhouse. ``But right
now, there is nothing wrong with this. I don't see any negatives.''

CVS: NO CORNER DRUGSTORE

<P>
   Three years after his heart transplant, Steve Ryder feels pretty
good, almost well enough to play ball again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the heart of an 18-year-old,'' says the one-time minor
leaguer from Framingham who in his younger days competed against
baseball greats Joe Torre and Gaylord Perry.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryder's 18-year-old heart requires 15 pills a day to run
smoothly in his 61-year-old body. The cost to his insurance
company? Between $1,000 and $1,500 a month, he estimates.
</P>
<P>
   It is for just such consumers that CVS Corp. launched a new kind
of specialized drugstore called CVS ProCare two years ago. In urban
markets, plans call for ProCare to augment the 4,100 standard
pharmacies that Woonsocket, R.I.-based CVS already operates.
</P>
<P>
   Standard pharmacies may be fine for those who need only a few
prescriptions filled, but ProCare is targeted at people with
massive medication needs _ someone who's had an organ transplant,
maybe, or someone infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Folks with such conditions, as well as many people with cancer
and hepatitis, take a category of medications called specialty
prescription drugs. With an aging population and new biotech
treatments rapidly coming on to the market, it's a category that
CVS expects to grow by 20 percent this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   With the category accounting for nearly 11 percent of total US
prescription drug sales, CVS thinks its ProCare format can support
more than 100 stores some day. Including two in Boston, 28 ProCare
stores are up and running, and there are plans to open 22 more by
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a $14 billion market that will soon grow into a $20
billion market,'' ProCare president Dennis Burton says.
</P>
<P>
   A ProCare doesn't look much like a typical corner drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   A standard pharmacy leases prime real estate at convenient
street-corner locations with plenty of parking. When customers come
in, the layout forces them to walk through long aisles stocked with
candy, magazines, and knickknacks to reach the pharmacy counter at
the back of the store.
</P>
<P>
   This floor plan is no accident. With health-maintenance
organizations fighting to keep drug costs low, pharmacy chains are
looking more and more to non-drug items such as potato chips and
cosmetics to generate profits.
</P>
<P>
   A different dynamic is at work at the much smaller ProCare
stores. Instead of big candy counters and magazine racks, there are
soothing color schemes and much deeper inventories of specialty
drugs. The emphasis is on offering customers more privacy and more
face time with pharmacists specially trained in both chronic
maladies and complex HMO reimbursement procedures.
</P>
<P>
   With doctors under cost-cutting pressures to see more patients _
and spend less time with each patient as a result _ it can often
fall to the pharmacist to do much of the explaining to
specialty-drug consumers about dosage levels, self-injection
techniques, and possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Many such customers ``need a lot of emotional support,'' says
Alice Chung, a pharmacist at a ProCare near downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice is my liaison,'' says Ryder, who adds that when someone
is on a lifelong regimen of medications for a heart transplant,
``it's nice to deal with just one person.''
</P>
<P>
   ProCare has the potential to offer similar high levels of
service to people with HIV, says Eric Brus, a treatment specialist
for the AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   For someone with AIDS or HIV, a typical drugstore can be a
daunting place, he says. At the pharmacy counter, the lines can be
long, and during peak periods the pharmacist can be too busy to
spend more than a minute or two with each customer. Even worse,
there can be little privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to get into the specifics of your personal health
with 10 people hearing it?'' Brus says.
</P>
<P>
   From a business standpoint, CVS has been ``happy'' with
ProCare's early results so far, says David G. Magee, an analyst
with Robinson-Humphrey. Within a few years, the ProCare chain has
the potential to add $2 billion to CVS's annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   At Merrill Lynch Global Securities, analyst Mark Husson is even
more bullish. He thinks ProCare could add $5 billion a year to CVS
revenues some day.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1999, CVS reported sales of $18.09 billion. On the New
York Stock Exchange, CVS shares have been trading in the $37 range.
</P>
<P>
   By using its buying power and its relationships with HMOs and
pharmacy benefits managers, CVS thinks ProCare can grab a
leadership position in the fragmented specialty-drug market.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond James analyst John Ransom has a ``strong buy'' rating on
CVS, but has some minor concerns about ProCare, which he describes
as a ``niche business'' with an ``unproven business model.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty may be why no other big drugstore chains have
created a separate division of stores to cater to specialty-drug
consumers. At this point, much of the competition for the
specialty-drug market is coming from wholesalers, mail-order
companies, and some smaller pharmacy players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really generalize about this business,'' Ransom says
of the specialty-drug market. ``Many oncology drugs have low profit
margins. But drugs for hepatitis and new biotech drugs can generate
big profits. Your success or failure depends on which drugs'' and
ailments you choose to specialize.
</P>
<P>
   But if margins are low, ProCare's costs can be low, too.
</P>
<P>
   Because ProCare is a ``destination store,'' a place to which
customers make a special trip, ProCare can operate in smaller
spaces and in lower rent districts than a standard drugstore,
analyst Husson says.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ryder, the heart-transplant patient, occasionally
visits a ProCare, he often reorders his meds by phone and receives
mail-order delivery. That means a big part of ProCare's business
can be fulfilled from a distribution center in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Add up these factors, and one result is that ProCare has lower
``infrastructure costs'' than a typical CVS, Husson says.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some irony in CVS's launch of ProCare. A few
decades ago, mom-and-pop drugstores were an industry mainstay. Then
big chains bulked up and stole away customers by using their buying
power to offer lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some mom-and-pops survived by giving customers more personalized
service. Now ProCare is trying to offer a similar level of service
to the industry's best-paying customers.

HATE CRIME LAWS SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas had no hate crimes law on the books when James Byrd Jr.
was dragged to his death behind a pickup truck. Nor did Wyoming
when Matthew Shepard was tied to a fence and beaten to death. And
that, Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy and others claim, is why a
federal hate crimes law must be enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crimes that are motivated by hate really are fundamentally
different,'' Clinton said on Monday after meeting with Byrd's
sister and nephew, ``and I believe should be treated differently
under the law.'' Kennedy, chief sponsor of the broad hate crimes
measure that passed the Senate on Tuesday, argued that it would
help ``define what this nation ought to be _ that is, a nation that
is going to be free from discrimination, hatred, and bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clinton and Kennedy believe that an applicable hate
crimes law might have prevented the Byrd and Shepard murders. How
then do they explain Buford Furrow? California, like 41 other
states, already has a hate crimes law, but that didn't stop Furrow
from opening fire last August on a group of Jewish children in a
Los Angeles community center, then killing a Filipino-American
letter carrier. Illinois's hate crime law didn't deter Benjamin
Smith from a shooting spree that left nine people wounded and two
dead _ all Jewish, black, or Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clinton and Kennedy keep invoking Byrd and Shepard
because they believe that a hate crimes law would have ensured that
the murderers in those cases were vigorously prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   But that can't be it, either. Of the three men who so savagely
killed Byrd, two have been sentenced to death and one is to spend
the rest of his life behind bars. Both of Shepard's killers have
also been sentenced to life. One of them, Aaron McKinney, was
facing a death sentence when Shepard's parents proposed a deal _
two life sentences in exchange for a permanent gag order that
prevents McKinney or his lawyers from ever appealing the verdict or
discussing the case in public. In the Buford Furrow case,
meanwhile, federal prosecutors in California are seeking the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   So what is it about the Byrd and Shepard atrocities that
Clinton, Kennedy, and the others are convinced requires a vast
expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction? The sheer, shocking
evil of those attacks? Undoubtedly what happened in Jasper, Texas,
and Laramie, Wyo., were horrors to freeze the blood. But were they
more horrible than John Wayne Gacy's serial murder of 33 young men
and boys in the 1970s? Than Timothy McVeigh's butchery in Oklahoma
City, which sent 168 innocents to their deaths? Than the mailed
bombs Ted Kaczynski used to kill three people and leave 23 others
wounded and maimed? Those, too, were abominations of heart-stopping
brutality _ yet none would qualify as a ``hate crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy argues that hate crimes are in a category of their own.
They ``wound not only the individual, but they also wound and scar
a community,'' he said on the floor of the Senate. Of course that
is true, but it is true of all violent crime. Every murder _ every
rape _ every mugging _ victimizes more than just the victim
himself. Which gives you the worse scare _ the robber who pulls a
gun on your neighbor up the street or the bigot across town who
beats up a stranger because of his color, religion, or sexual
orientation, which happens to be the same as yours?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had enough of Matthew Shepard cases,'' Kennedy says.
``We have had enough of the kinds of vicious murders based on
race.''
</P>
<P>
   What can this mean? That we have not yet had enough of cases in
which men who (itals)aren't(unitals) gay are tied to a fence,
beaten, and left to die? That we have not yet had enough of murders
that (itals)aren't(unitals) based on race? Is it only certain kinds
of murders of which we have had enough?
</P>
<P>
   Of course Kennedy _ who knows from sad experience what murder
can do to a family _ would never consciously claim that some forms
of murder are more acceptable than others. But that is the
unmistakable implication of his words. More important, it is the
unmistakable implication of hate crimes laws.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way around it: A law that cracks down harder on
criminals who harm members of certain groups by definition goes
easier on those who target victims from other groups. If a gang of
skinheads decides to crack some black or Jewish skulls, Kennedy's
bill would empower federal prosecutors to go after them. If they
decide to simply crack skulls at random _ or to go after illegal
immigrants or fat people or dwarfs or businessmen _ Kennedy's bill
leaves them alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equal protection of the laws must apply to all Americans,''
Kennedy said during the Senate debate. ``That's what this is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   No, what this is all about is precisely the opposite. Equal
protection means telling all would-be criminals that they will be
punished fully, regardless of the identity of their victims. The
bad bill passed by the Senate declares that some victims are more
deserving than others. That is not a message that should be allowed
to stand.

SORENSTAM AND FIELD SET SIGHTS ON WEBB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ The stage was in France, but you didn't need
sub-titles to figure out the plot to last weekend's LPGA Tour stop
in Evian-Les-Bains. The word rivalry is universal and requires no
translation.
</P>
<P>
   When Annika Sorenstam defeated Karrie Webb on the first hole of
a playoff in the Evian Masters it did much more than secure the
biggest payday ($270,000) in women's professional golf; it
established the presence of something far more priceless _
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, personally, it means a lot,'' said Sorenstam, 29,
whose hold on the top spot in women's professional golf began to
crack with the emergence of Se Ri Pak in 1998, then completely fell
apart last year when first Juli Inkster sizzled, then Webb went
into a Tiger Woods-like run to leave competitors in her divots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karrie right now is the No. 1 player, and when you beat
somebody like that, it gives you more confidence. To know that you
can beat her, that means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly since Webb, 25, had been virtually unbeatable for
most of the past year. She put together one of the best seasons in
LPGA Tour history last year _ six wins, including the du Maurier,
her first major _ and stormed out of the gates in 2000 with three
wins in three starts, including the Nabisco Championship.
</P>
<P>
   That remarkable stretch of golf was poorly timed, however, lost
in the glare of Woods's highly publicized six-tournament winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career has uncannilly paralleled Tiger's (they both were
Tour rookies in 1996; she has 20 wins and two majors, he has 20
wins and three majors),'' said Webb, ``and I think it has hurt the
LPGA Tour because the attention has been to what he's been doing a
little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Webb prepares for the start of the season's second major,
the McDonald's LPGA Championship at Du Pont Country Club (she could
become the fourth player in LPGA Tour history to win three straight
majors), she doesn't have to look far for something Woods _ at
least in light of his dominating performances at the Memorial
Tournament and US Open _ cannot find. That is, a serious
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   And she's not complaining, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great motivator (to have competition,)'' said
Webb, who has not exactly cooled off since her three-tournament
winning streak came to an end in March with a second at the
Standard Register Ping. Since then she has won once, finished
second twice, fourth once, sixth once, and 13th another time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, Juli pushed me all the way for the whole year. Just
to go head-to-head with her, it did motivate me to keep up my
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Different year, same situation for Webb, though the player
pushing her is a familiar foe _ Sorenstam. ``When I play
head-to-head with her,'' said Webb, of the game's former queen from
Sweden, ``I know that I have to play my best golf to beat her.
Neither of us probably played our best golf the last two rounds
last week, but we pushed each other to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what I'm out here for. I love that
competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Sorenstam, who cringes when reminded of her major
performances since she won that second US Women's Open in 1996 _ in
13 starts she has been Top 10 six times, but painfully has to
accept three missed cuts and the mysterious ``DNP'' at the du
Maurier last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not impatient,'' she said, asked if she has pressed too
hard when these majors rolled around. ``But I think I'm due.''
</P>
<P>
   Most definitely, Sorenstam has proven she is not going to fade
into to the background, as have so many of her counterparts on the
PGA Tour. David Duval, Davis Love, Phil Mickelson &AMP; Co. may have
trouble providing competition for Woods, but Sorenstam, for one, is
quite capable of doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to shake off a 1999 season that was sub-standard for
her (her lowest output of wins _ two _ since her sophomore year on
Tour, 1995), Sorenstam in just her second start of the 2000 season
got a chance at Webb, only to lose in a playoff at the Takefuji
Classic in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Having squandered a one-shot lead entering the final round,
Sorenstam was not as upset about the loss to Webb as she was with
the reason. Her putting. It was the part of her game that started
to push Sorenstam into the shadows cast by Webb, Inkster, and Pak,
though a chance meeting with Dave Stockton Sr. almost a year ago is
starting to pay dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so concerned about how I took the putter back,'' said
Sorenstam. ``He said it doesn't matter. Just strike the ball with
the hand forward. He really turned that around and now I enjoy
practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   The week after her playoff loss to Webb in Hawaii, Sorenstam won
the Welch's/Circle K Championship which earned her enough points to
earn entry into the LPGA Hall of Fame. A nice honor, she said, but
just as pleasing was a victory at the Firstar LPGA Classic in May,
then last Saturday's meeting with Webb at the Royal Golf Club
Evian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karrie beat me in a playoff in Hawaii,'' said Sorenstam, who
was forced into extra holes when Webb birdied the par-5 18th, then
won with a 5-foot eagle putt on that same hole. ``So this was kind
of my revenge a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it temporary satisfaction, because Sorenstam has a more
long-term goal. She wants to be where she once was _ the game's
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be No. 1 in the world, but it's tough to stay
up there. I don't want to be here (a notch or two below Webb), and
now you have to climb back up again. The motivation is there. Now
I'm chasing somebody and know what I want, and I think that's what
drives me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb glances in the rear-view mirror and welcomes the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got beat by an eagle (last week),'' said Webb. ``When it's
against Annika, I know that my most competitive nature comes out as
far as knowing that I'm just going to have to grit this one out all
the way to the end to beat her.''

&HT;     FOUL THOUGHTS ABOUND DURING CHICKING FILMING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE WESTBROOK  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of molding hundreds of clay chickens, animators
Nick Park and Peter Lord had some foul moods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick and I often expressed unkind thoughts about chickens
during the shoot,'' Lord said of Chicken Run, an animated film he
and Park directed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd had about enough of them. It was a love-hate thing, I
must confess.''
</P>
<P>
   The men even caught themselves craving chicken meals - as
revenge for their painstaking work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ashamed to say,'' Park said, ``I am not a vegetarian.''
</P>
<P>
   But somehow they retained a certain love for the funny fowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally we liked them as creatures,'' Lord said,
``because they're so absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Absurd mirth is just part of the fun of Chicken Run, the
ambitious first feature film from Britain's Aardman, a studio that
specializes in stop-motion animation.
</P>
<P>
   That involves making miniature sets for clay or mechanical
models of characters, which are minutely reshaped and shifted for
each frame of film.
</P>
<P>
   Since a single second requires 24 frames, a week's labor at
Aardman might produce just 100 seconds of film.
</P>
<P>
   Such work has graced movies since the silent era. The giant ape
of 1933's King Kong was stop-motion, as were the goblins of 1993's
The Nightmare Before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, fanciful effects have become dominated by
CGI or computer images.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Aardman proudly carries the torch as the world's chief
stop-motion studio.
</P>
<P>
   It is best known for three short films with Wallace &AMP; Gromit, a
cheese-loving British inventor and his smarter dog. Their
adventures in The Wrong Trousers, directed by Park and produced by
Lord, won 1994's Oscar for best animated short.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you haven't seen such films on video or TV, you may have
seen Aardman's work for TV ads, such as Chevron spots with rubbery
talking cars.
</P>
<P>
   Disregarding Wallace &AMP; Gromit for its first feature irked some
fans - especially in England, where the characters have become ``a
national treasure,'' Park said.
</P>
<P>
   But he and Lord ``wanted to start with a new idea and a clean
slate.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, a Wallace &AMP; Gromit movie will be made. Chicken Run is
Aardman's first film in a five-picture deal with DreamWorks, and
Wallace &AMP; Gromit will follow the second, The Tortoise and the Hare.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Chicken Run has rewards along the same lines.
</P>
<P>
   For its tale of a rooster (voice of Mel Gibson) helping Ginger
(voice of Julia Sawalha) and other chickens escape a farm, an
elaborate Pie-O-Matic device evokes Wallace's wacky inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Guard dogs wear spiky collars akin to Preston's in A Close
Shave, and a coal bin is inscribed with ``Feathers was here,'' a
nod to evil penguin Feathers McGraw of The Wrong Trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken Run also has Aardman's trademark faces, with bright rows
of teeth in wide maws and remarkably distinctive eyes. (Almost
1,000 eyes were created.)But true fowl form was needed, so some of
the crew of 385 went to a chicken farm to study the real animals.
</P>
<P>
   The farm turned out to be an ideal parallel for a film loosely
based on such World War II movies as Stalag 17 and The Great
Escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken farms really are like prison camps with barracks,''
Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly wouldn't have worked so well if it was The Great
Escape with cows,'' Park added.
</P>
<P>
   For scenes shot from a distance or featuring human characters,
the filmmakers used small-scale chicken models, 3 inches high. For
close-ups and concerted ``acting,'' they used 10-inch models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ginger's larger head is barely 2 inches high, yet that makes a
very powerful close-up for the big screen,'' Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 chickens were created.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume they're locked in a vault back in Bristol,'' Lord
said of Aardman's British home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably should give them to members of the crew as
mementos. We don't expect to make a sequel, though I guess that's
been said before.''
</P>
<P>
   Having so many chickens in the same shot was ``maddening,'' Lord
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you had one chicken in the foreground acting her heart
out, you had a dozen in the background who all had to be animated
and kept alive.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least they had a coup for their coop: signing superstar
Gibson, who, it turns out, is a Wallace &AMP; Gromit fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleasantly surprised,'' Park said. ``We kept thinking
he must have better roles to take than a chicken film.''
</P>
<P>
   The men hatched their idea four years ago, and after getting
financing, the production took 18 months, during which Aardman had
much autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great being on the other side of the Atlantic,'' Park
said. ``We weren't dealing so much with men in suits. There was
some tug of war; there always is. But they really wanted us to make
an Aardman movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Park admits using some CGI effects (for rain and a fountain of
gravy).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to embrace new technology,'' he said. ``Some things
are impossible with clay. But the CGI is minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop-motion work has ``a rawness, a reality of performance''
that computers can't convey, Park said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it hasn't gotten any easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very traditional technique, and this is really the only
way to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hesitate to call it a dying breed because we've grown a lot
in the past three years,'' Lord said. ``But generally it's an art
form that's dying out. I think that's because it's difficult.
People want easier, safer solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop-motion is ``risky'' because ``you only get one chance at a
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tweak it, as you do with computers or drawn
animation. If a shot doesn't work - if it's really bad - you have
to go back and do another take.''
</P>
<P>
   But extra work can come from being good, not bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We test-screened the film for a live audience, and the
reaction was: more rats,'' Lord said, referring to the chickens'
bartering rat allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in the last few months we extended their scenes, including
a bit at the very end.
</P>
<P>
   ``By chance, I got to do an awful lot of work on the rats,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day, more rats. But at least they weren't chickens.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King''
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Foster is a deal maker or breaker in Hollywood, and as
such she helped green-light this ill-advised nonmusical remake of
the fact-based tale from The King and I.
</P>
<P>
   Anna and the King is handsomely produced (with Malaysia subbing
for 1862 Siam), but it suffers due to Foster's woefully stiff
performance as a widowed English teacher trying to expand horizons
for the king's many children.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Chow Yun-Fat is superb as the king. Sporting an
uncannily fresh haircut in each scene, he's commanding without
being pompous - stern without being uncompassionate.
</P>
<P>
   The tale is peppered with palace intrigue and scenes of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially it's a romantic adventure with touches of comedy,
but, sadly for some viewers, no songs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Chow's romantic attraction to Anna is absurd,
nonsensical, unbelievable, etc. etc. But if you can focus on the
charming Chow instead of Foster's pinched fussiness, this Anna can
be rewarding as old-fashioned entertainment.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy''
</P>
<P>
   You could call this Gilbert and Sullivan Not in Love. You
definitely can call it an entertaining and informative portrait of
the great composing team of Victorian-era British theater.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship became stormy in the mid-1880s when Gilbert's
formulaic plots pushed a restless Sullivan to the edge. But when
Gilbert was inspired by a Japanese exhibit, The Mikado was born.
</P>
<P>
   Topsy-Turvy follows that light opera's creation, offering chunks
of the show as rehearsals or public performances. But mostly it's a
backstage look at art warring with commerce, at great talents beset
by human frailties, and at a special blend of creative juices.
</P>
<P>
   Though knowledge of Gilbert and Sullivan would grease the wheels
of appreciation, it isn't required. Besides, part of the reward can
lie in the learning.
</P>
<P>
   Director Mike Leigh (Secrets &AMP; Lies) again assembles a strong
ensemble for sustained scenes of brilliant acting. Though leisurely
(the film runs 160 minutes), Topsy-Turvy is never less than
absorbing, and its period-piece trappings couldn't be better.
</P>
<P>
   Topsy-Turvy won Oscars for its makeup and costume design, and
was nominated for art direction, along with original screenplay.
The last makes marvelously eloquent use of the English language.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cast, Jim Broadbent is a study in stubborn resolve and
gruff authority as Gilbert, while Allan Corduner is richly assured
as the self-amused, carousing Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Timothy Spall who steals the show as a key actor whose
juicy part is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, we witness creation of either ``grand Japanese
opera'' or ``low burlesque in a small theater on the banks of the
river Thames,'' as Gilbert puts it. The truth lies somewhere in
between, and artistic truth is what this fine film is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   1999, R, USA, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $24.95
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo''
</P>
<P>
   Like The Wedding Singer _ whose Adam Sandler executive-produced
this _ Deuce Bigalow offers raucous humor redeemed in part by a
sympathetic antihero.
</P>
<P>
   He's Deuce (Rob Schneider), a pool cleaner who's desperate for
cash. So he claims the clients of a gigolo while house-sitting for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Deuce is no lover; he's a naive slob. But he pleases women by
giving them what they really want, which can be simply an
understanding ear.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that each of his clients, for no logical reason,
suffers from a painfully real ailment.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to poke fun at handicapped people once in a film,
but the jabs here are monotonous and ultimately cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schneider is a good-hearted guy who isn't trying to exploit
or hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's a romantic, and there's a genuine sweetness in his
budding relationship with Arija Bareikis, who - here we go again -
has a wooden leg.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a strong song score, the film is comically uneven, but
it does offer enough good guffaws to stretch its thin plot over a
tidy 88 minutes. For a Saturday Night Live veteran's vehicle, you
can do worse.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   1999, R, Touchstone, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $32.99

U.S. WARNS OF TERRORIST THREAT AGAINST EMBASSY IN JORDAN  
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan, issued an
official warning Thursday morning that it has ``information
concerning terrorist targeting'' of the embassy and ``cannot rule
out'' the possibility of terrorist attacks on U.S. citizens
elsewhere in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   An embassy spokeswoman in Amman said the embassy could not
divulge the nature of the feared attack, the identity of the
suspected terrorists or the source of its information.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the United States has full confidence in the government
of Jordan's demonstrated ability and willingness to address
security threats, the full dimensions of the threat are not
known,'' the embassy said in its statement.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jordan has no recent history of terrorist attacks on
Americans or other foreigners, 28 members of an alleged terror ring
are currently on trial in Amman for what Jordanian prosecutors say
were planned bombings and assaults on local hotels and tourist
sites timed to coincide with Christmas and millennium celebrations
at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. tourists were to have been singled out in those aborted
attacks, prosecutors contend. The defendants are said to have been
enlisted and trained by associates of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
Islamist militant now based in Afghanistan, who is accused of
responsibility for the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``American citizens traveling or residing in Jordan should
exercise prudence, and are urged to review their security practices
and to remain alert to changing situations,'' the embassy said in
its statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``American citizens should avoid large crowds and gatherings,
keep a low profile and vary routes and times of all required
travel.''

COMEBACK HELPS SHAKE SHADOW OF '78 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No sweep. What a relief. We had been getting ready to revisit
some bad history. Here at the Globe, we were preparing one of those
nifty graphics, comparing the Red Sox June swoon of 2000 with the
bloody September of 1978. We live and work in Boston. It is what we
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry to be disappointing all the panic-striken people,'' said
Red Sox pitching guru Joe Kerrigan. ``Now you'll have to reset and
start over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox finally fought back Wednesday night. Trailing by a
run in the bottom of the seventh, they rallied for five runs (on
two hits) against a clueless New York bullpen to win the third game
of this goofy series and put some fire back in the ancient rivalry.
It was New York's turn to be embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Yankees were. Boss Steinbrenner, walking in the
concourse under the stands toward his clubhouse after the game, had
to endure a hoard of Red Sox fans chanting ``Yankees suck.'' It's a
time-tested form of civil disobedience sanctioned by all
card-carrying members of Red Sox Nation. King George must have felt
like Bob Kraft at a Hartford Chamber of Commerce luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the first two games didn't bother us that much,''
said Red Sox right fielder Trot Nixon, who had a triple and a
game-breaking, bases-loaded double. ``It was really important for
us to come back. We're never down-and-out. A lot of teams would
say, `Oh, we've lost a few in a row and this is the Yankees.' But
not us. We've got gamers here.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the Red Sox and Yankees, Nixon is too young to
understand what this game meant to veteran Sox watchers. How could
he know that 22 years ago _ nine months after the birth of Wilton
Veras and almost a full year after the birth of Yankee pitcher Jake
Westbrook _ the Yankees came into Fenway and decimated the Red Sox
in four straight games by an aggregate count of 42-9? A 15-3
trouncing was followed by 13-2, 7-0, and 7-4. The Yankees outhit
the Red Sox, 67-21, and Boston committed 12 errors. Boston never
recovered. Still hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   That is why so many were so nervous Wednesday night when the
locals trailed the hated Yankees in the seventh inning of the third
game of a four-game set. The Yankees had won the series opener,
22-1, to move back into first place Monday. It was the worst Fenway
loss in Red Sox history. Then the Yankees beat Pedro Martinez (New
York's Ron Guidry was Pedro in '78), 3-0. That's 25-1 over two
days. Scary shades of '78.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night was more kind. It could not have been a more
perfect night for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN brought its cameras and announcers to record some new
Sox-Yankee history, and Luis Tiant watched from behind the screen.
Several other grizzled vets of the summer of '78 were back at the
site of the massacre. Jim Rice, MVP in that fateful season, sat in
the Red Sox dugout, staring across the way at Yankee coaches Willie
Randolph and Chris Chambliss. Man of infamy Don Zimmer, who has
switched sides, sat at the right hand of Joe Torre. Jerry Remy
barked into a microphone. Peter Gammons, the Boston baseball bard
of '78, prowled the premises in his new capacity as de facto
commissioner. Yankee trainer Gene Monaham and Steinbrenner were
back at Fenway in the same positions they held 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tight game in the early innings and Boston fans sat on
their hands even when the Red Sox took a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees scored their first run in the fifth, Derek
Jeter ended the bases-loaded threat with a harmless fly to center.
Carl Everett caught the ball, then turned and fired it into the
bleachers before returning to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   If you love the Red Sox, you've got to love Everett because of
his hated for all things New York. He believes the Yankees
seriously derailed his professional career and still thinks they
mess with him on everything from room service to ticket orders when
the Red Sox play at Yankee Stadium. Tuesday he refused to be
interviewed by Yankee flagship station MSG.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox led, 4-2, when '78 stuff started happening in the top of
the seventh. With two on and none out, New York pinch hitter Jose
Vizcaino failed on two bunt attempts, then cracked a hard hopper up
the middle. Sox steady second baseman Jeff Frye went to his right,
but he misread the ball and it skipped past him into center for an
error. Sox fans with long memories (and they are legion) might have
been reminded of Lou Piniella's weak pop fly that fell between five
Boston fielders in Game 3 of the '78 Massacre. Second baseman Frank
Duffy took the fall for the fluffy hit that broke open the ballgame
for the Yankees. Now Frye.
</P>
<P>
   New York's three-run seventh gave the Yankees a 5-4 lead. Nabobs
of negativity remembered that 5-4 was the final score of the Bucky
Dent playoff game in '78. Happily, this bad-luck number was taken
off the board when the Sox roared ahead with a five-spot in the
bottom of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it was the Yankees who were choking. Relievers Jason
Grimsley and Mike Stanton could not throw strikes. With two out,
Grimsley walked (itals)Manny Alexander(unitals) to load the bases,
then Stanton walked Jose Offerman on four pitches to force home the
go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Sox fans came to life with their first ``Yankees suck'' chants
of the night. Then Stanton walked Frye to force home another run.
From the Boston dugout, Pedro openly mocked Stanton. Our only
regret is that ESPN hadn't pinned a microphone on Boss Steinbrenner
for his reaction to the embarrassing exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The game lurched to its ugly finish with the Sox on top.
</P>
<P>
   Breathe deep, Boston fans. Your team has restored calm on Yawkey
Way.

OF MIDLIFE, MONKEYS, AND MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's an interesting news item: ``A new study suggests that the
fall in estrogen levels associated with the mid-life change can
enhance spatial memory, making it easier to remember where car
keys, handbags, and glasses have been left, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   They could have fooled me. Not that it takes much to fool me
these days, when I seem to spend half my time wandering around
looking for one thing or another, saying to myself, ``Now I know I
left it somewhere around here, it's got to be here someplace, I'm
not losing my mind, am I?''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, I forgot where I'd put a couple of pages of notes for
this column. I suppose that qualifies as irony, although I suppose
I have to put it down to stupidity, now that I can no longer blame
my hormones, or lack of them.
</P>
<P>
   But back to this study, an account of which appears in the
current issue of the journal Behavior Neuroscience. I haven't read
the full report, only a brief story about it in Monday's Daily
Telegraph. But even though I know only the barest facts about the
study, I'd be willing to bet that the research was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's common knowledge that women in midlife experience
one memory crisis after another. The phrase, ``Where did I put
that?'' is never far from their lips. As somebody once said (I
can't remember who it was) the real reason women over 50 can't have
babies is because they'd put them down somewhere and forget where
they left them.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to Dr. Agnes Lacreuse of Emory University,
I suspect she might have reached different conclusions if she'd
based her study on humans instead of monkeys. It's a rare monkey
who misplaces her handbag.
</P>
<P>
   According to the news account, Dr. Lacreuse ``compared the
performance in memory and decision-making tests of six female
monkeys whose ovaries had been removed with monkeys whose ovaries
were intact. Monkeys without ovaries were poor at recognizing
objects, but had far better spatial memories, even performing as
well as young monkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea if glasses or handbags and car keys figured in
the research methodology, or whether other factors that impinge
upon memory were incorporated into the study. For instance, did the
research factor in stress? Because if the monkeys in the study had
jobs, families, and a million other commitments they'd lose their
car keys, ovaries or no ovaries.
</P>
<P>
   Memory failure in midlife isn't strictly sex-linked, so it can't
all be estrogen-related. Last week, Time magazine's cover story
considered the memory crisis afflicting the aging population, male
and female. Middle-aged men, too, are grappling with the great
plague of forgetting. According to the Time story, science knows
very little about how memory works. It used to be thought that it
worked less well as the years passed because the neurons used to
store memories gradually died off and the body was incapable of
replacing them. But recent research indicates that the brain seems
to be capable of making thousands of new neurons a day, in monkeys
at least, and presumably in humans too, although given Dr.
LaCreuse's memory findings, I'm not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists wrestle with the mystery of memory, the
forgetful are going to great lengths to try to sharpen their aging
brains with vitamin and herbal supplements, memory books and tapes,
memory classes, and mnemonic systems that seem dauntingly
complicated. Toning the memory is hard work. It may be a struggle
against the inevitable. Some researchers think the brain may have a
natural mechanism for retaining what's important and discarding
what's not. That doesn't explain why I keep misplacing my car keys.
I blame it on hormones.

THE ADOPTION ISSUE: KEEP IT PRIVATE, BUT NOT SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Keri and Peter T. moved from one suburb to another earlier
this year, they knew their first-grade son and third-grade daughter
might need help adjusting. But the crisis that confronted Keri at
the kitchen table one day after school wasn't at all what they
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess what?'' said Jason. ``At circle, I shared that I was
adopted!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you do something stupid like that?!'' screeched his
sister. ``You had no right to tell! I want it to be a secret!''
</P>
<P>
   Jason was dumbfounded as Rebecca dissolved into angry tears. So
was Keri. Was this the same daughter who, in first grade, had
shared her adoptive status as proudly and openly as Jason?
</P>
<P>
   ``Developmentally, she was at a new place,'' says her mother,
``and I was scrambling to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   As children grow, their view of adoption changes, sometimes
surprising or hurting parents. ``We feel terrific about being an
adoptive family,'' says Keri. ``To think our child might not . . .
''
</P>
<P>
   Most adoptees today grow up knowing the story of their birth and
adoption. Indeed, adoption specialists counsel parents to use
phrases like ``birth mother'' even with an infant, not because a
baby will understand but so the words begin to feel comfortable in
a parent's mouth. In the preschool years, adoptees who have heard
their story will talk about it with the same pride and pleasure
their parents do. Don't fool yourself, though, cautions child
psychiatrist Steven L. Nickman: ``They know the words but not the
meanings behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   That typically happens at age 6 or 7, when a developmental shift
causes them to want more privacy. It can unfold in several ways:
</P>
<P>
   --A need for control. ``Kids start to compartmentalize, to put
boundaries in their lives,'' says psychologist Joyce Maguire Pavao,
a nationally recognized adoption specialist. As a 5-year-old, a
child may be happy to share crayons and markers with siblings and
keep them in a community box in a kitchen drawer. ``At 7, just as
she wants her own drawer with her own supplies, she wants control
over who knows what about her,'' says Pavao. She is director of the
Center for Family Connection in Cambridge, Mass. and New York, and
the author of ``The Family of Adoption'' (Beacon Press).
</P>
<P>
   --An internal struggle. By about 7, any child is increasingly
able to look at an issue from more than one perspective. ``For an
adoptee, this can be the first inkling of a loss: `Most people who
have children parent them. Why didn't my birth mother?' '' says
educator and adoptive parent Joan Clark. That question turns
egocentric _ ``There must have been something wrong with me that my
birth mother didn't parent me'' _ which may lead him to conclude
there is something shameful about him. That, in turn, may lead him
to be more closemouthed, Clark says. She is executive director of
the Open Door Society, an information and support organization for
those touched by adoption.
</P>
<P>
   --A push from peers. Although the information an adoptee shares
about herself may be warmly accepted by classmates in kindergarten
or first grade, sooner or later the classmates see it in a new,
typically threatening, light: Not every child stays with the family
he or she comes to. That's both scary and wonderful to a child
living with biological parents, says Pavao: ``On the one hand, she
worries, `If my best friend's parents gave her away, maybe this
could happen to me, too.' On the other hand, if she's angry with
her mother, she may think, `Maybe I can get a nicer mother!' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's the worry (Nickman says it's more like terror) that prompts
her to ask her best friend, usually out of the blue, ``How come
your first mother didn't keep you?'' Although it's a question meant
to gain information _ ``I don't want this to happen to me, so I
better make sure I don't do what she did'' _ it takes on a mean
edge, says Nickman. ``The speaker wants to distance herself from an
issue that is very threatening: `` `You must have been really bad
for your parents not to keep you; I could never be that bad.' ''
Nickman is director of the adoption-and-custody unit at
Massachusetts General Hospital and in private practice in
Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   As a child gets slightly older, new issues surface:
</P>
<P>
   --Between 8 and 11: Most preteens become angry and controlling,
adoptees even more so. ``It's a cover for sadness and hurt,'' says
Pavao, ``a way to counteract the lack of control they had over the
beginning of their lives.'' She tells parents this is the time for
a conversation, hard as it is, about loss and sadness, including
your own, and she suggests we look for openings in the culture to
get at our child's feelings. ``The movie `Stuart Little' or the
(new network TV) show `MYOB' (about a girl's search for birth
parents) may be full of offensive stereotypes, but I see them as
opportunities to get kids talking,'' she says. Openings like these
are much better than direct questions. ``Avoid at all costs, `What
do you think about your adoption?' '' says Pavao. ``The word
`adoption' doesn't cross their minds, but the image of who their
birth mother was is always there.''
</P>
<P>
   --Between 9 and 12: ``All children this age are motivated by the
need to fit in, but adoptees in particular can get very
self-conscious about being different,'' says Clark. She tells of a
sixth-grader who lied in class, saying he was born in Boston
instead of China, in order not to draw attention to himself. Her
advice to parents: If you do hear about this behavior (and most of
the time you won't), don't make a big deal about it. ``Ask why he
lied, express the hope he'll get more comfortable with his
adoption, then leave it at that,'' she says. Even when parents came
to her for advice about dealing with lies their 12-year-old wrote
in his autobiography, Clark's advice didn't change: ``It doesn't
help to make him go to the school and say, `I lied.' What helps is
for him to know it's always better to be truthful, but being
truthful doesn't mean you have to share everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there's a difference between privacy and
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   When a stranger stops us and asks ``Where did you get those
adorable Asian children?'' the tendency is to go into great detail.
``It's fine to model to your child that you are proud of being an
adoptive family,'' says Pavao, ``but it's also important to model
that you have boundaries.'' A good response to a stranger: ``We
love to talk about adoption in our family, but we don't talk about
private matters with strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   This is language children can fall back on when peers become
intrusive, which happens even at age 4 or 5 for transracial
adoptees. ``You want him to know some information is private and
that it's up to him to decide what to share,'' says social worker
Carol Rogers of the Newton schools.
</P>
<P>
   She advocates a proactive approach: ``Tell even a 5-year-old,
`Not everyone understands adoption the way we do. Sometimes people
say hurtful things. I'd like to help you so you'll have some
answers and feel prepared.' '' Here are some questions peers
typically ask, with suggested responses:
</P>
<P>
   --How come your real mother didn't keep you? ``My birth mother
knew she couldn't take care of me.'' ``My birth mother chose
adoption for me.'' The use of the term ``birth mother'' helps
children avoid frustrating, circular conversations.
</P>
<P>
   --How come nobody in your family looks like you? ``My birth mom
is in Korea. She looks like me.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helps if an adoptee's repertoire includes a polite
version of ``It's none of your business,'' for instance: ``I'm not
comfortable talking about this'' or ``This is something I talk
about only with my family or my best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Given all that goes on developmentally, it's not surprising that
Rebecca T. wanted to keep her adoption secret at her new school.
Indeed, Pavao says, she wouldn't have been surprised if Rebecca
also had said, ``I wish I had never been adopted!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that a child wishes you weren't her parents, or that
she doesn't love you,'' she says. ``It's a wish for a life that is
less complicated.'' Rather than respond defensively (``What a
terrible thing to say!''), she tells parents to clarify the
statement: ``I bet you're wishing your life was easy, like your
friends' lives, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   While parents always need to respect a child's desire for
privacy, Pavao counsels not making promises you can't keep. Keri at
first, for instance, agreed not to tell anyone in their new town
that Rebecca was adopted. As she made new friends, however, she
began to feel deceitful: ``I told her I would always ask her before
I talked about it to anyone from school, but could she trust me to
talk to friends I trusted?''
</P>
<P>
   The family also talked about how Jason had to have the freedom
to be able to tell his story if he wanted, and that if someone
asked him about his sister, he would say, ``I can talk about me,
but only Rebecca can talk about Rebecca.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed just right to both of them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOW YOU CAN HELP
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Should you tell teachers or not? On the pro side, if a teacher
doesn't know and the subject comes up in the classroom, the teacher
might not be as sensitive as he could be; on the other hand,
adoption can become a label that is applied to any problem that
arises. Professionals generally recommend not putting it on a
child's record, and telling a teacher only after you get to know
him/her. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Be knowledgeable about how adoption comes up in the school
curriculum; be sure appropriate language is used (``A birth mother
chose adoption,'' she didn't ``give the baby away''); offer
yourself as a resource; offer alternatives for some projects: a
family orchard instead of a family tree.
</P>
<P>
   --Girls more than boys may share intimate feelings about
adoption with a best friend, only to have the friend turn around
and blab the details. If you see a friendship going bad, try to
start a conversation about it: ``Sometimes when best friends fight,
they share secrets you wish they hadn't . . . '' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Without telling you, a 12- to 15-year-old may use the Internet
to search for birth parents. This is part of the adolescent search
for self, but the Internet can make a reunion possible without a
teenager's really being prepared. Does your teen have all the
information you have? Offer to see if more is available. If they
want to search, be part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ With more family time available now that summer
is here, try this book for good conversation starters: ``201
Questions to Ask Your Parents/Kids,'' by Pepper Schwartz (Avon).

A MYSTIC VISITOR, A BREAK IN REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has this ever happened to you?
</P>
<P>
   You're going along, minding your own business, when a crack in
the cosmos opens at your feet. Your sense of well-being is
shattered by a betrayal, an unexpected assault, a breach of trust,
an act of deception, a knife in the back, the loss of a dream, the
sudden end of a career.
</P>
<P>
   As you stare into the crevice, reality shifts. The beliefs on
which you base your life tremble. Your sense of security vanishes.
Suddenly, the world darkens and feels dangerous beyond measure.
Suddenly, you mistrust not only those whom you once trusted, but
your own judgment as well. While you're stopped in your tracks,
your mind leaps from one terrible thought to another, like a crazed
monkey trapped in a cage.
</P>
<P>
   How do you repair your sense of the world? In time of need, is
it possible the universe sends messengers to restore your sanity?
</P>
<P>
   The other day, out of the blue, a woman I've never met called to
ask if we'd take a guest into our home. The person she had in mind
was a Mayan from Guatemala, a native healer named Gerado who
traveled the world, sharing his rituals with other indigenous
peoples, keeping the old ways alive. He was in Boston before
leading a trip to a tiny village in Colombia. Oh, yes, he spoke
only Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Fate must have sent him.
</P>
<P>
   On his second night in our home, Gerado asked if I'd like him to
read his stones for me. He laid a colorful hand-woven cloth on our
dining room table and unzipped the bright red-and-yellow bag he
carried with him everywhere. A jumble of stones, beans, and strange
objects spilled out. My husband and I watched him arrange them.
</P>
<P>
   In a line at the top of the cloth, he placed 20 stone objects,
each representing a divine energy in his religion. To his right, he
made a pile of perhaps 25 rocks, each one carefully selected from
some place on earth he had visited. Beside them, he placed a pile
of dried red beans.
</P>
<P>
   As I sat across the table from him, he laid out a handful of
beans in groups of four. Touching each pile, he recited the names
of the 20 divinities and stopped at a certain stone. ``IIQ,'' he
wrote on a sheet of paper. Jack translated the words that followed:
``The wind, which sweeps everything before it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding the cylindrical stone, Gerado reported that I was caught
in a web, or a net, Jack wasn't sure which. I explained that I was
having violent dreams, that I felt possessed by angry obsessive
thoughts. Gerardo made slashing motions. I must sever that net, cut
myself free.
</P>
<P>
   This was the ritual he prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   I was to create a sacred space by setting out four candles: red
to the north, white to the east, blue to the south, yellow to the
west, each exactly an arm's length away. These would create a
circle of safety within which I should seat myself. Gazing at the
red candle, I was to breathe slowly and deeply until I felt
centered. Then I was to make four petitions. After a pause, I was
to visualize each of the petitions as having been granted. All that
was required was to repeat this for 20 straight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``El mente (the mind) must tell el cuerpo (the body), and el
espiritu (the spirit) must tell el corazon (the heart),'' Gerado
said, gesturing. Of course. The way out was to tell myself over and
over what I wanted most deeply, but how should I address my
petitions? Each night I tried a different name for God. None felt
right until I settled on Gerado's choice, IIQ, power of the wind. I
asked to be free of angry thoughts. I asked for peaceful dreams and
headache-free awakenings. I asked to feel more loving and more
loved. I asked for greater balance and pleasure in my life.
</P>
<P>
   I, who could never make myself meditate, have done this ritual
now for eight nights running. I sit in this circle of fire,
listening to Paul Winter's ``Prayer for the Wild Things'' on tape.
</P>
<P>
   Each night my feeling of safety deepens. Each night I reflect
that like a candle, my one precious life is also beautiful, bright,
and brief. Some nights I sense that my pain is shared by all of
creation. Some nights I feel bathed in a healing golden haze. On
others I see the glittering shafts of light from the candles as
swords, cutting me free from my entanglement in ego, judgment, and
rage.
</P>
<P>
   Last night the wind signaled its presence, casting flickering
shadows on my living room walls. If Gerado was sent to guide me,
which I do believe, this is the message he has delivered:
</P>
<P>
   There is a refuge. Seek, and you will find it within.

MORE THAN ONE WAY TO FROST A WINDOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How can I frost a garage window? Or any window, really.
</P>
<P>
   SUE McDERMOTT, Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Easiest and quickest is frost Contact paper. It is easily
removed and a new piece applied when the original deteriorates.
There are two paints you can use instead: Zynolite, an aeorol
spray; two coats for more opaqueness. It can be cleaned off with
Windex. The other is frosting paint made by Sapolin, sold in paint
stores.
</P>
<P>
   And here's what G.D. of Melrose, Mass. did: Put up a plastic
ceiling light panel, cut to fit, secured with glazing points.
</P>
<P>
   All these applications go on the inside of the window.
</P>
<P>
   And here is what C.K. of Wilmington, Mass. learned about it, by
accident. He said he was sandblasting something with a hand-held
sandblasting blower when he inadvertently hit a pane of glass.
``Perfect frosting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am buying a 19-year-old house. I was told the kitchen floor
is ceramic tile, but it doesn't look like it to me. It is brick red
and has no shine, and is quite dingy looking, with white marks. Is
it ceramic, and if so,how can I clean it? What if it is ruined?
</P>
<P>
   KATHY DOLAN, West Roxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's ceramic tile all right, but not the shiny tile you are
used to. It is quarry tile, unglazed and with no shine, and it
quickly and naturally gets dirty because it is unglazed. It is not
ruined, but it really is not a good choice for a kitchen or most
other floors because it is unglazed. Those white spot are water
marks.
</P>
<P>
   You can clean it, with effort, by rubbing with steel wool soaked
in paint thinner, or steel wool dipped in a strong solution of Spic
and Span and water. Rinse and dry off the tile; the Spic and Span
could cause more white spots. Once you get it clean, you can apply
a coat of Future, which will give it a shine and make it easier to
keep clean. Try the Future in a small area to ensure it will not
make the tile look worse. The handyman got in big trouble some time
ago when he suggested Future on a quarry tile floor and it came out
horribly, probably because it was already finished with something.
Someday, if you get tired of all this work, you can have glazed
tile installed. It is really easy to keep clean; just swipe it with
a wet sponge.
</P>
<P>
   The only place quarry tile should be used, in my opinion, is on
a sunroom floor, where the solar heat will be absorbed by the tile
and stored until it is needed when the sun goes down. Shiny, glazed
tile would reflect this solar heat, making the sunroom less
effective.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is wrapped in Typar, and I plan to put up cedar
shingles on the walls. Should I put on cedar breather, a
1/4-inch-thick spacing blanket to allow air to flow between
shingles and sheathing?
</P>
<P>
   ED GERMAIN, Dublin, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. Hm. I have never heard of cedar breather going under wall
shingles, only under cedar shingles on the roof. The air space on
the roof allows the shingles to breathe both up and down, keeping
them from decaying. If the shingles were applied directly to the
sheathing, they would decay long before their time.
</P>
<P>
   While cedar breather is not designed for walls, it is a good
idea, because it will provide an air space, so if water vapor tends
to migrate from inside the house through the sheathing (and that
has happened in many houses in New England) the condensing vapor
will run down the air space before it pushes the paint off the
shingles. If you are putting up white cedar shingles, and don't
paint or treat them in any way, then you don't need the cedars
breather. But it won't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to the cedar breather is 3/8-inch insulation,
which will prevent water vapor from condensing into water. This
also will not hurt if you paint or stain or not.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to hang a shelf on a plastered wall? Should I
use brackets and Molly bolts, or can I use the stick-on brackets
that claim to hold 10 pounds?
</P>
<P>
   ANTHONY COSTELLO, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Use brackets, but I would try to screw them into studs. I am
always wary of stick-ons. One reason: You can use them on paint but
generally they work less well on wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot locate the studs for hanging brackets, you can use
Molly bolts, which will work well in a plastered wall with some
kind of lath behind it. In other words, if the wall is thick enough
to hold the bolts and brackets securely.
</P>
<P>
   And here's another idea that you might find useful: Nail two
boards together into an ``L'' shape, one board to be the shelf and
other to be its support, setting against the wall. Then you can
nail through that bottom board into studs.
</P>
<P>
   Use brackets to bolster the shelf. They can be screwed into the
bottom board and the underside of the shelf.

   NEWPORT, Mass. _ Hidden behind a stone wall and a thick screen
of trees at the end of Bellevue Avenue, the legendary street where
summer ``cottages'' stand as monuments to the excess of America's
Gilded Age, lies Rough Point, Doris Duke's baronial mansion.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be as grand as the homes of the Vanderbilts and
Astors, who spent fortunes trying to outmarble, outgild, and
outbuild one another at the turn of the century. But the dark
granite and sandstone structure, which mirrors the craggy,
forbidding coastline below, surely commands the most sweeping views
_ and holds the most secrets.
</P>
<P>
   On July 5, the gates of Rough Point will be thrown open to the
public for the first time. Visitors will be able to explore more
than a dozen rooms in the 30-room, 40,000-square-foot house and its
formal gardens and grounds. They will be able to walk through a
world that Duke, once known as ``the richest girl in the world,''
fiercely guarded before her death at age 80 in 1993. She abhorred
being photographed, traveled under aliases and behind sunglasses,
and always heeded her father's dying words _ ``Trust no one.'' Now
details of her everyday life will be accessible to all.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has been altered since the lonely billionairess last
walked out the back door. Even a used piece of soap still nestles
in a dish in an upstairs bathroom. And telephones and televisions
coexist with priceless antiques and paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a time capsule,'' says Pieter Roos, executive
director of the Newport Restoration Foundation, which was founded
by Duke in 1968 and owns Rough Point along with 80 other historic
buildings that she restored throughout the city. ``We want to keep
it as the house was lived in during the 1980s. We want people to
know a little bit more about Doris, the contents of her house, and
how she lived in the house. Although little has changed through the
years (Duke's father bought the house in 1922), Doris was
constantly adding to the collection, especially after her mother,
whom she didn't get along with, died in the late 1950s. It was then
that she began decorating in her own taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only relative who claimed anything after Doris's death was
her half nephew, Walker Inman Jr.,'' continues Roos. ``But he just
took a few objects for sentimental reasons _ a Tiffany teapot and
some mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's two beloved dogs, however, remain. They roam the estate's
10 acres but don't have to contend with their mistress's two pet
camels, which in summers slept in a tent on the side lawn and wore
custom-made garlands and pink bridles to their coming-out party.
And the trust-fund pooches no longer sleep in their mistress's
bedroom, with its collection of elaborate mother-of-pearl
furnishings, or lounge in the solarium on humid afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   What awaits visitors in the rooms open to the public is an
astonishing collection of 16th-century tapestries; paintings by
Gainsborough, Anthony Van Dyck, and Renoir; Ming Dynasty garden
seats and large jars; exquisite Isfahan and Savonnerie rugs; ornate
chandeliers; and Flemish and English furniture.
</P>
<P>
   What they will not see are any photographs. Not one framed
picture of Duke's father, the American Tobacco Co. baron James B.
Duke, or of his second wife and Duke's mother, Nanaline Lee Holt
Inman Duke. Not one photo of Duke herself, who was frightfully
self-conscious about her more-than-6-foot height. No shots of her
two husbands _ the second was Dominican playboy Porfirio Rubirosa,
who wedded another fabulously wealthy woman, Barbara Hutton _ nor
of her friends Jacqueline Onassis; Elizabeth Taylor, to whom she
gave $1 million for AIDS research; or Imelda Marcos, a frequent
visitor at Rough Point for whom Duke posted $5 million in bail when
Marcos was accused of helping her husband loot the Philippines.
There are also no pictures of her adopted, then disinherited
daughter, former bellydancer and Hare Krishna member Chandi
Heffner. Nor of Hollywood set designer Eduardo Tirella, whom she
accidentally crushed to death with her car against the gates of
Rough Point in the mid-'60s. Nor her beloved but alcoholic and
semiliterate butler, Bernard Lafferty, whom she named executor of
her $1.5 billion estate shortly before her death.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one life-size oil painting of Duke herself,
at 12, hanging at the top of the main staircase. Duke reportedly
told people that sitting for the portrait ruined her summer except
for the day the artist, John de Tosta, put the wrong end of the
brush in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Rough Point, which was built in the late 1880s for Frederick
Vanderbilt about the same time William K. Vanderbilt's Marble House
was being built a few blocks away, was only one of Duke's
residences. She owned a 2,700-acre farm in New Jersey; a
Moroccan-style home filled with Islamic art in Hawaii; a penthouse
in Manhattan; and Rudolph Valentino's former home, Falcon Lair, in
the Hollywood Hills.
</P>
<P>
   But she spent more time at Rough Point, from May to Thanksgiving
with trips to New York and Europe in between, than elsewhere,
according to estate manager Philip Mello.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main misconceptions about her is that she threw
large parties. She didn't,'' says Mello. ``She'd have four or six
people for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke, an early riser, always had breakfast served in bed. The
dogs would sometimes jump on the bed and spill things, but she
didn't seem to care, according to Mello.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dogs were number one around here,'' he says. ``She loved
animals. And, yes, she was very demanding. But she was OK to work
for. It was a job. And we were great chatterers and argued about
everthing _ politics, religion, philosophy. She read several
newspapers each day _ The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times,
and sometimes The Washington Post _ but I never saw her with a
book.''
</P>
<P>
   She swam twice a day, took lunch in the solarium, and composed
pieces on the piano. She'd dress for dinner when she had guests but
wore slacks and blouses most days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Duke played with people,'' says Mello. `` ``She'd act as
if she were on their side, you know, play along with them. Then
she'd look away and roll her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Two needlepoint pillows in the cozy, comparatively small morning
room speak volumes about Duke. One pillow says ``Familiarity
breeds''; the other, ``My decision is maybe and that's final.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its name, the morning room is where Duke brought guests
after dinner for drinks and conversation before a huge fire. The
room, with its comfortable modern couches, is home to Duke's last
major purchase, in 1985 _ a 17th-century Dutch marine painting by
Jan Van DeCapelle. Other treasures include a portrait by Joshua
Reynolds and a set of Dutch inlaid chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's interest in textiles is evident in the dining room, where
the walls are covered with 16th-century and 18th-century Flemish
and French tapestries. Ornate plaster ceilings look down on Van
Dyck's 17th-century portrait of Charles II, two John Hoppner
portraits, a pair of Della Robbia glazed-earthenware fruit baskets,
and a 25-by-25-foot 19th-century rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke had very good taste; she was very particular about
everything and she was constantly tweaking her collection,'' says
Roos, leading visitors into the great hall. ``The hall with its
monumental scale is similar to the austere halls of British homes;
it definitely has a baronial feel to it. The matched set of
tapestries are from Brussels and were woven around 1510. The
collection of Ming garden seats and jars is outstanding, and the
paintings are by Gainsborough, Van Dyck, and Ferdinand Bol. The
carpet is a 17th-century Isfahan and the three silver-plate
chandeliers are early-1700s French.''
</P>
<P>
   The other rooms on the first floor include the very French
yellow room, with its 16th-century Florentine screens and Louis XVI
furniture. The ballroom-size music room has breathtaking
hand-painted 18th-century Chinese wallpaper with a peony-and-cherry
motif, rock-crystal chandeliers that shine down on a vast
Savonnerie carpet, and a set of 1780 French chairs with their
original upholstery. This room and the yellow room have
18th-century parquet floors that originally graced a chateau near
Versailles and spent time on the floor of her Hawaii mansion before
being brought to Newport.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is Duke's favorite spot _ the solarium, with its three
glass walls overlooking the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a southwest breeze here, which the other houses
on Bellevue don't get,'' says Roos, ``mainly because this house
blocks them from that breeze. So the house is never unbearably hot.
And the mirror over there is broken because during Hurricane Bob,
the camels were brought inside and hay spread on the floor. It
seems one of the camels, Princess, whipped her head around and
broke the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   The two rooms open to the public upstairs are Duke's purple
bedroom, filled with mother-of-pearl furniture from the 1820s, and
her music room. There's a collection of small trophies in her desk
in the bedroom, honoring her prowess at the tango, Monday tennis,
and sandcastles. Duke was an accomplished pianist who practiced
twice daily, had a passion for jazz and gospel music, and studied
modern dance with Martha Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Duke's home can step back in time but can also catch
a glimpse of the future and perhaps the beginnings of a new Gilded
Age. But this time around, it could be called the Golden Chip Age,
since the money pouring into Newport is coming from dot-coms, not
steel, coal, railroads, and tobacco. Over the hedge from Rough
Point, a waterfront house is undergoing a reported $6 million in
renovations. Its owner is from Chicago. It will be his summer home,
or cottage. Just like a hundred years ago.

&HT;     LAWMAKER ROLLS OUT A DOT-COM LICENSE PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A Silicon Valley assemblyman who is running
for Congress has introduced a bill to create a new ``dot-com''
license plate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which the Transportation Committee of the state
Senate approved this week, is sponsored by the computer industry as
a way to raise money to buy computers for needy public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Highway
Patrol would design the plates. Right now, the only requirement is
that ``.com'' would be placed somewhere on the right side of the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Jim Cunneen, R-Cupertino, said the new plates are
``a perfect way of honoring the contributions of the industry''
while raising money to ``bridge the digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   California is already spending plenty of money on school
computers. The state budget for school technology and Internet
access will soon reach $1 billion. If 10,000 dot-com license plates
are sold, another $500,000 would be raised for school computers and
technology, minus the DMV's costs for making the plates.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the plates came from Namezero.com, a privately held
Los Gatos company with about 15 employees. The year-old company
registers domain names on the Internet for free, and it promised to
get 10,000 people to sign up for the new dot-com plates.
</P>
<P>
   In his press release on the bill, Cunneen included this
promotional plug from Namezero.com President Bruce Keiser: ``As the
only internet domain name registrar to provide fee .com domain
names ... Namezero believes that a .com license plate is a great
way to extend an Internet identity.''
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago, the Senate Transportation Committee agreed
to stop approving new specialty license plates because the state
was making so many different varieties. The CHP complains because
its officers have trouble identifying the plates.
</P>
<P>
   But the Legislature makes exceptions. The most recent was a
plate honoring Ronald Reagan, the former governor and president.

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: Reforms needed to avoid costly building spree
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, the Texas prison system has moved from
crisis to crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Unless action is taken quickly, the free world's largest prison
system will be hit with another crisis that again will hit Texas
taxpayers in the pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal punishment in Texas has come a long way from the
15-prison, 18,000-inmate prison system in 1979 to today's
110-prison, 150,000-inmate system.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' 1979 prison system was placed under federal control after
evidence emerged that prisoners were treated unconstitutionally.
</P>
<P>
   The next crisis occurred when lawmakers kept increasing
penalties in an effort to crack down on crime. Texas prisons became
so overcrowded that the backlog filled up county jails across the
state and forced the early release of violent criminals to make
room for the incoming prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1987, Texas had a mandatory release program for violent
criminals after they collected sufficient ``good time'' credits. It
was a stupid requirement even if it did relieve overcrowding. The
last prisoners society wants back on the streets before their
sentences are fully served are violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Overcrowding finally convinced the Legislature to ask Texans for
approval to launch a multi-billion-dollar prison building program.
Texas voters gave the lawmakers the go-ahead that resulted in a
prison system reportedly larger than those of any state and any
nation except China.
</P>
<P>
   Texas incarcerates 739 people for every 100,000 residents
compared to 530 for every 100,000 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, where the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles was
releasing nearly 80 percent of inmates when they first became
eligible for parole in 1994, only 20 percent are now being
released.
</P>
<P>
   Now the free world's largest prison system is again about to
overflow. Texans can either undertake another prison building binge
or find a better way punish criminals. The better way is best.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the 18-member parole board should begin releasing
non-violent prisoners when they become eligible for parole.
Thousands of prisoners are locked away for using drugs, not selling
drugs. Other prisoners have been sentenced due to their addiction
to alcohol. These addicted, non-violent prisoners should be
considered for release when they become eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, prosecutors and judges should develop alternative
sentencing for non-violent crimes. Alternative sentencing should
include participation in community service projects as well as
restitution to victims.
</P>
<P>
   More needs to be done to utilize the state jail program that
offers education and drug treatment to non-violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Prisons should do more to protect prisoners and break up prison
gangs that indoctrinate prisoners with racial hatred and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Parole oversight should be beefed up.
</P>
<P>
   More should be done to prevent crime by investing in children
who need to stay in school and obtain the education required to
become responsible, tax-paying adults.

SOME TEST SCORES ARE BETTER LEFT UNKNOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a recent staff meeting a colleague of mine at the newspaper
announced that he had been accepted into Mensa, the society of
people with high IQs.
</P>
<P>
   It was an awkward moment, I can assure you. Five seconds
earlier, the man had been just like the rest of us: a burned-out
drudge working out of a dim cubicle, wondering where it all went
wrong. Then, in an instant, he was transformed into someone else:
someone finer, someone sharper, someone from whom we could possibly
borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   As I fought off the urge to run my thumb along the throbbing
vein in his bulging forehead, I wondered: Are these intelligence
tests really trustworthy? I mean, if he is so smart, what is he
doing working here?
</P>
<P>
   Also, does this man now feel pressured by higher expectations?
When he writes his next hurricane story, will he not feel compelled
to use more big words or perhaps preface his story with a quote
from Shakespeare? (One possibility: ``Blow, winds, and crack your
cheeks! Rage! Blow!'')
</P>
<P>
   Is life not easier for people like me, for whom the $100
questions on Who Wants to be a Millionaire are an intellectual
challenge?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, but I do think this testing thing has gotten out
of hand. One could argue that there are good reasons to test
students and teachers and possibly even over-achieving weather
reporters, but do we really need an intelligence test for dogs?
</P>
<P>
   There is one, you know. It's found in the book ``The
Intelligence of Dogs: A Guide to the Thoughts, Emotions and Inner
Lives of Our Canine Companions'' by Stanley Coren (Bantam, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Coren, there are three types of dog
intelligence: Adaptive intelligence (learning and problem-solving
ability), instinctive intelligence (specific to individual animal
and measured by canine IQ test) and working/obedience intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   As I write this, my pug dog, Buster, is standing by the
sliding-glass door, barking insanely at what must seem to him a
highly threatening oxygen molecule. Buster is similarly affected by
TV doorbells. I would say that this falls under the category of
``instinctive intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   When I take Buster outside, I encourage him to chase rabbits
because I feel that rabbits generally lead a pretty dull existence
and deserve a good laugh. When I point to a rabbit, or throw him on
top of a rabbit, he invariably tears off in the opposite direction.
I would call this ``working/obedience intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   When given a choice between whatever we are eating (steak) and
whatever he is eating (hard, dry, cracker-like substance from a
50-pound bag), Buster will always choose the former. This is an
example of ``adaptive intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Much to my surprise, Dr. Coren ranked pugs 57th in intelligence
out of 79 breeds. (Border collies were the smartest and Afghan
hounds the stupidest.) Apparently unaware of Buster's unwavering
commitment to protecting his home against uninvited oxygen
molecules and TV doorbells, Dr. Coren also ranked pugs among the
dogs that are ``least likely to succeed at watchdog barking.''
</P>
<P>
   Buster is asleep now, but I can tell that this low intelligence
ranking has him deeply troubled. (His snoring seems more melancholy
and despairing.) Perhaps his self-esteem will be harmed to the
point that he will no longer jump on the furniture or accept a
doggie treat when I wave it under his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but not likely.

next week to partially lift the embargo by ending sanctions on U.S.
sales of food, medicine and medical supplies to Cuba. By DAN

   DIESEL-POLLUTION _ ATLANTA _ A variety of environmental groups
on Thursday told the EPA that proposed regulations to drastically
reduce pollution from diesel trucks and buses is the most
significant step to cut vehicle emissions since the removal of lead
from gasoline. Speaking at a public hearing in Atlanta on the new
rules, the groups urged the EPA to withstand efforts by the oil
industry to weaken the rules. Oil industry spokesmen said the new
rules will greatly drive up the cost of diesel fuel and trucking

   SHOWTIME _ Diversity, thy name is premium cable. Last year,
after prolonged finger-wagging by civil rights groups and
predictable hand-wringing by the major television networks, a deal
was struck to put more minorities on both sides of the camera. But
while NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox are still figuring out how to honor
that promise in their upcoming fall lineups, cable's Showtime
network is unveiling a pair of weekly dramas this summer that are
deliciously, and daringly different. ``Soul Food'' is based on the
1997 box office sleeper of the same name, and ``Resurrection
Boulevard'' revolves around a multi-generational Mexican family. In
their own way, both shows prove it's possible to produce top-notch
television with minority casts and grownup themes. (LHarris,

   MERDORE BORDER CROSSING, Yugoslavia _ She called it the ``worst
torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Alma Berisha's 45-year-old husband, Renor, was rounded up and
jailed 14 months ago by Serb paramilitaries. For months she and her
family awaited word of his fate. They then paid thousands of
dollars in bribes for his freedom. And then they had to wait some
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't know the agony of not knowing if someone is alive or
dead,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing days of last year's 78-day NATO bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia, Serb military and paramilitary gangs wreaked a
final round of terror as they retreated, rounding up thousands of
Kosovar Albanians and throwing many of them in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 1,100 ethnic Albanians, including old men,
women and teenagers under 18, remain in limbo in Serb jails, in
part because Western diplomats, rushing to finalize a cease-fire
agreement with the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government, deleted from
the document thorny provisions covering prisoner exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians defended this choice as politically expedient,
it has fostered a web of corruption within Serbia that charge
families between US$7,000 and US$15,000 to secure the release of
their relatives. In the last year, close to 1,000 Kosovar Albanians
have been freed from Serb jails, and Red Cross officials estimate
that 90 percent of those releases came after bribes paid by
families.
</P>
<P>
   The system, aid officials here say, is unjust, but they complain
that the strained political relationship between the international
community and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic keeps their
hands tied in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the hands of Belgrade,'' Nic Sommers, spokesman for
the International Committee of the Red Cross in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For the Berisha family, left with no political lifeline to help
free Renor, a former schoolteacher in his hometown of Djakova, in
western Kosovo, the choice was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you speak of money or a life, there is no choice. You
pay,'' Alma Berisha said.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's disappearance on May 13 last year, Alma
finally learned Renor was alive on Sept. 25. His name had been
published by the Red Cross, who gained access to many prisoners
after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The spunky 31-year-old with short curly, black hair, traveled to
the prison four times to visit Renor, reporting back to the family
that he was in good health and was treated humanely. But he had no
hope for release until February, when an Albanian lawyer named Ismi
Bytygi called the family.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said he could make a deal with the Serbs to free
Renor. The cost: US$7,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Berishas scrounged together the cash, gave it to the lawyer.
And, for three more months, no word came.
</P>
<P>
   The tension during this time was unbearable, Alma recalled. Her
4-year-old son, Renlend, insisted his home set a plate at his dad's
place at the dinner table ``so we could feel nearer to him,'' she
said. But the empty place hung heavily on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst torture. This waiting time,'' Alma said
during an interview with Cox Newspapers last month at their family
home.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, without any warning, the family received a
phone call they had been waiting for: 17 Albanians would be
released at the Merdore Border Crossing the next day, and Renor
would be among them.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, the Berishas flew into motion. With less than 24 hours
to prepare, Alma was overcome with apprehension. She elected to
stay home with Renlend and other women in the family to prepare the
welcome home feast, while her brothers-in-law and her older son,
12-year-old Shefki, drove the four hours to the border to greet
Renor.
</P>
<P>
   When they reached Merdore in the early afternoon of May 30, a
crowd of about 100 people _ family members who also were waiting
for their relatives _ had already gathered.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere along the two-lane road felt like an airport when
an arriving plane is late. People attempted nervous small talk, not
daring to speak what each feared, that their husband, son or sister
would not appear.
</P>
<P>
   All of the 17 families said they paid to free their relatives.
None believed that the money was used for court fees or defense
investigations, but simply got passed along as bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares whose pockets I line or where it all ends up. What
is money, when you are talking about a human life?'' said one man
who paid US$10,000 to have his 21-year-old son released.
</P>
<P>
   As shadows lengthened across the grain fields dotted with red
poppies and the heat slipped from the late spring day, the tension
collapsed into wails of joy, like a clap of lightning followed by
raindrops.
</P>
<P>
   A three-vehicle convoy of white minibuses had been glimpsed down
the road across the stretch of no-man's land. Slowly, 15 men and
two women got out of the vehicles and walked single file under a
concrete railroad bridge and across the border to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Renor came into view at the end of the line. He walked strongly,
with hands swinging, past Serb guards and into the arms of his
family.
</P>
<P>
   The Berishas smothered him in kisses, while he scooped his son
into his arms. Minutes later, the former schoolteacher, who looked
pale but otherwise healthy was still too overcome with emotion to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   The only member of the family who could find words through the
tears was Shefki, who wore a wide grin across his freckled face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm very happy. My dad has missed so much,'' the lanky
youngster said. ``He's not fat anymore. Now, I'll have to tease him
about something else.''

   MERDORE BORDER CROSSING, Yugoslavia _ She called it the ``worst
torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Alma Berisha's 45-year-old husband, Renor, was rounded up and
jailed 14 months ago by Serb paramilitaries. For months she and her
family awaited word of his fate. They then paid thousands of
dollars in bribes for his freedom. And then they had to wait some
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't know the agony of not knowing if someone is alive or
dead,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing days of last year's 78-day NATO bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia, Serb military and paramilitary gangs wreaked a
final round of terror as they retreated, rounding up thousands of
Kosovar Albanians and throwing many of them in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 1,100 ethnic Albanians, including old men,
women and teenagers under 18, remain in limbo in Serb jails, in
part because Western diplomats, rushing to finalize a cease-fire
agreement with the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government, deleted from
the document thorny provisions covering prisoner exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians defended this choice as politically expedient,
it has fostered a web of corruption within Serbia that charge
families between US$7,000 and US$15,000 to secure the release of
their relatives. In the last year, close to 1,000 Kosovar Albanians
have been freed from Serb jails, and Red Cross officials estimate
that 90 percent of those releases came after bribes paid by
families.
</P>
<P>
   The system, aid officials here say, is unjust, but they complain
that the strained political relationship between the international
community and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic keeps their
hands tied in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the hands of Belgrade,'' Nic Sommers, spokesman for
the International Committee of the Red Cross in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For the Berisha family, left with no political lifeline to help
free Renor, a former schoolteacher in his hometown of Djakova, in
western Kosovo, the choice was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you speak of money or a life, there is no choice. You
pay,'' Alma Berisha said.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's disappearance on May 13 last year, Alma
finally learned Renor was alive on Sept. 25. His name had been
published by the Red Cross, who gained access to many prisoners

   NEW-DANCERS (New York) _ What makes a dancer stand out from the
crowd? A dazzling technique helps, though multiple turns and high
jumps are par for the course today. Beautiful bodies and appealing
faces draw the eye. But stages are full of performers who fit the
prescibed notion of physical perfection. There are so many dancers
to claim the heart and mind and eye, yet only a few do each season.
Ease, physical eloquence and quiet daring are common denominators
among seven outstanding new or unfamiliar performers who will dance
this weekend in New York, as well as the three former Alvin Ailey
dancers whose new modern-dance troupe has made its debut this week
at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the Berkshires. All occupy
the stage with a look of unassuming ownership. Each catches the eye
with something more than skill or physical beauty, an often elusive
quality that remains in the mind, like a flash of bright unexpected
color on a bustling city street, long after the curtain falls. By
Jennifer Dunning.

   OLD-THEATERS (Undated) _ When you want to orient yourself in a
new city or to see a familiar one in a new way, it is useful to
have an obsession. Over the last two years I revisited three cities
I know well: Boston, Buffalo and Philadelphia. During those visits
I looked at them from the idiosyncratic standpoint of what had
become of their historic theaters, I also made a trip to Washington
to visit the nation's most famous and sacred historic theater,
Ford's; actually, it is a facsimile, as the original structure in
which Abraham Lincoln was assassinated was torn down. In the course
of these trips I learned much about the dynamics and histories of
the cities themselves. I saw the tremendous energy and sometimes
heartbreaking compromises necessary to maintain a performing-arts
center today. And I learned how intensely it is possible to love a
theater and to believe in a city, so much so that some people may
devote most of their adult lives, sometimes as volunteers, to
keeping an old theater alive. By Mindy Aloff.

<P>
   PHILLY-WARHOL-GWATHMEY (Philadelphia) _ Here's a stretch: one of
the more improbable pairings in recent exhibition history. It puts
the work of Andy Warhol (1928-1987) with that of the social realist
painter Robert Gwathmey (1903-1988), the idea being that the
under-appreciated Gwathmey and the canonized Warhol shared an
outlook as ``social commentators'' on American life. At the
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, each is given a separate
show, ``Robert Gwathmey: Master Painter'' and ``Andy Warhol: Social
Observer.'' But each is meant to complement the other in this
ill-conceived double feature. The Academy's aim in mounting the two
together, it says, is nothing less than reshaping conceptions of
postwar American art. By Grace Glueck.

   APPLES-LOS-ANGELES (Los Angeles) _ More than anywhere else in
America, Los Angeles has been defined by popular culture _ that is,
by the entertainment industry. But they are mere fragments of
reality, snippets of grainy black-and-white or gaudy Technicolor,
and splicing them together into an accurate picture is a tall

&HT;     BOSSES CAN LEARN A THING OR TWO FROM TIGER WOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Suppose you have an employee who is nearly as
talented in your field as Tiger Woods is in his. Could you bring
out the best in that worker?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. Sorry to say, but most bosses are better suited to
managing mediocrity than promoting talent.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why, let's go back three years. At age 21, Woods
had just won the Masters by 12 strokes in arguably the greatest
golfing accomplishment of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose golfers were managed like white-collar workers, and
you were in charge of supervising Woods and 19 other golfers _ some
good, some mediocre and a couple downright lousy. Be honest now:
How much time would you end up spending with Woods?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, probably.
</P>
<P>
   After all, you'd say to yourself, he's already a success. What
more can he do?
</P>
<P>
   As Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman point out in their great
book, ``First, Break All the Rules,'' typical bosses spend most of
their time concentrating on inferior workers, trying to bring them
up to some semblance of mediocrity. Only the best bosses realize
that they will get more by concentrating on the top people, because
their potential is almost unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, a mediocre worker can turn into a lovelier shade of
mediocre. But a superstar can change the world.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was smart and didn't surround himself with a bunch of
``yes'' people, Woods realized after he won the Masters that his
game still needed to improve substantially if he wanted to achieve
his goal of being the best golfer in history. He worked with a
coach for hours and hours to change his swing, and gradually became
the dominant golfer in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Woods topped himself last weekend, winning the U.S. Open by 15
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   One great scene on Sunday was when Woods looked fired up after
sinking a 12-foot putt to save par on the 16th hole. He was already
miles ahead of the competition, but making that putt helped him
finish the final round without making a bogey, one of his goals.
</P>
<P>
   That's how motivated Woods is. Certainly he makes a ton of
money, but he also challenges himself even when money and
competition are not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   All star workers have some sort of internal motivation. As the
Houston Rockets fought back to win their second consecutive
National Basketball Association championship in 1995, Coach Rudy
Tomjanovich came up with a rallying cry: ``Never underestimate the
heart of a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boss, you have to figure out what motivates your stars and
not automatically assume it is the same thing that motivates you.
Maybe they don't care about money or prestige or corner offices;
maybe they would prefer to be recognized in front of their family
or peers, or get more time off, or have an executive assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Don't limit your thinking or theirs. If your quota for
salespeople is $80,000 and someone gets to $120,000, it's easy to
just give her a plaque and be thankful. But maybe she could get to
$300,000, with the right encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   God knows she makes your job easy enough, but what can you do to
make her job easier? Could an assistant handle her paperwork so she
could spend more time selling? Could you pay for a nanny so she
wouldn't worry so much about child care? Could you excuse her from
mundane meetings or send her to a prestigious training program in
Paris?
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know what you can do, here is a wild and crazy
thought: Ask.
</P>
<P>
   Don't use this as an excuse to micromanage, but even the
greatest workers can use help. Woods needs coaches to help with his
swing, and Michael Jordan certainly recognized the importance of
Coach Phil Jackson. The best bosses help great talents achieve
their potential.
</P>
<P>
   Inferior bosses say that they can't play favorites. That is
certainly true, if all your workers are equal. But if some are
giving you extra effort or extra production, you owe it to
yourself, your employee and your company to help your best workers
become even better.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without help, spectacular workers can fade away. Orson Welles
was 25 when he made ``Citizen Kane.'' That was certainly a
wonderful achievement, but you have to wonder if Welles could have
topped himself if he had found the right encouragement. A lot of
directors get better as they gain experience.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest boxer of the 20th century was Muhammad Ali, but
Mike Tyson had the potential to be even better. He was a juvenile
delinquent, but he hooked up with a father figure and coach in Cus
D'Amato, who help him develop as both a boxer and a human being.
But when D'Amato died, no one really took his place, and Tyson
eventually self-destructed.
</P>
<P>
   Keep this in mind, though: Tyson was far better in his sport at
age 20 than Woods was. By the time he turned 21, he had millions of
dollars and a heavyweight championship, but his coach had already
passed away.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you're lucky enough to hire a great talent,
remember Tiger Woods. And never forget Mike Tyson.

   NEW-DANCERS (New York) _ What makes a dancer stand out from the
crowd? A dazzling technique helps, though multiple turns and high
jumps are par for the course today. Beautiful bodies and appealing
faces draw the eye. But stages are full of performers who fit the
prescibed notion of physical perfection. There are so many dancers
to claim the heart and mind and eye, yet only a few do each season.
Ease, physical eloquence and quiet daring are common denominators
among seven outstanding new or unfamiliar performers who will dance
this weekend in New York, as well as the three former Alvin Ailey
dancers whose new modern-dance troupe has made its debut this week
at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the Berkshires. All occupy
the stage with a look of unassuming ownership. Each catches the eye
with something more than skill or physical beauty, an often elusive
quality that remains in the mind, like a flash of bright unexpected
color on a bustling city street, long after the curtain falls. By
Jennifer Dunning.

<P>
   OLD-THEATERS (Undated) _ When you want to orient yourself in a
new city or to see a familiar one in a new way, it is useful to
have an obsession. Over the last two years I revisited three cities
I know well: Boston, Buffalo and Philadelphia. During those visits
I looked at them from the idiosyncratic standpoint of what had
become of their historic theaters, I also made a trip to Washington
to visit the nation's most famous and sacred historic theater,
Ford's; actually, it is a facsimile, as the original structure in
which Abraham Lincoln was assassinated was torn down. In the course
of these trips I learned much about the dynamics and histories of
the cities themselves. I saw the tremendous energy and sometimes
heartbreaking compromises necessary to maintain a performing-arts
center today. And I learned how intensely it is possible to love a
theater and to believe in a city, so much so that some people may
devote most of their adult lives, sometimes as volunteers, to
keeping an old theater alive. By Mindy Aloff.

<P>
   PHILLY-WARHOL-GWATHMEY (Philadelphia) _ Here's a stretch: one of
the more improbable pairings in recent exhibition history. It puts
the work of Andy Warhol (1928-1987) with that of the social realist
painter Robert Gwathmey (1903-1988), the idea being that the
under-appreciated Gwathmey and the canonized Warhol shared an
outlook as ``social commentators'' on American life. At the
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, each is given a separate
show, ``Robert Gwathmey: Master Painter'' and ``Andy Warhol: Social
Observer.'' But each is meant to complement the other in this
ill-conceived double feature. The Academy's aim in mounting the two
together, it says, is nothing less than reshaping conceptions of
postwar American art. By Grace Glueck.

   APPLES-LOS-ANGELES (Los Angeles) _ More than anywhere else in

   TAMIL-TIGERS (Colombo, Sri Lanka) _ The Tamil Tigers, regarded
as perhaps the world's most ruthlessly efficient rebel force, were
forged into a tiny but lethal body of fighters by a cultish leader

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ The man cannot contain the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Leno opens the door to a 1956 Chrysler Imperial to show off
a really unusual automotive option _ a record player built into the
dashboard _ and the boy within him jumps out. Blue eyes sparkling,
he bursts into hearty song: ``Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild
frontier . . .''
</P>
<P>
   In their day, the records that fit the dashboard phonograph
could be purchased only from Chrysler, and Leno has been able to
acquire only two: the Davy Crockett theme song and music from the
movie ``The Pajama Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it Jay's Playhouse, two enormous garages near the airport
here that hold his fabulous and eclectic gathering of things
automotive: classic cars, souped-up cars, muscle cars, sports cars,
old race cars, motorcycles, petrobilia, automobilia, toys, posters,
badges.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a public place. Here one finds the private side of the
public man. When he is not on the set of the ``Tonight'' show, or
doing a standup routine in Las Vegas, this is where he likes to
hang out. He comes here almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go out to eat. I don't go out to clubs,'' says Leno,
dressed in his perpetual private-time outfit of denim shirt and
jeans. ``This is what I like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   David Brownell, former editor of Hemmings Motor News magazine,
the bible for auto fanatics, says Leno is doing what he likes quite
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay's got some of the best examples of desirable cars and
motorcycles in the country,'' says Brownell, and they range from
classically restored or preserved to mechanically unique.
</P>
<P>
   Leno walks to a 1934 Rolls-Royce Phantom II, its chassis fitted
with a wood-and-metal body that looks like a giant open cockpit
racer. It is powered by a 27-liter Merlin aircraft engine that
cranks out 1,000 horsepower. It is a car, he says, that ``starts to
walk around on you'' once you get it up over 120 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez, that's fast,'' he says of the car. It will not be the
last time he uses the phrase in a tour of his immaculate garages.
</P>
<P>
   This is where he comes to dwell in a quiet place, paradoxically
finding relaxation amid the thundering and thumping engines and the
metal-on-metal cacophony of a garage.
</P>
<P>
   He comes to tinker and tune, to talk technology with some of the
specialists with whom he has surrounded himself to help maintain
and preserve rare cars, and to relive childhood fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all the cars I used to read about when I was a
kid,'' he says, acknowledging that he never dreamed he would
someday be able to own them. But through talent, hard work, and
good fortune, they are his.
</P>
<P>
   They are the tangible dreams of a boy who grew up in Andover and
who once worked prepping new autos at Foreign Motors on
Commonwealth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   He's owned cars and motorcycles since his teens when, he says,
he worked at a McDonald's and at the garage while other kids played
sports. He sometimes owned several vehicles at a time, even then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had the stuff,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he has much more stuff. But he doesn't call what his
garages house a collection. He will not call himself a collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of pick them up here and there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And don't ask him how many cars and motorcycles he has, or what
they are worth. Because this is not about numbers to Leno.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be, people would come up to you and ask, `What is
it?' '' when you had a special car, Leno complains. ``Now they ask,
`How much is it worth?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Leno's penchant for autos is well known, particularly in the
world of aficionados. Some people, he says, have tried to use his
name, implying that he was interested in what they were selling, to
drive up their prices to other buyers. He has heard reports of Leno
sightings at auctions, hat pulled down, jacket collar rolled up, as
he quietly bid up the prices.
</P>
<P>
   But he buys mostly through clubs and collectors, he says. He is
not out to drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   To Leno, cars are about fun and function: everything he owns, he
drives. Or they can be about pedigree, as in a Stutz racer with a
proven track record, or about mechanical challenge, such as fitting
a V-12 Jaguar engine into an XKE that originally had a V-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all interests me,'' he says. ``I like stuff that's
technologically interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   He walks to the side of a 1925 Brough Superior motorcycle that
had been raced on the Isle of Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were the Vincent Black Shadows before there were Vincent
Black Shadows,'' he says, referring to the legendary British
motorcycle of the 1950s that came with instructions to shift into
high gear at 110 miles per hour. He's got several Broughs, a whole
parcel of Vincents _ including an ugly and rare shrouded Vincent
Black Knight _ and other motorcycles: Harley-Davidson, Triumph,
Ducati, Agusta, and Henderson among them.
</P>
<P>
   The car collection is impressively eclectic: Bugati, Duesenberg,
Stutz, Jaguar, Bentley, Stanley, Baker Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Perched among the Duesenbergs is an aerodynamic Duesenberg
coupe, its flowing lines in sharp contrast to the solid,
rectangular look of most of its mates. In the old days, when you
bought a Duesenberg, you bought a ready-to-roll chassis. You went
to a coachmaker for the body. The scion of the Eli Lilly drug
empire had this aerodynamic coupe constructed; it is a huge
automobile, though it only seats two people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing it was good for was running over poor people,''
Leno laughs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 1924 Bentley whose 3-liter engine has been replaced
with an 8-liter. It has had twin turbochargers added and is now a
500-horsepower charger, faster than Leno's Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going that fast in something 80 years old,'' he says in
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   There's a 1957 Buick Roadmaster, a 1955 Packard Caribbean
looking like a Creamsicle, and a 1966 Dodge Coronet with a 426 Hemi
engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't stop, it doesn't corner,'' he says of the Dodge,
and you need not finish the next sentence for him: ``But, geez,
it's fast.''
</P>
<P>
   His ``offices'' at the garages are more like playrooms: couches,
chairs, pictures, posters, collectibles, and toys everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He stops to show off a toy. It is a re-creation of a drag-strip
staging area. A Plymouth Barracuda sits at the light. Leno flips a
switch. An announcer introduces the car and driver and the crowd
cheers. Suddenly, the body of the Barracuda rises, revealing the
driver and the engine, which spits what looks like flames from its
exhausts. The body lowers, the staging lights run through to green,
the engine roars, and the 'Cuda rises in a wheelie.
</P>
<P>
   Leno cackles, seemingly as happy with this toy as he is with
each car, each motorcycle, in his garages.
</P>
<P>
   Back out on the garage floor _ a Vegas appearance is coming up
in hours _ he looks around a final time during this tour of his
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like Mia Farrow,'' he says of the actress who has adopted
many children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I like. I like saving cars.''

CARS THAT WERE STARS START WITH A '67 MUSTANG 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The premiere-night party was in full swing as I
stepped off the escalator and spotted her far across the room.
Sheathed in tight silver that clung to every curve, she dominated a
room full of movie stars. Nice set of headlights, great bumpers.
Overhead lights danced off her body with every turn she made.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage was there. So were Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall,
Jon Voight, Billy Bob Thornton, and many, many older men of
Hollywood who had kindly brought their nieces with them to the
premiere and later, this party, for the new movie ``Gone in 60
Seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   I only had eyes for Eleanor _ a customized 1967 Ford Mustang
GT500 KR _ the choicest of the 50 prime cars that Cage, Jolie,
Duvall, and cohorts are forced by bad guys to steal in this remake
of a 1970s cult film. I approached Eleanor, watched her spin on the
giant turntable, and wondered: Will she go down with the great cars
we've seen in the movies and on television? Will she assume a place
at the top of my list of favorites?
</P>
<P>
   Would she make your list?
</P>
<P>
   Here's mine as I pick through a genre that includes trashy
television such as ``Charlie's Angels'' and ``The Dukes of
Hazard,'' B movies including ``Hot Rod Gang,'' ``Teenage Thunder,''
and ``Chopper Chicks in Zombie Town,'' and some better film fare
and cult classics such as ``Vanishing Point'' and ``Two Lane
Blacktop.''
</P>
<P>
   --The yellow, 1932 Ford 5-window coupe hot rod that Paul Le Matt
drove in ``American Graffiti.'' Classic street-rod looks though
built as a film car. Also loved Harrison Ford's 1955 two-door
Chevrolet. Quiz: Where was this car seen in an earlier movie?
Answer below.
</P>
<P>
   --Steve McQueen's 1968 Mustang GT 390 from the great chase scene
in ``Bullit.''
</P>
<P>
   --And speaking of Mustangs, how about Robert Urich's black 1966
Ford Mustang fastback from the television series ``Spenser for
Hire''?
</P>
<P>
   --And dreadful though the show was, I still remember the Mustang
II Cobra that Charlie's Angels tooled around in.
</P>
<P>
   --``Vanishing Point'' featured what is certainly one of my
favorite film cars, Kowalski's 1970 Challenger R/T Hemi. I have
read that if you watch closely at the end, the filmmakers
substitute a Chevrolet for the Challenger just before it hits the
bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   --``Starsky and Hutch''? That was a 1976 Ford Grand Torino with
a 460 V-8 in which the blow-dried pair pursued the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   --They had beer, cigarettes, a full tank of gas; it was dark out
and they were wearing sunglasses. So Jake and Elwood Blues _ Dan
Akyroyd and John Belushi _ hit the road in their 1974 Dodge Monaco
440. But not to worry. It was a cop car.
</P>
<P>
   --I have to include it because it may be the most famous movie
car ever built _ George Barris's Batmobile. Barris took a 1955
Lincoln Futura _ built in Italy by Ghia to Lincoln-Mercury design _
and turned it into the Batmobile in 1966. Before that, as the
Futura, it had been seen in the movie ``It Started With a Kiss,''
starring Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   --I leave out the ``Back to the Future'' DeLorean because that's
a car that never should have been built in the first place, much
less used as an example of where the automotive future might take
us.
</P>
<P>
   --Remember Mel Gibson's ``Mad Max'' movies? I include his 1973
Australian-built Ford Falcon XB Coupe for the impact it had on
future movies. I'd like a dollar for every movie that followed in
which filmmakers took old cars, sprayed them flat black or primer
gray, and crashed them around in some desert. An entire genre was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Others of note?
</P>
<P>
   The 1969 Charger R/T 440 of ``Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry'';
Banacek's Barris-custom AMC AMX; the more than 100 1969 Dodge
Chargers that were reportedly wrecked in the making of ``The Dukes
of Hazard'' television series; Nash Bridges's 1971 Hemi Barracuda;
the modified 1968 Oldsmobile Toronado that Mannix drove; the 1958
Plymouth Fury, malevolent and furious, from the Stephen King movie
``Christine''; the AMC Pacer from ``Wayne's World,'' so perfect as
Queen blasts from its sound system.
</P>
<P>
   The quiz answer?
</P>
<P>
   On an ``American Graffiti'' Web site _
kathyschrock.net/graffiti/ _ it is reported that the 1955 Chevrolet
driven by Harrison Ford was a composite of two earlier 55s used in
the movie ``Two Lane Blacktop,' which featured James Taylor and
Dennis Wilson roaming America and eventually racing for titles with
Warren Oates in a 1970 GTO.
</P>
<P>
   Add those to my list, too. But on this night, Eleanor stole my
heart _ both Eleanors. I say both, because as I left the party, her
silver image still dancing in my mind, I came across another
Eleanor, the 1973 Mustang Mach I from the original ``Gone in 60
Seconds'' from 1974.
</P>
<P>
   This Eleanor looked forlorn _ battered at the edges, paint job
sloppy and touched up, hanging on like an aging starlet. Hollywood
can use you that way.

JAGUAR XKR HAS CATS WORKING UNDER THE HOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a pair of hood louvers and a mesh grille can
make.
</P>
<P>
   They distinguish the Jaguar XKR from the XK8. But that's really
just eye candy. Add a supercharger, give the rear deck an
insouciant little flip, let it crouch on Z-rated Pirelli tires
mounted on 18-inch wheels, and you've got a much quicker Cat.
</P>
<P>
   Opt for the convertible and you've got a drop-top that will run
with many Porsches and is more fun than any open-air Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   All this and a classic front end that holds the lines and
lineage of the XK series of Jags from the 120 on down. If its lines
are lacking at all, it is only that the flip at the tail could have
been even a bit more insolent, and a flexing bulge to the rear
fenders would have made the crouch look even more intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the XKR swathes you in leather from seats to wheel. The
seats are stiff everywhere your body touches them _ stiff in a
good, supportive way, right up to the high headrests. The front
buckets are adjustable in myriad ways and front legroom is
plentiful. The rear seat, meant for two, is really not suitable on
long trips for adults or even large children. It sits too low and
legroom is cramped at best. Great place for groceries or luggage
when two are on board, however.
</P>
<P>
   The ergonomics are simple with stems on the steering column
controlling wipers and lights and gauges behind the wheel grouped
tightly and easy to read while driving. Controls at center dash _
for audio and climate _ are a bit too small and can be distracting
to use while rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The optional ($2,400) navigation system was a bit disappointing
in that it seemed to lack many of the secondary roads that have
already been added to other systems _ I'm thinking Mercedes, Acura,
and Lincoln, specifically. The generations of navigation systems
are coming and going in rapid succession and it behooves makers of
luxury cars to keep up with the most complex.
</P>
<P>
   Storage is limited _ particularly if the rear seats are
occupied. Bins in the doors are small and the center console bin is
quite shallow. The trunk has moderate space, but two on a trip
using the rear seat and trunk for luggage would be in fine shape.
</P>
<P>
   The view from the driver's seat is classic Jag _ all nose.
</P>
<P>
   So point the nose and go.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, you think Porsche, you think 'Vette.
</P>
<P>
   That's as in silky like a Porsche, muscular like a Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike a Porsche, which seems to lower itself to the ground
as you feed its horses, the Jag lifts its nose as it surges
forward. And unlike the 'Vette, it does not push you back in your
seat so much as pin you down and into it.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the surge that sends two tons of convertible (about 300
pounds more than the coupe version) hurtling down the road is a
370-horsepower, supercharged, 4.0-liter V8. Feeding on almost 400
lb.-ft. of torque, it cranks 0-60 in just over 5 seconds. I did not
get the convertible onto an abandoned airport runway, as I did the
coupe, but that car went from 80-100 miles per hour in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   For all its power, it managed to deliver 16 miles per gallon _
about one m.p.g. less than the coupe, maybe owing to the extra and
the aerodynamic drag of the ragtop.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of the convertible top: Its fit, from the inside,
looked amazingly tight. One passenger thought he was in a hardtop,
the fit appeared so seamless. Yet on the road, there was a fairly
constant, low-level wind sound and I could not figure its source.
That is, until I took the Jag through a brushless carwash. At the
upper front corners of both the driver and passenger side windows,
water came flowing in. It makes sense that if water can find its
way through whatever gaps lurked there, so could wind.
</P>
<P>
   But back to driving performance. To handle the XKR's quickness
and speed, the underpinnings best be good. Start with 18-inch
wheels _ they look positively dominant on this low-slung car. Add
those Pirellis and they handle that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   They held on long, carved turns like the rig was on rails. On
snaps through corners they seemed to dig in. In the coupe, I
noticed a slight weight shift to the rear in the tightest of
corners. It was slightly more pronounced in the convertible, which
by nature of being topless is bound to flex a bit more, but even
with the soft top, this is a highly responsive car.
</P>
<P>
   It fights body roll, yaw, squat and dive with _ cute in a Jag,
CATS _ its Computer Active Technology System. CATS monitors speed,
steering wheel position, and brakes and adjusts the stiffness of
the shocks to compensate. Feed CATS with stiff springs, stiff
antiroll bars, traction control, and you've got a scampering,

   If I have one major criticism of this car, it's the shifter. The
automatic mode seemed to shift up when it should (though sometimes
earlier than I would like), while the manual option really isn't
that at all (as in a Porsche, for instance) as it seems to hold
back on your decisions, trying to make up its own mind despite what
you may have decided.

CHINA AND U.S. RECOGNIZE IMPROVED RELATIONS DURING ALBRIGHT VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ More than a year after the NATO bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, the United States and China officially
declared Thursday, during a visit by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, that the interlude of bitterness had given way to
improved relations.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, both sides said that the firmer footing of the
relationship, based on the recent passage in the House of
Representatives of a broad trade agreement with China, was now
focused on the sensitive issue of Taiwan and the Clinton
administration's plans for an anti-missile defensive shield.
</P>
<P>
   On human rights, an area on which Washington and Beijing remain
far apart, an official traveling with Albright said the Chinese
leadership had remained ``noncommittal'' on a request to restart an
official dialogue on human rights that was broken off more than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who is on a visit of less than 36 hours to China _
probably her last as secretary of state _ said at a news conference
that she had encouraged the Chinese leadership to resume a dialogue
with Taiwan. It did not matter, she said, whether it began at a
fairly low level or with a summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our major goal is that there be a resumption in the
cross-strait dialogue,'' Albright said. ``More will be gained
through flexibility and appeals to shared interest than could
possibly be achieved through efforts to intimidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese leaders whom she met, including the prime
minister, Zhu Rongji, and the president, Jiang Zemin, deflected her
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry said at its weekly news briefing Thursday
that relations between China and the United States had ``greatly
improved'' because of efforts by both sides. But the foreign
ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, focused most of his comments on
Taiwan and said that Washington must stop its plans to include
Taiwan in the theater missile defense system ``in any capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, in the wake of the successful summit meeting
between the two Koreas, the new president of Taiwan, Chen
Shui-bian, invited Beijing to participate in a summit meeting. But
the Chinese foreign ministry swiftly turned away the idea, saying
that Taiwan had to first agree to the ``one China'' policy that
describes Taiwan and mainland China as one country.
</P>
<P>
   Differences between Washington and Beijing over the future of
Taiwan will persist as long as Washington continues to support a
theater missile defense system for Taiwan, said a senior Chinese
foreign policy analyst, Chu Shulong, in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater missile defense is a total national security issue for
China, and China wants a clear commitment from Washington not to
provide theater missile defense to Taiwan,'' said Chu, a senior
research fellow at the China Institute of Contemporary
International Relations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Beijing was particularly alarmed by the proposed defense system
because it would result in what Chu called the ``integration'' of
U.S. and Taiwanese armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Chu said that the proposed defense system for Taiwan would
continue to roil Chinese-U.S. relations because, for domestic
political reasons, Washington would not be able to give the
assurances of non-deployment that the Chinese were seeking. The
Chinese are particularly upset about theater missile defense
because it would give the United States the ability to detect and
destroy Chinese missiles as they were launched.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Albright arrived at her meetings Thursday expecting a full dose
of criticism about the Clinton administration's plans for a
national missile defensive shield, but Chinese officials did not
dwell on that issue, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Albright's goals was to learn how the Chinese had
interpreted the meeting between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong
Il, and Kim Dae-jung of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   China and the United States share common ground in their
interest in seeing reconciliation between the two Koreas, and
administration officials have gone out of their way to note
Beijing's help in encouraging North Korea to be more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright's aides said considerable time was spent
discussing Korea, Albright offered few new details Thursday on the
Korean summit meeting. The Chinese, she said, described Kim Jong Il
as ``jovial,'' ``forthcoming'' and ``knowledgeable,'' all familiar
adjectives from the past week. An aide to Albright said Thursday
night that Jiang had noted the North Korean leader's wit and said
that he was ``very polite.''
</P>
<P>
   A continual irritant in Washington's relationship with Beijing,
China's transfer of missiles and missile parts to Pakistan and
other countries, was discussed, but no progress was made, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright gave the Chinese qualified praise for ``the overall
record'' of ``becoming part of various arms control regimes,''
including the Chemical Weapons Treaty and the Non-Proliferation
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be encouragement to get the Chinese to improve
their export controls on nuclear-related materials. The
administration is facing intense criticism from Congress for being
too lax toward the Chinese on such matters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two senior non-proliferation officials, including the assistant
secretary of state for non-proliferation, Robert Einhorn, visited
Beijing last week in an attempt to resolve a problem involving
China's transfer of M-11 ballistic missiles to Pakistan nearly a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the Central Intelligence Agency to Congress last
year stated that Pakistan had acquired the missiles from China, the
first time that the United States has publicly acknowledged that
China sent the weapons to Pakistan. Under U.S. law, such a transfer
by China requires the administration to impose economic sanctions,
including on space systems, a move that the White House would like
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official traveling with Albright said
Thursday night that the problem of the transfer of weapons to
Pakistan had not been resolved. The State Department's senior
adviser on arms control, John Holum, will visit Beijing next month
to pursue a solution, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The national security adviser, Sandy Berger, has said that the
administration would like China to become a full member of the
Missile Technology Control Regime, the main global missile
non-proliferation pact, but that China has consistently resisted,
arguing that Washington should first stop selling advanced weapons
to Taiwan.

THE COLOR OF MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
  The faces are more varied, but green is still the most important
shade 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You may have noticed something different about the movies you've
seen in these first six months of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   They look like America.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever before, films are reflecting the multiracial
character of this society. From both Hollywood and the independent
sector, picture after picture acknowledges that this is a nation of
African, Asian, Latino, Native and European folks who are all in it
together.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the movies employ race as a key subject, such as the
Jackie Chan western ``Shanghai Noon,'' the spring's hip-hop/kung fu
crime thriller ``Romeo Must Die,'' the examination of white kids
and gangsta culture in ``Black and White'' and even ``Me, Myself &AMP;
Irene,'' the goofy comedy in which Jim Carrey raises three
African-American sons. Others never so much as mention the
multicolored nature of their casts; ``Mission: Impossible 2,''
``Rules of Engagement,'' ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' ``Groove'' and
Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare update ``Love's Labours Lost'' fit in
that category.
</P>
<P>
   But what all of these films share with many more 2000 releases
(``Shaft,'' ``Catfish in Black Bean Sauce,'' ``Ghost Dog: The Way
of the Samurai,'' ``Luminarias'' and upcoming films ranging from
the spoof ``Scary Movie'' to the more serious likes of ``The
Patriot,'' ``Girlfight,'' ``Nurse Betty,'' ``What's Cooking'' and
``Remember the Titans,'' among others) is a perception that the
racial barriers that have historically undermined the egalitarian
American dream are crumbling fast.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not fast enough, both in society at large and in the
movies that reflect it. But, with notable reservations, talent,
businesspeople and observers of the film scene see the current
trend as a positive one, especially for an artform that, from its
beginnings until very recently, wallowed in segregation when it
wasn't actively practicing exclusion and stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I would say that this is something that is mostly
happening organically, it's something that we're certainly
conscious of and have spoken about,'' says Buena Vista Motion
Picture Group President Nina Jacobson, whose various Disney labels
has or will distribute ``Shanghai,'' ``60 Seconds'' and ``Titans''
this year. ``Our movies have, in the past, certainly been whiter
than the world we live in. And although we feel that it's our
responsibility that any time you cast a movie to cast the best
person for the part, we are aware of the fact that our movies ought
to reflect our world.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, altruism in studio executive suites is about as
common as domestic cars in their assigned parking spaces; present,
perhaps, but not prevalent. And movie-money people freely admit
there's a strong commercial incentive for multiracial casting.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a marketing point of view, you're trying to involve all
groups,'' notes entertainment industry analyst Art Rockwell of
Burbank-based Rockwell Capital. ``There's something of a parallel
to be drawn with the music business today, the great Latin music
explosion and the intermingling of races in rap groups. Much of
this movement is catering to the widest possible audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Paramount Motion Picture Group Vice-Chairman Robert
Friedman, whose studio made ``M:I-2,'' ``Shaft,'' ``Rules'' and the
upcoming ``Bless the Child'' with Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smits and
``Along Came a Spider'' with Morgan Freeman and Monica Potter,
``It's a combination of both trying to do the right thing and
knowing that the non-Caucasian moviegoing population represents
about 30 percent of the business. So, obviously, there's real value
there from just a purely commercial sense.'' When we get properties
that are creatively exciting to us and, by the way, also are
multicultural, then we see it as an opportunity and it's something
we like to try to do.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial considerations have driven studio thinking on race
since, at least, the huge commercial success of D.W. Griffith's
virulently racist, ``Birth of a Nation'' in 1915. For decades
following, African-Americans were overwhelmingly represented in a
negative light, American Indians were westerns' designated bad
guys, Charlie Chan was played by white actors wearing heavy makeup
and the breakthrough ethnic leading ladies such as Dolores Del Rio
and Anna May Wong were constantly typecast as fetishized exotics.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s and '60s, things were changing, often in token but
fundamentally well-meaning terms (check the Sidney Poitier ouvrage)
_ although the sensibilities of white audiences in the
still-segregated South remained a constant concern for
distributors. Black/white buddy comedies blossomed in the late '70s
and early '80s, but their energy was based more on contrast than
inclusion. A serious African-American cinema was finally
established by the 1990s, while substantially smaller Asian and
Latino equivalents are still striving to sustain footholds.
</P>
<P>
   Now multiracial pictures are the latest step on this path of
cultural evolution. And in keeping with the movies' past
performance, there is some inevitable stumbling on the way toward
the admirable goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about including everyone under the color spectrum
in film and television, it sounds really good,'' National Hispanic
Media Coalition Chairman Alex Nogales points out. ``But when it
comes into practice, we're taken for granted, somehow expected to
respond to non-Latino films and characters. It's very
disheartening, but we intend to keep addressing this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Berry, western regional director of the NAACP, whose
organization was at the forefront of last year's effort to make
network television more inclusive, also sees a long road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may represent more inclusion, but there's a long way to go
in terms of proper portrayal,'' he observes. ``The problem is all
the crime stories, all the gang activities, all the hip-hop, when
there's a much broader spectrum of the African-American community.
They'll even go abroad to get someone who comes from a different
culture to, it seems, avoid a proper portrayal of our culture
coming forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry is referring to English-African actress Thandie Newton's
romantic lead opposite Tom Cruise in ``M:I-2''; a film, by the way,
which was directed by Hong Kong transplant John Woo. He's a prime
example of the recent upsurge of Asian talent in American cinema.
But that development, too, leaves much to be developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive thing is that they are using Asians as, at least,
the co-stars of films, like Jet Li in 'Romeo Must Die' and Jackie
Chan in 'Shanghai Noon,''' acknowledges Guy Aoki, president of the
Media Action Network for Asian Americans, an industry watchdog
group. ``The bad side of that is that they're all from Asia, and
they're usually action stars or martial artists.'' From our point
of view, that's a bit frustrating because we feel there is so much
Asian-American talent here that is not made use of; not given the
chance. It's a good thing overall, but it's still a long ways away
from where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best progress, as is often the case, is being made
by independent filmmakers. Chi Muoi Lo wrote, produced, directed
and co-starred in ``Catfish in Black Bean Sauce,'' a film inspired
by his experiences as a Vietnamese refugee growing up in an
African-American neighborhood of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Lo feels that a new generation's attitudes are bound to overcome
old prejudices and stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race is not the first thing that we see,'' he says of today's
youth. ``And when it is, we've gone by that in, like, a minute, and
start judging a person by their character. In my world, I have all
different multicultures around me, and I find it very comforting.
And now you're dealing with a new group of directors and writers
who come from that same perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Puerto Rican-born director Miguel Arteta, whose
well- reviewed, upcoming indie feature ``Chuck &AMP; Buck'' has no
intrinsic ethnic angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's very important, as a minority filmmaker, to
burst through the burden of representation into an area where
you're simply telling stories that matter and you're trying to make
the best movies that you can,'' Arteta says. ``Latinos will
hopefully fit into those equations.''
</P>
<P>
   And in ``Chuck &AMP; Buck,'' one has. Veteran actress Lupe Ontiveros
plays a key role in the film as a novice stage director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lupe is one of the great Latino talents that has, kind of, yet
to be discovered by mainstream Hollywood, yet she's been in
Hollywood for 30 years,'' Arteta notes. ``And although she's done a
few important roles _ she was the woman who killed Selena in that
film _ mostly, she's been asked to play maids, more than 300 in
television and films. That's really sad to look at in such a great
talent like her.''
</P>
<P>
   And while exposure is one thing, the movie business on both the
indie and corporate levels remains primarily a money-driven
enterprise. Not surprisingly, minority talent views the pay scale
as the next equality hurdle to jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line: Green is the only color that really matters in
this day and age,'' observes the rising African-American star
Anthony Anderson, who has already appeared in ``Romeo,'' ``Irene''
and ``Big Momma's House'' this year. ``Whoever they need to put on
the screen, be it white, black, yellow or brown, they'll put them
up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I honestly can't complain, but here I am, barely getting
paid beyond scale, and I've worked with the Barry Levinsons and the
Ron Howards and the Jim Carreys and the Farrelly brothers. All I
ask is for fair market value for my talent, but that aspect of the
business is not as equal as things may be looking on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the inequities that still need to be overcome,
the American film industry appears to be committed to making movies
for, and with, all Americans _ which, at its best, could be the
most hopeful reflection of society yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just like we should do it because, oh, it's p.c.,''
Buena Vista's Jacobson affirms. ``We're a movie studio, we want as
many people as possible to see our movies, and they ought to
reflect the audiences we're trying to appeal to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that we believe in,'' Paramount's Friedman
concludes. ``I don't know how to say it any better than that.''

MINGHELLA MET THE CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who had read Michael Ondaatje's ``The English Patient''
must have been amazed when they heard it was being turned into a
movie. The poetic novel has an unconventional, complicated
narrative that moves seamlessly between memory and the present.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anyone who doubted it could be done was proved wrong
_ at least on some critical and commercial levels. The 1996 film
won the Oscar for best picture and did profitable business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The English Patient's'' director-screenwriter, Anthony
Minghella, then took up another challenge: adapting Patricia
Highsmith's ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' which comes out on video
next Tuesday. While Highsmith's 1952 thriller has a more
conventional narrative, its protagonist, Tom Ripley, is a
psychopathic chameleon _ hardly an attractive character, even if
you do cast glamour boy Matt Damon to play him.
</P>
<P>
   The question here isn't whether Minghella has done a good
adaption, but rather has he created a film that stands on its own?
``Ripley'' does do that, even better than ``The English Patient,''
though it didn't fare as well at the Oscars. (There's an irony in
that.) Billed as a lush romance (though it wasn't much of that),
much of ``Patient'' is too detached and postcard pretty, deadening
its themes of passion and regret.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ripley,'' Minghella has given us another sumptuous picture
to look at, but under its cool '50s, jazzy surfaces is a deadly
vibrancy _ literally _ that gives the film its life. Highsmith
described her novel as being about ``two young men with a certain
resemblance _ not much _ one of whom kills the other and assumes
his identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripley is an orphan in his mid-20s with a gift for mimicry.
Mistaken for a Princeton grad, he is hired by a rich businessman to
go to an Italian resort village to persuade the man's son, Dickie
Greenleaf (Jude Law), to return home. Ripley's masquerade allows
him into Greenleaf's rather decadent but dazzling world, which
includes Dickie's girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow). At first
Ripley is happy to just be part of it, but soon becomes aware of
how tenuous is his hold.
</P>
<P>
   Envy and fear of discovery turn to something more sinister. As
the story develops, Minghella skillfully plays with questions of
morality and consequences for one's actions. And while Ripley lacks
a conscience, there is almost a sadness about him, as if he
recognizes a dim light of conscience but is unable to turn toward
it. Damon captures this duality brilliantly. Pasty white compared
to the bronzed Law, he's like a stray dog whose cute and harmless
look makes you forget he has teeth.
</P>
<P>
   What Minghella has fashioned is a rich and intelligent thriller
in ``Ripley''; the film's complexities merit repeated viewing. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
Give me 'Liberty': In ``Liberty Heights,'' which is already in
video stores, director Barry Levinson (``Rainman'') returns to his
hometown of Baltimore for the fourth time. ``Heights'' joins
``Diner,'' ``Tin Men'' and ``Avalon'' as affectionate, smart,
entertaining films that also explore the social changes that shaped
in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Like his other Baltimore films, Levinson keeps a number of
storylines going in ``Heights,'' but the film centers on a
teen-ager named Ben (Ben Foster) who learns after living a
sheltered life that most of the world is not Jewish. The time is
the mid-'50s, when school integration was first mandated. In high
school, Ben is an outsider, returning at night to his Jewish
community. Eventually, Ben becomes friends with another outsider,
Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), one of the token African-Americans at his
school. A delicate relationship develops, and Levinson, who has a
wonderful touch with such things, never overplays his hand in this
charming, heartfelt film. &QL; 
--- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' (Paramount) is priced for rental on
VHS; sale price is $103.99. The DVD is $29.99 and includes
commentary from Minghella and interviews with the cast and crew.
``Liberty Heights'' (Warners) is priced at $106.99 on VHS. The DVD
is $24.98 and includes interviews with and commentary by the cast
and Levinson. &QL;

PASSION FUELS `DON QUIXOTE'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
 
 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing like the blood and thunder of Spanish folk dance
to take the chill out of classical ballet. Icy technical perfection
is fine as far as it goes. Crisply executed pirouettes can
mesmerize the soul.
</P>
<P>
   But the passionate gypsy and flamenco currents that pulsate
through the Bolshoi Ballet's new production of ``Don Quixote''
bring an earthiness and comic vigor to what might otherwise seem a
rather silly and superficial ballet, a parade of virtuosic set
pieces stitched together with the thinnest of plots.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, this relentlessly festive and athletic ``Don
Quixote'' offers a nonstop outpouring of baroque effusion. Sheer
unthinking pleasure is all that will be required of you as you
watch the Bolshoi's spectacular soloists, the astonishing Nina
Ananiashvili foremost among them.
</P>
<P>
   Making its first appearance at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in
more than a decade, the legendary Russian company is performing the
popular three-act ballet based on parts of Cervantes' episodic
novel about a deluded old knight, with Ludwig Minkus' somersaulting
score. The Bolshoi refers to the production as a ``new
choreographic version'' by Alexei Fadeechev, based on the enduring
designs of Marius Petipa and Aleksandr Gorsky.
</P>
<P>
   The new version builds momentum by skillfully balancing its
classical and gypsified elements. There's a colorful vernacular of
tambourine slapping, fan twirling and castanet clicking. Lines of
dashing toreadors flourish capes, while a woman minces !ital!en
pointe through a maze of upended knives. We get just enough
kinkiness to offset the elegant sensuality, just enough whirling
control to tame the mad, leaping score.
</P>
<P>
   Ananiashvili, beautiful and indefatigable, exemplifies both
tendencies as Kitri, the innkeeper's daughter whose love for the
barber Basil (Andrei Uvarov), against the wishes of her father,
arouses Don Quixote's chivalrous instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Though showing somewhat more poise than personality,
Ananiashvili is an engaging presence, conveying the pluck and
enthusiasm of a young girl. Her rapid-fire sequence of fouettes,
turns on one leg, brought the expected roars from the balcony, but
it was her spirit as well as her technique that won us over.
</P>
<P>
   Her elongated partner, Uvarov, with his scything, black-tighted
legs, demonstrated strength and grace in his solos and his
one-armed hoists of Ananiashvili. It should be interesting to see
what this pair does tonight with ``Romeo and Juliet,'' the other
half of the Bolshoi's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gaunt Andrei Sitnikov, gallantly mistaking Kitri for the beloved
Dulcinea of his medieval fantasies, makes the most of the mimed
title role. His eyes locked in a dreamy gaze, he wanders through
Barcelona squares, moonlit taverns, a windmill-lined gypsy
encampment and a fairy-haunted forest, all beautifully designed by
Sergei Barkhin. Playing his faithful servant Sancho Panza,
Alexander Petukhov has a charming Chaplin-esque comic grace: he
beams with delight at his master's triumphs and his legs always
seem to be two steps behind his chubby trunk.
</P>
<P>
   By its third act, ``Don Quixote'' pretty much drops any
pretensions of storytelling in favor of one stunning duo or solo
after another: a Spanish dance, a gypsy dance, a bolero. It takes
something special for a company to try such a sequence, let alone
pull it off with such aplomb. We could all do with more of that
reckless kind of idealism. &QL;

&HT;     SAUSAGE MAKER SUSPECTED IN DEATHS OF THREE FOOD INSPECTORS 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     By DEMIAN BULWA,

<P>
   SAN LEANDRO, Calif. _ A sausage maker accused of killing three
food inspectors at his downtown factory had grown furious with the
government's scrutiny in recent months and may have snapped,
according to people who know him.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Charles Alexander, 39, was in custody Thursday in
connection with the shootings of two U.S. Department of Agriculture
inspectors and an investigator from the California Department of
Food and Agriculture who were at his Santos Linguisa Factory to
document conditions Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Waving and firing his handgun, Alexander then chased another
state food inspectors out of the small factory, the police said,
before stopping and surrendering to a bicycle officer a half-block
away in this community south of Oakland. The fourth inspector was
unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were described only as two men and a woman, ages 30
to 50, who were shot many times at about 3:30 p.m. One was carrying
a camera to take pictures of conditions at the factory, said San
Leandro police Lt. Dan Marchetti.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander had shut his factory in January after the USDA ordered
him to raise cooking temperatures to acceptable levels, according
to a February report in the San Leandro Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Food inspectors visited frequently in subsequent months, with
Alexander's shop closing and reopening several times.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who has a history of legal and financial woes, and
ran for mayor in 1998, called for public donations to aid his
fight. He posted a sign that read: ``To all our great customers,
the USDA is coming into our plant harassing my employees and me,
making it impossible to make our great product.'' The sign was
still up on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inspectors were on him, and he was getting nasty and they
were getting nasty,'' said Mike Smith, 71, of San Leandro, who
described himself as a father-figure to Alexander and one of his
closest friends. ``They kept pushing, pushing, pushing. It was too
much pressure. I told Stuart, `You better cool it, buddy.' He was a
good guy, but people snap.``
</P>
<P>
   San Leandro police detectives and FBI agents swarmed the
one-story sausage factory, which sits among a row of houses and is
connected to a bar. The FBI was involved because federal employees
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting stunned residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shocker. I came out here after I heard it on the news
just to see if it's really possible,'' said David Teles, 43, who
used to live just a block from the factory and was one of many
people to claim that Alexander's sausage was some of the best
around.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis issued a statement late Wednesday, mourning the
deaths and calling the shooting ``an unspeakably barbarous act.''
He ordered that flags be flown at half staff at state buildings to
commemorate the state food inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Officers arrived at the factory after the police received
numerous reports of gunshots. Bicycle patrolman Rick Cahall found
Alexander standing on the sidewalk unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After Alexander was arrested, officers broke through a window of
the factory because all the doors were locked. They found the
victims' bodies in the front of the store, where customers would
pay for and pick up sausages at a counter, Marchetti said. At least
three handguns were also found inside, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was booked on suspicion of three counts of murder and
one count of attempted murder, Marchetti said.
</P>
<P>
   San Leandro Detective Sgt. Chris Lux said a female employee, one
of about 10 at the factory, was in the store when the shooting
happened. They planned to interview her and another potential
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Lux said this was not the first time the government agents had
dropped by Alexander's store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were out here (Wednesday) on an inspection for hygienic
problems at the plant. That's been going on for a while, since
about January,'' Lux said. ``The (business) has been open, closed,
open, closed. He would lose his permit, and then correct the
problems, and then get the permit back again.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In California's ``sausage capital'' _ San Leandro has at least
eight sausage companies _ many people seemed to know the story of
the third-generation linguisa procurer.
</P>
<P>
   During his mayoral campaign two years ago, Alexander frequently
parked a truck full of live pigs outside his factory, a memory
recalled with both humor and anguish after Wednesday's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were huge pinkish pigs just sitting in the truck,'' said
City Councilman Gordon Galvan, who dealt with the complaints. ``We
had lots of complaints like that. Stuart is not the type of guy who
would just say, `Sorry. It won't happen again.' He defended his
turf. That's the way he is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander grew up in San Leandro and inherited his meat business
from his father, Herman ``Tweety'' Alexander, who had run it for
more than 40 years. It was founded in 1921 by Stuart Alexander's
grandfather.

&HT;     CALIFORNIA'S HIGH COURT TAKES NIKE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The California Supreme Court has agreed to
decide whether a San Francisco activist can sue Nike Inc. for
allegedly lying about conditions in its Asian factories.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit by Marc Kasky was dismissed by a lower court on
free-speech grounds. But the state's high court voted to take up
Kasky's appeal and decide whether his claims, if proved, would show
that the world's largest athletic shoe maker violated a broad
California law against unfair business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Ronald George and Justices Stanley Mosk, Joyce
Kennard, Kathryn Mickle Werdegar and Janice Rogers Brown voted
Wednesday to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   The suit attacks Nike's statements to the public and its
stockholders about its treatment of hundreds of thousands of
workers, mostly women, in Asian factories run by contractors that
make the company's shoes and other apparel.
</P>
<P>
   After reports in the news media and elsewhere that the women
were working for low pay in dangerous conditions, Nike commissioned
a study led by Andrew Young, the former U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, and declared its workers were well-treated. The
company said the factories complied with their home countries' laws
on pay and safety and that workers were provided health care, paid
an average of twice the local minimum wage and protected from
physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Kasky, represented by some of the same lawyers who successfully
challenged the Joe Camel cigarette advertising campaign, likened
Nike's statements to deceptive advertising and said they were
intended to lure customers by whitewashing factory conditions. He
sought to require the company to return illegally obtained profits
to customers and the state and conduct a corrective public
information campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge David Garcia dismissed the suit without a
trial and was upheld last March by the 1st District Court of
Appeal, which said Nike's statements were more like political
speech than commercial advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The company's campaign did not focus on any of its products, but
was intended to ``promote a favorable corporate image'' and
influence the public debate over global corporate practices, said
Justice Douglas Swager in the 3-0 ruling. He said the suit ``seeks
judicial intervention in a public debate'' that was
constitutionally shielded from government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Kasky's attorneys urged the state Supreme Court to intervene,
arguing that public relations campaigns could amount to false
advertising. Attorney Alan M. Caplan said reinstatement of the suit
would allow the lawyers to gather evidence from Nike and determine
the truth about factory conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Nike spokesman Vada Manager said the company considered Kasky's
suit ``a case without merit.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Can you just stay focused, sweetheart?'' Jonathan
Greenfield says tersely to his wife as they settle into a hotel
lobby in Danbury, Conn., near their home. ``It's so important for
you to listen to the question and not just open your guts.'' He
apologizes for his wife, whom he manages professionally. ``We
always have this discussion!''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Spector Greenfield is nervous and scattered, but if her
thoughts, in a froggy smoker's voice, scamper off in exultation,
why not?
</P>
<P>
   After all, a 13-year-old lawsuit over royalties from songs she
recorded when she was clambering out of her teens has just been
resolved in her favor.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that for such glorious '60s hits like ``Be My
Baby,'' ``Baby I Love You'' and ``Walking in the Rain,'' Ronnie and
the Ronettes, the shimmying bad girls once so famous that their
opening act was the Rolling Stones, received only a one-time check
of $14,482.30 from Phil Spector, Greenfield's former husband. Last
week, a New York state Supreme Court justice ruled that Spector,
who repackaged Ronettes' songs for oldies collections, commercials
and movies like ``Dirty Dancing,'' owed Greenfield and the
Ronettes, her sister and cousin, $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed it's over,'' says Greenfield, 56, who still wears
her luxuriant dark hair long, as she did as a teen-ager, her eyes
made up with liquid black liner, her much-imitated look. Even now,
a mother of two teen-agers, she has an irrepressible girlish
eagerness that is endearing and, despite her flinty ambition,
vulnerable. ``I can have my career back!''
</P>
<P>
   Getting her career back has pretty much been her goal since that
morning in 1972 when Ronnie Spector finally got her husband's
permission to take a sunlit stroll. She walked out of the gloomy,
guarded Beverly Hills mansion barefoot so as not to arouse his
suspicions and just kept going. Spector paid her divorce lawyers in
nickels and stamped her alimony checks with an expletive.
</P>
<P>
   As she wrote in her 1990 autobiography, ``Be My Baby'' (foreword
by Cher, another comeback queen who knows from Svengalis), the
brilliant Spector adored her voice and what she calls her ``Spanish
Harlem half-breedishness.'' Her mother, a hard-working waitress,
was black and American Indian, her father, a happy-go-lucky drinker
and unemployed drummer, was white.
</P>
<P>
   It all crested when the Fabulous Ronettes were touring England
and ``Be My Baby'' was a worldwide hit. She was 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I was waiting for all my life,'' she says with a
throaty laugh. ``I was in love with the man I adored and he even
flew over to England to see me. And Phil hates to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there was my audience! The applause! We had girls who
wanted to wear their hair like us, in beehives, the Chinese bangs,
the long braid! The kids would be screaming and tearing your
clothes off! I loved it! `Want my shirt? Here! Want a shoe?
Here!'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, after the Ronettes dissolved, the couple married. She
has often described her reclusive, gilded life. His gift of a
Camaro came with a mannequin in the passenger seat wearing
Spector's trademark cap, so it would always look as if he was
accompanying her. Opera, which she hates, resounded through their
home. He made her sit through screenings of ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That girl couldn't sing,'' Greenfield says, hurt shadowing her
face. ``Was Phil trying to tell me something?''
</P>
<P>
   Bored, isolated: ``I'd get drunk so I could go to rehab, just to
get out of the house.'' She adds brightly, ``I got to hear Carole
King's `Tapestry' in rehab!''
</P>
<P>
   After she left Spector, she asked the impresario Murray the K
for work. ``I'm only 29 but I'm an oldie but goodie? I just poured
vodka into my soda.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she was plucky and blessed with a much-admired
sin-'n'-innocence tremolo. Billy Joel wrote ``Say Goodbye to
Hollywood'' for her. She toured with oldies shows and Bruce
Springsteen's E Street Band. Last fall she released a five-song
collection, ``She Talks to Rainbows,'' whose co-producer was Joey
Ramone. She kept bobbing back up, even performing for President
Clinton (who greeted her, arms wide, singing, ``Be my little
baby!'').
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, at 36, she met Greenfield, 15 years her junior, who had
seen her show when he was a smoldering, smitten teen-ager. ``He
didn't pull on me right away like most guys,'' Greenfield says.
``So we were friends first. If I thought a date was trying to kiss
me before we went out to dinner, I'd call up Jonathan and say, `I
need you to fix something!' And he would get rid of the guy for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   When she credits Greenfield for the lawsuit, he erupts,
excoriating her low self-esteem, but ending with a pep talk. ``You
were the trailblazer 35 years ago and after you filed the lawsuit,
you wouldn't go away! That's what the Bad Girl is about!''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie, how have you changed?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm my own person,'' she replies. ``I was so controlled by
Phil and now I have my own ideas. With this lawsuit over, I'm only
looking forward; to my future, to singing rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's beautiful, sweetheart,'' her husband says.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, along with singers like Mary Chapin Carpenter and
Sheryl Crow, Greenfield appeared at a House subcommittee hearing on
a new copyright law. When she was introduced, she broke into
``Wuh-uh-uh-oh, be my, be my baby,'' startling her buttoned-up
audience. ``I just felt the urge,'' she explains. Afterward, she
was swarmed by autograph seekers. ``I saw Mary Bono and said: `Hi!
How are the kids?'''

TAP, TAP, TAPPING, ONCE AGAIN, ON ROCK FANS' SPINAL MANIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Set your amps to 11 and get that spandex out of mothballs _
Spinal Tap is back.
</P>
<P>
   The three original members _ David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel and
Derek Smalls, plus Fleetwood Mac's Mick Fleetwood on drums _
appeared live on VH1's ``The List'' on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the band to once again Tap into America also include a
new single, ``Back From the Dead,'' a live performance at Los
Angeles' House of Blues, a ``Where Are They Now?'' segment on VH1,
and the theater, video and DVD re-release of ``This Is Spinal
Tap,'' the 1984 documentary of their final, disastrous U.S. tour.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by what he said during an interview from his sheep farm
in Pomona, Calif., guitarist/vocalist David St. Hubbins couldn't be
happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philosophically, we'd like to set the record straight,'' says
St. Hubbins, who formed the group back in the '60s with Smalls and
Tufnel, achieved metal stardom in the '70s, and slid down the
popularity totem pole in the early '80s, the final stage of which
was documented on ``This Is Spinal Tap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie was a blatant hatchet job, and we don't know why,''
he says. ``Marty (DiBergi) was a ``fan of ours.'' He knew what
color the labels were on our early singles, things like that. It
was all skewed content and character assassination. We want to show
where the film made us look even more incompetent than we actually
were.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, you've either got the joke or not: St. Hubbins is
actually actor Michael McKean; Tufnel is Christopher Guest and
Smalls is Harry Shearer. They came together under the direction of
Rob Reiner (who played documentary filmmaker Marty DiBergi) to play
members of a fictional, failing metal band, and the resulting
mockumentary was easily the funniest film ever about rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   A vicious lampooning of pretentious English bands, it gave the
world the phrase ``amps on 11'' and hilarious set-pieces, such as
when the group got lost backstage before their first show.
</P>
<P>
   Band squabbles, ``cold sores,'' song titles such as ``Big
Bottom,'' a far-too-small Stonehenge stage set, a cucumber down the
pants, a drummer who died choking on someone else's vomit,
soul-destroying gigs at an Army base and a theme park _ ``Spinal
Tap'' was a huge giggle for any metal fan.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it coined the phrase ``Spinal Tap moment,'' which is
loosely defined as any ridiculous behavior or onstage calamity
involving an overpaid pop star.
</P>
<P>
   And for many who live in the ``real'' world of rock 'n' roll, it
was, and is, dead-on accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys in bands find it funny _ we can relate to it because we
don't take anything seriously,'' says Madison Winchell, drummer for
the Fort Worth rap/rock band Pimpadelic. ``One time we were in
Oklahoma and we made some jokes about the bombing _ not to be taken
seriously _ and when we left the club after the show our tires had
been flattened. All five _ even the spare. That was kind of Spinal
Tap.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Tap moments in the past several years have included the
members of U2 getting stuck in the huge lemon they normally stepped
out of before doing their encores, and diva Mariah Carey demanding
pink toilet paper in every hotel room in which she stays. Oh, yes,
and Van Halen demanding that all brown M&AMP;Ms be removed from their
buffet backstage _ and trashing the room if they find one.
</P>
<P>
   Paula McElheney, who works for local concert promoters 462, has
seen her share of out-of-control rock-star egotism. She says the
movie is ``still'' more accurate than most rock fans would like to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous and beyond most people's normal scope, but
it's real,'' she says. ``It's an industry cult classic _ I don't
know a single person in the record business that doesn't love it.
The pettiness of the band members, the egos, the complaining about
the backstage catering _ it really is that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in the Tap revival do not speak to McKean,
Shearer or Guest: They get one of the three in character; we drew
St. Hubbins, a decent chap who says the Tap's mission is still the
same _ to rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do an acoustic set, but let's face it, what we're here
for is to provide a splitting headache of the most enjoyable
type,'' he says. ``One doesn't go to an AC/DC show for a ``nap,''
does one? That's what you go to see Judas Priest for. We just want
to make the eardrums bleed, as the poet put it.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Hubbins says his time off has largely been spent raising
sheep and working on two musicals: an opera called ``Beowulf of
London'' and an all-scat version of ``Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tufnel, he says, ``is always going off and waking up in Bali or
somewhere. He's got an awful sense of direction, but he's a
constantly moving target, so that helps.''
</P>
<P>
   And Smalls is ``Mr. London,'' content to live in a ``cleanish''
apartment hard by the River Thames, hanging out with an endless
stream of ``birds'' and friends who ``share his taste in Italian
pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the chance came to revive the band, the three jumped at
it. The way St. Hubbins figures it, the world is ready for the Tap
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of Spinal Tap in everybody _ it has to do
with the human condition, doesn't it?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So they hired Fleetwood and recorded ``Back From the Dead,''
which St. Hubbins describes as ``a good hard-rocking industrial
Latino desperate attempt at a hit single, really.''
</P>
<P>
   The three original members are taking the reunion in stride, but
Fleetwood is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mick is terrified,'' St. Hubbins says. ``He's a bit wobbled at
the knees about working with the Tap, as well he should be, as we
were an early influence on Fleetwood Mac. They used to support us
in the clubs all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't Fleetwood also scared of dying, as so many Tap drummers
have?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' St. Hubbins says. ``He has a lot of protective
clothing, an anti-radioactive suit, sort of a heat-resistant thing.
He's not a ``fool,'' you know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tap, he says, will not mount another long tour, although he
says he always enjoyed them _ even the last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd never had a band member leave the stage before Nigel
did,'' he says. ``I popped out to get a massage once, but that's
different. The trip to Graceland was very moving, but what I really
remember was meeting the ones who sell the records and put them on
the air. That's the most rewarding part about touring, isn't it?
Meeting all the little people who have made you rich and
successful.''

   JERUSALEM _ The linchpin Shas political party retracted its
resignation from Israel's government Thursday afternoon, leaving
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's broad coalition battered but intact to
head into a crucial stage of peacemaking with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his strongest speeches since taking office, Barak then
appealed to his nation to reflect on and rise above the recent
internal turmoil, which, he said, threatened to sour ``everything
that the Jewish nation fought for and dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What sort of Israel do we want?'' Barak said in a live radio
broadcast from a Labor Party meeting. ``Do we want an Israel of
violence and division?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want an Israel of hatred? Where will this lead? I am
afraid that we all know, and I believe that we are all afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends, we cannot make peace with our neighbors without
making peace first among ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this gut-wrenching day for many Israelis, when
their country was spared the immediate turmoil of a government's
collapse but witnessed the denouement of what many considered a sad
spectacle, Dennis Ross, the U.S. peace envoy, arrived here to
tackle the external peace issue.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will follow on Tuesday as
part of the Americans' intensifying effort to lay the foundation
for a successful retreat-style summit meeting in July. The
meeting's goal would be a final peace agreement and an end to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, although a partial solution is
considered more feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Those peace talks are the backdrop for Thursday's political
events.
</P>
<P>
   Shas officials, in fact, specifically noted that their
re-enlistment in the government would permit Barak to proceed with
the negotiations that are his central project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave the prime minister, first of all, the umbrella that he
has a government,'' said Shlomo Benizri, a Shas official and the
health minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``And with this government, he will be able to travel to the
United States in the near future, within two weeks, to continue
with the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a year of tense co-existence with the leftists in
Barak's government, Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party, won a primary
battle by forcing the leftist Meretz Party out of the Cabinet so
that it could remain.
</P>
<P>
   Meretz's three ministers, including the education minister,
Yossi Sarid, a staunch secularist who has become Shas' nemesis,
quit their posts on Wednesday night. Meretz will stay in the
government to support the peace effort that it champions, but the
leaders relinquished their ministries to end the uncertainty about
whether the government would survive, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister agreed, maybe against his true wishes, to
give up Meretz,'' Sarid said. ``And Meretz agreed to lie down over
the fence for him.'' He was using a well-known army expression,
referring to a soldier who throws himself over barbed wire so that
others can walk over him to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who now has a cabinet similar to that of his rightist
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, did not try to convince the Meretz
ministers to stay. He did say that he appreciated their
``concession,'' but he seemed to cast blame widely, calling on all
parties to ``stop with the invective and the arm-twisting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is not the toy of any party or any individual,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Barak will learn whether the political crisis has been
worth it: whether Shas backs him and the peace effort or whether it
continues to act like an opposition party that sits in the
government. He originally included Shas in his coalition, and
withstood its full-time balkiness, in order to have the party's
backing for a peace deal with the Palestinians. But that support is
not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The overt issues in contention between Shas and Barak concerned
the finances and oversight of the religious party's indebted school
system and the legalization of its pirate radio stations, which
have been nicknamed ``the holy channels.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Shas' rabbis instructed their politicians to resign
from the coalition last week, they also cited as an incentive
Barak's plan ``to forsake'' the West Bank. There is a deeply
embedded resistance inside the party to territorial concessions,
despite a one-time ruling by Shas' spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef, that it is valid to give up land if it serves to end the
violence and save Jewish lives.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's party, One Israel, ``has not discounted the possibility
that in a month or two, if he presents an agreement with the
Palestinians, Shas will stick a knife in his back,'' Yossi Verter
wrote in the Haaretz newspaper Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Formed a year ago, Barak's broad coalition was his effort to
learn from the mistakes of his mentor, the late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, and to forge a national consensus for his
peacemaking. But the rifts between various segments of Israeli
society go deep, and they are probably even more intense at the
leadership level. Instead of bridging differences, the broad
government has seemed to exacerbate them.

</P>
<P>
   A demonstration of the deep-seated enmity between Sarid and Eli
Yishai, the Shas leader, played out like hostile theater in the
Israeli parliament on Wednesday. Sarid mocked what he said was
Yishai's weakness as a party leader, repeatedly saying: ``Try to
refrain from lying. I know it's not easy.'' Yishai accused Sarid of
persecuting Shas in an obsessed way and referred to him as
``wicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the bickering, Barak sighed. ``You hear the
argument,'' he said, ``and you really understand why when the
teacher in the second grade sees her pupils misbehaving she says to
them: `This isn't the Knesset, get a hold of yourselves.''' The
Knesset is the Israeli parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis have been disgusted and disillusioned by the
political crisis. Nahum Barnea, a senior columnist for Yedioth
Ahronoth, compared the politicians' displays of rage to a recent
rash of impulse murders. ``The ministers are no better than the
drivers who kick each other to death because of a quarrel over the
right of way at a traffic light,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gabi Lalouche, who is the right-wing mayor of Dimona, a poor
town, noted that he strongly opposed Sarid's views on the peace
effort. ``But I've been mayor for 11 years, and what Sarid and Ran
Cohen,'' another Meretz minister, ``have done in the last year for
the development towns has not been done in many years. Their exit
is a dirge for generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Political experts heaped a lot of blame on Barak, a former
general, for handling the situation like an inexperienced
politician. They said he ended up doing belatedly and publicly what
he could have done much earlier and more quietly: pressuring Meretz
and capitulating to Shas' demands.
</P>
<P>
   But the same experts said that the political world in general is
to blame; politicians have become so hermetically sealed in their
air-conditioned parliament that they don't seem to understand the
Israeli public's desire for peace with its Arab neighbors and peace
at home, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madmen, get down from the roof!'' Sima Kadmon, another
newspaper columnist, wrote to the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   For the Shas school system, Barak offered millions in debt
relief as well as tax forgiveness. He also proposed that the
system's problems be administered by a special team reporting to
him and taken out of the Education Ministry's hands. The radio
stations will come under the umbrella of Israel's second
broadcasting authority, where they have been promised almost
complete independence.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Shas will withdraw its support for early elections,
killing the idea for the time being.

O'CONNOR FALTERS ON SELF-DISCOVERY PATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever else she has been or will be, Sinead O'Connor won't be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   She's an Irishwoman who has bounced between Dublin and London
and explores the volatile relationship between the two countries; a
performer equally at home with traditional Irish instruments,
hip-hop and reggae; a woman who has torn up a picture of the Pope
on TV and is now a priest in an outlaw Roman Catholic sect; an
artist who has made fantastic records but hasn't released a
full-length CD in six years.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 33, is clearly on a personal journey of discovery _
she's again living in Dublin, and only a few weeks ago she outed
herself as a lesbian. And as such, her new CD, ``Faith and
Courage,'' is a deeply emotional summation of where she's been (a
suicide attempt, motherhood, unhappy relationships, a newfound
calmness and spirituality) and her desire to see people set aside
their differences in finding strength through prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The result is frequently riveting _ and frequently
patience-testing. Like many people who have undergone a recent
infusion of faith, O'Connor can be ridiculously preachy _ at its
worst, ``Faith'' comes off as both self-satisfied and whiny.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's ``No Man's Woman,'' which is simply the nadir
of her career, flat-out man-bashing at the most basic, obvious
level. Nice tune, though.
</P>
<P>
   There are also times the CD feels simply lazy: On ``Daddy I'm
Fine,'' she can't even be bothered to find a rhyme for ``money,''
shortening the word to ``mon' '' to serve her purposes. Six years,
and we can't find a better way to tell this particular tale?
</P>
<P>
   I realize I'm in the minority here: Numerous critics have
praised ``Faith and Courage'' to the skies: Time magazine has
already judged it ``one of the best CDs of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   And to be sure, there is much to admire, from O'Connor's
overriding conviction and always amazing voice to her fusion of
Irish and high-stepping reggae on ``The Lamb's Book of Life'' to
her compassion and intelligence on such songs as ``The Healing
Room,'' the sunny R&AMP;B of ``Dancing Lessons'' (which was produced by
Wyclef Jean and deserves to be a massive hit single) to the
majestic pop of ``The State I'm In.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, moreover, a profound sense of relief that this older,
at least slightly mellower O'Connor has gone through all she has _
and no question, she's had her hardships _ and come through, by the
sound of things here, able to make music that often has such power,
emotional depth and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   But all that said, ``Faith and Courage'' is not her best effort
_ and not one without some significant problems. Those of us who
have long admired her will continue to listen as she sends out the
occasional message from her heart, and ``Faith'' is best heard in
this context: as part of a greater process, a step along the path.

   Second Thought on `Moon' Trip
</P>
<P>
   The deal was this: Periodically the actors would vote on whether
to let the filmmakers back into rehearsals; if the vote was no, the
film would be burned. Under that not altogether comfortable set of
conditions, D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus began work on ``Moon
Over Broadway,'' their acclaimed documentary about the putting
together of the 1995 play ``Moon Over Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   When Docurama releases the film on tape and DVD on July 5, there
should be none of the unsettling elements that surrounded either
the documentary or the making of the troubled Broadway comedy,
which starred Carol Burnett and Philip Bosco. Noted for a
cinema-verite approach that allows the camera to observe but never
intrude, Pennebaker documentaries have famously watched
show-business scenes unfolding. For this assignment he and Hegedus
appeared with their cameras at the start of rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take anything for granted,'' Pennebaker said the
other day. ``You're going into private areas of people's lives.''
Burnett had not been on Broadway in 30 years. ``No matter how
engaging they might be initially when they shake hands and tell you
how much they like your films, when you start to poke around you
aren't sure how they're going to take it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the disc, Bosco; Tom Moore, the play's director; Ken Ludwig,
the playwright; and Rocco Landesman, one of the producers, indicate
that they took the documentary makers' presence well enough to join
in on the director's commentary several years later. Burnett's
reflections, recorded separately, are stirred in.
</P>
<P>
   During rehearsals they spoke their minds, and they do so again
on the disc, which is one reason DVD commentaries can be fun and
instructive even if they are about an old Broadway show that had
its problems from the start but lasted 9 months and 301
performances.
</P>
<P>
   In the commentary Bosco is as critical of the play as he was
during rehearsals, when he reacted angrily to what he perceived as
the director's and the playwright's attempts to stifle the actors'
interpretations of their roles. Bosco initially joined the project
because he thought the comedy, about the farcical troubles of a
flamboyant and once-renowned older theatrical couple, had been
written for him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it had been, but other elements crept in _ Hollywood,
he notes, by which he means the necessity in the end to create a
star vehicle. But he joins the others in lauding Burnett, who
worked hard to adjust from her years in television.
</P>
<P>
   But the real hero of the documentary is Ludwig. ``Time and `Moon
Over Buffalo' have also reinforced my long-held suspicion that
Burnett can locate a laugh in an empty laundry hamper,'' Vincent
Canby wrote in his review in The New York Times, a not exactly rave
referral to the play's humor. The playwright, rewriting like mad
all through the rehearsal process, , takes criticism in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I met them all at the same birthday party, they wouldn't be
a happy group,'' Pennebaker said. ``I liked them all individually
because I see the terrible ordeal they go through.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   `Liberty Heights'
</P>
<P>
   Barry Levinson's fourth Baltimore-based film chronicles the rise
of '50s television, rock 'n' roll and the teen-age car culture.
Avoiding ``Happy Days'' stereotypes is no mean trick, but here is a
fresh perspective from two young brothers (Ben Foster, above, and
Adrien Brody) growing up in a middle-class Jewish family in a
gentile-dominated world. Luckily they have solid, caring parents
(Joe Mantegna and Bebe Neuwirth). ``Again,'' Stephen Holden wrote
in The New York Times, ``Levinson shows a special knack for
capturing the boastful, clinging camaraderie and cultural fetishes
of innocents trying to invent themselves in a more restrictive
era.''
</P>
<P>
   _1999. Warner. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 127 minutes. Closed
captioned. R.

   ``You need to share more than anyone I've ever known,'' an
undercover Fed named Charlie Mayo (Liam Neeson) is told by his
psychiatrist (Michael Mantell). During an operation Charlie was
caught and tortured face down in a pile of watermelon and ever
since he has been looking for his lost nerve. His new assignment
lands him between a yuppie Colombian thug (Jose Zuniga) and a
violent cohort, Fulvio (Oliver Platt). Charlie's stomach growls
like a Rottweiler, but comfort comes from a nurse named Judy
(Sandra Bullock) in ``one of the most subtle and inspired comedies
you'll see this year'' (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>

<P>
   Leila
</P>
<P>
   Learning that her daughter-in-law, Leila (Leila Hatami), is
infertile, an imperious mother-in-law (Jamileh Sheikhi)
systematically undermines the marriage of her only son (Ali
Mosaffa). Dariush Mehrjui's heartbreaking film is set in Iran, but
the parent's selfishness and pride put her in the same elite league
with some of Hollywood's most formidable Gorgons. Born to wealth
and privilege, Leila is thrown by the relentless campaign to have
her husband take a second wife who can bear him a son. While he
remains devoted, she gradually falls apart in a film that ``is, in
a word, devastating'' (Holden).

</P>
<P>
   In a London hospital after a brawl with a Serb, a Croat winds up
in the bed next to his opponent, and they fall to arguing over who
started it all. Jan Dizdar's film follows an agglomeration of
Balkan characters and others around the multicultural city, trying
to find some sense in a situation that has none. But his movie,
crammed with disparate stories, is anything but grim. Dizdar
``directs with extraordinary exuberance and self-confidence, in a
style that combines documentary realism with a playful,
improvisatory sense of possibility'' (A.O. Scott).

   _1999. Trimark. $69.99; DVD, $24.99. 117 minutes. Closed

</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in
earlier editions.
</P>
<P>
   TOO JEWISH? Avi Hoffman's delightful musical revue does its best
to keep Yiddish and Yiddish theater alive, evoking the past when it
flourished from the shtetls of Eastern Europe to the Bronx. ``A
warm and winning mixture of nostalgia, song, comedy and cultural
and social history,'' Lawrence Van Gelder wrote in The New York
Times. 1995. Ergo Media. $29.95. 100 minutes. Information: (800)
695-3746.
</P>
<P>
   FREEDOM SONG. Keeping sentimentality largely at bay, Phil Alden
Robinson's film recounts a time of mounting racial violence in the
South in the early 1960's. A disillusioned idealist (Danny Glover)
tries to deal with his angry son (Vicellous Reon Shannon), who
allies himself with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
as tensions lead to murder, demonstrations, beatings and jailings.
Robinson, William McDonald wrote in The New York Times, ``has
avoided falling into the trap of peopling his microcosm with
representative types.''
</P>
<P>
   DRUNKEN ANGEL; I LIVE IN FEAR. Two films by Akira Kurosawa are
available for the first time. In ``Drunken Angel'' (1948, 102
minutes), with Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura, a gangster with
tuberculosis and a bullet lodged in his hand relates to the
alcoholic doctor who treats him. In ``I Live in Fear'' (1955, 105
minutes), an aging foundry owner (Mifune) terrified of nuclear
conflict, moves to Brazil. Home Vision. $19.99 each. Japanese with
English subtitles.

YOUTH ORCHESTRA FESTIVAL BEGINS IN SARASOTA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga., Texas, Wis., Minn, Va., Ohio, Mich., Mass.)   By CHARLIE HUISKING   Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Five hundred teen-agers are converging on
Sarasota this week to participate in the National Youth Orchestra
Festival, an intensive week of rehearsals, coaching sessions,
workshops and public concerts that began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Five youth orchestras from around the country qualified for the
event: Northern Virginia's American Youth Philharmonic, the Atlanta
Symphony Youth Orchestra, the Greater Dallas Youth Orchestra, the
Milwaukee Youth Symphony Orchestra and the Minnesota Youth
Symphonies.
</P>
<P>
   Each ensemble will perform once with its own conductor at the
Sarasota Opera House. Then, the musicians will be regrouped into
four festival orchestras. They will perform such works as
Stravinsky's ``Firebird Suite,'' Elgar's ``Enigma Variations'' and
Mussorgorsky's ``Pictures at an Exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   An 18-member faculty of guest conductors and musicians will work
with the students. The roster includes Christopher Wilkins, music
director and conductor of the San Antonio Symphony; Robert Vernon,
principal viola, Cleveland Orchestra; and Ann Hobson Pilot,
principal harp, Boston Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is co-sponsored by the American Symphony Orchestra
League and Sarasota's Florida West Coast Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial event was first held in 1998 at the Interlochen
Center for the Arts in Michigan. While the inaugural festival was a
success, scheduling problems forced organizers to look for a new
home. Sarasota was chosen largely because of the reputation of the
Florida West Coast Symphony, said Debra McKeon, the festival's
managing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symphony has such a commitment to education, to young
people,'' she said. ``They have the same mission, the same
philosophy that we do. It seemed like the perfect fit.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said youth orchestra festivals are common in Europe,
``but until 1998, we'd never had a forum in the United States to
celebrate the success of the youth orchestra movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have a lot to celebrate. The level of musicianship is
increasing at a fast pace. That's happening in part because young
people are studying music at an earlier age. Also, I think we as a
country are coming to realize that music education is important,
not only to those who want to be musicians, but to us as a
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 200 youth orchestras in the nation, 25 auditioned
for the festival. The winners were chosen based on audio tapes of
their performances.

WALLACE AND GROMIT FANS, GET YOURSELVES TO THE THEATER _ COOP
SUITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' and ``M:I-2.'' Anyone who has seen
the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit short films knows that nobody,
but nobody does a chase scene better than Nick Park.
</P>
<P>
   And at the climax of ``Chicken Run,'' DreamWorks' new
stop-motion animated feature, Park and co-director Peter Lord
deliver, with a breakout sequence that's not likely to have a rival
this summer. But despite such brilliance from the directors and
their team of animators, ``Chicken Run'' occasionally flags a
little as it makes its way to this rousing conclusion; it's proof
that a movie can be worthwhile, entertaining and a little
disappointing all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Park brings a lot of good will to the project,
thanks to his popular Wallace and Gromit series. Charming and
hilarious, these imaginative short animated films _ featuring
eccentric inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit _ have earned
Park quite a cult following, some of whom have been awaiting a
feature film for nearly a decade. That's long enough that anything
but a total bomb is probably going to seem a satisfactory payoff.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Chicken Run'' is far from a bomb. It's funny, it's
fast-paced and it's laced with other winning Park trademarks, such
as Rube Goldberg-style inventions and wry dialogue. But it suffers
from the dangers inherent in expanding to feature films after a
career of making shorts _ especially the kind of exhaustively
animated films that Park, Lord and their England-based Aardman
Animations specialize in. Most Aardman films clock in at under 30
minutes, with only one or two speaking voices and a thriftiness
with peripheral characters. With ``Chicken Run,'' Park, Lord and
their team of animators have created a movie nearly three times as
long, with a 10-member principal ``cast'' and a coopful of extras.
</P>
<P>
   They keep the story simple: It's about a flock of chickens'
attempts to escape England's moody Tweedy Farm, which looks like a
concentration camp with the ``Psycho'' house as headquarters.
Leading the breakout attempts is Ginger (voiced by ``Absolutely
Fabulous''' Julia Sawalha), a plucky clucker who's hamstrung by
barbed wire, chicken-hearted or bird-brained coopmates, and her
inability simply to fly over the fence. One look at the cruel Mrs.
Tweedy (Miranda Richardson), though, and you understand Ginger's
desperation: If you're a Tweedy Farm hen and you've stopped laying
eggs, then you're tomorrow night's dinner. And Mrs. Tweedy is about
to hatch a new profit-making scheme involving a machine that makes
chicken-pot pies.
</P>
<P>
   But Ginger thinks she's found a solution when Rocky, a strutting
American rooster voiced by Mel Gibson (whose first line is a riff
on ``Braveheart''), inadvertently lands in the coop. Rocky has
apparently discovered the secret of chicken flight, but we in the
audience know he's a fraud _ and yet we also know that somehow
he'll come through in the end, albeit reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Chicken Run'' is dedicated to the romantic tension
between Ginger and Rocky, and to his scheming attempts to whip the
coop into shape for an escape. And Park, Lord and screenwriter
Karey Kirkpatrick concoct an amusing variety of sight gags and
chicken puns to fill the time between the movie's best moments,
which include the initial series of ``Great Escape''-inspired
escape attempts (all of which end with Ginger in ``solitary
confinement''), a near-miss for Rocky and Ginger in the pot-pie
machine, a dance number, and the wild and woolly _ er, feathery _
climax. This is good stuff indeed, but the tightness of Park and
Lord's earlier work is missing, even as this movie whisks by at a
brief 85 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   What's also missing is the uniqueness and intimacy. Wallace and
Gromit, especially, are thoroughly original characters, one a
blabby, cheese-loving, somewhat clueless chap, and the other a dog
who's unusually expressive and understanding even for his
empathetic species. The chickens in ``Chicken Run,'' and the
villains that threaten them, are more generic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it can be guilt-inducing to carp about it. Park and Lord
avoid the mistake of making the animation so flashy, as in the
recent ``Dinosaur,'' that the story and characters suffer because
of it. Within minutes, you've accepted these characters as
characters, rather than cartoons. This, and a love of Park and
Lord's previous work, might help blind the duo's fans to ``Chicken
Run's'' flaws. Then again, they also might find its occasional
slackness to be a minor letdown. But they won't find the movie to
be a waste of time, because it's true to the Aardman style and
holds the promise of better things to come.

`ME, MYSELF AND IRENE': WITH BAD TASTE FOR ALL AND CHARITY FOR
NONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``Me, Myself and Irene,'' Peter and Bobby Farrelly, proud
sons of Cumberland, R.I., extend the string of heartfelt,
stomach-turning comedies that began with ``Kingpin,'' still the
greatest Amish-bowler road picture ever made, and continued with
``Dumb and Dumber'' and the seminal gross-out masterpiece,
``There's Something About Mary.'' Their characteristic
preoccupations are much in evidence here: characters gratuitously
named Dick or Dickie; animals in medical distress; and an almost
connoisseurial regard for onanism, scatology and _ how to put it? _
sticking things where the sun doesn't shine (in this case, an
oversized sex toy and a live chicken).
</P>
<P>
   If ``There's Something About Mary'' disgusted you with its
callous mockery of hair and pet care and its whimsical views of
stalking and serial killing, ``Me, Myself and Irene'' will make you
miserable indeed. As a character squats down to defecate on a
neighbor's lawn, the brothers (who directed from a script they
wrote with Mike Cerrone) cut to a shot of chocolate soft-serve ice
cream swirling into a cup. They serve up bodily fluids with all the
gusto of deranged sommeliers proffering rare vintage wines. But
``Me, Myself and Irene'' shares with the Farrelly brothers' earlier
movies a kind of dopey, boyish sincerity and a good-natured
sympathy for the underdog that may prove capable of winning over
even the dourest spirits.
</P>
<P>
   The superior ``Mary,'' it's true, had a more inventive story,
the indelible presence of Jonathan Richman as a guitar-strumming
narrator and a range of inspired comic performances, notably
Cameron Diaz's sweet-tempered spitfire and Matt Dillon's besotted
private investigator. What ``Me, Myself and Irene'' has is Jim
Carrey, whose rubberized body and latex fright-mask face dominate
the screen, making the rest of the cast look like well-meaning,
ordinary folk.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey plays Charlie Baileygates, a proud member of ``the
greatest law enforcement organization in the land'' (the Rhode
Island State Police, naturally), who lives with his three sons in a
modest waterfront bungalow. Because of a plot twist I'll refrain
from divulging, Charlie's triplets are African-American academic
prodigies. They humor their adoring dad in his attempts to speak
their language: ``I don't want to have to bust a cap,'' he says,
reminding them to clean up their rooms and do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys like to poke at cultural sensitivities, daring the
audience to take offense and at the same time daring it not to.
Charlie's sons are obvious racial stereotypes but they also mock
the very idea of racial identity. Growing up in a suburban
backwater in one of the whitest little states in the union, Jamaal
(Anthony Anderson), Lee Harvey (Mongo Brownlee) and Shonte Junior
(Jerod Mixon) talk like characters in one of Ice Cube's ``Friday''
movies, a result of their youthful exposure to the stand-up comedy
of Richard Pryor. The most striking thing about this family,
though, is not the color of its members but how loving and loyal
they are to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Some literal-minded souls have objected to this movie's
portrayal of mental illness, since its shambling plot turns on
Charlie's affliction with ``advanced hallucinatory schizophrenia''
accompanied by ``involuntary narcissistic rage.'' Yes, the etiology
of Charlie's disorder is flagrantly inaccurate, but the movie's
message, to the extent that it has one, is one of compassion,
self-awareness and emotional balance. Or maybe I'm crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, in layman's terms, Charlie's diagnosis arises from the
fact that after enduring 18 years of milquetoast humiliation at the
hands of his first wife, his neighbors and the good people of
southern Rhode Island, he suddenly turns into Hank, a lustful
sociopath who expresses himself in skewed tough-guy catchphrases.
``Just because I rock doesn't mean I'm made of stone,'' he tells
Irene, a fugitive golf-course superintendent played with the right
mixture of moxie and bewilderment by Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   As Hank, Carrey shows the edge of creepiness that made him so
repellent, and so fascinating, in the underrated ``Cable Guy.'' As
Charlie he manifests a dorky sincerity somewhere between ``The
Truman Show'' and ``Dumb and Dumber.'' The two performances become
less distinct as the movie careens toward its climax _ the most
amazing one-man wrestling match since Steve Martin grappled with
the ghost of Lily Tomlin in ``All of Me'' _ but somehow add up to a
credible romantic lead. It's a rare comedian who can be so
completely repulsive and at the same time so lovable.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``Me, Myself and Irene'' doesn't really bear
thinking about; at any rate, Cerrone and the Farrellys don't seem
to have given it much thought. Something about crooked dealings
between an upstate New York golf course developer and the
Environmental Protection Agency, and a clutch of standard-issue bad
guys (notably Richard Jenkins and Chris Cooper, in a succession of
Hawaiian shirt and blazer ensembles) _ just enough to send Hank,
Charlie and Irene on a scenic ramble from gag to gag.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, they acquire an albino sidekick named Whitey, a
character whose treatment is a perfect illustration of the
Farrellys' comic sensibilities. When Hank first meets Whitey
(Michael Bowman), he subjects him to a torrent of unprovoked, and
hilarious, abuse, which turns to tears of remorse when he realizes
he has hurt the young man's feelings. The audience's feelings after
this sudden tonal shift lie somewhere between guilt and
bewilderment, but they are soon swept away by the next round of
jokes. The humor in ``Me, Myself and Irene'' is often outrageous
but rarely cruel. I hope I don't embarrass the filmmakers, who work
so hard to give offense, by pointing out the streak of tender
humanity that runs through their work. They commit acts of flagrant
bad taste in the service of decency.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Me Myself and Irene'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes _ where to
begin?

`ME, MYSELF' AND MY TIRED HUMOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no surprise that gross-out masters Peter and Bobby Farrelly
would want to take on split-personality disorder with their latest
movie, ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' because these are guys who want to
have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Guys who want to mock mental illness while convincing you that
they're sympathetic to the afflicted. Guys who treat women as sex
objects, yet generally make them the most grounded, intelligent
characters in their movies. Guys who make a career out of promoting
ethnic stereotypes, but who throw in just enough positive twists to
escape accusations of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Guys who make a movie like ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' which has a
dual personality of its own: It is, at times, laugh-out-loud funny,
albeit in the most outrageous and disgusting ways. But just as
often, it's draggy and slack, and appears to be in need of a good
editing job.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the first time the Farrellys have given the sense that
instead of topping themselves, they're repeating themselves _ and
worse, repeating other movies before them. Because as crass and
politically incorrect as the Farrellys can be, they're usually
wholly original. But in ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' they borrow from
the time-honored ``Jekyll and Hyde/Nutty Professor'' tradition:
Nice guy has badder guy inside him, trying to get out.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal to the Farrellys is obvious: One reason their
particular brand of crude humor works with audiences is that it's
so outlandish, you can believe it's all in fun. But it's often
mean-spirited, and the Farrellys are expert at covering that up by
giving themselves all kinds of loopholes. Heck, after one
vituperative scene in ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' the offending
character actually apologizes for being offensive _ and then has a
brief, ``I just wanna be loved'' breakdown afterward. You can't
give yourself much more of an escape clause than that.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey, returning to his maniacal comic style after more
controlled turns in ``The Truman Show'' and the woefully
underappreciated ``Man on the Moon,'' plays the two-faced character
who's the ``Me, Myself'' of the title. Carrey is Charlie
Baileygates, a mild-mannered Rhode Island state trooper whose life
comes crashing down when his sweetheart (Traylor Howard) makes a
love connection with the angry chauffeur who brought the couple
home from their wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Left in the lurch with triplets who obviously aren't his _ they
grow into strapping and overweight African-American teens _ Charlie
suppresses his anger for 18 years, until one particularly bad day
finally brings out his alter-ego, the hyperaggressive Hank. Hank
speaks in the growl of mid-career Clint Eastwood, and his manner is
something like what might happen if the smarmiest Vegas Elvis
merged with the smuttiest Howard Stern. Carrey's slow burn as he
approaches the transformation is masterful, and his spin into Hank
has an amusing but cruel-edged (and at one point, nauseating)
payoff. Fortunately, he can control the disorder with medication.
Unfortunately, he leaves the meds behind at a crucial point.
</P>
<P>
   That comes when _ through plot convolutions we won't go into
here _ he winds up going on the lam with Irene (an ill-fitting
Renee Zellweger, whose own physical attributes are lampooned).
She's a golf-course maintenance expert who has been set up by her
sleazy ex-boyfriend (Farrelly veteran Daniel Greene) and a crooked
Upstate New York cop (''American Beauty's'' Chris Cooper). Charlie
is assigned to extradite Irene to New York, but when it becomes
clear that she's in danger, bad boy Hank comes to the rescue. He'd
be a hero, except that he has the social skills of a pit bull in
heat.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychiatric Association recently sent out an e-mail
to film critics condemning ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' for making fun of
the mentally ill _ and for the constant, erroneous description of
Charlie's disorder as ``schizophrenia'' (actually, it's a much
longer description than that, but never mind). Of course, this
being a Farrelly brothers movie, it wouldn't be surprising if
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the NAACP, Little
People of America and the National Organization of Albinism and
Hypopigmentation joined the chorus. They all represent groups that
are held up for ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   But something about the Farrellys' envelope- and button-pushing
humor is getting tired. In ``There's Something About Mary,'' their
torture of the little ``Puffy'' dog inspired guilty guffaws; in
``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' a cow gets the animal-mauling treatment,
and it only leads to forced chuckles. One of the key props is what
this newspaper once genteelly referred to as ``an artificial sex
toy,'' but it feels like a mere echo of the zipper and hair-gel
scenes from ``Mary.'' And how many more disasters are the Farrellys
going to contrive for guys alone in bathrooms?
</P>
<P>
   As for Carrey, he performs his own little duality trick by both
rising above the humor with his performance and still managing to
keep in the spirit of the movie's indecent behavior. But his
showcase scene, in which Charlie and Hank finally have a showdown,
is such an overblown piece of self-indulgent physical comedy that
the preview audience _ which up to that point, had laughed
frequently, but not uproariously _ seemed more stunned than amused.
</P>
<P>
   Upstaging Carrey are Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee and Jerod
Mixon, who play Charlie's African-American ``sons'' with verve, wit
and rowdy warmth. They're the best-written characters in the movie,
brilliant students who speak in the most foul-mouthed street
vernacular while discussing such matters as quantum physics. Even
that idea isn't exactly original, but it's entertaining in this
context, and it makes you wonder if the Farrellys focused on the
wrong central idea for a film. Then again, we probably don't want
to see any of these guys in an embarrassing bathroom situation.

`ABYSSINIAN CHRONICLES': IN A LAWLESS LAND, A BOY MUST FIND HIS OWN
RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many first novels, Moses Isegawa's ``Abyssinian
Chronicles'' is a first-person account of a young man's coming of
age: a discursive tale of familial struggles, thwarted romances and
picaresque adventures. Isegawa's book, however, takes place in the
1970s and '80s in Uganda, a country wracked by Idi Amin's brutal
reign of terror and the fallout of civil war; and his story not
only traces his hero's loss of innocence but the dissolution of his
entire family and by implication that of an entire country and way
of life.
</P>
<P>
   Isegawa's narrator, Mugezi, is a latter-day descendant of
Fielding and Thackeray's blackguards, transported to the peculiarly
lawless landscape of Amin's Uganda. A malcontent and sometime
scoundrel, Mugezi has learned to manipulate and dissemble in the
course of surviving a Dickensian childhood of alarming violence and
barbarity. He tells the story of his life in a blunt, rough-hewn
narrative devoid of anything resembling rationalization or
emotional censorship. He does nothing to conceal the rage he feels
against his parents and refuses to sentimentalize, or justify, his
own unsavory actions. As a result his story has a strange amoral
power, an immediacy and raw energy that capture the chaotic mood of
his times.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the book is remorseless, its language overheated.
``Uganda was in a state of siege, writhing like a dying moth on the
floor,'' Isegawa writes. ``The bugles of defeat were poised,
waiting to blow the walls down. The inside of the country was like
a grenade whose pin had already been drawn. There was an explosive
feeling in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of two decades of political and social turmoil
Mugezi's family suffers a succession of violent losses. His
grandfather's sister, who worked as the village midwife, is killed
during the coup in which Idi Amin seized power in 1971. One of his
aunts is gang-raped by soldiers during a clash between Amin's
forces and the guerrillas. Another aunt, who was tortured for her
work with anti-Amin forces, comes to power in the aftermath of his
overthrow but soon dies of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mugezi's other relatives, they will succumb to the
centrifugal forces of history and domestic discord, leaving their
small ancestral village for the alienating streets of Kampala, and
in the case of Mugezi, eventually leaving Kampala for a life of
exile abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Mugezi repeatedly refers to his parents as ``the two
dictators,'' drawing implicit comparisons between their tyrannical
rule over their children and Amin's tyrannical rule over Uganda.
Mugezi's mother, Padlock, is a former nun who was expelled from the
convent for beating her students, and her six children bear the
brunt of her frequent and irrational rages. His father, Serenity,
tends to hold himself apart from their domestic wrangles but on one
occasion beats Mugezi so severely that the boy thinks he is going
to die.
</P>
<P>
   To get back at his parents, Mugezi contrives a series of cruel
practical jokes. He forges a love letter from one of his mother's
admirers, causing his father to suspect a heated love affair; he
steals the bobbin from his mother's sewing machine, undermining her
business as a seamstress. (Such is the economic reality of Uganda
that it takes her 90 days to get a new one through the black
market.) His pranks continue when he is sent away to a seminary
school: he vandalizes a car belonging to one of the priests and
defaces the boat of another school official.
</P>
<P>
   It is at the seminary that Mugezi inadvertently discovers a love
of books: in a mercenary effort to get an easy white-collar job at
the school, he finagles himself a position in the library and
stumbles into the realization that books offer a respite from the
dog-eat-dog world around him: they offer ``a reliable escape route
into a safer reality crammed with fantasy and ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the reader, Mugezi's accounts of his travails
at home and school quickly grow long-winded. Though his darkly
comic descriptions of his parent's abusive behavior are initially
shocking, they soon devolve into a repetitive pattern of complaint,
and the reader begins to tire of his crude put-downs and even
cruder vows of revenge. When Mugezi looks beyond the suffocating
world of his own travails, however, he proves himself a perceptive
observer, setting down the stories of friends and family members
with a mixture of nostalgia, sadness and regret.
</P>
<P>
   There's his uncle Kawayida, a meter reader for the local energy
company and a master storyteller, who loses a girlfriend and his
youngest child to AIDS. There's his former schoolmate Lwendo, who
persuades Mugezi to join him in a get-rich-quick scheme involving
piracy and blackmail. And there's his grandfather, who warned of
the political ``powder keg'' created by colonialism, and who dies a
violent death during the turmoil surrounding Amin's downfall in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Mugezi's own tale, the stories of these characters
provide a window on recent Ugandan history, a window that enables
us to understand the terrible ways in which public history can
intrude upon private lives, the ways in which the political becomes
the personal.

NEWS OF THE GREAT WHITE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JESSE McKINLEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the mind of your average theatergoer, the musical
``Footloose,'' which posted a July 2 closing this week, bears many
of the hallmarks of a long-running Broadway hit.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of its run, after all, it will have staged 737
performances, playing at the Richard Rodgers Theater for well over
a year and half; it will have been seen by hundreds of thousands of
people; and it will have spawned a cast album, a national tour
(with another planned) and promises of future companies in London,
Australia and points beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all that, it is to date, and without a doubt, a
financial flop.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the show is a case study in the always daunting risks
and unseen pitfalls faced by today's producers of Broadway
musicals, a group often faulted for their taste but never their
checkbooks. It also re-emphasizes, despite the faith in the power
of marketing, the steep climb faced by shows with bad reviews
trying to return their investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Footloose'' opened in October 1998 at an estimated cost of
$6.5 million and to a bushel of poor notices with a few good ones
mixed in. Still, producers pushed ahead, and their effort was not
without precedent. In recent years, after all, shows like ``Annie
Get Your Gun'' and ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' have overcome negative
reviews to build audiences with newfangled demographic direct mail
and old-fashioned advertising blitzes. In the case of
``Footloose,'' producers targeted suburban radio and newspapers,
hoping to tap into fans of the musical's source material, the hit
1984 film that starred Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The musical's backers were also banking on another time-tested
strategy: brand building. Producers are often willing to take a
loss in New York with hopes of making it back on the road, where
costs are lower, and any ``Broadway musical'' is often the biggest
_ and only _ show in town. Indeed ``Footloose'' begat a tour almost
immediately, sending a troupe out just two months after the show's
Broadway debut.
</P>
<P>
   The producers' stratagems showed some early success, and weekly
sales in New York reached the $550,000 range in November 1998, a
profit of roughly $150,000 a week. At year's end, during the
Christmas rush, the sales topped $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also problems. One was that the costs of running
``Footloose'' were more than expected because of advertising in New
York, which often reached $400,000 a week. Initial projections
called for operating costs of $350,000 or less. The show's brand
also proved less lucrative than expected on the road, with
half-filled houses in some cities. And unlike musicals or plays
that might become films, ``Footloose'' did not hold out the hope of
a sale to another medium; the movie, after all, was already made.
</P>
<P>
   Michael David, the president of the Dodger Theatricals, which
produced ``Footloose,'' did not return several calls for comment.
But an investor who has seen the show's financial statements said
that by last December the show had returned only 5 percent of its
initial investment, a figure that may have grown to about 20
percent by its closing. Still, producers soldiered on, some weeks
losing money, others earning some.
</P>
<P>
   By this spring a new show, ``Seussical,'' a musical based on the
canon of Dr. Seuss, announced it would take over the Richard
Rodgers Theater in the fall, meaning ``Footloose'' would have to
fold or move. In recent months producers retooled parts of the show
and began a new ``Footloose Five'' advertising campaign, featuring
the five young male leads, a strategy aimed at cashing in on the
current boy-band craze. It showed some effect, but in recent weeks
box office grosses dropped precipitously.
</P>
<P>
   In the end there was simply no more gas in the tank. As one
producer not connected to the show said, ```Footloose' burned, but
never exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   Many a New Day
</P>
<P>
   There were subtle signals this week that the production of
``Oklahoma!,'' tentatively scheduled to open on Broadway on Dec. 7,
was inching closer to fruition, and that its theater of choice
would likely be the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, home to
``Jesus Christ Superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for neither show would confirm the rumors, but sales
for ``Superstar'' have not been, well, stellar. Last week it sold
54 percent of its seats. A ``Superstar'' cast member who spoke on
condition of anonymity said rumors were flying backstage that the
show would close shortly after Labor Day, adding, ``It has
certainly not been lost upon us that attendance is not great.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility of making way for ``Oklahoma!,''
Adrian Bryan-Brown, a spokesman for ``Superstar,'' said the
producers were about to ``launch a very aggressive advertising and
marketing campaign, because they believe the show has a very large
summer audience.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the fall, when ``Oklahoma!'' is due?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have supreme confidence `Superstar' will find a summer
audience,'' Bryan-Brown reiterated.
</P>
<P>
   Arbor Day
</P>
<P>
   The last time Jeffrey Wright performed in Central Park, in 1991,
the city was in a recession, Christopher Walken and Raul Julia were
playing Iago and Othello, and Wright was playing, in his own words,
``the third cyprus tree from the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed. Beginning on Aug. 8 Wright will be playing
Marc Antony in ``Julius Caesar,'' at the Delacorte Theater,
alongside Jamey Sheridan (Brutus) and David McCallum (Caesar).
</P>
<P>
   The production is nicely timed, Wright said. ``There's something
perfect about doing this Roman play in the middle of this Roman
city,'' he said, referring to New York's imperial pre-eminence.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's transition from tree to leading man has been a steady
one, including performances on Broadway (``Angels in America,''
``Bring in da Noise, Bring in da Funk'') and on film
(``Basquiat''). Currently most people probably associate him with
his film-stealing performance in ``Shaft,'' in which he plays a
drug dealer named Peoples Hernandez, prone to malapropism (``You
can't turn off the dogs of war''), mangled English and menace.
</P>
<P>
   Since the movie opened last week Wright has been besieged with
offers, but he said he couldn't pass up the chance to play a man
``who becomes the very thing that he despises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back onstage,'' he said, ``is a chance to control what I
have.''

NEWS OF THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ One of the main reasons Robert Rodat, screenwriter
of 1998's ``Saving Private Ryan,'' decided to set his follow-up
film during the American Revolution was that it was a period and a
setting that movie audiences had not seen, at least not in many
years, and not in such an epic, sweeping format.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, there haven't been a lot of films about the
American Revolution, and I don't know why,'' Rodat said. ``I
thought about it a lot lately. I think part of it may be the degree
to which the Western mythology, beginning in the 1860s and coming
right up to the modern day, became so dominant in American
mythology. The Revolution doesn't tap into that classic American
mythology; it feels more like an English conflict, with the wigs
and people talking about principles.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Patriot,'' directed by Roland Emmerich, Mel Gibson
plays a South Carolina landowner who decides to sit out the war to
protect his motherless brood but is eventually forced, by
circumstances and the prodding of a patriotic son, to take up the
musket. At 2 hours and 40 minutes, it is the most epic in scope of
the three big movies scheduled to open in time for the Independence
Day weekend, probably the most competitive weekend of the summer.
(The others are ``The Perfect Storm'' and ``The Adventures of Rocky
and Bullwinkle.'')
</P>
<P>
   This holiday promises to be particularly lucrative because it
falls on a Tuesday. The long Fourth of July holiday weekend is
always a major period at the box office, with big films often
opening the previous Wednesday (``The Patriot'' opens on Wednesday,
the other films on Friday) and running strongly through the
weekend. But with the holiday on a Tuesday, there is a strong
chance that the moviegoing will continue at a holiday pace for two
extra days, providing a movie that opens the previous Wednesday
with a full week of holiday weekend box-office steam.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gordon, one of the movie's three producers (there were also
three executive producers and two associate producers), said he
remembered sitting down with Rodat, with whom he has worked on
several films, right after the release of ``Saving Private Ryan''
and trying to decide what backdrop they would choose for their next
project. ``Bob mentioned the American Revolution,'' Gordon said,
``and we both thought, yes, this was something that hadn't been
seen in a while, something that would feel fresh to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodat and Gordon sold the idea for the film to Columbia Pictures
and developed the screenplay over 18 months. Initially they thought
they would use an actual historical figure (Francis Marion, the
legendary Swamp Fox, who bedeviled British troops from the marshes
of the coastal Carolinas), but eventually they turned their
character into an amalgam of several guerrilla fighters from the
Southern campaign, most particularly Andrew Pickens, who, like
Gibson's character, had a large family and tried to stay out of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like watching big-canvas movies and I enjoy writing them,
but the essence of a big-canvas movie has to be a tiny story,''
Rodat said. ``That's certainly what David Lean taught us. So I find
when I'm writing a big, sweeping sort of screenplay, I am wearing
two hats. I'm the miniaturist and the painter of the big canvas,
all at the same time. I must write something that has scope and
scale, but at the same time has that little human window that
allows us to enter that big world.''
</P>
<P>
   A Nod to Wireless
</P>
<P>
   When executives from the French conglomerate Vivendi announced
this week that they were purchasing Seagram and its Universal
Studios, they hung their future prospects upon the economic
viability of the coming generation of wireless hand-held devices
that many in Hollywood believe will be the entertainment industry's
next big thing.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi's device, called Vizzavi (as in vis-a-vis), is just one
of many being developed in hopes that people will very soon be able
to connect to the Internet from wherever they are, without phone
lines, to download music, video games, short films, television-like
programs and even, some think, feature films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absolutely true that wireless is going to be
big,'' said John Hegeman, who has long straddled the worlds of the
Web and the movie industry, first helping put together Internet
marketing campaigns for films, including last summer's ``Blair
Witch Project,'' and now as a partner with Joe Roth, a former
Disney executive, in Distantcorners.com, an Internet entertainment
site aimed at young science-fiction and horror fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd say it's going to be something more like a radio or a
portable television set than a portable movie theater,'' he said.
While Hegeman said he could certainly see people whipping out their
hand-held devices to watch a five-minute short, or check the news,
or send e-mail, he has a harder time imagining that many people
will want to watch big Hollywood movies on something that can fit
into their hand.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the results, there is certainly growing ferment in
Hollywood over how the Internet will affect the way movies are
distributed. This is, of course, a matter of some concern to those
who have based their strategies on the long-established way of
doing things, in which movies are first released in theaters and
only then sent out to subsidiary venues like television and
videotape. Will the Internet somehow threaten the primacy of the
theatrical release?
</P>
<P>
   In part to bolster this theatrical primacy, the Academy of
Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences issued a statement this week
clarifying its rules about what films are eligible to compete for
the Academy Awards, making it clear that only those films that have
their first showings in a Los Angeles movie theater can compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board just wants to make it crystal clear so that in the
rush to embrace new technologies, a legitimate theatrical motion
picture doesn't inadvertently jeopardize its eligibility,'' said
Bruce Davis, the academy's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if Universal or any other studio decides in the
future to release a film initially on the Internet _ perhaps to
show off some new technological advance _ the film will be treated
in the same way as one shown for the first time on television.
</P>
<P>
   In response, IFilm, one of the leading companies offering
streaming video on the Internet, scrambled and put together a deal
with the AMC theater chain to allow some of Ifilm's shorts to be
shown to paying audiences for three consecutive days in a Los
Angeles cinema before being released on the Web. This is all that
is required to qualify for the Oscars, said IFilm's chairman, Kevin
Wendle.
</P>
<P>
   The official 73rd Academy Awards booklet will be sent to members
in early August. If you want to mark your calendar, nominations for
films released in 2000 will be announced on Feb. 13 and the Oscar
ceremonies will be, once again, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los
Angeles on March 25. &QL;

 &HT;    Croupier can't keep his distance as temptation builds
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Pity the poor casino croupiers. They watch
impassively, hour after hour, as customers lose vast sums of money,
grow hostile and hurl abuse. From their bosses, they must endure
the assumption that they are untrustworthy and dishonest. Of
course, much of the time, the bosses are absolutely right.
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Manfred is not your run-of-the-mill casino drone. He
tells us in the even-toned voice-over narration of Mike Hodges'
cerebral little thriller ``Croupier'' that he is not drawn to
gamble. He is content to be an observer of life rather than a
participant. After all, he keeps reminding himself, the only reason
he is dealing blackjack and working a roulette wheel is to gather
material for his long-sought novel.
</P>
<P>
   But in the course of this well-observed, low-key morality play,
Jack and his ethical compass will be sorely tested. Slowly and
inexorably, we come to understand just how human he is beneath his
emotionless exterior.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the lavish fantasy world of Las Vegas. ``Croupier''
exists in the cramped, tawdry gaming clubs of London, a domain that
screenwriter Paul Meyersberg understands and director Hodges (''Get
Carter'') captures in all its paranoid glory.
</P>
<P>
   Strapped for cash, Jack goes against his instincts when his
father calls and tips him off to a croupier job at the Golden Lion
casino. And from the way Jack manipulates the chips at his
interview, he evidently has a history of being around casinos. On
his shift, he looks robotically dispassionate, but from his
thoughts we learn that he is getting hooked again, taking vicarious
enjoyment from watching players lose. As Jack, Clive Owen
understands the value of a poker face. His performance is
understated in the extreme, but it is right for the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Croupier'' defies most expectations of conventional thrillers,
but Jack's downfall still comes at the hands of seductive women.
When deciding whom not to trust, be wary of Bella (Kate Hardie),
the dealer who undresses too casually in the unisex locker room and
breaks fraternization rules by seducing Jack. Be suspicious of Jani
(''ER''s Alex Kingston), more adept at gambling than she lets on,
who will woo Jack into scamming the casino.
</P>
<P>
   And while you are at it, watch out for Jack's live-in fiancee
Marion (''Notting Hill's'' Gina McKee), who far prefers the
romantic notion of marrying a novelist than a croupier.
</P>
<P>
   As his novel progresses, Jack starts thinking like his dealer
alter ego Jake, a literary conceit that never has much dramatic
payoff. Gradually, perhaps inevitably, ``Croupier `` reduces down
to being about the casino scam and the question of who is behind
it.
</P>
<P>
   The gritty texture of the film and Jack/Jake's deadpan narration
both prove more satisfying than the plot's wrap-up, so enjoy the
verbal and visual atmosphere as it wends its way to the conclusion.
``Croupier'' needs more of a knockout punch line, but for an icy,
dark, yet harshly lit tale, this is a bet worth taking.

MONASTERIES OFFER ROOMS, MEALS AND REMARKABLE HOSPITALITY TO WEARY
TRAVELERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   PAGANI, Italy _ The server in the simple dining room of our
hotel set down our first course _ expertly cooked penne tossed with
prosciutto, olive oil and freshly shaved Parmesan _ and looked at
us expectantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vino?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   We just stared at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahhh ... wine?'' she said, groping for the English word,
assuming we hadn't understood.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, we'd heard her; we just hadn't believed her, just as
we couldn't believe the courses she kept bringing: A salad of
tender butter lettuce, dressed in a fresh lemon vinaigrette; thin
pan-fried pork steaks, with more lemon; crusty Italian bread;
eggplant and portobello mushrooms sauteed with a touch of balsamic
vinegar. Fresh tangerines and strong coffee with real cream. And a
chaser of iced ``limoncello,'' the locally produced lemon liqueur.
</P>
<P>
   This was a monastery?
</P>
<P>
   True, the Monastero di Santa Maria della Purita in Pagani, near
Naples, wasn't a five-star hotel _ our upstairs double room
resembled a Catholic boarding school, circa 1970, and it would have
been unbearably cold if the staff hadn't thoughtfully hauled in an
ancient space heater. But for $22 a night apiece _ including two
meals _ we weren't about to complain.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder more American travelers in Italy, and to a lesser
extent the rest of Europe, are catching on to this centuries-old
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who are looking for a different way to experience
Italy, this is the perfect niche,'' says Eileen Barish, author of
``The Guide to Lodging in Italy's Monasteries'' (Anacapa Press;
$22.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're inexpensive, you know you will be safe, you know the
innkeepers will be respectful ... and some of them are in the most
gorgeous locations and the most gorgeous old buildings you could
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   In Italy alone, there are at least 500 inns, apartments or
full-fledged hotels run by religious orders _ everything from
converted 13th-century castles to modern 1960s-style high-rises to
country villas to a four-star hotel on the Italian Riviera. The
majority accept both male and female guests without regard to
denomination, and charge just enough to cover their costs or
perhaps make a small profit.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition dates back hundreds of years, says Barish,
beginning when friars traveling to see family or make pilgrimages
were invited to stay at monasteries along the way. The monasteries
and convents eventually expanded to take in other guests;
Europeans, especially families and singles, have traveled this way
for decades, Barish says.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, however, were slow to catch on, partly because
information was hard to find. Italy's tourism organizations don't
offer much help in finding such lodging; insiders say that's
because they're pressured not to by commercial hotels, which see
the religious institutions as competition. There was little
information in English until Barish's book and another similar
guide came out, both, coincidentally, last year.
</P>
<P>
   The other guidebook, ``Bed and Blessings Italy: A Guide to
Convents and Monasteries Available for Overnight Lodging'' (Paulist
Press; $16.95), was written by American mother-daughter team Anne
and June Walsh, who took three long trips to Italy to research the
book, staying at a number of convents. (The Walshes are currently
working on similar guides for the United Kingdom, France and the
Middle East.)
</P>
<P>
   The word is getting around. In Rome, for instance, I met a group
of three American women traveling across northern Italy this way;
they were staying in a convent near the Vatican, perfect for
touring the papal state. The rooms were often a bit austere, they
said, but the hosts and hostesses had been gracious and helpful.
And nowhere had they paid more than $30 apiece, a true bargain in
cities where even the simplest ``pensione'' can charge at least
$50.
</P>
<P>
   If the positives are obvious, so are the negatives. Some
convents and monasteries have curfews. Most rooms are on the simple
side; some don't even supply towels and sheets, much less shampoo
and soap. You probably won't have a TV or a phone. Sometimes, baths
are down the hall and must be shared with other guests. And the
inns are often run by nuns, monks or priests who have other duties
and may lack the tourism expertise you'd get at a similar-size
hotel. You may not find many people who speak English, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even with the new guides, finding a room at a convent
or missionary when and where you want it will take some legwork;
some fill up with groups, others close for the winter or for entire
months in the summer. But those who are persistent _ and a bit
lucky _ can find a whole new way to see Italy.
</P>
<P>
   After our first attempt at staying at a convent, we were not
sure it was a way we were going to like.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   My friend Nichele and I had booked a room in an apartment owned
by a small order of nuns in Scala, a tiny town perched on the top
of a hillside on the Amalfi coast, with beautiful views of the
lemon groves and terra-cotta-roofed villas tumbling down to the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cold day, spitting sleet and snow, when we arrived in
the village to find the convent, which proved not so easy to
locate. It was not well-marked, and no one answered the door the
first time we knocked. Our cab driver kindly drove us up and down
the town's main street, going with us to knock on doors until we
finally found a priest who figured out what we wanted. It took more
than an hour of inept charades and mangled Italian before we were
settled.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment, which was next to a small, friendly inn where we
could take our meals, was clean and spacious and stocked with
towels and linens. But its other amenities were sparse. It was
dimly lit, the hot water worked only sporadically, and though the
heaters made a great deal of noise, we never coaxed them to produce
any actual heat. After dinner, we pulled all the extra blankets off
the unused beds and went to sleep wearing our coats and gloves. We
woke up considering canceling that night's reservation in a second
monastery.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, that second institution, the Monastero di
Santa Maria della Purita, did not seem to hold much more promise.
It was located in the nondescript town of Pagani, part of the vast
urban sprawl surrounding Mount Vesuvius and the ruins of Pompeii.
Again, we found it only by accident, having jumped off the bus at
the wrong spot and thus being forced to ask passersby for
directions. From the outside, with its ornate but weathered facade
stuck in a not-very-prosperous-looking strip of clothing stores,
shoe shops and small groceries, the place looked a little cold and
run-down.
</P>
<P>
   But inside, we were pleasantly surprised. The 18th-century
monastery was built around a courtyard filled with green tropical
plants, lemon trees and wrought-iron furniture. As we reached the
end of the hallway, we were greeted by the director, who dispatched
assistants to help us to our room and to inquire when we wanted to
eat dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms themselves were small and simple _ plain twin beds,
crucifixes, a simple but clean private bathroom, and an unadorned
particleboard desk. The tiled hallways were much more interesting,
filled with dark antique furniture, religious paintings and,
downstairs, a large, old-fashioned birdcage filled with parakeets.
The dining room was reminiscent of a private-college dining hall _
plain wooden tables were covered with utilitarian plastic covers
over the white tablecloths, glass-fronted wooden cabinets held
large numbers of glasses and china, and a large TV sat unused.
</P>
<P>
   But the food, and the service, were excellent. Dinner took
nearly two hours, partly because our young servers kept pressing us
with more food and more red wine from bottles labeled with the
monastery's name, and partly because assorted nuns, priests and
other workers kept stopping in to check on us. No one spoke any
more English than we spoke Italian _ which is to say, none of us
had a clue what the other was saying _ but everyone was cheerful,
and intent on making us eat and drink more.
</P>
<P>
   After joining us for shots of ``limoncello,'' the director
proudly insisted on showing us through the monastery. The order was
locally famous for nativity scenes _ the monks collect them from
around the world, and half a dozen large glass cases are filled
with Christmas sets from more than 30 countries. The Dutch ones
featured windmills; Nigerian ones depicted Joseph and Mary wearing
kente cloth; the Chinese ones had a pagoda in the background. There
were sets from France, from Brazil, from Japan and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   But outside was the real centerpiece. Each winter, the monks
create a vast dollhouse-scale nativity scene in six massive
tableaux, complete with moving angels, intricate hand-built street
scenes, piped-in music and fake blowing snow. It took them more
than a month to build; they kept it up until February so that
everyone in town could enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, after we'd enjoyed a quiet (and warm) night's
sleep, the director insisted on driving us to the train station; we
were headed to Rome and a night at a commercial three-star hotel.
Just the day before, we couldn't wait to get back to a ``real''
hotel. Now we finally understood why rooms in religious houses have
appealed to travelers for centuries.

`REPATRIATION' BECOMES A DEALER'S COUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, France, Switzerland)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Auction houses may make a lot of news but they don't score all
the coups in acquiring private collections to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Mallett, the 135-year-old London antiques dealer, recently
snared a major collection of neoclassical English furniture from an
American Anglophile who decided to ``repatriate'' his antiques.
They went on view in Mallett's Bond Street gallery last week in an
exhibition titled ``The Age of Matthew Boulton: Masterpieces of
Neoclassicism.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes works by Robert Adam (1728-1792), the
architect and designer of country houses in England and Scotland;
the royal cabinetmakers Mayhew &AMP; Ince (circa 1770); and Matthew
Boulton (1728-1809), a lesser-known designer who was called the
``master of English ormolu.''
</P>
<P>
   The consigner wants to remain anonymous, said Lanto Synge, chief
executive of Mallett. ``We've known him for a long time,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   For the past 30 years he has acquired from us, at auction and
all sorts of places. He is an industrialist who is approaching
retirement. He has been very discerning, even persnickety. He built
up a collection of superlative standards and condition. Now he is
having a change of direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes a pair of torcheres that Adam supplied
for the Earl of Bathurst, the first owner of Apsley House in
London, which was donated to the Duke of Wellington after he
defeated Napoleon. Adam designed the interiors of Apsley House, now
open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition reminds visitors how neoclassical taste goes in
and out of style. As Synge put it, ``It seems to have come in waves
ever since the Renaissance.'' After the discovery of Herculaneum in
the 1700s, designers from England, France, Sweden and even America
flocked to Italy for inspiration. Adam went to sketch temples,
tombs, monuments and the walls of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Those
motifs then showed up in his design repertory. ``Adam was the
greatest Grand Tourist of them all,'' Synge said.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's George III giltwood and gesso torcheres and candelabra,
from about 1780, are in the exhibition. They have triangular
plinths on claw feet, with oval medallions depicting women in
classical dress playing music. The corners have ram heads. Seated
griffins are separated by a classical urn.
</P>
<P>
   Another Adam piece is a stand he designed for his friend George
Keate. It is made of tulipwood and satinwood, to complement a
precious 1711 Italian pietra-dura medals cabinet that Keate had
bought in Rome. The small oak box has ebony veneers inset with
colorful hardstone fruits and flowers. On the top, a toucan perches
on a cherry branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few miniature jewel-like boxes like this,''
Synge said, ``and we know Adam designed its stand because we found
his drawing for this very piece in the Sir John Soane Museum.'' The
museum has 9,000 Adam drawings, which Soane bought from Adam's
daughters years after his death, when they desperately needed the
money.
</P>
<P>
   The stand is in Adam's Etruscan style, with neoclassical motifs
on an ebony ground. Each side has a frieze with a pair of ormolu
griffins flanking a vase. Beneath are ormolu laurel swags and bows.
``There was a big following for neoclassical taste in the late
1700s,'' Synge said. ``But Adam was its grandest proponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallett is selling an equally neoclassical George III rolltop
desk attributed to the fashionable London cabinetmakers Mayhew &AMP;
Ince, contemporaries of Adam. The ladylike rolltop was made about
1775. The frieze on the front of the single drawer also has
griffins, but they are done in penwork, on partridgewood panels.
The tambour top has satinwood and yew bands decorated with inlaid
wavy lines. The four tapering legs are decorated with zigzag,
so-called shark-tooth marquetry. It was on loan to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art until January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayhew &AMP; Ince probably invented the rolltop desk,'' Synge
said. ``There are two or three known, but this is the greatest one.
It must have been inspired by the French cylinder desk.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had unearthed some of the desk's history: ``It was
acquired by Archibald, fifth Earl of Rosebery, and his wife, Hannah
de Rothschild, of Mentmore, in 1875. Lord Dalmeny, Rosebery's heir,
looked it up for us in the family records and found the bill _ it
was (PS)500.''
</P>
<P>
   England was suffering through an agricultural depression at the
time, and land prices had collapsed. ``The Roseberys took advantage
of the dispersal of collections formed during the 18th century,''
Synge said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Earl of Rosebery (1847-1929) had his own financial
concerns. Synge said he had insisted on inserting a proviso into
the bill for the desk, which was an expensive piece of furniture
even then. The earl was a famous horse breeder. He stipulated that
he could forfeit the desk and return it if his racehorse did not
win the English Derby that year. Fortunately for the cabinetmakers,
the horse won and he paid his bill. Mallett is asking about
$983,000 for the desk.
</P>
<P>
   Mallett is also selling 20 pieces by Boulton, a 19th-century
engineer from the Midlands of England who was a pioneer in the
development of early locomotives and made a fortune. At some point
he decided he would design items like clocks and candelabra in
bronze gilded to look like solid gold.
</P>
<P>
   Because Boulton was an engineer, not a classicist, his
``repertoire of ornament was drawn from books, models borrowed from
other makers, plaster casts, other artifacts, architects, indeed
from anywhere and anyone,'' Nicholas Goodison writes in the Mallett
catalog. ``He set out to rival the French bronziers.'' It is rare
to have 20 pieces on display at one time, according to Mallett.
</P>
<P>
   One perfume burner has a plinth with a medallion showing an
allegory of the death of Adonis. Beneath it, a mourning Venus and
crying Cupid are putting out the Flame of Love, as a Dove of Peace
looks on, perched on a quiver of arrows. Another piece, a clock,
shows a gilded Minerva in armor and helmet, carrying a spear. The
shield of Medusa rests at her feet.
</P>
<P>
   Boulton works can often be identified because he used local
stones with his ormolu mounts. He especially liked Derbyshire
``blue john,'' a type of amethyst fluorspar. But the Boulton story
has an unhappy ending. ``He tried to cash into the luxury market
and ended up going bust,'' Synge said. ``But he did great work.''
Proust Galleys
</P>
<P>
   The 52 long-lost galley sheets for Proust's ``Swann's Way,''
auctioned at Christie's in London on June 7, sold for $1,012,218, a
world record at auction for a work of French literature. The buyer
was the Martin Bodmer Collection in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Felix de Marez-Oyens, director of Christie's international book
department, said the manuscript was acquired for the Martin Bodmer
collection at the Bibliotecca Bodmericana, a library in
French-speaking Switzerland, which will make it available to
literary scholars.

 By MARY DEJEVSKY  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore launched a broadside against
the oil companies Wednesday, accusing them of ``oil-gouging and
price-fixing.'' His accusations added to the outcry from America's
car-dependent consumers and electioneering politicians about the
sharply rising price of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, he said that he was ``extremely
concerned about the conduct of the oil companies that may have led
to these unreasonable price increases.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures, Gore said, showed that oil company profits
had increased by as much as 500 percent in the first part of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Without waiting for the FTC's findings, he said: ``These
enormous and unreasonable profits suggest that big oil is gouging
American consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The worry for Gore as the Democratic presidential candidate is
twofold. Price rises through last autumn and winter were almost
uniform across the country, drawing complaints from the more
northerly states that use large quantities of heating oil, as well
as from states like California and Virginia with large numbers of
long-distance car commuters, not to speak of truck drivers all over
America.
</P>
<P>
   Recent fuel price rises, however, have been especially sharp in
the Midwest, in and around cities such as Chicago and Milwaukee,
where the price of gas has reached the almost unimaginable (to an
American) heights of two dollars a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, the price across the United States was only
just over one dollar, dipping in some places in some weeks even
below that.
</P>
<P>
   The big Midwestern states are widely regarded as the ground on
which November's presidential election will be won or lost. Gore is
currently running neck and neck with his Republican rival, George
W. Bush, in such key swing states as Illinois and Ohio _ which Bill
Clinton won for the Democrats last time around.
</P>
<P>
   Bush must be careful how he handles the oil price issue; much of
the Bush family's wealth derives from oil, and any conclusion that
U.S. oil companies, as opposed to ``foreigners,'' have been
profiteering could have an adverse effect on his electoral chances.
</P>
<P>
   The greater danger, though, is to Gore. While the rise in gas
prices, if not stemmed soon, could damage his prospects in the
crucial Midwest, they could also have a knock-on effect on the
economy generally, as truckers find their margins shrinking and the
price of road distribution and delivery raises prices generally.
</P>
<P>
   The country's current economic well-being is a pillar of Gore's
election strategy; ``prosperity and progress'' was the slogan
chosen to headline his three-week campaign swing across the United
States that ends next week.
</P>
<P>
   But some signs of an economic slowdown _ fewer house sales,
fewer new housing starts, a slight fall in imports and a similarly
slight decline in orders in some parts of the country _ are already
appearing.
</P>
<P>
   If higher oil prices compound the subduing effect of recent
interest rate rises, Gore's claim to a record of ultra-successful
economic stewardship could start to ring very hollow. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore launched a broadside against
the oil companies Wednesday, accusing them of ``oil-gouging and
price-fixing.'' His accusations added to the outcry from America's
car-dependent consumers and electioneering politicians about the
sharply rising price of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, he said that he was ``extremely
concerned about the conduct of the oil companies that may have led
to these unreasonable price increases.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures, Gore said, showed that oil company profits
had increased by as much as 500 percent in the first part of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Without waiting for the FTC's findings, he said: ``These
enormous and unreasonable profits suggest that big oil is gouging
American consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The worry for Gore as the Democratic presidential candidate is
twofold. Price rises through last autumn and winter were almost
uniform across the country, drawing complaints from the more
northerly states that use large quantities of heating oil, as well
as from states like California and Virginia with large numbers of
long-distance car commuters, not to speak of truck drivers all over
America.
</P>
<P>
   Recent fuel price rises, however, have been especially sharp in
the Midwest, in and around cities such as Chicago and Milwaukee,
where the price of gas has reached the almost unimaginable (to an
American) heights of two dollars a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, the price across the United States was only
just over one dollar, dipping in some places in some weeks even
below that.
</P>
<P>
   The big Midwestern states are widely regarded as the ground on
which November's presidential election will be won or lost. Gore is
currently running neck and neck with his Republican rival, George
W. Bush, in such key swing states as Illinois and Ohio _ which Bill
Clinton won for the Democrats last time around.
</P>
<P>
   Bush must be careful how he handles the oil price issue; much of
the Bush family's wealth derives from oil, and any conclusion that
U.S. oil companies, as opposed to ``foreigners,'' have been
profiteering could have an adverse effect on his electoral chances.
</P>
<P>
   The greater danger, though, is to Gore. While the rise in gas
prices, if not stemmed soon, could damage his prospects in the
crucial Midwest, they could also have a knock-on effect on the
economy generally, as truckers find their margins shrinking and the
price of road distribution and delivery raises prices generally.
</P>
<P>
   The country's current economic well-being is a pillar of Gore's
election strategy; ``prosperity and progress'' was the slogan
chosen to headline his three-week campaign swing across the United
States that ends next week.
</P>
<P>
   But some signs of an economic slowdown _ fewer house sales,
fewer new housing starts, a slight fall in imports and a similarly
slight decline in orders in some parts of the country _ are already
appearing.
</P>
<P>
   If higher oil prices compound the subduing effect of recent
interest rate rises, Gore's claim to a record of ultra-successful
economic stewardship could start to ring very hollow. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To us, it has become almost a forgotten war, but not
so to Baghdad and to the regime of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 months now, British and American jets have prowled the
skies over the northern and southern sections of Iraq every day and
routinely let fly bombs and missiles on to targets below.
</P>
<P>
   This steady punishment of Iraq _ calculated to amount roughly to
one attack every three days _ has been going on since December
1998. That is when Hussein decided to challenge the no-fly zones
imposed nearly 10 years ago by the West, by firing at the allied
planes that are dispatched to patrol them.
</P>
<P>
   Since December 1998, the air combat in the zones has become most
intense. According to the Iraqis, British and American planes have
penetrated their air space 21,600 times.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, people can hear their screeching, but cannot seem
them. The pilots fly always at a safe altitude of 20,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely are the tragic human consequences reported. A
correspondent for The Washington Post wrote last week of the fate
of Omran Harbi Jawair, 13. He was watching his family's sheep on
May 17 when a missile landed within feet of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without warning, according to several youths standing nearby,
the device came crashing down in an open field,'' the reporter,
Edward Cody, wrote. ``Four shepherds were wounded. And Omran, the
others recalled, lay dead in the dirt, most of his head torn off,
the white of his robe stained red.''
</P>
<P>
   While the orders from London and Washington are to destroy those
weapons that threaten the planes, the toll in lost Iraqi lives
continues to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is, meanwhile, stepping up its rhetoric, decrying the
attacks and demanding that they be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi estimates, which have been partially confirmed by an
independent United Nations survey, suggest that some 300 Iraqis
have been killed and another 800 injured in the 18 months of
intense bombings. Iraq says that at least two-thirds of those
killed have been civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant-General Yassin Jasem, the Iraqi military spokesman,
Thursday ridiculed as false the claims by the U.S. and Britain that
their planes attack only in response to threats against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``American officials are nowadays producing lies in order to
cover their failure and daily crimes in the so-called two no-fly
zones,'' he declared at a news briefing in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The zones themselves were created in the aftermath of the 1991
Gulf War to protect minority Shia Muslims in the south of Iraq and
a Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq from attack by Saddam's military
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says that nearly 280,000 sorties have been flown
over the areas by American and British planes in the almost
decade-long period of enforcing the no-fly order. &QL;

NEW AND NOTEWORTHY FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies. Ratings and running times are in
parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   ``BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE,'' starring Martin Lawrence. Directed by
Raja Gosnell (PG-13, 97 minutes). This fitfully amusing film,
starring the comic whirligig Lawrence, could best be described as
``Stakeout'' goes ghetto, with a touch of ``Tootsie'' for flava _
er, flavor. Lawrence plays Malcolm, an FBI agent with a penchant
for doing undercover work in full body makeup. Here he impersonates
Big Momma, a stubborn old Southern woman. Why? Big Momma's
granddaughter is on the run because her ex-boyfriend, Lester, a
murderous bank robber, has escaped from prison. Malcolm believes he
can use her to get to Lester. This isn't much of a movie; it looks
like a series of baseball card shots and may have the worst rhythms
ever in a film directed by a former editor (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``DINOSAUR,'' with the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard and
Ossie Davis. Directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton (PG, 90
minutes). Reputedly the most expensive animated feature ever made,
Disney's showcase of computer animation technology begins with a
breathtaking sequence, a visual and sonic extravaganza that the
rest of the movie never quite lives up to. The story, of a young
dinosaur raised by lemurs who must lead a herd of his fellow
reptiles to safety after an asteroid strikes the earth, is cobbled
from other Disney plots. But the effects _ the dinosaur's movements
and their nearly seamless insertion into real locations _ will
impress skeptical grown-ups. Despite some potentially upsetting
scenes of carnivorous mayhem, the film will delight children (A.O.
Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``FANTASIA/2000,'' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The millennial
version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of animation and
classical music includes seven new segments and keeps one from the
original film (the wonderful ``Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' starring
Mickey Mouse). ``Fantasia/2000'' is more backward-looking than
futuristic. The two best segments are ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty
Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld
set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to Stravinsky's
``Firebird'' Suite), in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around
the globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the
planet's life forms. (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``FREQUENCY,'' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed
by Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ``Back to the Future''
meets ``Field of Dreams'' meets ``It's a Wonderful Life'' meets
``The Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly
sentimental supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Caviezel is
a morose young policeman who makes contact with his dead father, a
firefighter, on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the
accident that cost him his life. The two collaborate on changing
other aspects of the past and on catching a serial killer. There
are enough testosterone tears to soak Shea Stadium (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``GLADIATOR,'' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott
(R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one
bothered to ask: what would happen if someone decided to film the
imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial?
Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in
the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is
admirable but repellent. As the noble Roman general who ends up
fighting for his life, Crowe gives a performance with ball-of-fire
intensity, suffused with a movie star's impatience. He holds the
movie together, such as it is (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``GONE IN 60 SECONDS,'' starring Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi,
Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall. Directed by Dominic Sena (PG-13,
119 minutes). A remake of a movie so insubstantial that its title
seems to refer the length of time it would linger in memory. Cage,
who has gone prematurely blond, is the world's best car thief,
dragged out of his apparently lucrative go-cart business and
returns to auto theft to save the life of his brother ( Ribisi).
With a magnetic cast of crooks and cops, it's mindless hot-rodding
entertainment, a film so glossy and impersonal that you will
sympathize more with the cars than the people (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``HAMLET,'' starring Ethan Hawke and Liev Schreiber. Directed by
Michael Almereyda (R, 112 minutes). Almereyda has rooted his
voluptuous and rewarding new adaptation of Shakespeare's play in
today's Manhattan. The city's contradictions of beauty and squalor
give the movie a sense of place, and New York becomes a complex
character in this vital and sharply intelligent film. Often shaded
in lush, soothing hues of blue, ``Hamlet'' exudes an intoxicating
masochism in which half the cast is battling despondency and the
other half has the glint of imminent insanity. Here the melancholy
of Hamlet ( Hawke) over the death of his father is almost a state
of grace: it gives him a sense of purpose that the other characters
lack. The director's rigorous trimming has a boldness and vivacity
that make this version exhilarating while leaving Shakespeare's
language and intent intact (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``HIGH FIDELITY,'' starring John Cusack, Jill Peterson, Iben
Hjejle and Joan Cusack. Directed by Stephen Frears (R, 107
minutes). Although its setting has been moved from London to
Chicago, the screen adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling 1995
novel is wonderfully true to the spirit of the book. Cusack has one
of his juiciest roles in Rob, a 30-something record store manager
and vinyl fanatic sorting through the ``Top 5'' breakups in his
disastrous romantic history while trying to salvage his latest
relationship. The movie hilariously captures the mind-set of
not-so-young men for whom pop music is a kind of religion and hip
musical taste an ultimate measure of a person's worth (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST,'' starring Kenneth Branagh, Nathan Lane,
Matthew Lillard, Alessandro Nivola and Alicia Silverstone. Directed
by Branagh (PG, 95 minutes). Branagh has decided, for no particular
reason, to festoon an early Shakespeare comedy with classic show
tunes and classic Technicolor movie-musical cinematography. His
cast consists mainly of attractive young movie actors, most of whom
are not terribly adept at singing, dancing or reciting Shakespeare.
But the stumbling amateurism is not without charm. Branagh throws
it all together with the gusto of a man playing a tuba with a bass
drum strapped to his back while his pet monkey leaps around with a
squeeze box. It's not art exactly, or even music, but it's
occasionally entertaining (Scott).

 UNDATED: entertaining (Scott.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``M:I-2,'' starring Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton and Sir Anthony
Hopkins. Directed by John Woo (PG-13, 120 minutes). Cruise returns
as the daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt in Woo's loud, flashy,
incoherent new blockbuster. The film is jampacked with movie
references _ to Hitchcock, to the first ``Mission: Impossible''
movie and to Woo's superior Hong Kong action films _ but it's at
once overheated and flat. The plot, involving killer viruses, is
baffling rather than twisty. The introduction of a love interest (
Newton) who also happens to be the bad guy's ex-girlfriend adds an
element of melodrama that's more grating than affecting. Some good
car chases and explosions, though (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``SHAFT,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey
Wright, Christian Bale, Toni Collette, Richard Roundtree and Mekhi
Phifer. The always dependable and indomitable Jackson stars as John
Shaft, nephew of the seminal freelance crime fighter ( Roundtree).
A Manhattan police detective when introduced, Shaft leaves the
force to bring to justice a wealthy, heartless WASP racist ( Bale)
who has beaten a black man ( Phifer) to death. Aware that racial
politics have changed since the 1971 original, the picture wants to
trade on the not-so-subtle differences between stereotype and
archetype, and breaks a sweat trying to shatter each. When
``Shaft'' scores at the box office, it will be a cheap,
opportunistic victory, but an enjoyable one (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``SHANGHAI NOON,'' starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson.
Directed by Tom Dey (PG-13, 110 minutes). Chan is one of the great
physical comedians, and this martial arts western spoof is a
high-spirited, marvelously silly showcase for his talents. Chan
plays Chon Wang, an Imperial Guard dispatched from Beijing to the
Old West to rescue a princess played by Lucy Liu. But the heart of
the movie is the interplay between Chan and Wilson, who depicts his
inept outlaw sidekick with goofy, spacey charm. After the glum
bullying of ``Gladiator'' and the noisy bombast of ``M:I-2,'' it's
refreshing to see a movie so good-natured, so confident in its
ability to provoke not queasy awe or numb exhaustion but pure
delight (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``SUNSHINE,'' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer
Ehle, Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R,
180 minutes). In Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history,
Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family _
grandfather, father and son _ who endure the corruption of the
Austro-Hungarian empire, the viciousness of fascism and the
brutality of Communism. Fiennes' performances, and those of Ehle
and Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life)
help save the film from melodramatic excess. ``Sunshine'' is a
serious, humane and thought-provoking attempt to make sense of
complicated and painful historical experiences (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``TITAN A.E.'' With the voices of Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore and
Bill Pullman. Directed by Don Bluth and Gary Coleman (PG, 90
minutes). This animated sci-fi fantasy, set in the 31st century,
imagines that Earth has been destroyed by aliens and what is left
of humanity is scattered about the universe in drifter colonies.
Guided by a magic ring left to him by his father, Cale ( Damon), a
teen-age space explorer, searches for the Titan, a hidden spaceship
with the key to humanity's future. The technology is innovative,
and there are some gorgeous special effects. But the screenplay and
characters are too bland for the story to catch fire (Holden)
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571,'' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Jon Bon
Jovi, David Keith and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow
(PG-13, 120 minutes). Mostow, whose previous film, ``Breakdown,''
was a marvel of B-picture minimalism, shifts from the wide-open
spaces to the cramped interior of a World War II submarine movie.
McConaughey, whose knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he
were cramming for finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a
Nazi code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and
his crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they have hijacked. Mostow
does a fine job of building tension, given that he is working in a
minor genre whose climactic notes you will know if you have ever
seen a movie set on a sub (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE VIRGIN SUICIDES,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, James Woods and
Kathleen Turner. Directed by Sofia Coppola (R, 97 minutes).
Coppola's directorial debut, adapted from Jeffrey Eugenides' 1993
novel about the self-destruction of five sisters in a 1970s
Michigan suburb, shows her to be a filmmaker with fine visual and
emotional instincts, adept at matching the book's hypnotic, sensual
black humor. The movie's best moments have an inspired feeling of
playfulness and freedom matched by Dunst's smart, beguiling
performance as Lux Lisbon, whose sexual awakening propels her and
her sisters to their doom. But despite Coppola's keen instincts,
and the beautifully understated acting of Woods and Turner as the
Lisbon parents, ``The Virgin Suicides'' is marred by the
self-conscious aestheticism and emotional detachment of its source
(Scott).

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Butler, the outspoken Australian who led the
United Nations efforts to strip Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction after the Gulf War, says he fears that Iraq has used
the 18 months without U.N. monitors to rearm.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been under sanctions since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
but in an interview with the Independent, Butler said that Iraq had
exploited divisions among the five U.N. Security Council permanent
members _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has even ensured that ``Saddam has a veto at the Council
table'' by insisting that Iraq must approve of the future
inspection procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence from Iraq of such (disarmament) work should be a
source of grave concern,'' says Butler.
</P>
<P>
   If the Big Five U.N. members are united, then military action
should not be necessary to enforce international law, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who has just published a book ``Saddam Defiant'' on his
own frustrating experience as top weapons inspector, said that
``The world will never be the same'' if a missile loaded with nerve
gas were to hit Tel Aviv, a single canister of VX nerve gas were
released into the New York City subway system, or a single nuclear
explosion hollowed out central London.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is now faced with a tough policy decision on Iraq in the
coming weeks when the new disarmament body prepares to test Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's willingness to allow intrusive
inspections aimed at ensuring that he has given up the capacity to
build weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq defies U.N. provisions by refusing entry to the U.N.
inspectors, the Security Council will once again have to decide
whether to take military action to force the sanctions-hit country
to comply with international law.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's last refusal to cooperate with UNSCOM inspectors led by
Butler prompted the United States and Britain to launch Operation
Desert Fox in December 1998. The two countries have kept up a
low-level bombing campaign in allied-patrolled ``no-fly'' zones
since that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a crunch in August,'' Butler predicted.
</P>
<P>
   That is when UNMOVIC, the new organization which he describes as
the ``sickly son of UNSCOM,'' will have recruited and trained up
its politically- and geographically-correct team of experts.
</P>
<P>
   They were mandated by the Security Council last December to
complete the elimination of Iraqi nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons, and long-range missiles capable of striking Iraq's
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM fell apart in the aftermath of Desert Fox, which split
the Security Council, amid accusations that UNSCOM was being used
by the U.S. and Israel for spying purposes, and was disturbing
Iraqi sensibilities through its ``cowboy'' methods.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, backed by Russia and China, continues to insist that it
has already complied with U.N. disarmament requirements and that
sanctions should be lifted forthwith. Baghdad has also warned that
it will not cooperate with UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
   Once the UNMOVIC teams, now led by former IAEA chief Hans Blix,
are up and running at the end of August, the Security Council will
have to decide whether to force the issue by attempting to send
them back to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who is now diplomat in residence at the Council for
Foreign Relations in New York, says that Britain will come under
huge pressure in the Security Council from the Russians and
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will call for a shift in policy, then they can get
UNMOVIC in,'' he says. ``Russia, China and France say first lift
the sanctions on the promise to let the monitors in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice for the West is: will they take Iraq's word for
it?... And then the Council will have been conned,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that August is only three months ahead of the U.S.
presidential election, Butler says that the attitude of the other
hard-liner on Iraq in the Security Council cannot be predicted at
this stage.
</P>
<P>
   Washington seems somewhat disengaged on Iraq at present,
according to U.N. diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats commented that Butler may be premature in
predicting a new crisis with Iraq in August, and that the Security
Council may continue to sit on its hands when presented with the
new-look inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The current deadlock, under which Iraq is benefiting from a
loosened oil-for-food humanitarian program while receiving the
occasional bomb from a U.S. or British warplane, may actually
benefit all the players concerned, including Britain and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if the inspectors go back this side of
Christmas,'' one diplomat said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When shareholders of America Online Inc. and Time
Warner Inc. meet Friday morning, they almost certainly will approve
the merger of the media behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   But the combination of one of the world's largest entertainment
and news companies with the No. 1 Internet provider, worth roughly
$120 billion, still needs the approval of the Federal Trade
Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates are pushing those regulators to block the
merger, or at least limit the power of the new media giant. While
AOL predicts it will win regulatory approval by fall, consumer
groups say their battle against the merger is gaining momentum for
two reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ Recent actions by AOL involving its Instant Messager and by
Time Warner involving cable TV programming demonstrate ``that the
companies cannot be trusted to act properly without more rules in
place,'' said Harold Feld, associate director of the Media Access
Project, a non-profit public interest group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _ The European Union is taking a much tougher stance towards
mergers. On Monday, European antitrust authorities announced they
would take as many as four more months to review AOL and Time
Warner, which have extensive operations there. On Tuesday, the
Washington Post reported the EU is likely to scuttle a separate but
somewhat similar merger, that of MCI WorldCom Inc. and Sprint
Corp., because of questions about control of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very heartened by the EU,'' said Jeffrey Chester,
executive director of the Center for Media Education, a non-profit
group in Washington. By taking tough antitrust stands, ``the
Europeans have created a political moment here _ an opportunity to
preserve the vitality of the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL shareholders will meet at 10 a.m. EDT Friday in a hotel not
far from its Dulles, Va., headquarters. Time Warner shareholders
will meet at the same hour in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deal was announced Jan. 10, AOL's stock price has
fallen to $56.50 from $72.69, while Time Warner stock has risen to
$81.4375 from $64.75.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts and corporate executives expect
shareholders to approve the creation of the world's largest media
company, one capable of providing a wealth of proprietary content
to AOL's 23 million subscribers over high-speed Time Warner cable
lines.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what has regulators concerned.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, much of the worry centers on the online delivery of
entertainment. There, AOL has a four-year agreement with
Bertelsmann AG, Germany's largest media company, guaranteeing that
company will have access to AOL as a marketplace for its music,
television and publishing content. By absorbing Time Warner, AOL
also will gain ``preferential access to the leading source of music
publishing rights and music repertoire'' in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Given such advantages, there is a danger AOL will become not
just another competitor in the music industry, but rather the
``gatekeeper in the emerging online music distribution channel,''
the European Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   To appease regulators, AOL has offered some concessions, but the
commission called them ``insufficient'' to ease concerns about
competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, consumer groups, regulators and some
lawmakers are questioning whether AOL Time Warner could monopolize
the Internet by leveraging its position as a high-speed Internet
provider and a marketer of proprietary content and services.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say the key issue is ``open access.'' They
argue that the Internet has grown wildly because its operating
standards allow everyone to use it. For example, a person who gets
access to the Internet through EarthLink Inc. can send e-mail to an
AOL customer.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is seen as moving away from an open model with its
Instant Messager software, which allows users to send quick
messages to people on their ``buddy lists.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC wants Internet companies to establish a standard that
would allow instant message providers to interact. But AOL has
battled hard to prevent competitors, such as Microsoft Corp. and
Tribal Voice Inc., from connecting with AOL Instant Messenger and
AOL's other closed system, ICQ.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, AOL submitted a proposal to an Internet standards
group to create the technical specifications to allow interaction,
but critics still accuse the company of foot-dragging. The FCC has
asked AOL to explain its Instant Messenger policies as part of its
review of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner also stirred up fears about monopolistic tendencies
after it shut down ABC programming for 3.5 million cable
subscribers during a contract dispute this spring. Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
condemned the company's willingness to ``restrict consumer choice
to gain market leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates fear that once AOL and Time Warner put
together immense marketing power with broadband Internet services,
they will kill the open nature of the Internet and reduce consumer
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of an Internet where everyone can connect, they want
to turn it into a private network where their content will be
featured and favored,'' Chester said.

Council may continue to sit on its hands when presented with the
new-look inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The current deadlock, under which Iraq is benefiting from a
loosened oil-for-food humanitarian program while receiving the
occasional bomb from a U.S. or British warplane, may actually
benefit all the players concerned, including Britain and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if the inspectors go back this side of
Christmas,'' one diplomat said. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ With just over a week left before Mexico's
closest-ever presidential election, the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party is stripping down for action and going after
the female vote.
</P>
<P>
   A quintet of buff male dancers pranced in cowboy boots,
strutting their stuff and snapping their thongs for 15,000
shrieking women at a recent political rally on the outskirts of the
capital. The organizers had enticed poor urban housewives out in
record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes were on the message spelled out on the backsides of the
tight boxer shorts worn by ``The Sexy Boys'': VOTE FOR PRI! When
these, too, were cheekily flung away, the screams were almost
supersonic.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these women from the PRI stronghold of Mexico state,
which has 7.5 million potential voters, arrived six hours early to
secure an unobstructed view of the stage.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the dull PRI campaigns of the past. There
was no brass band wheezing tunes while a rent-a-crowd of day
laborers cheered the candidate's stilted speech, then waved his
convoy of flashy cars off to the next fly-blown town.
</P>
<P>
   A big banner for the PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco
Labastida, was prominently displayed as a backdrop while the
entertainers did their bumps and grinds. However, the silver-haired
technocrat did not attend as a speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it in a Mexican political
campaign,'' said Josefina Franzoni, an analyst at the Mexican
Institute of Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   When male strip shows first took Mexico by storm last summer,
National Action Party (PAN) stalwarts and right-wing Catholic
clergyman often were tempted to score political points by revoking
permits at the last minute in the name of public decency.
</P>
<P>
   This only added to the show's mystique, and one touring stud
cabaret, ``Solo Para Mujeres,'' set box-office records. In less
than a year, the ruling party has seized on the gimmick as a crowd
puller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that we can see nude men, but I would like to see
more political proposals,'' said Franzoni.
</P>
<P>
   Comprising 51 percent of Mexico's 59 million registered voters,
women can swing this tight election and they are being courted by
all candidates. Some four million households are headed by single
women, and they are changing the dynamics of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's wife even went on a walkabout in one of Mexico
City's tough neighborhoods to speak on crime. ``She's the first
wife of a candidate with her own personality,'' said Miguel Acosta
of the Mexican Human-Rights Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls waver, but for the first time the authoritarian
PRI is facing a viable challenge in a transparent election process.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, conservative candidate for an alliance of the PAN
and the Mexican Green Ecologists, has been riding high with his
appeal to young professionals. He even led by five percentage
points in one recent poll.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the left-wing spoiler from the Democratic
Revolution Party, gained support following a television debate in
which he appeared statesmanlike, but his electoral chances are
slim. Some of his party have defected, but he refuses to join Fox
in his alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Spin and image have been greater factors in this campaign than
in previous elections where a PRI victory was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   An American political consultant, James Carville, helped to
devise Labastida's campaign slogan, ``Change with a course,'' as an
antidote to the corrupt image the PRI acquired during seven decades
in power.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive, is more succinct: ``Enough!''
is his rallying cry.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a backlash from women's groups, offended by the
PRI's spectacle. A full-page advertisement in a leading daily
newspaper recently denounced the skin show, but reproduced raunchy
images from it.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Movement to Fight for Human Rights and the Equality
of Women said: ``No, Mr. Labastida, Mexico is grander than this.
You are not able to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they would have been satisfied had female strippers
received equal time is unclear. &QL;

 &HT;    RESENDING TO DENOTE THAT A PHOTO IS AVAILABLE WITH THIS STORY
 &HT;    EDS: Advance story for Sunday, June 25.
 &HT;    A museum of a different color'
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA - Apart from the traditional sites of this seat of
onetime Austrian royalty is a quite-uncommon house whose courtyard
faces the Danube Canal in a neighborhood where there are no
palaces.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the building appear unusual are the windows.
</P>
<P>
   No two are alike.
</P>
<P>
   This is KunstHausWien, a privately-operated and sponsored museum
that pays homage to the art and architectural representations of a
most unusual man, Friedensreich Hundertwasser. ``Unusual'' might
not be adequate to describe him; ``eccentric'' likely is better,
``bizarre'' also fitting _ and ``creative genius'' perhaps most
precise.
</P>
<P>
   In KunstHausWien, you won't find any crown jewels, or chamber
pots some little prince used.
</P>
<P>
   Hundertwasser, who died in February at the age of 71, was a
contemporary artist much of whose prominence was attained through
architectural designs that turned ordinary into unique: a gruesome
district heating plant with a new skin of tiles, lights and bright
colors; a traditional church belltower renovated to include a gold
onion dome and exterior ceramics; a somewhat candy-striped roadside
restaurant that surpasses any unconventional equivalent in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   What also set Hundertwasser apart from others, in addition to
lecturing in the nude (flanked, of course, by two corresponding
unclad females), was his passion for the ``right of window.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own words, Hundertwasser proclaimed, ``Each individual
window has its own right to life.'' Translated, he was saying that
uniform windows on buildings were a manner of conformity from which
he felt the world should rebel.
</P>
<P>
   There's where the KunstHausWien comes in. In 1991, the already
internationally-recognized Hundertwasser took a commonplace former
furniture factory and recreated it as his legacy. Not only were all
the windows made to be different, but much of the floors were
reconfigured uneven; a rise here, a decline there _ like walking in
the woods but you are inside a house.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hundertwasser's position that people who lived inside
buildings have a right to stamp their cachet on those buildings.
Anything within arm's reach outside the window was fair game for
the occupant to design to his or her own desires. The window
casements even could be altered. As a suggestive template,
Hundertwasser designed the building that he described as ``a
``colorful spot in the cheerless, monotonous and sterile face of
the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Externally, the shape of the windows, the paint and/or tiles
around them, depict a cacophony of color and style that somehow
makes sense. On the inside, Hundertwasser's representative art, a
contemporary corollary to what fellow Austrian Gustav Klimt
expressed a century earlier, fills the walls and display cases, a
monument to his creativity and his adroitness for performing
cosmetic surgery on unattractive buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Hundertwasser's diverse talents even brought him to designing
postage stamps and redesigning national flags, none of the latter
having been accepted but which represented his utopian beliefs. As
an example, he designed a flag for the Holy Land; not Israel, not a
Palestinian State but for what he idealistically called the Holy
Land. It has a white background with a green Star of David sitting
atop a horizontally-drawn green Muslim-representative crescent, an
artistic wish that coexistence would be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   On the lower floors of this unusual building, Hundertwasser's
paintings, graphics and architectural prototypes are numerous. So
are his decrees: ``If we do not honor our past, we lose our future.
If we destroy our roots, we cannot grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``The straight line is godless.''
</P>
<P>
   It is to the latter that Hundertwasser most addressed himself.
Straight lines are difficult to find in KunstHausWien.
Nevertheless, his contemporary style can please even
tradition-bound devotees, among which included the Austrian critic
Wieland Schmiel who admitted that his original unfavorable
assessment of Hundertwasser was colored by the unusualness of the
artist himself rather than the hypothetical, yet controlled, images
he was painting.
</P>
<P>
   Hundertwasser's philosophy of life dominates. To attempt to
explain it, his theories of space, of mind, of environment, would
require much the space taken by those lower floors. He has a
philosophy about everything, not always in concert with his other
philosophies. That's what makes his house so exciting; so eclectic.
He takes us on adventures into multiple facets of life, all with
artistic creation.
</P>
<P>
   The upper floors, reachable via a giddy, lumpy staircase provide
exhibition space for other artists and artisans.
</P>
<P>
   Born as Friedrich Stowasser in Vienna of a Jewish mother and
Aryan father, that he and his mother came through the Nazi period
in that city is salient, if not mysterious inasmuch as more than 60
of his maternal side perished in the Holocaust. This is not a
hidden period of Hundertwasser's life (there is a photo displayed
of him in the museum, showing him as a school child posing in a
classroom with crossed Nazi swastika flags in the background) but
puzzling in that the mother and son (the father died in 1929) not
only survived but seemed to fit into the pattern of day-to-day
living in a Nazi-controlled society. He adopted his professional
name in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   A biographer, Pierre Restany, devoted but three sentences to
that period of Hundertwasser's life. A guide at KunstHausWien said
he was unable to answer my question as to how the Hundertwassers,
despite their Jewish linkage, endured _ not because of anything
protective but simply because he didn't know, that it wasn't an
issue to which he felt he needed answers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundertwasser was too young to be involved in anything political
then but his later blossoming as an artist brought worldwide
acclaim. In 1981, Austria awarded him the country's highest honor
for culture, the Austrian State Prize. He toured extensively and,
at times, lived in France and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   (According to Associated Press, Hundertwasser's first
architectural creation in New Zealand was a public toilet made of
colorful tiles and wine bottles, with no straight lines and a roof
that was covered with vegetation including marijuana plants.)
</P>
<P>
   It was on a cruise aboard the QE2 from New Zealand that the
outspoken critic of nuclear power had a heart attack and died
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   His endowment to the world of art and architecture is intact in
the strange house alongside the Danube Canal. In the course of
doing the Vienna thing, palaces, royal apartments and treasure
caches are plentiful. Take a break from the glitz of royalty, try
the unique KunstHausWien.

A RUTHLESS TIGER LEADS A LONG BATTLE AGAINST SRI LANKA

 (Clarifies injuries in suicide bombing in December and religious

 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ Few have seen him, but a nation fears him.
</P>
<P>
   He learned military strategy from West Point manuals, at secret
Indian training camps, and from Clint Eastwood videos. He
cultivated savage endurance by poking pins under his nails, and
schooled himself to be merciless by torturing insects to death with
needles.
</P>
<P>
   He commands cultish devotion from followers, although most have
never met him. Their reward for accepting a suicide mission is a
first and last supper with the man they call Thavalar, ``The
Leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Short, pudgy-faced, and smiling in a photo on a Web site for his
cause, Velupillai Prabhakaran may not look like a mastermind of
assassinations of presidents, prime ministers, and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But Prabhakaran, a 45-year-old guerrilla leader who is fighting
for a homeland, or eelam, for the Tamil minority on this island, is
as ruthless and elusive as Cambodia's Pol Pot, and as inspiring to
his followers as Cuba's Che Guevara. It has been years since he
granted any journalist an interview.
</P>
<P>
   His 5,000 to 10,000 male and female guerrillas have been a
relentless, untamable adversary for Sri Lanka's military of 120,000
to 140,000 soldiers. Even their enemies say the Tigers are stronger
now than at any time since the Tamil separatist movement was
founded in 1972. Sri Lanka's armed forces, meanwhile, seem to be at
their most beleaguered.
</P>
<P>
   Since late last year, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have
overrun army bases and seized artillery, have gained ground in
northern and eastern Sri Lanka, and have launched suicide bomb
attacks, such as one in December that blinded the president of Sri
Lanka in one eye and killed 22 bystanders. Another bombing killed a
cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the rebels nearly captured Jaffna, the northern city
at the heart of the would-be Tamil state, after they lost it to
government forces five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Sri Lankan military officials say they have not been more
worried in 17 years of this war between the largely Hindu Tamils
and the largely Buddhist Sinhalese, which has claimed more than
62,000 lives. (Both ethnic groups include significant minorities
with other religious affiliations, including a sizable Christian
Tamil community.)
</P>
<P>
   Since the Tigers abandoned peace negotiations and broke a truce
five years ago, Sri Lanka's president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, has
vowed to ``wage war for peace.'' But the government's refusal to
carve up this island country, the size of West Virginia, to create
a Tamil state has hardened Prabhakaran's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Quite possibly the most disciplined and well-funded guerrilla
force in the world, the Tigers are described by diplomats as more
systematic and callous than the Irish Republican Army, more willing
to die for their cause than the Middle East's Hezbollah. Outlawed
as a terrorist organization in the United States and India as well
as in Sri Lanka, the Tigers have become among the biggest
nongovernmental arms buyers in Southeast Asia. Supported by
donations from Sri Lankan Tamil emigres and revenue from commercial
enterprises, the Tigers are also alleged to have profited from drug
trafficking, though that has not been proved.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the main reason for the movement's effectiveness is
neither money nor weaponry, but blind dedication to an idea, and to
the man behind it.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, many Tamils have nursed deep resentment against
perceived discrimination and persecution by the majority Sinhalese.
But the ``Tamil cause'' is complex and nuanced, and by no means do
Prabhakaran and the Tigers represent all Tamils, who make up 18
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Ceylon Tamils, who claim roots on the island for 1,500 years,
tend to want an independent homeland, while so-called Indian
Tamils, whose ancestors came to work on tea plantations in the
1800's, tend to favor national unity. Even among those who want a
Tamil state, many are appalled by the Tigers' methods and bemoan
that people on both sides are susffering needlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prabhakaran is single-minded, like a horse with blinders on.
He cares more about the Tigers than about the Tamil cause,''
Dharmalingam Sithadthan, president of the Peoples' Liberation
Organization of Tamil Eelam, said sadly. A former Tamil militant
who joined the democratic opposition, Sithadthan is on the Tigers'
hit list, he said, ``because anyone who opposes the LTTE is
considered a traitor to the Tamil cause.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Growing rebel support &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Tamil militants were a fringe movement of
radicals and Marxists. But in 1983, the cause began gaining wider
support after authorities allowed rampaging Sinhalese mobs to kill
hundreds of Tamils and to firebomb thousands of Tamil businesses
and homes in retaliation for a Tiger attack that killed 13
Sinhalese soldiers. In the years since, the Tigers have honed a
almost-religious dedication that would be hard for any army to
match. A Sri Lankan cabinet minister put it simply: ``We fight to
live. They fight to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Each fighter _ about half are women _ is given a nom de guerre
and forbidden to smoke, drink, or have sex. They are permitted to
marry at age 23, but only after five years of service. They take a
vow to die rather than be captured and wear cyanide capsules on
strings around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Prabhakaran's Tigers systematically wiped out
rival groups of Tamil militants as well as moderates who favored a
political settlement. Tamils seen as traitors were lynched.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he feels somebody is thinking against him, the next moment
they are eliminated. The LTTE feels there must be only one
leadership, and Prabhakaran doesn't want anybody who's stronger
than he is,'' said K. Suresh Premachandran, secretary general of
the Eeelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front and a former
militant who fled Jaffna after the Tigers killed hundreds of
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Premachandran said the government has unwittingly built support
for the Tigers by ignoring the demands of Tamil leaders like
himself who laid down arms to join the political mainstream. ``If
the government wants an alternative to the LTTE, they should treat
democratic Tamil parties better. People now believe the government
only understands the language of war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, meanwhile, have created a virtual global corporation
to fund that war, including about 11 cargo freighters, according to
a leading shipping insurer. They operate 45 offices in more than 40
countries _ more than the number of Sri Lankan embassies.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers reputedly raise more than $1 million a month from
voluntary and pressured contributions from many of the more than
500,000 Tamils who fled Sri Lanka after the 1983 riots. After Tiger
fighters overran a key army base in April, elated Tamils are
reported to have made $80 million in congratulatory pledges and
gifts, including a BMW from a supporter in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A former Sri Lankan Air Force commander, Oliver Ranasinghe,
acknowledged that accidental killings of civilians by government
bombs have driven many Tamils into the arms of the Tigers. ``That's
our fault . . . there are mistakes made because we don't have the
proper equipment,'' he conceded. But the LTTE, he asserted, places
its camps close to villages to use Tamil civilians as human
shields. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Politicians blamed
</P>
<P>
   Ranasinghe and others complain that the war has been mismanaged
by politicians who tied the hands of the military. Purchases of
desperately-needed weapons have been delayed, he and other
commanders said. Several arms dealers said the purchases have been
haphazard in times of crisis, leaving Sri Lankan forces with
mismatched equipment and bargain-basement models.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian leaders retort that they had to delay or cancel arms
deals because corrupt officers were taking a cut. They have also
limited military purchases in order to maintain social programs
that have endowed this country with some of the highest rates of
literacy and life expectancy in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   The recent Tiger victories are also hard to explain entirely as
a matter of inadequate government weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The army took nearly a year to gain control of huge swath of
land in the north, but it lost it in four days of Tiger assaults
last November. An even bigger shock came two months ago with the
Tiger victory at Elephant Pass, a key base blocking the neck of the
Jaffna peninsula that had been declared impregnable by US special
forces advisers, according to military sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, with an estimated 1,800 guerrillas, managed to rout
as many as 12,000 soldiers by cutting off their water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Low morale is a natural outgrowth of a war that seems unwinnable
against an opponent willing to die and take no prisoners, said
Paikiasothy Saravanumuttu, executive director of the Centre for
Policy Alternatives. ``Does the average Sri Lankan soldier really
know what he is fighting for?''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Sri Lanka is holding its ground, following
emergency arms purchases last month and a full-court press to hold
Jaffna. But long term, the pendulum is likely to swing. That has
some here saying the international community should pressure Sri
Lanka to offer an autonomy package to Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't kill them, you have to deal with them, and if you
have to deal with them, you can't set the terms alone,''
Saravanamuttu said.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there is no sign that the government will grant the
Tigers' demand for a homeland _ or that Prabhakaran will accept
anything less.

 &HT;    A fruit with universal appeal
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hard to believe, looking at all the mangoes
hanging on trees here, that the juicy tropical fruit grows anywhere
else on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Don't we have enough in our own back yards?
</P>
<P>
   Equally hard to believe is that mangoes are more well-known in
most of the world than apples; the mango is the world's No. 1 fruit
eaten out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists agree mangoes got their start in Southeast Asia.
India is the main producer in Asia today; but they're grown in hot
climates around the world including South Africa, the Caribbean and
South and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Every country that eats mangoes has its own twist on using them
in dishes. Indians give us lahssies _ a type of smoothie made with
yogurt. Their yogurt tastes nothing like our commercial varieties;
so to get the more tart flavor, add buttermilk to the plain yogurt
along with honey and fresh mango for an ice-cold treat.
</P>
<P>
   In the Caribbean islands and throughout Latin America, a mango
is reamed into a juice or pureed in a blender, mixed with sweetened
condensed milk and served over crushed ice for a batido.
</P>
<P>
   Chutneys also come from India, though the Brits have perfected
this dish.
</P>
<P>
   Mangoes with curry may sound like an odd combo, but it's also
indicative of some areas in India, and also Trinidad, which has
adopted curry-flavored preparations for many of its fish stews.
Curry with shrimp and mangoes is an exotically beautiful dish as
well as being tasty.
</P>
<P>
   Also from the islands, we get mango bread, a sweet breakfast
staple that freezes well. Jamaicans use fruit in many of their
baked goods, likely inspired by the British fruitcake.
</P>
<P>
   Green mangoes are eaten in Vietnam and Thailand; green mango
pickles are a specialty, typically served with fish. Salads or
slaws, made with mangoes and other fruits and dressed with vinegar,
are inspired by their cuisines.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican chefs often use cilantro with mangoes. You'll see the
combination in a version of tropical gazpacho, a decidedly Spanish
dish with a Mexican flair.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest American chefs are using mangoes with their
chile-fired dishes; smoked chiles (anchos) go especially well with
the sweet, ripe fruit in a chicken dish.
</P>
<P>
   Here in South Florida, mango salsa is on many menus, paired with
chicken, fish and pork. The fruit salsa would also work as a dip
served with fried strips of yuca that have been dusted with garlic
powder for a touch of Cuban cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   However you use mangoes, here are tips for choosing them and
storing them:
</P>
<P>
   Mangoes will ripen in a paper bag if not picked too soon. Choose
mangoes that are beginning to ripen, but not yet soft. Place them
in a paper bag and seal the end; leave on the counter overnight.
Avoid putting ripe mangoes in the refrigerator; this will inhibit
their ripening.
</P>
<P>
   The small black ``sugar'' spots on a mango's skin won't affect
the flavor, but avoid bruising the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   To get maximum fruit off a mango, slice it parallel to the pit.
Hold the mango in one hand at eye level. Turn the mango to find the
narrowest side, and run the knife vertically in a wide slice from
the top. Continue on the opposite side of the mango.
</P>
<P>
   Cube, slice or puree fresh mangoes and put into freezer
containers to preserve them. They keep well in the freezer for up
to six months. (They should be peeled first; the peel is toxic if
eaten in quantity.)
</P>
<P>
   Here are samples of how mangoes are used in cuisines around the
world:
</P>
<P>
   India: Some Indians use the mango in their curry dishes, while
others create the famous lahssie _ a fruit-yogurt smoothie. Mango
chutney comes from India as well.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean: Mango bread and mangoes with curry and fish are
common on certain islands.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico: Batidos, milkshake of mangoes and condensed milk, are
often found in streetside booths here.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest U.S.: Mangoes are matched with chiles and pork or
chicken by American chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia: Thai and Vietnamese cooks use green mangoes for
pickling and in salads. French cooks from Vietnam have contributed
the green mango pie (or tart).

 &HT;    Mangoes popular with cooks around world
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   Here are recipes taken from several cuisines where mangoes are
grown.
</P>
<P>
   'Mangos flameados' (Flambeed mangoes)
</P>
<P>
   2 mangoes, about 1 pound, cut into strips
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Thinly pared and julienned rind of 1/2 orange
</P>
<P>
   Thinly pared and julienned rind of 1/2 lime
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce Triple Sec or Cointreau
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1/2 orange
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1/2 lime
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce white tequila
</P>
<P>
   Peel the mangoes, remove the pit, and cut the flesh into thick
strips. Set aside. Melt the butter in the chafing dish, stir in the
sugar, and continue stirring until it has dissolved. Add the rinds
together with the Triple Sec, heat the mixture, and flame it.
</P>
<P>
   When the flames have died down, add the juices and cook until
reduced _ about 2 minutes. Add the mango strips and heat until the
syrup begins to bubble. Add the tequila, heat through, and flame
again. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 to 3 servings
</P>
<P>
   (From ``The Cuisines of Mexico,'' Harper &AMP; Row Publishers.)
</P>
<P>
   Cold papaya, mango and cape gooseberry bisque
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mangoes
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds papayas
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fresh cape gooseberries (ground cherries)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups pineapple juice, or enough to cover fruit
</P>
<P>
   1 large piece peeled fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon allspice powder
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup honey
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cornstarch mixed with 1/2 cup water, for thickening, as
needed
</P>
<P>
   Lemon juice to taste
</P>
<P>
   Garnish:
</P>
<P>
   Sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Toasted macadamia nuts, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Peel, seed and chop the mangoes and papayas. Husk the cape
gooseberries and leave them whole. Place the fruit in a saucepan,
cover with pineapple juice, add the spices and honey, and simmer
until the fruit is tender. Discard the cinnamon stick. Puree the
mixture in a blender until very smooth. Strain, if desired. Return
the soup to the saucepan and bring to a simmer. If necessary,
thicken by adding cornstarch mixture a little at a time to the
simmering soup, stirring constantly until desired consistency is
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Adjust the flavor with lemon juice. Chill thoroughly. Just
before serving, garnish each portion with a dollop of sour cream
and a sprinkling of toasted macadamia nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 to 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Mango bread
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs, well beaten
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 cups peeled and diced fresh mango
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup macadamia nuts or walnuts, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup grated coconut
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350(degrees). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch
loaf pans. Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder and cinnamon
into a small bowl. In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, oil
and sugar. Combine with dry nuts and coconut. Pour into the loaf
pans and bake for 45-60 minutes, or until the bread is golden
brown. To test if bread is done, insert a toothpick in the center
of the loaf. When it comes out clean, the bread is done. Let the
loaves cool in the pans for 10 to 15 minutes; then unmold and let
cool completely on racks.

   ALBRIGHT-CHINA (Beijing) _ More than a year after the NATO
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the United
States and China officially declared Thursday during a visit by
secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright that the interlude of
bitterness had given way to an era of improved relations. Even so,
both sides said that the firmer footing of the relationship, based
on the recent passage in the House of Representatives of a broad
trade bill dealing with China, was now focused on the sensitive
issue of Taiwan and the Clinton administration's plans for an
anti-missile defensive shield. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY-LAUNDERING (Washington) _ With evidence mounting that bank
secrecy laws can threaten financial stability everywhere, the
world's rich nations Thursday took the unprecedented step of naming
15 countries, including Israel, Russia and the Philippines, as
potential havens for ill-gotten wealth. The public blacklist is the
culmination of a decade-long diplomatic effort to take action
against money-laundering centers. The action does not punish the
named countries or cut them off from the world financial system.
But it does pressure banks and brokerage houses to scrutinize all
financial transactions with clients there as possibly linked to
crime or high-risk financial transactions. And it threatens the
nations because they could lose legitimate financial business, a
lucrative source of tax revenue. By Joseph Kahn.

   BRITAIN-IMMIG-DEATHS (London) _ The Dutch driver of the truck in

of a $13.4 billion foreign operations spending bill, which passed

The shift involves retooling its product line to move more software

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: Don't blame Big Oil, OPEC for high gas prices
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Democrats, the obvious villain in the rapid rise of gasoline
prices is Big Oil, which they suspect of driving up prices to
increase profits. As a result, the Federal Trade Commission is
investigating the oil industry's role in Midwestern gas prices,
where the rise has been most rapid, and Vice President Al Gore is
even suggesting that ``Big Oil may have gotten too big.''
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the villain in the rapid rise of gas prices is
equally obvious: the federal government. By protecting the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge from oil drilling, by failing to coerce
OPEC nations into raising oil production, by insisting on
cleaner-burning blends of gasoline, the Clinton administration has
brought the nation to this crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, there is no single villain, no single
explanation, no single solution. In February 1999, gasoline was
selling at less than 70 cents a gallon in some Georgia locations.
Have government policies changed so much in 16 months to force a
doubling of gas prices? Hardly. Likewise, if Big Oil had the
control over gas prices that some Democrats suggest, would the
industry have allowed prices to decline so much back in February?
Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of our predicament lies elsewhere, in simple supply
and demand. In economic terms, the demand for gasoline is
inelastic, meaning it doesn't change much in response to price.
People tend to buy the same amount of gasoline each week no matter
how high _ or how low _ the price is. That makes gasoline prices
extremely volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: When a widgetmaker finds himself with too many
widgets on hand, he merely cuts his price a little, people buy more
widgets, and his excess inventory disappears. But gasoline doesn't
work like that. If refineries have too much gasoline to sell, they
have to cut their prices by a whole lot if they hope to increase
gas consumption even a little bit. That's what happened last
February. The reverse is also true. When gasoline supplies get
tight, the price has to rise by an awful lot before it starts to
discourage consumption and restore balance to the market. That's
what's happening now.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that complicated a story. But since it lacks a villain,
it also lacks sex appeal, and politicians can't use it to scare up
votes. So it's a story not often told.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the closest thing to a villain in this story is you. As
in us. As in we, the American people. We have treated gasoline as
liquid sunshine, something that pours into our cars and trucks and
sport-utility vehicles just as naturally and inevitably as the sun
rises each morning.
</P>
<P>
   We have the same fuel-efficiency standards in effect today as we
did in the 1970s, when auto technology was much more crude. And
we've taken advantage of a loophole in those standards by turning
en masse to gas-guzzling light trucks and SUVs that make up an
increasing percentage of our fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians don't like that story either, for obvious
reasons. Instead of concentrating on the demand for gasoline, which
is something we can influence, they prefer to focus on its supply,
which is something we can't influence.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the claim that gas prices would fall if we opened
the Arctic wildlife refuge to drilling conveniently overlooks the
fact that American-produced oil is no cheaper than the oil coming
out of Saudi Arabia. Take a look: The price of oil from Texas oil
fields today is $31 a barrel, right in line with OPEC's price.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the popular ploy of blaming OPEC for our problems is
like blaming Mexico and Columbia for our drug problem. Yes, they're
taking advantage of our addiction, but we're the ones hooked on the
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   And like a lot of addicts, we want to blame anybody but
ourselves.

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: Hate crimes bill offers shield not stamp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As soon as long-overdue legislation to broaden federal authority
to fight hate crimes cleared a hurdle in the U.S. Senate, a couple
more obstacles came into view.
</P>
<P>
   First, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), no friend of
the measure, said he would hold up action on the overall defense
bill, to which the hate crimes language is attached as an
amendment. Even if the amendment survives Lott's stalling tactics,
it faces an arduous route to passage in the House, which is
decidedly cooler to the proposal than the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to get it passed is worth the effort. America needs
it.
</P>
<P>
   Current U.S. law on hate crimes only covers protected civic
activities such as trying to vote or registering for school; it
doesn't apply to, say, an assault on a person because of his or her
race, ethnicity, etc. In 1998, the last year for which there is a
complete tally, 8,000 hate crimes were reported in the United
States: 56 percent motivated by race, 18 percent by religion and 16
percent by sexual orientation _ with the latter percentage said to
be rising.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment is not intended to heap penalties on perpetrators
but to assist local jurisdictions, some of which don't have
adequate legal protections or the investigative wherewithal to deal
with suspected hate crimes. This is not intervention, just federal
consultation and assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest about this issue. This initiative would be
sailing through both houses were it not for the fact it covers gays
and lesbians. Some on Capitol Hill and in sanctimonious circles
elsewhere argue illogically that this would legitimize
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment applies no such stamp of approval. It would merely
protect gays and lesbians from persecution just as it would
safeguard racial, religious and ethnic minorities or the
handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   As a co-sponsor of the amendment, Sen. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.)
said this week: ``In many ways, passage of the Hate Crimes
Prevention Act would be nothing more than a symbol. But it is a
symbol that can be filled with substance by changing hearts and
minds and by better protecting all our citizens, be they disabled,
female, black or gay. They are Americans all.''

WITH THE ARRIVAL OF EMP, IT'S NOT YOUR FATHER'S SEATTLE ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ MSFT forever changed our image. So did WTO. Now it is
EMP's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, amidst a blitz of international hype and hoopla, Paul
Allen's curvaceous, gaudily clad Experience Music Project opens its
doors to the public and our once-shy, shades-of-gray city will
again be subject to double-takes and once-overs from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Get an eyeful, rubberneckers. The Old Gray Mare, we ain't.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago it would have been insane to put up this
museum,'' says Charles Cross, editor-in-chief of the Northwest rock
magazine The Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no music scene, no club scene. But people want to
come to Seattle now to vist in many ways has become the most
vibrant city in America in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Allen's timing couldn't be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft _ MSFT to its triple-split stockholders changed our
image from folksy Pioneer Square Squared into Silicon North, and
helped raise the area's per-capita income by 11 percent in 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks gave us the jagged caffeine edge of a Turkish coffee
house.
</P>
<P>
   Grunge _ that sonic, early-'90s growl that spread across the
country like moshed Mudhoney _ convinced Rolling Stone magazine to
declare us Rock City.
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization ``Battle of Seattle'' protests late
last year put us on the map as a budding Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Now the EMP _ the world's most expensive rock 'n' roll museum,
with a heady entry fee of $19.95 _ is threatening to reshape
Seattle's public image into a high-amp, defiantly idiosyncratic,
brave-new Tomorrowland.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the amps, baby, and ditch the beige raincoat. Mold's
out. Bold's in. It could be permanent Hawaiian shirt day in
Seattle, if that red and purple and blue and silver and gold
whatzit at the foot of the Space Needle looks anything like our
future.
</P>
<P>
   It very well could.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind the EMP curtain, jet-setting Microsoft co-founder
Allen, has always had a foot _ maybe two _ in the future. It's
where fellow Da Vinci-ites with that rich Renaissance right-brain,
left-brain, art-and-science thinking tend to dwell.
</P>
<P>
   It was Allen, remember, who helped dream up that pie-in-the-sky
cyber-highway called the World Wide Web. In the early days at MSFT,
his partner, Bill Gates, referred to him simply as ``the idea
man.'' The new term for Allen is ``visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his idea for EMP began modestly enough. He wanted to do
right by his guitar guru, Jimi Hendrix, a mind-blowing Fender
bender as far ahead of his time musically as Allen is ahead of his
technologically.
</P>
<P>
   Allen planned a $50 million shrine to the Seattle-born
guitarist, with 6,000 artifacts and 10,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   A couple hundred million dollars later, the focus has grown to
embrace rock gospel, funk, hip-hop, jazz, blues, punk and grunge,
with 80,000 artifacts, 140,000 square feet, 50 patents pending on
techie innovations, and a most curious and incendiary architectural
design by Frank Gehry that has stirred pundits in Seattle to vivid
metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   You can't judge a book by its cover. But passing judgment on the
EMP _ based on the colors of its skin and its endomorphic bulges _
has become a regular Seattle pasttime.
</P>
<P>
   Graphic naysayers compare the building to the organs of a
slaughtered cow, a dumped-over garbage can, open heart surgery gone
awry, the crash site of an airplane. The architect, some complain,
is nothing but a big showoff. And the idea just plain stinks.
</P>
<P>
   Admirers, in turn, praise its ``massive coolness'' and
double-dare-ya chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   Some are wonderfully poetic. ``It's a Matisse odalisque purring
at the nervous gang of male buildings standing on the street
corners in the downtown skyline,'' says Tom Corddry, leader of the
team that created Microsoft's Encarta. ``Or maybe it's just the
Space Needle's pet pot-bellied pig, heavily tattooed.''
</P>
<P>
   Press-shy Allen _ who is suddenly popping up in everything from
Rolling Stone magazine to the New York Times to promote EMP _
describes the museum as fresh, audacious, exuberant, unabashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think big,'' he has told his staff. They have. When your boss'
imagination runs on Quicken Deluxe _ with a personal wealth that
fluctuates around $30 billion, depending on the mood swings of the
stock market _ the sky's no limit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither are the conventional trappings of traditional Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has long been a city of grinding process, where civic
decisions can take days, or weeks, and nobody leaves the table
completely satisifed. The EMP _ totally funded by Allen _ flies in
the face of that.
</P>
<P>
   The city didn't ask for this. It didn't pay for it. Mr. Allen
can pretty much do whatever he wants in his rock 'n' tech temple.
</P>
<P>
   See what happens when you don't compromise?
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is doing a good job of being a tycoon,'' says Corddry.
``He is too quick and unpredictable and brassy for the neighborhood
process junkies to keep up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the EMP about modesty _ Seattle has long been the high
exalted capital of Scandinavian understatement. This radical
high-volt temple to rock isn't designed to whisper. It's designed
to howl, to rock, to boogie all night long.
</P>
<P>
   It's about the Seattle we're becoming. Not the Seattle we've
been. That plugged-in city is not only growing wealthier, it is
growing younger (average age about 38) and hipper (the city has the
seventh largest population of artists in the nation). And rock 'n'
roll is at its heart 'n' soul. ``We're a generation of people who
grew up with rock and pop music and culture built into our lives.
We take it for granted,'' says the museum's curatorial director,
Chris Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   ``EMP is a natural product of the times and culture we live
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Or will live in, if EMP projections are correct. Staffers
estimates annual attendance at the museum will average at least
800,000. First-year figures, they say, could be more than 1
million.
</P>
<P>
   That's almost twice the annual attendance of Cleveland's Rock
'n' Roll Hall of Fame _ and the Seattle Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   It's also twice the population of Seattle proper.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce describes the estimate as modest. Others say it may be
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether EMP can create a museum that is vibrant, that people
want to return to again and again, is going to be quite a task,''
says Rocket editor Charles Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The key, he says is soul. The city's. The museum's.
</P>
<P>
   And he, for one, hopes the two can tango.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think rock 'n' roll does deserve a cultural place in our
history,'' says Cross, ``and I'm glad that Paul Allen appreciates
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the equivalent of someone saying I'm building the
Seattle Public Library for music and I' m doing it on my own
dime.''

GUITAR GOD SET OFF A SPARK IN ROCK 'N' ROLL BILLIONAIRE'S
IMAGINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ His broad face expressionless as he gazes out a
window, Paul Allen is thinking back to the last time he saw his
idol, Jimi Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a hint of awe in the billionaire's voice as he
recalls a mystic summer day in 1970, a day filled with vivid
memories of a rock star with an extraordinary command of the
electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of other Seattle teenagers who jammed Sick's
Stadium on July 26, 1970, Allen was mesmerized by the hippie prince
with the wild Afro and Fender Strat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen anybody with such absolute control of his
instrument,'' Allen says during an interview at Vulcan Northwest in
Bellevue, the hub of his sports, entertainment and high-tech
empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd just close his eyes and have these amazingly fluid
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix, a Seattle native, had dazzled audiences at the 1967
Monterey Pop Festival and '69 Woodstock festival with his fiery
guitar style, billowing scarves and psychedelic voodoo. But his
final Seattle show was electrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Allen _ whose Experience Music Project was inspired by Hendrix _
was standing only 20 feet away from the guitar god that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a chance of rain, so they built a plastic awning
that Jimi could stand under,'' Allen says. ``It started to sprinkle
and became progressively stronger, not a downpour, but a good
Seattle rain.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no way Jimi was going to be under that awning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was right at the edge of the stage in a silk jumpsuit.
There was water running off the guitar, and he had his eyes closed
as he played. It was incredibly loud, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen had seen Hendrix the year before, in May 1969, at the
Seattle Center Coliseum. But the Sick's Stadium concert would be
the guitarist's last hometown stand. Hendrix died in London less
than two months later, on Sept. 18, 1970, choking to death in his
sleep after mixing alcohol and barbiturates.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, there are a number of different videos that
capture some of Jimi's performances. But seeing him live was
something else,'' Allen says wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   Cradled in a big leather chair and surrounded by high-tech
hardware in a plush conference room, Allen chuckles at the memory
of the guitarist's last Seattle show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are given special talents and special
creativity,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Allen could be talking about himself. He's a man of abundant
ideas _ and the wealth to implement them.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Seattle on Jan. 21, 1953, he grew up in the Ravenna
district and attended Lakeside School, where he met Bill Gates.
They founded Microsoft in the early 1970s. Allen left the software
giant in 1983 after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, which
is now in remission.
</P>
<P>
   His portfolio includes stakes in more than 100 companies and his
net worth is around $30 billion, depending on which way the stock
market goes on a given day.
</P>
<P>
   In pro sports, he owns the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle
Seahawks. His movie investments include $500 million in DreamWorks
and $3.75 million in Seattle's Cinerama theater. He's a major
player in cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   His collection of lavish abodes includes a high-tech palace on
Mercer Island, Wash.; a 16-room condo in Manhattan; a mansion in
Beverly Hills; a house in London's Holland Park; a villa in the
hills above Cannes, France; and several houses on Lopez Island,
Wash., at the site of a former children's camp.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's hobbies include movies, chess, scuba diving, playing
guitar in his own band and throwing ultra-lavish parties, including
a star-studded 1996 bash at his villa in Southern France during the
Cannes film festival and a cruise aboard a chartered ship from
Juneau to Seattle in 1998 that Rolling Stone estimated cost $9
million.
</P>
<P>
   EMP's opening weekend features more arena-level headliners than
any other local festival this summer. But Allen's band, Grown Men,
won't perform.
</P>
<P>
   The group rehearses at Allen's private studio and occasionally
plays at local clubs. It includes Marc Willett (bass and vocals),
Mike Chadderton (piano, organ and synthesizer), Rick Boice (drums,
percussion and vocals), Eric Robison (sax, flutes, whistle and
``wind controller'') and Terry Davison (guitar, pedal steel,
mandolin and vocals).
</P>
<P>
   Allen plays guitar and writes lyrics and music, sharing credits
with Willett and Davison.
</P>
<P>
   The cover of the new CD, ``Grown Men,'' depicts a toddler in a
purple bandana, a la Hendrix, dousing a burning toy guitar with
lighter fluid as he kneels before it. It has a warm and fuzzy look.
</P>
<P>
   But the music has a dark edge. Allen's brooding songs about
failed love, disillusionment and catastrophe are a bit surprising
from a man with so much economic power and entrepreneurial
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The song ``Kingdom of the Lonely'' includes the lines, ``In the
country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king/ I thought I had an
answer, but I did not know a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mushroom Cloud,'' Allen writes, ``Millions have planned and
worked for this day/ Targets are locked in, it's missiles away/
Brighter than the sunniest day/ It's falling, we're falling, it's
tumbling down.''
</P>
<P>
   Most surprising is the vengeful ``Time Bomb'': ``Underestimate
me if you want/ I can take every jeer and taunt/ Don't even try to
box me in a corner/ The fire I set will be made to order.''
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, the music recalls Bob Dylan, Tom Petty and
particularly Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Allen tried to break the Hendrixian guitar code,
hoping to master some of the riffs that had given him chills at
Sick's Stadium in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   His admiration for Hendrix, as well as his growing wealth,
inspired him to buy hundreds of artifacts that now fill the Hendrix
gallery at EMP.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's collection grew to include shards of the guitar Hendrix
destroyed during his incendiary performance at the '67 Monterey Pop
Festival, the guitar on which he played ``The Star Spangled
Banner'' at Woodstock and the mixing console from his Electric Lady
studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these things, if you're a guitar player or someone who
loves this kind of music, it gives you shivers,'' says Allen, who
wears black slacks, light-blue shirt, blue wire-frame glasses and a
large turquoise ring that belonged to his late father.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then you realize that these were just the tools of the
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed Seattle had no Hendrix shrine, save for a
commemorative rock at the Woodland Park Zoo, Allen proposed a
Hendrix museum at Seattle Center in 1992. Al Hendrix, the
guitarist's father, enthusiastically supported the idea, but Allen
and the Hendrix family later had a falling out and the museum
evolved into the much larger, costlier and innovative EMP designed
by Frank Gehry.
</P>
<P>
   Allen instructed Gehry to make his museum look ``swoopy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the idea goes back to Jimi's music itself,'' Allen
says. ``There was the way he played, where he'd go way up and out
into the stratosphere and come down, and the music itself would
swoop around.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of exploratory creativity was something that I
wanted to somehow get across in the architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Electric guitars, with their bright colors and curved shapes,
were the inspiration for the museum's exterior, which is covered
with painted metal shingles.
</P>
<P>
   Others have suggested the multisegment building resembles a
human heart, the human inner ear, or worse. ``Hydroplane wreck''
and ``open-heart surgery gone awry'' are among the less-flattering
comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen shrugs off criticisms of the building's design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Frank a couple of times, and I've told him how
excited I was about the project,'' he says. ``The last time I saw
him, when the museum was coming off the ground, I said, `This is
going to be fantastic.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank is someone who is always pushing boundaries of what
architecture can be, and I think we encouraged him to go even
further than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest attractions at the 18-room museum is Sky
Church, a great hall inspired by Hendrix's concept of a place where
people of all ages, interests and backgrounds could come together
to experience music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jimi expressed in some of his interviews, and in his
songs, the idea that music serves as a magic carpet that can take
you to different places,'' Allen says. ``There's a churchlike
feeling there, and great music makes the spirit soar.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Sound Lab, a futuristic studio where visitors can
create music, regardless of their level of skill, using various
instruments. They can learn basic skills or work on improving their
existing ones. They also can be virtual rock stars, performing in a
booth that simulates the arena-rock experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a challenge to come up with things that were
hands-on, yet robust enough to stand up to thousands of people
using them and still allow a level of instruction for someone who
hasn't had much experience playing an instrument,'' Allen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to get them excited about music and think, `Hey,
here's a door I can go through.' There's a lot of fun and
excitement in self-expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen also wants his museum to be a place where music fans and
musicians can come together. Punk-rock icon Patti Smith, who
performs at the opening festival, has already agreed to do a
workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the museum will be a focal point, a place where you
have all sorts of different levels of live performance as well as
things that are more innovative and educational, more of a
master-class nature,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a key set of experiences that really got them
excited about music. Music is one of those things that people are
very passionate about. And the people who make music are very
passionate about it too.''

   As the young dancers in the nightclub ecstatically gyrate to the

is an old one, familiar from innumerable rock 'n' roll, twist and
disco movies in which young people discover and create a new sound
or dance style that alarms, then seduces their wary elders. The
message rings loud: You can't stop the music, and woe to those who
try.
</P>
<P>
   The irresistible sound in this particular variation on the theme
is the fusion of Algerian rai (pronounced rye) and Western rap and
European pop into a sensual but lyrically pointed trance music that
is extremely catchy and rhythmically sophisticated.
Smoother-sounding than rap and not so overtly aggressive and
confrontational, the rai songs in ``100 Percent Arabica'' offer
acute sociopolitical commentary with anti-authoritarian sentiments
but refrain from strenuous gangsta-rap posing.
</P>
<P>
   The music's most ardent opponents are the Islamic equivalent of
those finger-wagging Christian elders in the 1950s who denounced
rock 'n' roll as the devil's music. Algeria's Islamic censors, of
course, are not to be trifled with. In 1994, the singer Cheb Hasni,
known as the ``prince of rai,'' was assassinated under a fatwa, a
death warrant issued by fundamentalist Islamic leaders. As a
result, many of rai music's most popular musicians, including the
stars of ``100 Percent Arabica,'' now live in exile in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But as ``100 Percent Arabica'' demonstrates, many social
tensions in their homeland followed these immigrants into their
impoverished neighborhood on the outskirts of Paris. The movie pits
a group of hip, attractive young people who are devoted to rai
against the less attractive, religiously conservative squares who
want to shut them up. Just to be absolutely clear about where the
movie's political heart lies, it makes Slimane (Mouss), the chubby,
bespectacled leader of the anti-rai forces, corrupt on top of
everything else. In cahoots with a cynical mayor running for
re-election, he collects the equivalent of protection money from
neighborhood businessmen who can barely afford donations that will
supposedly be used to build a new mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The music's pied pipers are Rachid (Khaled), and Krimo (Cheb
Mami), rival stars who have set the girls swooning, much to the
consternation of their horrified parents. These local stars are
already fantasizing about million-dollar recording contracts and
fancy cars. They are popular enough that enterprising children who
tape their concerts do a flourishing business selling cheap bootleg
cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   In the jovial spirit of vintage rock 'n' roll movies, ``100
Percent Arabica,'' doesn't take itself too seriously. Its resident
clown, Salem (Mohamed Camara), is a handsome but reckless young man
who impulsively downs a bottle of Scotch after his crude passes at
various women in the nightclub are rebuffed. In another comic bit,
a prissy rent collector is outwitted by tenants who initially
welcome him as a distributor of welfare checks, then change their
tune when he hands them a bill.
</P>
<P>
   If ``100 Percent Arabica'' is high-spirited, it is chaotically
assembled. It leaves too many subplots undeveloped and barely
addresses some of the political and social issues. But as they say,
the beat goes on. And no matter what is happening in the movie, as
soon as it bursts into song it feels good. &QL;

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Another special counsel, just in time for the
elections?
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A top Justice Department prosecutor has recommended a special
counsel be appointed to investigate Al Gore in the 1996 campaign
fund-raising controversy. The recommendation reportedly came from
Robert Conrad, supervising attorney for the Justice Department task
force investigating 1996 fund-raising abuses. Sen. Arlen Spector
(R-Pa.) of the Judiciary administrative oversight subcommittee,
said today that Attorney General Janet Reno ``has done a great
disservice to Vice President Gore, because these matters should
have been investigated a long time ago.'' Reno repeatedly declined
to seek appointment of an independent counsel before the statute
expired a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHERS RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE BUDDHIST NUNS
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest teachers' union, which reports to the IRS
that it spends none of its $200 million a year in teachers' dues on
politics, spent millions of dollars to help elect ``pro-education
candidates.'' National Education Association documents reviewed by
the Associated Press show that $4.9 million was budgeted in a July
1999 union strategic plan for the 2000 election for such things as
``organizational partnerships with political parties, campaign
committees and political organizations.'' The documents raise
questions about the group's tax returns. The union, funded by about
$200 million a year in teachers' dues, said today it believes it
has complied with the law.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONS OF LIFE AND DEATH
</P>
<P>
   After days of being heckled by death penalty opponents, George
W. Bush retreated to the quiet of his office in the Texas Capitol
today and awaited the state pardon board's decision that convicted
murderer Gary Graham should be put to death. And the governor
refused to bow to protests that followed him throughout a three-day
West Coast tour, shrugging off any consequences the execution could
pose to his White House bid. Al Gore, a death penalty supporter,
entered the debate for the first time, saying the goal of both
sides of the issue should be getting erroneous executions ``down to
the virtual zero point.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH DOUBLES UP ON GORE NATIONALLY . . .
</P>
<P>
   A new poll has troubling news for Al Gore. The bipartisan
Voter.com Battleground survey shows George W. Bush with a
double-digit lead. It also indicates Bush is running even among
groups Gore probably needs to win: women and union members. Getting
more credit as the candidate who would keep America prosperous,
Bush had 52 percent support among likely voters, while Gore had 40
percent. Bush's lead in the same poll last month was only 6 points.
The Texas governor also led 49-41 percent in a just-released
NBC-Wall Street Journal poll.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND CATCHES UP IN CONNECTICUT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has erased the 9-point advantage Al Gore had
among Connecticut voters in April, a new poll released by
Quinnipiac University showed. The two presidential candidates are
now in a virtual tie in the state, with Gore at 43 percent and Bush
at 42 percent, well within the poll's margin of sampling error of
2.7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   AND MAYBE SOME OF THAT ALPHA STUFF'LL RUB OFF
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and Jesse Ventura, their new political friendship on
display, joined forces today at a junior high school in St. Paul to
promote special education after some late-night bonding time. ``I'm
not working on his endorsement; I'm working on his vote,'' said
Gore. Ventura, the ex-pro wrestler who gained fame for winning the
Minnesota governor's job as a Reform Party candidate, said he's
committed to the third party movement and that he'd ``feel that I'd
betray that movement'' by endorsing Gore. ``We don't talk much on
issues when we get together; we tell old war stories,'' Ventura
said. Added Gore: ``We stayed up until way past midnight talking
about everything under the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE MORE COMPETITION MIGHT BE INTERESTING . . .
</P>
<P>
   After meeting today with Green Party candidate Ralph Nader,
Teamsters President James P. Hoffa said that neither Al Gore nor
George W. Bush have taken strong enough stands on trade and other
issues important to labor. For that reason, Hoffa said Nader and
Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan should be allowed to
participate in the presidential debates. ``Who really wants to see
a debate between Gore and Bush? I mean they're somewhat the same on
trade, the same mindless debate on Social Security goes on and
on,'' he said. ``We want to broaden the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   . . . BUT NOT EVERY TEAM MAKES THE PLAYOFFS
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Commission on Presidential Debates defended their
decision to exclude candidates who draw less than 15 percent in
national polls, arguing that anyone falling below that threshold
doesn't have a realistic shot at the presidency. Their defense
comes as Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader are complaining they can't
win if they are shut out of the high-profile, prime-time fall
debates. ``Our role is not to jump start your campaign and all of a
sudden make you competitive,'' said Paul Kirk Jr., co-chairman of
the commission.
</P>
<P>
   NOW LOOK WHO'S FAVORING EXCLUSION
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, who's been complaining
about his exclusion from the presidential debates this fall, is
himself refusing to debate party rival John Hagelin. Hagelin had
issued a challenge to Buchanan for a series of debates in advance
of the Reform Party's mail-in primary, but Buchanan manager and
sister, Bay Buchanan belittled the idea: ``We received their
request, and our response is, `John Who?' ... How many delegates to
the convention does he have?''
</P>
<P>
   JUST ASK HIM, HE'LL TAKE IT
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said today he'd agree to be Al Gore's
running mate if asked. The son of ex-New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, 42,
also said he might seek his party's nomination for governor of New
York in 2002. Cuomo was asked the question while in Israel to
create a commission of Israeli and U.S. experts to look for ways to
increase the supply of affordable housing in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   TALKING, EATING, AND BRINGING IN SOME BUCKS
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will be in Los Angeles the next two days
speaking and raising funds. Friday, it's receptions for the state
Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee Saxophone
Club, and a DNC dinner. On Saturday, Clinton will appear at a
Convention Host Committee breakfast, and a brunch and reception for
California Victory 2000.
</P>
<P>
   GAY PRIDE PARADE NOT FOR LAZIO
</P>
<P>
   A group of Democrats and gay elected officials criticized Rick
Lazio's decision to campaign upstate instead of marching in this
weekend's Gay Pride parade in Manhattan. During the last two
weekends, Lazio marched in the Salute to Israel parade, the
Filipino Independence Day parade and the Puerto Rican Day parade.
He was invited to march in Sunday's gay pride parade with the Log
Cabin Republicans. ``It very much shows symbolically where Rick
Lazio is on issues of concern to the gay community, which is
nowhere,'' said state Sen. Tom Duane, a gay Democrat from
Manhattan. Hillary Clinton plans to participate. So does Rudy
Giuliani, whom Lazio replaced in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST THE POLLING PLACES, THEN THE COURTHOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon LaRouche, a perennial candidate who runs for president as
a Democrat every four years, goes into court Friday in Little Rock,
trying to get the seven delegates he says he's entitled to for
winning nearly 22 percent of Arkansas primary vote. Arkansas
Democrats have refused to seat LaRouche's backers, accusing him of
racism and wackiness and saying he isn't a legitimate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL ADS, ILLEGAL ADS: ANY REAL DIFFERENCE?
</P>
<P>
   Two groups said they'll demand a criminal probe of the Gore and
Bush campaigns for allegedly misusing political parties' TV ``issue
ads'' to promote presidential candidates and ``engaging in an
illegal scheme.'' Common Cause and Democracy 21 said they'll ask
the Justice Department to investigate, because ``the presidential
campaigns design, create, target and control the ad campaigns,
which are no different in kind or approach than other campaign ads
being run by the Gore and Bush campaigns.'' Both parties defended
their advertising.
</P>
<P>
   NAILING DOWN HISPANIC SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush continued his quest for Latino support by wooing
the National Association of Hispanic Journalists in Houston. He
said he's ``proud of the Hispanic heritage and traditions in the
state. I intend to take that attitude to the White House should I
be fortunate enough to win. He added that if elected he'd support
bilingualism: ``I will pledge to you that I will welcome the
Hispanic heritage in America. I will reject the English-only
movements.''
</P>
<P>
   GLAD TO BREAK BREAD ANYTIME
</P>
<P>
   A group of moderate Republican senators who support abortion
rights sent a letter to George W. Bush, asking him to ``take the
lead'' in changing the Republican platform's anti-abortion plank.
They also invited Bush to lunch. They got a response _ to the lunch
invitation. Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said he's still
seeking a ``more specific response'' on abortion and remains
hopeful he'll get it.
</P>
<P>
   TALK ABOUT CONVENTION CHAOS!
</P>
<P>
   Just days after a basketball-related riot in L.A., a police
union announced it will be joining protesters at the Democratic
convention. The Los Angeles Police Protective League and protesters
from eight other major police unions have applied for permission to
hold demonstrations outside the downtown Staples Center in
mid-August. The cops are upset with the Clinton administration,
which is threatening the city with a court order to impose reforms
on the city police that were demanded by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING DOWN WITH THE WORKING CLASS
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to blue-collar union workers, Al Gore said that only
the wealthy would gain from George W. Bush's proposals. ``This is
the choice in this election,'' Gore said. ``Are you for working
people?'' Making his arguments with charts and testimonials at a
carpenter's union hall in Des Moines, Iowa, Gore said Bush's tax
cut and retirement plans would bankrupt Social Security and harm
middle-class Americans. He warned that ``Governor Bush has proposed
a plan that's very different'' and ``doesn't work very well for
working families.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW CHOICE IN MICHIGAN RACE
</P>
<P>
   The already close Michigan Senate race between freshman
Republican Spencer Abraham, and his Democratic challenger, Rep.
Debbie Stabenow, has tightened a bit further with the entry of Mark
Forton, a Reform Party candidate and supporter of Pat Buchanan.
Forton, an ex-Republican who said he'll make immigration a top
issue, could cause Abraham problems by attracting Republicans upset
by the senator's efforts to help loosen immigration restrictions to
let companies hire more foreign workers.

XML USHERS IN NEW WAVE OF WEB PAGE DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID SIMS    
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A potential successor to HTML, the computer language that tells
your browser how to display Web pages, could be a boon to small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   It's called XML _ the Extensible Markup Language _ and it's a
bit like the story of the blind man and the elephant: depending on
where he approached it, he thought it was a snake, a rope, or a
wall.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing that XML does do is allow you to create new markup
languages unique to a certain task.
</P>
<P>
   A markup language is a system of tags that lets you tell a
computer what certain content is or means. If you've ever looked at
the underlying code of a Web page (you can do this by pulling down
the View menu on your browser, and choosing Source), you'll see the
HTML (hypertext markup language) that makes the page show up in
your browser. Headlines are marked with an H1, italics are marked
with an ``i,'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   HTML has a limited number of tags. But the ``extensible''
aspects of XML offer a way to create new tags for different uses.
So, for example, someone doing business in the wine industry could
create a markup language that included tags for things such as
vintage year, type of grape, winery, appellation, price, and so on.
They could call it the VML, the vintners' markup language, and it
would be just one of many XML languages.
</P>
<P>
   Why would they bother to do this? One advantage is that if
everyone in an industry can get together and agree that they will
use that markup language, then their Web servers can easily
exchange information about the goods they're buying and selling.
So, for example, I could do a search for all zinfandels from the
Alexander Valley, and ask my computer to list only those with
bottle prices between $10 and $30.
</P>
<P>
   That would be interesting, but more interesting would be if my
computer and the winery's computer could complete the transaction
on their own. So that if I were a reseller looking for a certain
price on a type of wine, I could set my machine to look for that,
and buy it when it found it. The winery's machine and mine could
complete the sale, I would get a confirmation from the winery's XML
server, and the wine would arrive at my store in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 30 years, some companies have been working on
systems like this to make computers do much of this work by talking
to each other. Collectively, they have been called EDI, or
electronic data interchange.
</P>
<P>
   But these systems have been expensive to implement and have been
limited to companies that can afford them.
</P>
<P>
   One of XML's promises is to bring EDI-like services to
companies, especially those in developing countries, that have been
unable to afford EDI _ which can cost millions of dollars to
implement.
</P>
<P>
   XML makes it possible to do this relatively cheaply, so that a
desktop machine running at a small shop in Thailand can communicate
over the Web with computers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Mac made everyone a desktop publisher, and as the
Web made everyone a global publisher, so might XML make every
business able to communicate electronically with every other
business _ all for pennies per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups are contending to be the main repository for
these XML classifications, called schemas. Microsoft is sponsoring
one called BizTalk. Another group, called Oasis, is working with
the United Nations on a strategy called ebXML, which hopes to make
one global repository of this type of business information.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is still mostly wealthy companies that are working
to build this repository, a trickle-down effect may follow. Once
standards are defined, and vendors build tools to work with them,
these tools may become as inexpensive as Web development tools _ a
few hundred dollars or less. If that happens, it could be just one
more way that the Web levels the playing field.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of strong thunderstorms will bring the threat of
flooding to parts of the upper Midwest through the end of the week.
The thunderstorms will erupt as disturbances in the jet stream
intersect a plume of very warm, moist air flowing north from the
western Gulf of Mexico. The heaviest rain is expected over southern
Minnesota, northern Iowa and western Wisconsin where one to three
inches of rain will be common by late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will have ample sunshine, comfortable humidity and
seasonable warmth Friday. Some puffy afternoon clouds will mix with
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Summery heat will cover the southern tier of states. The
Southeast will be partly to mostly sunny, although scattered
thunderstorms will develop near the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. In
the Southwest, afternoon thunder will form over many mountain
peaks.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SUMMER LAG
</P>
<P>
   The duration of daylight has begun to dwindle gradually, but,
the most intense heat of summer typically accompanies the reduced
daylight. Two effects combine to cause the hottest weather to lag
behind the sun. The atmosphere is heated indirectly. Energy from
the sun first heats the surface of the earth, which then warms the
air above. At this time of year, 20,000 to 30,000 feet aloft, the
lingering chill of the past winter is still being erased. Moreover,
the ocean surface responds more slowly to the incoming energy than
does the land, further delaying the warming of the atmosphere over
the oceans.

&HT;     CUBA BETS ITS ECONOMY ON TOURISM
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, June 25)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA, CUBA _ This island nation, playing up its tropical good
times and rogue reputation, is in the midst of a tourist bonanza
and wants to lure even more visitors this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro expects a boost in tourism dollars to help Cuba's
11.1 million people climb out of the economic hole created by the
40-year-old U.S. trade embargo and the loss of Soviet bloc
subsidies early in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The new optimism comes at a time when the House is expected to
vote on easing the embargo banning U.S.-Cuba trade by permitting
sales of American food, medicine and medical supplies to Havana.
The Senate has passed a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   If approved this week, the House measure would have little
immediate impact on Cuba's balance sheet, experts say. While
allowing the limited sales by U.S. companies, the bill would still
forbid Cuba to sell its goods to the United States and would not
allow Havana to buy on credit.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba, which buys rice and other commodities from Asia, might
save some money on transportation costs since U.S. suppliers are
much closer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current embargo, $3 billion in direct foreign
investment has flowed into Cuba in the past 18 months, according to
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Last year, 1.6 million tourists _
60,000 of them Americans _ infused a record $1.9 billion into
Cuba's dollar-starved economy _ more than double the 1992 level.
Cuban officials hope the number of visitors will top 2 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would then be in the big leagues,'' said Tourism Ministry
adviser Miguel Alejandro Figueras, adding that only 40 nations in
the world receive more than 2 million visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism has surfaced as an antidote to the economic double
whammy that followed Castro's seizure of power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. embargo set Cuba adrift from its major trading partner.
And the downfall of the Soviet bloc between 1989 and 1991 meant the
loss of massive subsidies and trade worth more than $2 billion
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Those were dark times, literally. Cubans suffered through
frequent blackouts because of the government's cost-cutting actions
restricting the use of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Food was scarce. Tourist guide Carlos Aguiar recalls losing 40
pounds and looking emaciated. ``And I wasn't on a diet or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Cuba has reinvented itself as a dollar-based
economy, open to foreign trade, tourism and investment even while
it remains a centrally planned communist state.
</P>
<P>
   This city's skyline is dotted with new and renovated hotels,
some run by foreign firms under management contracts and others
under construction as Cuban joint ventures with European and
Canadian hotel chains. An Italian company has also overhauled the
island's telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   While Cuba is nowhere near China in opening up its economy to
free enterprise, it has transferred most of its state-owned farm
land to semi-autonomous farmer cooperatives and individual owners.
Cubans can run restaurants out of their homes and charge fees for
giving private lessons in foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, Cuba is still in a slump. It exports about $1.4
billion in sugar, nickel, cigars and other products. It imports $3
billion, much of it food, oil and other necessities on credit.
Tourism surpassed sugar in the 1990s as Cuba's main source of
revenue, providing funds that are crucial to the island's efforts
to join the world dollar economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a nominally egalitarian society, the new economy has created
a curious class division based not on education or party membership
but on access to dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans who work in hotels, restaurants and other places
frequented by tourists get dollars in tips and can buy hundreds of
consumer items that most Cubans cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the physician or lawyer or engineer who wants to be at
the hotel's front door getting the bags of tourists,'' says
Figueras. ``There are a lot of jokes about that.''
</P>
<P>
   At hotels some Cubans strike up conversations with tourists and
then offer them boxes of cigars at cut-rate prices provided the
buyers pay in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In a 98-year-old tobacco factory here workers hold up individual
cigars to visitors and mutter, ``One dollar, one dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Without dollars, life can be bleak. Reynaldo Jimenez, a social
sciences professor, and his wife, Mercedes, a dermatologist, have a
combined income in pesos equal to about $18.50 a month. Medical
care and education are free, and with rationing cards, food costs
little.
</P>
<P>
   The Jimenezes live in a small apartment at the top of three
flights of unlit stairs. Asked to recommend a nearby restaurant for
an evening meal, Reynaldo cannot say because he and Mercedes never
go out to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that a family is better off if its income is
in dollars,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Those with relatives in the United States can receive up to
$1,200 a year in cash, a fortune for the average Cuban. In all,
Cubans receive about $900 million from their relatives annually.
</P>
<P>
   Economic improvement is difficult to measure. In Havana,
tourists are shocked by the tattered condition of streets, houses
and windowless, one-room apartments.
</P>
<P>
   But Cubans like to boast that everything is becoming up-to-date
on their island. They note with pride that five years ago the
government, desperate for revenue, started taxing private income _
just like other nations.
</P>
<P>
   To build up tourism, Cuba has invested $400 million in airports
in the past 10 years to make all parts of the island accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Figueras laments that much more must be done to develop
restaurants, nightclubs, sports facilities and other tourist
attractions. ``We have no theme parks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Cuban-American opponents of Castro are
fighting hard to prevent Congress from easing the embargo. Noting
that Cuba is often slow to pay for the items it has bought from
other countries, they call it a deadbeat nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Sorzano, a leading anti-Castro spokesman and a former
national security official in the Ronald Reagan administration,
warns that if the United States eases the embargo, ``the American
taxpayer will be asked to foot the bill'' sometime in the future
when Castro cannot pay.
</P>
<P>
   But many American entrepreneurs see Cuba as a risk worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all around world are selling products to Cuba and
getting paid,'' said L. Craig Johnstone, a former State Department
official in the Reagan and Clinton administrations and now a vice
president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Would you as a
business person have to keep an eye on your business? Yes. It's an
impoverished nation, but clearly there are a number of
possibilities there.''

 &HT;    Jethro Tull looks to future, nods to past
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ask Jethro Tull frontman Ian Anderson if he
sees a connection between his band and the cinematic rock spoof
``This Is Spinal Tap'' and he responds with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose Jethro Tull along with Black Sabbath, Deep Purple
and a whole bunch of other bands contributed wittingly and
unwittingly to the movie,'' he says, speaking by phone from his
home in England. ``I'm a great fan of it. It's not too far away
from real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's hard to take Tull too seriously. This was the
British band, after all, that wedded rock, blues and folk in a kind
of mystical package _ and named itself after an 18th-century
farmer/inventor. And there was Anderson, who played the flute and
danced on stage like a man possessed. Even by the psychedelic
standards of the '60s and '70s, it was not your typical group.
</P>
<P>
   Jump ahead more than three decades and Jethro Tull is still
going strong. Oh, the band has lost a few members along the way,
but Anderson and longtime guitarist Martin Barre remain. And while
its music is anything but commercial these days _ you have as much
chance of hearing Jethro Tull on a Top 40 station as you do a
Mozart symphony _ it continues to be loved by legions of older
fans.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ALBUMS
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder Anderson and the band have been able to release
two albums in the last year _ Anderson with his solo project ``The
Secret Language of Birds'' and the band with ``j-tull Dot Com'' _
and mount a national tour that comes to the Sunrise Musical Theatre
on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And while you can still laugh at the band's seemingly
Druid-inspired approach to rock spectacle and the philosophical
musings that creep into Anderson's lyrics, you can't laugh at the
facts. Jethro Tull has sold 60 million recordings and played more
than 2,500 concerts since its inception in 1967. Its releases from
the early '70s _ ``Aqualung,'' ``Thick As a Brick'' and ``A Passion
Play'' _ are still considered some of the most ambitious projects
of the concept-album era. It even managed to win its first Grammy _
for best hard rock/heavy metal performance _ with the release of
``Crest of a Knave'' in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   There's also something refreshingly honest about the group, both
in terms of its ability to laugh at itself and its faith in the
music it plays. Of the former, the 52-year-old Anderson says it's
better to be aware of one's reputation ``and build upon it
knowingly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been making a living on the self-deprecating side of
humor for the last 30 years,'' he explains. ``It's something I've
always based part of my presentation on, making fun of myself and
the others in the band.''
</P>
<P>
   TULL WON'T TRY TO CONFORM
</P>
<P>
   As for the music, that's another story. Anderson has no desire
to try to bring Jethro Tull up to speed in a music scene dominated
by trash-talking metal rappers or poster-boy pop stars. Mention
Carlos Santana's recent success with the ``Supernatural'' album
that joined the guitar great with several current chart-toppers and
you can practically hear Anderson sneer over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what you're looking for is some measure of commercial
success, you do what the guy at the record company tells you to do,
and that's epitomized by Carlos Santana becoming a guest on his own
album,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe radio won't play Anderson's recently released ``Secret
Language of Birds.'' In a way, it's the industry's loss. The
disarmingly simple acoustic album represents a gentler side of
Anderson, all pastoral melodies, fluttering flutes and the
occasional exotic instrument. The Jethro Tull frontman, who has
recorded two previous solo albums, says he relishes the opportunity
to create songs that don't necessarily have to work for his band.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm writing songs for a solo album then I don't have to
worry about making the drummer happy,'' he explains. ``You're
completely selfish and you let (the music) go where it wants to go.
And lyrically, I can be a little bit more intimate, a little bit
more personal, than in the context of a rock album.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the album's most touching songs is ``Postcard Day,'' a
sun-baked reflection on the joys of vacation, written during a trip
to Barbados. ``Well, I may be a hostage to summer, but I'm a
hostage, not a slave,'' Anderson sings in his soothing manner.
Still, the composer acknowledges the song stretches the truth a
bit. ``I'm not a great vacation person. . . . I start throwing
things around after three days and being rude to people,'' he says
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The album also explores some darker corners. In ``Sanctuary,''
Anderson contrasts the plight of child prostitutes in India with
aging zoo animals left abandoned. He admits that when he revisited
the song after completion, it made him cry. ``There are things I
have written that when I go back and listen to them, I do find them
quite emotional,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   SALMON-FARMING ANDERSON
</P>
<P>
   But if you get the impression that Anderson is turning all
touchy-feely, just ask him about his salmon-farming business.
That's right, one of England's most beloved rock stars spends a
good portion of his time raising fish _ and overseeing the 350
employees who work in his operation. If you dare question if
commercially harvested fish can compare taste-wise to the wild
variety, be prepared for an earful. Anderson will talk about the
cleanliness of the water and the diet of the fish and throw out a
whole range of technical terms. The bottom line? ``Farm fish have a
much more consistent taste,'' Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   The rock star is just as serious when he discusses the recent
shooting of Lake Worth, Fla. middle school teacher Barry Grunow, a
devout Jethro Tull fan. The news of the murder reached Anderson
right away. He doesn't blame the tragic situation on the gun
manufacturers. ``I was brought up around guns. . . . When it's part
of your society in a sporting context, you learn the responsible
attitude,'' he says. But he does have a different point of view
when discussing the culture of violence that today's children are
raised in _ just ask him about the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie he
caught by accident on television the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was blowing people away with a total lack of emotion . . .
that kind of violence breeds a complete lack of understanding,'' he
concludes. ``Schwarzenegger and the whole industry that supports
that, those are your killers.''

GUITAR GOD LIT UP ROCK _ AND BURNED OUT HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was a question that oozed sex, drugs and rock 'n'
roll, posed by an imaginative 24-year-old whose freak flag was
flying high and whose blistering Fender Stratocaster was cranked to
max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you experienced?'' Jimi Hendrix cried on his debut album
in 1967. ``Have you ever been experienced?''
</P>
<P>
   James Marshall Hendrix _ the shy, dreamy kid from Seattle who
played his guitar left-handed and upside-down _ would stand the
world of rock on its ear, set it afire, put blues to the acid test,
blow the minds of his tuned-in, turned-on generation, and, in the
waning days of the 20th century, stir a music-minded
multibillionaire to build the world's most expensive rock 'n' roll
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy was incredibly creative and set a standard that
prevails even today. He was one of a kind,'' said Paul Allen, the
Microsoft co-founder bankrolling the Experience Music Project and a
longtime collector of Hendrix memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Hendrixians, the techno-billionaire spent hours
trying to master the complicated licks of a man who never learned
to read music. ``After long nights of programming at Microsoft, I'd
pick up my Strat and try in vain to figure out one of Jimi's guitar
solos,'' said Allen, guitarist in his own band, the Grown Men.
</P>
<P>
   It was to honor Hendrix that Allen first proposed building a $50
million-$60 million museum at Seattle Center. The
10,000-square-foot rock 'n' roll shrine would be called the Jimi
Hendrix Museum, and house Allen's sizable collection of
Jimi-abilia. A decade, $200 million and 130,000 square feet later,
the idea has grown to encompass all of pop music and culture.
</P>
<P>
   But Hendrix's voodoo chile soul still lies at the heart of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Hendrix story begins on Nov. 27, 1942, at the King County
Hospital with the birth of a large baby boy, part black, part
Cherokee, part white. A teenage mom named Lucille, said to be as
interested in partying as mothering, named her big baby Johnny
Allen Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   It was the boy's father, James A. ``Al'' Hendrix, who renamed
his firstborn James Marshall after returning from the Army and
taking over the boy's care.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of young Jimmy's fascination with the guitar are
legendary.
</P>
<P>
   He transformed a cigar box into a guitar, worked out on a
one-string ukulele, played air guitar on a broom, begged his father
for five bucks to buy his neighbor's funky acoustic, and, finally,
convinced his dad to buy him his first electric, a Super Ozark
1560S.
</P>
<P>
   Singing would come later. ``Jimmy used to say he couldn't carry
a tune in a paper bag,'' said Al Hendrix. ``He just didn't have no
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Jimmy learned by ear, playing along to 45s and LPs of B.B.
King, Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry and other greats. Before dropping
out of Garfield High School and enlisting in the Army, he played in
several local dance bands with names like The Rocking Kings, the
Velvetones, Thomas &AMP; His Tomcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy would walk right across town if somebody said he could
probably play there,'' said his brother, Leon.
</P>
<P>
   After a medical discharge from the Army _ Hendrix injured
himself parachuting _ he set out to make a name for himself,
traveling as sideman with the King Curtis Combo, the Isley Brothers
and other hot R&AMP;B bands, often upstaging the players.
</P>
<P>
   He was already developing the flamboyant stage style that would
become his trademark, taking fashion advice from an over-the-top
showman named Little Richard and working out attention-grabbing
tricks on his amplified six-string. He played with his teeth,
played behind his back, played between his legs, flirting
suggestively with his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Soon his huge, wandering hands were doing things to a guitar
that no God-fearing folk mama would approve of. He spanked it,
yanked its springs, set off on steamy runs and perilous dives,
using his ring or microphone stand for a slide. He bent notes,
shattered riffs, distorted feedback and, always, turned up the
volume. His amps had two settings: off and high.
</P>
<P>
   On more than one occasion, he literally brought down the house,
with pieces of plaster falling onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   A teenage Jimmy had told his dad he would be famous one day. By
1966, with the Age of Aquarius in full flush, he was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   Critics would one day call him the Black Elvis, the Charlie
Mingus of rock. And on his way to the top, Hendrix had tried on
names of his own: Jimmy James, Maurice James, Cupcake, The Bat, The
Creep.
</P>
<P>
   But the hook that stuck in 1966 was Jimi. In London, with his
new name and a new band called the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the
young virtuoso released two hits that would soon become anthems:
`Hey Joe'' and ``Purple Haze.''
</P>
<P>
   European rockers loved the American hippie with the
here-there-everywhere Afro, the peace-and-love philosophy, the
rainbow clothes, the scarves and waistcoats, the onstage antics and
the backstage reputation for psychedelic drugs and free-love
groupies. ``The youngsters go wild for the ugly man with a perm,''
read an Italian tabloid headline.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, the band smashed into the American consciousness
with a performance at the Monterey Pop Festival, a show-buster that
climaxed with Hendrix dousing his guitar with lighter fluid and
setting it afire. America soon fell into its own guitar-induced
purple haze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible to be assaulted with all these screaming
winds,'' said guitar great Carlos Santana, one of hundreds
influenced by Jimi's style. ``He would really control that
instrument like a jazz player or a blues player would. It was like
controlling a demon and making it sing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three dizzying years, the broom-playing kid from
Seattle's Central District became the top concert draw in the rock
industry and one of rock's highest-paid stars. He deconstructed the
``Star Spangled Banner'' at Woodstock, reconstructed Bob Dylan's
``All Along the Watchtower'' in the studio and tripped out
audiences at every major Love Gen concert.
</P>
<P>
   They were three years of living high, drinking hard, moving fast
and, ultimately, burning out. In early September 1970, a
27-year-old Hendrix admitted to a Danish journalist that he didn't
think he would live to be 28. Before month's end, he was dead. He
suffocated in his sleep after mixing red wine and sleeping pills.
</P>
<P>
   The groovin' guitar god, often described as rock's answer to
John Coltrane or Miles Davis, had joined the Dead Musician Club, a
club that would soon include Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison _ and, in
1994, the Northwest punk icon Kurt Cobain, all dead at age 27 after
brief, incendiary stints at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix had thought often about death, dropping remarks about
having jam sessions in heaven, getting busted at his own funeral,
returning to Seattle in a pine box.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't meet you no more in this world,'' he sang on
``Voodoo Child (slight return),'' ``then I'll meet you in the next
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``And don't be late.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 30 years since his death, an estimated 2,000 posthumous
recordings featuring his music or spoken word have been released,
along with hundreds of covers and tribute albums of varying
quality.
</P>
<P>
   His life has been microscopically examined in dozens of books,
most notably the acclaimed ``Crosstown Traffic'' and ``Jimi
Hendrix: Electric Gypsy.'' Al Hendrix recently released his own
book with Aljas Enterprises, ``My Son Jimi.''
</P>
<P>
   A biopic from Showtime is shooting now in Toronto, to air in
September. And Friday the form-shattering, $240 million museum
designed to honor him opens in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other Elvis, Jimi lives.
</P>
<P>
   He knew he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny the way most people love death,'' a prophetic
Hendrix once said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you are dead, you are made for life.''

`STORM' SIGNALS: GEORGE CLOONEY BRACES FOR `THE PERFECT STORM' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment column.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of George Clooney
in scenes from ``The Perfect Storm.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    If ``The Perfect Storm'' is the monster hit that many are
predicting, there may be only one thing left afloat after things
blow over: George Clooney's movie career.
 &HT;    The fates of television stars who dump their shows for the big
screen have been checkered at best, but Clooney is determined not
to end up in the also-ran column. Since leaving the megahit ``ER,''
he has been working at warp speed to carve out a movie career to
match.
 &HT;    Clooney may have made a nostalgic return to his old stamping
grounds for Julianna Margulies' final episode of ``ER'' back in
May, but otherwise he's been focusing on the silver screen ever
since he hung up Dr. Ross's emergency-room blues.
 &HT;    Sure, his 1997 outing in the Batman suit proved little _ it
seldom does for anyone. And indeed he has yet to snare the
box-office equivalent of the brass ring.
 &HT;    But film fans and critics alike have been impressed as Clooney
has tackled a wide variety of films, from romances such as ``One
Fine Day'' (1996) and thrillers such as ``The Peacemaker'' (1997)
to quirky crime capers such as ``Out of Sight'' (1998) and war
movies such as ``Three Kings'' (1999).
 &HT;    In the process, he's held up well opposite such established
female stars as Michelle Pfeiffer, Nicole Kidman and Jennifer
Lopez, while working with top directors such as Steven Soderbergh
and Terrence Malick, for whom Clooney appeared in ``The Thin Red
Line'' (1998).
 &HT;    He's proven himself to be a rare commodity on screen: an
old-fashioned man's man _ think Gable with a sensitive side, Peck
with a sense of humor _ who also displays an aw-shucks,
all-American-boy quality reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart with sex
appeal.
 &HT;    Now he's bringing those assets to one of the most eagerly
awaited movies of the year, playing Billy Tyne, skipper of the
doomed fishing ship Andrea Gail, in the $100 million-plus epic
``The Perfect Storm,'' opening nationwide on June 30.
 &HT;    Originally Clooney was to play a supporting role to Mel Gibson
as Tyne, with Steven Spielberg directing. But when Gibson dropped
out _ reportedly, his $25 million asking price was too rich for the
film's already-straining budget _ Clooney stepped up, despite
misgivings that he might be too young to play the skipper.
 &HT;    Ironically, Clooney and Gibson will go head-to-head at the box
office as well, with ``The Perfect Storm'' opening the same weekend
as Gibson's Revolutionary War saga ``The Patriot.''
 &HT;    Based on Sebastian Junger's best-selling book, ``The Perfect
Storm'' was filmed partly in Gloucester, Mass., from which the
actual Andrea Gail sailed, and on a Los Angeles sound stage, where
some of the most terrifying storm scenes were shot using a computer
that can digitally generate 100-foot waves.
 &HT;    Those waves _ especially the immense one which concludes the
film's buzz-generating trailer _ are already the talk of the town,
but Clooney says that the core of the movie is still the people.
 &HT;    ``You've got to connect with the cast,'' the 39-year-old actor
says, wearing a black outfit topped with a Navy baseball cap and a
two-day beard stubble. ``You've got to feel for them, otherwise it
won't work.''
 &HT;    Filling out that cast are Mark Wahlberg, Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio, John C. Reilly, Diane Lane and Karen Allen, working
for German director Wolfgang Petersen, who knows all about
dangerous seas: He directed the classic submarine movie ``Das
Boot'' (l981), as well as ``In the Line of Fire'' (1993) and ``Air
Force One'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``The Perfect Storm'' is only part of Clooney's personal
whirlwind of activity. Besides his return cameo on ``ER,'' he also
recently produced and starred in the CBS live-television remake of
the classic Cold War thriller ``Fail Safe'' (1964). He's just back
from the Cannes Film Festival, where he was promoting his next
film, the Coen Brothers' Depression-era jailbreak film, ``Brother,
Where Art Thou?''
 &HT;    In addition to that one, due to open in October, Clooney is also
preparing for a remake of the old Rat Pack comedy/thriller
``Ocean's Eleven'' (1960), which starred Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin
and Sammy Davis Jr. in a saga about a bunch of guys in Las Vegas
who plan to rob a casino. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, who worked
with Clooney on ``Out of Sight,'' the film will have a star-studded
ensemble cast that, rumor has it, may include such heavy hitters as
Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts and Michael Douglas.
 &HT;    Those are big names for a former television actor to see paired
with his own, and imply that his campaign for movie stardom may yet
win out. At the very least, he's one of the hardest-working men in
Hollywood, barely resting between pictures.
 &HT;    He admits that his eagerness to work has put stress on other
aspects of his life, and says that it may have undermined his
recently ended three-year relationship with French kindergarten
teacher Celine Balitran.
 &HT;    ``I'm a workaholic,'' he concedes, ``and sometimes it impinges
upon my personal life.''
 &HT;    Not that he's planning to change. He won't be hot forever, and
Clooney _ the offspring of a show-business family _ knows that it
pays to seize the moment. After all, he spent 13 years toiling in
the television trenches, appearing in more than a dozen dead-end
pilots, before his ``ER'' breakthrough.
 &HT;    ``But I always told myself I was a film actor who just happened
to be doing TV,'' Clooney says. ``When things go well for you,
everyone compliments you and tells you you're great. When things
aren't going well, it's your fault and you're an idiot. As long as
you don't listen to the latter and don't buy the former, you'll be
fine.''

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By JAMES BROOKE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Every summer, after the steel bonds of winter fall away,
Montrealers leap forth for an outdoor season of street festivals,
cafe-hopping, bicycling along canals or simply strolling streets
imbued with the history of a city founded in 1642.
 &HT;    This bubble of Latin culture, the world's second-largest
French-speaking city, after Paris, has drawn Americans since the
days of Benjamin Franklin.
 &HT;    Promoting itself this summer as ``Paris without jet lag,''
Montreal can now throw in ``without the long ride from the
airport.'' All commercial air traffic now goes to Dorval
International Airport, a 15-minute cab ride from downtown, as
opposed to the 40-mile ride from Mirabel, the old airport.
 &HT;    Then there is the money: restaurant checks may look steep, but
subtract a third, because $1 American buys almost $1.50 Canadian.
 &HT;    As Americans reserve Montreal hotel rooms at the fastest clip
since the Expo 67 World's Fair, they will discover an attitude
change here. Montreal is on the economic rebound as investors
finally accept the ``French fact.''
 &HT;    With a huge concentration of college students, Montreal is
churning out a French-speaking middle class. With the French
language more dominant in Montreal than it has been since the
1760s, separatism is on the back burner and Quebecers are
increasingly self-confident and outward looking.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Fireworks set to music is the theme of the Benson &AMP; Hedges
International Fireworks Competition on 10 nights, which began on
June 18 and ends on July 30, over the old World's Fair grounds on
Ile Ste.-Helene. Among the competitors are Japan, Germany, Italy
and the United States. From 10 p.m. Seats range from $21 to $28 and
can be ordered from (800) 361-4595. Information: (514) 872-6222.
 &HT;    The Montreal Jazz Festival will include 400 concerts, 300 of
them free, largely in and around Place des Arts downtown, from June
29 to July 9. It is dedicated to Louis Armstrong and is expected to
draw 2,000 musicians and an audience of 1.5 million.
 &HT;    Among the performers expected are the trumpet player Arturo
Sandoval, the bassist Dave Holland and the vocalist Ranee Lee.
Information: (888) 515-0515. Schedules and ticket sales at
www.montrealjazzfest.com.
 &HT;    The last weekend of the jazz festival, July 7 to 9, is also the
weekend for Carifiesta, Montreal's Caribbean carnival. Like almost
everything else here, the festival has a French touch, drawing on
the traditions of Guadeloupe, Haiti and Martinique, with blasting
bands to lure 150,000 people into the streets. A parade will be
followed by a free party at the Champ-de-Mars, behind city hall.
Information: (514) 735-2232.
 &HT;    The Afro beat picks up July 13 with Nuits d'Afrique for 10 days,
some 30 concerts and nearly 300 musicians from Africa, the
Caribbean and Black America. Information: (514) 499-9239. The
schedule includes Miriam Makeba on opening night at the Spectrum
nightclub (tickets $35) and Tiken Jah Fakoly, reggae singer from
the Ivory Coast, in one of the free nightly concerts at Place
Emilie-Gamelin.
 &HT;    What's so funny about Montreal? Find out at the Just for Laughs
festival, July 13 to 23. Many of the 1,500 performances in French
and English by stand-up comics and troupes from around the world
will be free on outdoor stages along Rue St.-Denis. Among the
headliners are Tim Allen, Eric Idle and William Shatner. For
information, call (514) 845-3155, or visit www.hahaha.com.
 &HT;    July finishes with the Lesbian and Gay Pride celebration on the
31st. It draws from all over North America, with attendance
expected to hit half a million for the Pride Parade on the last
day, Aug. 6. An outdoor big-band concert is planned for
Emilie-Gamelin Park at 8 p.m. on Aug. 1, and a street fair will
take place at Ste.-Catherine East between Berri and Papineau on
Aug. 5. Information: (514) 285-4011.
 &HT;    Through Oct. 15, the Museum of Fine Arts, 1380 Sherbrooke West,
(514) 285-2000, will display 81 paintings, including Cezannes,
Renoirs and Picassos, on loan from the Musee de l'Orangerie in
Paris through Oct. 15. Open daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission $10.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The delights of a Montreal summer require footwork: strolling
centuries-old blocks and streets, inspecting architectural details,
reading historic plaques, window shopping on streets lined with
antiques shops, or sipping an allonge coffee at a sidewalk cafe.
 &HT;    The best neighborhoods for walks are Vieux-Port, the Old Port
section where the city began life 358 years ago; the Rue St.-Denis
restaurant, cafe and shopping streets; and Rue Ste.-Catherine, the
shopping and entertainment district.
 &HT;    For $13.50, the Montreal Museum Pass allows holders to visit 21
museums over two days. A good place to start is just off the docks
in the old port section.
 &HT;    The new Pointe-a-Calliere Montreal Museum of Archaeology and
History, Place Royale at Rue de la Commune, offers visitors a good
background on the city's development, starting with a fast-paced,
Monty Python-style bilingual multimedia show on Montreal's history.
The tower provides a bird's-eye view of Old Montreal and the St.
Lawrence River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday to Friday, 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m. weekends; (514) 872-9150. Admission $5.75, $2 ages 6 to
12.
 &HT;    If you need a break from the heat (yes, it can happen even in
Montreal), slip into the cool and soothing, robin's-egg-blue
interior of Notre-Dame Basilica, about three blocks up the hill
from the history museum, at 110 Rue Notre-Dame West. This graceful
Gothic Revival church was believed to be the largest religious
edifice in North America when it opened in 1829.
 &HT;    The architect, a New Yorker named James O'Donnell, was so taken
with its soaring, gold-leaf interior and stained-glass windows
depicting the history of Montreal that he converted to Catholicism
in order to be buried there. Admission is $1.35.
 &HT;    Four blocks away, at the corner of Rue St.-Laurent and the
river, Cirque du Soleil, the cultural ambassadors of modern
Montreal, offer their first large-screen film, ``Journey of Man,''
at the IMAX Old Port. Filmed all over the world, it follows a child
as he travels from birth to adulthood. $8.45, seniors and
teen-agers $7. Information: (514) 496-4629, or www.imaxoldport.com.
 &HT;    The Montreal Botanical Garden, 4101 Sherbrooke East, one of the
world's largest, hits full bloom in late June. With 21,000 species
of plant, the gardens sprawl over 30 acres, ranging from formal
European gardens, to a Chinese pavilion in the style of the Ming
Dynasty, to a 16-acre arboretum and 10 exhibition greenhouses.
Admission $6.45, seniors and students $4.75, ages 6 to 17 $3.20;
(514) 872-1400.
 &HT;    After stopping to smell the roses, you may desire more vigorous
activity. There's bicycling along an eight-mile lighted, paved path
from Rene Levesque Park to the Pere Marquette Promenade, a route
that passes by the Lachine Rapids. Bikes can be rented at any of
several kiosks in the Old Port.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    American tourism is expected to surge this summer, so expect
higher seasonal rates. Rooms can be scarce during major festivals.
 &HT;    With 487 spacious rooms, the Holiday Inn Montreal-Midtown, 420
Sherbrooke St. West, (514) 842-6111, fax (514) 842-9381, is a good
bet during the peak season. Many of the rooms have views along
Sherbrooke, Montreal's Fifth Avenue. Doubles are $114 to $150.
 &HT;    For the charm of Old Montreal, the Auberge du Vieux-Port, 97 Rue
de la Commune East, (888) 660-7678, fax (514) 876-8923, is a
late-19th-century stone building converted to a hotel. The 27
neo-classical rooms, in great demand, have brass beds, stone or
brick walls, and large casement windows overlooking the port docks.
Doubles are $129 to $179, including full breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: At the junction of the busy bar, restaurant and boutique
scene, at the corner of Rue Ste.-Catherine and Rue Crescent, the
Comfort Suites, 1214 Rue Crescent, (514) 878-2711, fax (514)
878-0030, offers 96 simple, comfortable rooms, each with balcony.
Doubles: $80 to $112.
 &HT;    One block to the east, the Novotel, 1180 Rue de la Montagne,
(514) 861-6000, fax (514) 861-0992, offers slightly higher priced
rooms on a street lined with boutiques and restaurants. The 227
rooms have bright, modern decor, and there is a fitness center.
Doubles: $87 to $135.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Ritz-Carlton Montreal, 1228 Sherbrooke West, (514)
842-4212, fax (514) 842-4907, the 88-year-old empress of Montreal's
Golden Mile, has just emerged from a renovation that added luster
to its marble bathrooms, its rooms appointed with antiques, and to
its piano bar and delightful garden restaurant. The
turn-of-the-century ambience melds nicely with two-line phones in
the 229 rooms. Doubles are $288.
 &HT;    The largest of half a dozen inns to open in historic buildings
in old Montreal in recent years, the Auberge Bonaparte, 447
St.-Francois Xavier, (514) 844-1448, fax (514) 844-0272, offers
views of Montreal's historic heart from many of its 30 individually
decorated rooms. On a quiet side street, the Bonaparte has an
excellent restaurant of the same name. Doubles $98 to $132.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    It used to be said that, after language and politics, food was
the favorite topic of conversation in Quebec. But now, judging by
the expanding waistlines of the graying separatist leaders, food
may be winning out .
 &HT;    My introduction to the sensuous culinary delights of Montreal
came last winter when a waitress at Toque instructed me to place a
chunk of warm foie gras on my tongue and feel it dissolve around
the sides. In an unpretentious setting on Montreal's restaurant
row, Toque, 3842 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 499-2084, is near the top of
the city's dining pyramid. Giving Quebecois products a new spin,
the chef, Normand Laprise, serves maple-syrup-glazed quail as an
appetizer, and roasted saddle of lamb with butternut squash and
fiddlehead ferns among the main courses. Dinner for two, with wine,
was $150. Reservations are essential.
 &HT;    Within walking distance of the Sherbrooke Street hotels is an
old favorite for a quiet romantic dinner by the fireplace, Chez la
Mere Michel, 1209 Rue Guy, (514) 934-0473. As flute music warbled,
we had lobster souffle Nantua and tournedos bearnaise. Dinner for
two, with wine, was $142.
 &HT;    In heavily French-speaking East Montreal, Laloux is an elegant
restaurant popular with the business crowd at lunch. It is run by
an expatriate French chef, Andre Besson, and is at 250 Avenue des
Pins East, (514) 287-9127, on a quiet street far from the tourist
flow. Laloux offers veal escalope with dried apricots, almonds,
muscat wine sauce and linguini, or poached red snapper with white
wine, a la mandarine, and crispy vegetables. Dinner for two, with
wine, $68.
 &HT;    An affordable place in the Old Port neighborhood is Stash's
Cafe, 200 St.-Paul West, (514) 845-6611, a Polish restaurant with a
Warsaw counterculture air. Ensconced behind thick stone walls with
views of pedestrian traffic, Stash's offers four-course menus for
$13 to $16.50. Specialities include zurek (a white borscht), wild
boar and strudel.
 &HT;    Pino, 1471 Rue Crescent, (514) 289-1930, with a heavily Italian
menu, is strategically perched on a second-floor corner, with
tables placed by the curving windows for people-watching along Rue
Ste.-Catherine. Calamari with garlic butter, a three-cheese green
pasta and beers came to $36 for two.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By RYAN J. DONMOYER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It was almost midnight and my girlfriend, Patty, and I were
tiptoeing behind our guide, deep in the bush of Stewart Island, the
smallest and least populated of New Zealand's three principal
islands. So far, we had seen three possums, but I had practically
given up hope of spotting a kiwi, the furry, nocturnal, flightless
bird that has been New Zealand's national symbol for more than a
century.
 &HT;    ``Use your fingers to filter your torch,'' whispered the guide,
Matt Gaze, of Kiwi Wilderness Walks. ``Kiwis cannot tolerate strong
light.''
 &HT;    Then, about 100 feet up the track, there was movement, and our
flashlights shone in unison. A pair of red, evil-looking eyes
beamed back at us. Another possum. ``I guess we should turn back,''
Matt said with a sigh.
 &HT;    My heart sank _ after four trips to New Zealand spent trying to
see in the wild just one of the elusive, charismatic creatures,
another chance to do so was slipping away.
 &HT;    We started heading back through the ferns to the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse where we would stay overnight as part
of our five-night package. Four hours earlier, we had hiked there
after a six-seater Cessna flew us about 25 miles from Riverton on
South Island, where we spent our first night, across Foveaux Strait
to the beach in Mason Bay on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    The homestead is administered by New Zealand's Department of
Conservation and is one of only two lodging sites on Mason Bay, a
three-day walk from Oban in Halfmoon Bay, where all 350 or so of
Stewart's human residents live.
 &HT;    This is kiwi country. There are at least 10 times as many kiwis
as there are people on the 670-square-mile Stewart Island, about
the size of Oahu in Hawaii, and these endangered birds are easiest
to spot on its unpopulated west side, near Mason Bay.
 &HT;    Only 75 years ago, with no natural predators, some 5 million of
the birds roamed New Zealand. Today, because of farming and the
introduction of predators such as cats, dogs and weasel-like
stoats, only about 75,000 of the six varieties of kiwis remain in
pockets around the country.
 &HT;    Their numbers are dwindling by half every 10 years, say
researchers at the Kiwi Recovery Program, a nonprofit venture
sponsored by the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of
Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. As a
result, despite being the country's mascot, most New Zealanders
have never seen a live kiwi outside of one of the dozens of kiwi
aviaries catering to tourists.
 &HT;    Although we, too, still had not yet seen a kiwi, we were finding
plenty of evidence of them. We encountered a few trekkers who had
spun tales of seeing kiwis feeding on the beach at sunrise or
plodding along the trails in front of them in broad daylight
(unlike the country's other kiwis, the Stewart Island brown kiwi is
frequently active during the day). Matt showed us holes where the
birds had plunged their long, pointy bills into the ground in quest
of worms and insects.
 &HT;    Once, he leaned over to pluck something off the ground. ``Kiwi
feathers,'' he pronounced, handing Patty and me tiny wisps of soft,
brown down.
 &HT;    And then there was the noise _ a repetitive, high-pitched
whistle by the males, and a coarser, raspier answer by the females.
Their calls filled the forest. Unfortunately, to the untrained ear,
they are easily confused with possum.
 &HT;    Suddenly, there was rustling in the bush about 25 feet to our
left. Another false alarm, I thought, as our flashlights swarmed
across the area until I finally saw movement.
 &HT;    ``There!'' I gasped. And the kiwi, a knee-high bundle of dark,
hairlike feathers, stepped into our makeshift spotlight. It lunged
with its long beak, using the nostrils at the end of it to snuffle
through the leaves. An instant later, it was gone.
 &HT;    ``Kill your lights,'' Matt whispered. ``And don't move.''
 &HT;    A moment later, the fern next to his boot shook, and the kiwi
stepped onto the track. My heart flipped. The kiwi glanced at us,
turned and waddled up the trail, its muscular legs supporting a
squat, bristly backside. Then it made an abrupt about-face and
plodded toward us. It sniffed curiously at Matt's boot, made
another about-face, and ran up the track into the dark.
 &HT;    I realized I had been holding my breath, so I exhaled. The whole
experience had lasted less than five minutes, but it had made the
entire trip to New Zealand worthwhile. ``I'm so happy we saw his
little face!'' Patty said.
 &HT;    I was thrilled, too. Seeing a kiwi in the wild had become
something of a life goal for me since becoming obsessed with the
birds 15 years earlier, when I lived in Auckland. I had tried to
book a one-night kiwi-spotting trip on Stewart Island in 1997, but
the tour had been full.
 &HT;    Patty, although this was her first trip to New Zealand, was also
falling in love with the kiwis, and was especially impressed by the
fact that compared with humans, they exhibit opposite sex roles.
 &HT;    Although kiwis live as monogamous pairs, the female is larger
than the male and is the dominant partner; the male tends to have
primary responsibility for incubating the eggs, which weigh up to a
third of the female's body weight. ``Ouch,'' Patty said.
 &HT;    As fascinating as they were, the kiwis were just one example of
the native New Zealand birds we would encounter. Matt had already
pointed out an area where local tribes of Maori (a Polynesian
people who inhabited New Zealand for nearly a millennium before
Europeans discovered it) gathered every year for a ritual harvest
of plump muttonbird. These birds are also known as short-tailed
shearwater, and the Maori have eaten them for hundreds of years.
 &HT;    Just off the coast of Mason Bay, most of the 62 flightless
kakapo parrots known to exist thrive on predator-free Codfish
Island. Stewart Island also is home to wild parakeets, bellbirds,
shags, heron, oystercatchers, large wood pigeons, rare dotterels,
and three species of penguin.
 &HT;    There are also tuis, which resemble priests with their jet-black
feathers and white tufts at their throats, and the cheeky,
flightless weka, which is often mistaken for a kiwi.
 &HT;    A few minutes after spotting our first kiwi we saw another, and
this time we were able to watch eagerly for a good 15 or 20 minutes
before it disappeared into the bush. We were still chattering
excitedly about the two sightings as the forest gave way to a
grassy clearing and the farmhouse where we would spend the night
appeared in the moonlight. It was basically a rustic cabin with no
electricity, an outhouse, and drinking water collected from
rainfall.
 &HT;    In the morning, Matt laid out a spread of muesli, powdered milk
and fruit. He boiled water on a gas camping stove and offered us
tea, which we greedily accepted.
 &HT;    ``Should be a nice day to walk,'' he said. ``And the kiwis are
more vocal where we're going at night.''
 &HT;    It was about nine miles through a swamp on the North-West
Circuit, a rugged 80-mile trail around the northern tip of the
island, to Freshwater Landing, where we would be staying that
night. After breakfast, we hoisted on our packs and set off. We
were joined by Marijka, a Dutch woman now living in New Zealand's
Southland, who had also signed on for Matt's tour. She set a
healthy pace.
 &HT;    Patty and I held back a little, marveling at the sheer
isolation. Stewart Island, known to the Maori as Rakiura, ``Land of
the Glowing Skies,'' really is a different world.
 &HT;    The day before, when the Cessna dropped us off at Mason Bay, our
little party had been the only people on the pristine,
10-mile-long, white sandy beach. When a man and a woman emerged
from the track ahead and began walking toward us, Matt said, ``It's
getting crowded out here.''
 &HT;    The absence of humanity was evident in unexpected ways. As the
terrain changed from grassy swamp to an archway of trees marking
the entrance of a new forest, there was furious fluttering above.
 &HT;    ``The bellbirds aren't too happy with us,'' Matt said. ``We're
trespassing.''
 &HT;    After we reached Freshwater Landing, another sparse
accommodation that we shared with a dozen independent trekkers
spread over two rooms of bunks, Matt prepared a scrumptious dinner
of pasta, sundried tomatoes and mushrooms. Pouring rain prevented
another kiwi-spotting excursion, so we went to bed when the sun
went down.
 &HT;    The next morning, we caught a reserved water taxi from
Freshwater Landing to Milar's Beach, to complete the journey by
kayak with Jo Paine, a guide from the Completely Southern Sky Sea
Kayaks Tour Company. After a few minutes of instruction from Jo
(Patty had never kayaked before), we paddled off into Paterson
Inlet, which has nearly 120 miles of sheltered coastline.
 &HT;    We drifted past oystercatchers, with their black bodies and
long, red bills. We passed several varieties of cranelike shags,
which flew inches above the water, hunting for fish. Before long,
we happened on a yellow-eyed penguin _ considered the world's
rarest _ floating on its back.
 &HT;    Jo took us up the Rakeahua River, where we got one last bit of
calm before the rain. Rain falls on Stewart Island 275 days a year,
according to the guidebooks. Only parts of Chile, Argentina and a
few remote islands off the coast of South Africa and New Zealand
are closer to Antarctica than Stewart Island, and the weather can
change suddenly.
 &HT;    What began as a calm, pleasant day trip quickly became an
adventure, as we paddled into nearly horizontal rain and rapidly
growing swells. By the time we made it to the boathouse in Halfmoon
Bay, we were like a bunch of drenched rats.
 &HT;    Fortunately, our final night on Stewart Island was spent in a
guesthouse called Ngahere. It had a view of Halfmoon Bay, hot
water, a fireplace and clean sheets on a double bed. After our 48
hours in the bush, the place felt luxurious. Over a dinner of bean
salad and the freshest salmon I have ever tasted,we discussed the
birds we had seen over the last few days.
 &HT;    ``Have you ever wondered how the kiwi lost its wings?'' Matt
said. The scientific explanation, he said, is that the kiwi is part
of an order of birds that includes the emu, ostrich and moa, a
giant flightless bird hunted to extinction by the Maori. The kiwi
evolved to be flightless over 30 million years because it had no
natural predators. But, Matt explained, Maori lore tells a
different story.
 &HT;    In the Maori version, the god of the forest, Tanehokahoka,
worried that the bugs were starting to eat the trees to death. He
asked three varieties of birds to live on the forest floor and eat
the bugs, but they all refused.
 &HT;    Finally, the kiwi agreed, even though it was told that it would
lose its wings and never see the light of day again. Tanehokahoka
was angry with the other birds and punished each of them.
 &HT;    Then, the legend goes, Tanehokahoka turned to the kiwi and said:
``You, kiwi, because of your great sacrifice, you will become the
most well-known and most-loved bird of them all.''
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: A LONG HIKE TO THE LAIR OF AN ELUSIVE BIRD  
 GETTING THERE  
 &HT;    My girlfriend and I flew from Los Angeles to Auckland, New
Zealand, on Air New Zealand, (800) 262-1234. Qantas Airways, (800)
227-4500, and United Airlines, (800) 538-2929, also serve Auckland
from Los Angeles.
 &HT;    To get to Stewart Island, we caught an Air New Zealand flight to
Christchurch on South Island, rented a car and drove eight hours to
Riverton. But we could have flown to Invercargill, the country's
southernmost city, about 30 minutes from Riverton.
 &HT;    From Riverton, we flew to Stewart Island in a six-seat plane,
landing at Mason Bay, on the uninhabited side, a flight that was
part of our tour package. It is possible to get to the island's one
township, Oban in Halfmoon Bay, by commercial ferry from Bluff, or
light aircraft from Invercargill on Southern Air, (64-3) 218-9129.
 SEEING THE KIWIS  
 &HT;    We took an organized tour with Kiwi Wilderness Walks, which is
run by Evan Bloomfield at the Riverton Rock Guesthouse, 136
Palmerston St., Riverton, New Zealand, (64-3) 234-8886; fax (64-3)
234-8816; www.riverton.co.nz/html/walks.
 &HT;    Although the peak time for such tours is November through April
(the summer season), they are available all year. The five-night
tour includes air or boat transportation to Mason Bay and three
nights on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    It begins and ends with a night's stay at the comfortable
Riverton Rock Guesthouse on South Island, a restored historic inn
with a half-dozen rooms, including one with an all-scarlet decor.
 &HT;    On Stewart Island, one night is spent at the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse with outside toilets; we spent
another night at Freshwater Landing on the North-West Circuit, but
now the tour goes straight to Oban for two nights. There, we stayed
at a guesthouse called Ngahere.
 &HT;    The kiwi-spotting tours take three to 12 people with each guide.
The price is about $500 a person (based on 2.18 New Zealand dollars
to the American dollar). The cost covers all meals and
transportation and five nights' lodging. The guide cooks during the
trek, featuring fresh fish.
 &HT;    Bravo Adventures in Oban offers a four-hour boat trip to see
kiwis every other evening. It costs about $28 but fills up quickly
and should be booked several weeks ahead at (64-3) 219-1144. A
snack and tea and coffee are served.
 WHERE ELSE TO STAY  
 &HT;    With only about 350 residents, Stewart Island offers few lodging
options. The South Sea Hotel, on Elgin Terrace across from the
wharf, (64-3) 219-1059, is the most modern and comfortable
accommodation for independent travelers. There are 26 rooms,
including 9 ``studios'' with private baths and kitchens. Rates
range from $18 to $36 for a double and $44 for a room with a view
of the bay. The studios are $48.
 &HT;    Another option is Stewart Island Lodge, Post Office Box 5,
Halfmoon Bay, Stewart Island, New Zealand, phone and fax (64-3)
219-1085; www.stewartislandlodge.co.nz. It has five rooms, all with
king beds, bath and electric blankets. There is a dining room and
lounge. Rates start at about $65 a person a night, including
breakfast.
 &HT;    More information on lodging and transportation is available from
the Stewart Island Visitor Center, (64-3) 219-1130.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY ANN BANKS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is the nature of armchair travelers to stay put, reading, not
wandering. But sometimes, when the wind is right, a book can send
us on our way.
 &HT;    On a winter's night some years ago in Oxford, England, Christina
Hardyment sat before the fire and read to her daughters from ``The
Wind in the Willows.'' This was their first encounter with Toad,
one of literature's most seductive dream peddlers.
 &HT;    Toad is by nature a traveling animal. He is met ``resting in a
wicker garden chair, with a preoccupied expression on his face and
a large map spread out on his knees.'' Before long, he's expounding
to Ratty and Mole his philosophy of the Life Adventurous:
 &HT;    ``Here today and up and off to somewhere else tomorrow! Travel,
change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a
horizon that's always changing!''
 &HT;    Reading those lines stirred in Ms. Hardyment a Toadlike urge to
fling off the shackles of everyday routine. The next thing, she and
her family had set out in a yellow camper on the journey of a
lifetime, a 4,000-mile quest for the roots of storybook Europe.
They tracked Pinocchio in Tuscany, explored Hans Brinker's Holland,
looked for witches and wolves in German forests, hunted Babar in
Burgundy.
 &HT;    I picked up Ms. Hardyment's 1987 account of their adventures,
``Heidi's Alp,'' in search of a few hours diversion _ and found
myself lured into a world of daring and delightful possibilities.
 &HT;    What ``The Wind in the Willows'' had done for Ms. Hardyment,
``Heidi's Alp'' did for me. Christina Hardyment became my heroine,
an even more inspiring apostle of waywardness than Toad himself.
Toad may have followed the open road, but he didn't take along four
children in his yellow cart.
 &HT;    Not that I necessarily meant to trace Ms. Hardyment's tracks
(for one thing, I was three children short). But her breadth of
vision encouraged me to think about expanding my own family's
horizons.
 &HT;    We'd taken our school-age daughter on vacations _ to the beach,
to Grandma's _ and made the obligatory haj to Disney World. It was
time to consider voyages of discovery, the kind of travel that
challenges coping skills, stretches the imagination and allows for
the possibility of magic.
 &HT;    Our pursuit of the Life Adventurous in the last decade has taken
us to foreign countries and to back country; some trips have meant
tents, sleeping bags and whitewater rapids, others have involved
passports, strange languages and, one storybook winter, Heidi's
Swiss alp (where Kate christened our sleds Schwanly and Barli,
after Heidi's uncle's willful goats).
 &HT;    Sometimes, Kate, my husband, Peter, and I have traveled
together, a compact nuclear family. Often, it's been just Kate and
me. And on one wonderful, intergenerational occasion, my mother
took Kate and me on a driving tour of Wales, where we explored
castles and visited members of the family my grandmother had left
behind when she emigrated. (As an intrepid traveler, my mother was
easily the equal of Christina Hardyment.)
 &HT;    Whatever our destination, we've been budget-minded, given to
picnicking on a riverbank or railroad-station bench. (I don't
consider this a significant compromise, since travel with children
pretty much precludes serious dining experiences anyway.)
 &HT;    Airfare is generally the biggest expense, so I've become expert
at harvesting frequent-flier miles, discount coupons and seasonal
sales. We even volunteer to get bumped in case our flight is
overbooked; twice we've been awarded free tickets that way, and
consider it the equivalent to winning the lottery.
 &HT;    Whenever trip preparations are underway, I expect to hear
graphic warnings against ``the horrors of travel in general and
with children in particular,'' as Ms. Hardyment herself observed.
 &HT;    At first, I found myself internalizing this cautionary chorus.
What if Kate didn't like the food? What if I found unremitting
motherhood hard to take at times? What if the hotel was a dump? _ a
distinct possibility given our budget.
 &HT;    By now, all those things and more have come to pass and we've
survived. (She ate rice; I got grumpy; we changed hotels.) In the
long run, none of it has mattered much, and we've learned to allow
for both ups and downs.
 &HT;    Of course, the effort to negotiate an unfamiliar environment is
inevitably humbling. How do you pitch this tent, anyway? What's the
system in this country for using a pay phone? Will the waiters
bring plain water if you ask? And how do you ask in their language?
Nothing like total ignorance of what's expected to make you feel
frustrated and stupid _ like a kid, in fact.
 &HT;    I like traveling to strange places with Kate because it requires
me to join her on the steep learning curve that is the constant
condition of childhood. Fumbling around together has been great for
our relationship.
 &HT;    I do have an agenda _ the time-honored educational one.
Depending on our destination, we might read the ``Tales of King
Arthur'' en route to Wales, or on the way to Belize study the
nocturnal habits of parrot fish (they spin themselves a sleeping
bag from their mouths). This is as much for my benefit as for
Kate's; seeing that she gets the most out of our travels has
prevented me from getting lazy.
 &HT;    But I've tried to take a relaxed approach. If Merlin's
prophecies aren't holding our interest that day, we explore
whatever Kate finds more exciting _ a wax museum, possibly, or a
store that sells China cat figurines.
 &HT;    Here again, Christina Hardyment is my guide. In the course of
the family's travels, she found herself imposing less and less on
her children, learning to ``sit back and follow them'' instead of
trying to lead all the time. They had as much to teach her as she
them, Ms. Hardyment came to understand.
 &HT;    ``Looking at the world through the children's eyes made it look
a lot less jaded and tired and a lot more fun,'' she wrote. That
has been my experience, too.
 &HT;    I'd always admired in passing the smartly dressed Parisian
children clustered around the sailboat pond in the Luxembourg
Gardens, but with Kate for company I was no longer a mere observer.
 &HT;    Being 9, Kate was first to master the subtleties of guiding the
progress of our rented wooden sailboat with a baton, but she
generously showed me how and allowed me a turn. In a city where I
have stored up many favorite memories over many years, the
afternoon my daughter and I lingered by the boat pond tops the
list.
 &HT;    And so I maintain that kids make great traveling companions _
contrary to popular myth, and in defiance of the anticipatory
Schadenfreude that passes for friendly advice. We who can hitch a
ride on our children's curiosity and imagination are the lucky
ones.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My department at work is in charge of arranging our annual
regional conference, and we don't want to repeat last year's
disaster _ too hot, too many bugs and too many guests at the hotel.
Plus, I know that many of my co-workers would like to bring their
families. Do you know of a resort that can accommodate us in
comfort?
 &HT;     A:  One of the best places I can recommend is the Marriott
Resort &AMP; Golf Club on Marco Island in South Florida. This resort
has mastered the art of having something for everyone.
 &HT;    The resort boasts over 40,000 square feet of meeting space
spread over seven outdoor function areas and three large, versatile
ballrooms.
 &HT;    You can also make use of the in-house production company, Wizard
Studios International, to design events that are suited to your
company's needs. After hours, your co-workers can take advantage of
one of the many lounges and restaurants.
 &HT;    The resort offers daily activities _ from sailing and shelling
excursions to parasailing, kayaking and windsurfing _ that take
advantage of the miles of shimmering white sand beach and the
tranquil blue-green Gulf waters. The 18-hole championship golf
course makes good use of the natural landscape.
 &HT;    Guests can also use the 16-court tennis complex, the health club
and spa options, island bike tours, and the three pools and
whirlpool. For kids, there are daily Kids Korner activities;
ping-pong tables; an arcade; and, on weekends, the ``Dive-In,''
where, instead of sitting in cars, they can watch movies while
floating in the pool.
 &HT;    It's easy to see why the Marco Island Marriott Resort &AMP; Golf
Club has won numerous awards for its full-service meeting and
convention properties as well as being named one of ``America's Top
20 Resorts'' by Conde Nast Traveler. For more information and
reservations, call (800) GET-HERE or (941) 394-2511.
 &HT;     Q:  Can you tell me if the Plaza Hotel in New York City is
really as special and luxurious as people say it is?
 &HT;     A:  Luxurious indulgence is what you'll find at the unsurpassed
Plaza Hotel. The Plaza has delighted young and old with memorable
stays for generations.
 &HT;    Located between Central Park and Fifth Avenue, The Plaza is both
contemporary and chic, yet exudes great charm. Highly attentive
service and attention to detail are hallmarks of this legend.
 &HT;    Rooms and suites are spacious, have exceptional high ceilings
and capture the feeling of old European charm. As an added bonus,
computers are available in all rooms and suites, and a beautiful,
8,000-square-foot spa and workout room are now open.
 &HT;    The Plaza is in a class by itself, and General Manager Gary
Schweikert plans to keep it that way. Room rates vary according to
season. Double rooms range in cost from $275 to $725; suites, $500
to $15,000. For reservations and more information, call (800)
527-4727.
 &HT;     Q:  My best friend and I are looking for a good golf package in
Las Vegas. Have you heard of any lately?
 &HT;     A:  The Golden Nugget, located in the heart of downtown Las
Vegas, is offering an amazing golf package that starts at $183.15
for two people. In addition to the room, the price includes green
fees, golf cart, tee times, bag storage and tax.
 &HT;    The Golden Nugget is ideal for quick-and-easy trips to
outstanding local golf courses, such as American Golf's Badlands
Golf Club, Las Vegas National Golf Course, Painted Desert Golf
Course and the Wildhorse Golf Club.
 &HT;    Guests are free to enjoy the amenities that the Golden Nugget, a
recipient of the AAA Four Diamond award, offers. The resort boasts
breathtaking views, first-class rooms and suites, live
entertainment, shopping, several dining options and a luxury spa
and salon. For more information or reservations, call (800)
846-5336.
 &HT;     Q:  I recently completed an extensive family tree and
discovered that I am distantly related to Austrian royalty. As a
result, I will soon be visiting this country to learn more about my
heritage. Do you know of any museums or day tours there that place
an emphasis on Austrian history?
 &HT;     A:  Even better, why don't you discover what it felt like to be
Austrian royalty by spending a few nights in a 12th-century
medieval Austrian castle? The Schloss Matzen bed and breakfast is
located in the Alpbach Valley, just 30 minutes east of Innsbruck.
Here, guests are transported back in time as soon as they set foot
behind the heavy stone walls and into the medieval ambience of the
local antique decor.
 &HT;    The small community of the Alpbach Valley celebrates its local
cuisine, music, festivals and customs, which are sure to give you
plenty of insight into the lives of your Austrian ancestors.
 &HT;    For more information, call Schloss Matzen at (888) 837-0618, or
visit http://www.schlossmatzen.com
 &HT;    This unique hotel _ and others like it _ can be found in the
Spring/Summer 2000 Specialty Travel Index, which costs $10 per year
for two issues. Send orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My fiancee and I are looking for an escape from reality. We
want to eat well, pamper ourselves and feel like the world is a
million miles away. Please help us find a luxe hideaway.
 &HT;     A:  The ultraluxe and secluded Little Palm Island is exactly
what you are looking for. Located three miles offshore in the
Florida Keys, this island hideaway is only accessible by boat or
seaplane.
 &HT;    This Relais and Chateaux property is also offering an amazing
couples package through Sept. 30, 2000. The Island Indulgence
package includes four nights/five days accommodations, a welcome
bottle of wine, three gourmet meals daily, one ``hot stone''
massage per person, a daylong snorkel trip, a private sunset
cruise, tax, gratuity and airport transfers. The package is priced
at $4,790 per couple.
 &HT;    The absence of everyday nuisances, such as telephones and
televisions, at Little Palm Island make it perfect for couples who
want to spend quality time together. Whether soaking up some sun on
the beach or relaxing in your bungalow, you are sure to feel
removed from the everyday grind.
 &HT;    Also, don't miss a visit to the full-service spa, featuring
professional therapists and ecologically balanced Pevonia Botanica
products. 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    From the Green Mountains of Vermont to the Sonoran Desert of
Arizona, the United States has plenty of vacation destinations for
adventurous travelers. Here's a sampling of trips for early fall.
Prices are per person, based on double occupancy, and land-only
unless otherwise noted.
 &HT;     Butterfield &AMP; Robinson  (70 Bond St., Toronto, Ontario, Canada
M5B 1X3; 800-678-1147; www.butterfield.com) has a ``Smoky Mountains
Getaway Walking'' trip, a five-day adventure that features a stay
at Blackberry Farm, a Relais &AMP; Chateaux property. Walkers also get
to spend the night in a luxury camp, when they're not walking past
the magnolia trees and red maples of the Great Smokies. The
September departure costs $3,695.
 &HT;    For the yachting set, the ``America's Cup Getaway Bike, Walk &AMP;
Sail'' is a five-day trip to Newport, Martha's Vineyard and
Nantucket. This trip combines biking and walking with sailing on
12-meter racing yachts. The September departure is $4,995.
 &HT;     Country Walkers  (P.O. Box 180, Waterbury, Vt. 05676;
800-464-9255; www.countrywalkers.com) has ``Utah: Natural Temples
of Zion and Bryce.'' During this six-day walk, which departs in
September and October, travelers stay in classic canyon lodges.
Equal time is spent exploring the crimson-colored cliffs of Zion
and the limestone formations in Bryce. The cost is $1,879.
 &HT;    The company also offers ``Arizona: Riches of the Sonoran
Desert.'' This seven-day trip visits Ramsey, Madera and Sabino
Canyons, as well as the Chiricahua Mountains. Exotic plant life and
wildlife are highlights of this trip. There are September and
October departures, and the cost is $1,969.
 &HT;     Equitour  (P.O. Box 807, Dubois, Wyo. 82513; 800-545-0019;
www.ridingtours.com) has a seven-day ``Redwood Coast Ride'' along
the coast of California that goes through Jackson State Forest and
includes a ride along 10 Mile Beach. In fact, much of the time is
spent riding on northern California's beaches.
 &HT;    Departures are in September and October, and the cost is $1,795.
This trip is perfect for intermediate riders, who can expect
upwards of five hours a day of riding.
 &HT;    Beginners might enjoy the ``Green Mountain Inn to Inn Ride.''
Timed for participants to enjoy foliage season in September, the
six-day ride is $1,650 and goes through Vermont's lakes region.
Riders stay in period inns and can expect to spend five to six
hours in the saddle daily.
 &HT;     New England Hiking Holidays  (P.O. Box 1648, North Conway, N.H.
03860; 800-869-0949; www.nehikingholidays.com) has a five-day trip
called ``North Carolina: Blue Ridge Mountains'' that follows the
route of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Hikers go through Moses Cone
National Park and have the option of ascending Grandfather
Mountain. There are departures in October, and the cost is $1,175.
 &HT;    ``Virginia: Shenandoah Mountains'' is a five-day hike through
Shenandoah National Park and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Highlights
include ascents of two, 4,000-foot peaks _ Mount Pleasant and Mount
Pompey. The cost is $1,175, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;     The Northwest Passage  (1130 Greenleaf Ave., Wilmette, Ill.
60091; 800-RECREATE; www.nwpassage.com) does international
destinations such as Crete and the North Pole, but it also focuses
on perhaps the most overlooked area in the United States for
adventure travel: the Midwest.
 &HT;    Their ``Isle Royale-Lake Superior'' trip is an eight-day
sea-kayaking voyage. The trip to the island, located 22 miles
offshore, offers what the company says is ``the most realistic
sealike destination for sea kayakers in the Midwest.'' This camping
trip runs in September and costs $825.
 &HT;    The ``Porcupine Mountains-Michigan'' is a four-day
hiking/camping trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The cost
for the September departure is $295.
 &HT;    River Odysseys West (P.O. Box 579, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho 83816;
800-451-6034; www.rowinc.com) offers a large number of western
rafting trips, although most of them will be completed by midsummer
due to water levels.
 &HT;    The exception is the five-day ``Snake Rmidsummerlls Canyon''
trip, which takes rafters through the deepest river gorge in North
America, Hells Canyon. On the border with Oregon and Idaho, the
river offers some of the largest rapids in the Northwest. There are
departures in September, from $995.
 &HT;     VBT  (P.O. Box 711, Bristol, Vt. 05443; 800-245-3868;
www.vbt.com) does the ``Lake Champlain Valley'' of Vermont for six
days in September and October. This is a biking trip, with an
optional half-day of sea kayaking on Lake Champlain, which lies
between the Adironadacks and the Green Mountains.
 &HT;    There are routes for varying abilities and an itinerary that
includes stops at such towns as East Middlebury. The cost is
$1,145.
 &HT;    The ``Purely Acadia'' trip is just that _ six days exploring
Acadia National Park. Most biking is done on the car-less carriage
roads that John D. Rockefeller built throughout the park. But there
are also trips to Swans Island and Little Cranberry Island. The
cost for the September departures is $1,395.
 &HT;     The Wayfarers  (172 Bellevue Ave., Newport, R.I. 02840;
800-249-4620; www.thewayfarers.com) offers a ``New Mexico: Land of
Enchantment'' trip, a six-day walk based in Taos and Santa Fe.
Walkers go to Abiquiu and the home of painter Georgia O'Keefe,
visit the Taos pueblo and wander through Frjoles Canyon. The cost
is $1,695, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;    The Wayfarers also have a ``Coast of Maine'' trip. Moving up the
coast, by van and by foot, travelers visit Damariscotta Mills and
explore the area around Camden and Rockport. The cost for this
September departure is $1,695.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By JAMES BROOKE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Every summer, after the steel bonds of winter fall away,
Montrealers leap forth for an outdoor season of street festivals,
cafe-hopping, bicycling along canals or simply strolling streets
imbued with the history of a city founded in 1642.
 &HT;    This bubble of Latin culture, the world's second-largest
French-speaking city, after Paris, has drawn Americans since the
days of Benjamin Franklin.
 &HT;    Promoting itself this summer as ``Paris without jet lag,''
Montreal can now throw in ``without the long ride from the
airport.'' All commercial air traffic now goes to Dorval
International Airport, a 15-minute cab ride from downtown, as
opposed to the 40-mile ride from Mirabel, the old airport.
 &HT;    Then there is the money: restaurant checks may look steep, but
subtract a third, because $1 American buys almost $1.50 Canadian.
 &HT;    As Americans reserve Montreal hotel rooms at the fastest clip
since the Expo 67 World's Fair, they will discover an attitude
change here. Montreal is on the economic rebound as investors
finally accept the ``French fact.''
 &HT;    With a huge concentration of college students, Montreal is
churning out a French-speaking middle class. With the French
language more dominant in Montreal than it has been since the
1760s, separatism is on the back burner and Quebecers are
increasingly self-confident and outward looking.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Fireworks set to music is the theme of the Benson &AMP; Hedges
International Fireworks Competition on 10 nights, which began on
June 18 and ends on July 30, over the old World's Fair grounds on
Ile Ste.-Helene. Among the competitors are Japan, Germany, Italy
and the United States. From 10 p.m. Seats range from $21 to $28 and
can be ordered from (800) 361-4595. Information: (514) 872-6222.
 &HT;    The Montreal Jazz Festival will include 400 concerts, 300 of
them free, largely in and around Place des Arts downtown, from June
29 to July 9. It is dedicated to Louis Armstrong and is expected to
draw 2,000 musicians and an audience of 1.5 million.
 &HT;    Among the performers expected are the trumpet player Arturo
Sandoval, the bassist Dave Holland and the vocalist Ranee Lee.
Information: (888) 515-0515. Schedules and ticket sales at
www.montrealjazzfest.com.
 &HT;    The last weekend of the jazz festival, July 7 to 9, is also the
weekend for Carifiesta, Montreal's Caribbean carnival. Like almost
everything else here, the festival has a French touch, drawing on
the traditions of Guadeloupe, Haiti and Martinique, with blasting
bands to lure 150,000 people into the streets. A parade will be
followed by a free party at the Champ-de-Mars, behind city hall.
Information: (514) 735-2232.
 &HT;    The Afro beat picks up July 13 with Nuits d'Afrique for 10 days,
some 30 concerts and nearly 300 musicians from Africa, the
Caribbean and Black America. Information: (514) 499-9239. The
schedule includes Miriam Makeba on opening night at the Spectrum
nightclub (tickets $35) and Tiken Jah Fakoly, reggae singer from
the Ivory Coast, in one of the free nightly concerts at Place
Emilie-Gamelin.
 &HT;    What's so funny about Montreal? Find out at the Just for Laughs
festival, July 13 to 23. Many of the 1,500 performances in French
and English by stand-up comics and troupes from around the world
will be free on outdoor stages along Rue St.-Denis. Among the
headliners are Tim Allen, Eric Idle and William Shatner. For
information, call (514) 845-3155, or visit www.hahaha.com.
 &HT;    July finishes with the Lesbian and Gay Pride celebration on the
31st. It draws from all over North America, with attendance
expected to hit half a million for the Pride Parade on the last
day, Aug. 6. An outdoor big-band concert is planned for
Emilie-Gamelin Park at 8 p.m. on Aug. 1, and a street fair will
take place at Ste.-Catherine East between Berri and Papineau on
Aug. 5. Information: (514) 285-4011.
 &HT;    Through Oct. 15, the Museum of Fine Arts, 1380 Sherbrooke West,
(514) 285-2000, will display 81 paintings, including Cezannes,
Renoirs and Picassos, on loan from the Musee de l'Orangerie in
Paris through Oct. 15. Open daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission $10.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The delights of a Montreal summer require footwork: strolling
centuries-old blocks and streets, inspecting architectural details,
reading historic plaques, window shopping on streets lined with
antiques shops, or sipping an allonge coffee at a sidewalk cafe.
 &HT;    The best neighborhoods for walks are Vieux-Port, the Old Port
section where the city began life 358 years ago; the Rue St.-Denis
restaurant, cafe and shopping streets; and Rue Ste.-Catherine, the
shopping and entertainment district.
 &HT;    For $13.50, the Montreal Museum Pass allows holders to visit 21
museums over two days. A good place to start is just off the docks
in the old port section.
 &HT;    The new Pointe-a-Calliere Montreal Museum of Archaeology and
History, Place Royale at Rue de la Commune, offers visitors a good
background on the city's development, starting with a fast-paced,
Monty Python-style bilingual multimedia show on Montreal's history.
The tower provides a bird's-eye view of Old Montreal and the St.
Lawrence River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday to Friday, 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m. weekends; (514) 872-9150. Admission $5.75, $2 ages 6 to
12.
 &HT;    If you need a break from the heat (yes, it can happen even in
Montreal), slip into the cool and soothing, robin's-egg-blue
interior of Notre-Dame Basilica, about three blocks up the hill
from the history museum, at 110 Rue Notre-Dame West. This graceful
Gothic Revival church was believed to be the largest religious
edifice in North America when it opened in 1829.
 &HT;    The architect, a New Yorker named James O'Donnell, was so taken
with its soaring, gold-leaf interior and stained-glass windows
depicting the history of Montreal that he converted to Catholicism
in order to be buried there. Admission is $1.35.
 &HT;    Four blocks away, at the corner of Rue St.-Laurent and the
river, Cirque du Soleil, the cultural ambassadors of modern
Montreal, offer their first large-screen film, ``Journey of Man,''
at the IMAX Old Port. Filmed all over the world, it follows a child
as he travels from birth to adulthood. $8.45, seniors and
teen-agers $7. Information: (514) 496-4629, or www.imaxoldport.com.
 &HT;    The Montreal Botanical Garden, 4101 Sherbrooke East, one of the
world's largest, hits full bloom in late June. With 21,000 species
of plant, the gardens sprawl over 30 acres, ranging from formal
European gardens, to a Chinese pavilion in the style of the Ming
Dynasty, to a 16-acre arboretum and 10 exhibition greenhouses.
Admission $6.45, seniors and students $4.75, ages 6 to 17 $3.20;
(514) 872-1400.
 &HT;    After stopping to smell the roses, you may desire more vigorous
activity. There's bicycling along an eight-mile lighted, paved path
from Rene Levesque Park to the Pere Marquette Promenade, a route
that passes by the Lachine Rapids. Bikes can be rented at any of
several kiosks in the Old Port.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    American tourism is expected to surge this summer, so expect
higher seasonal rates. Rooms can be scarce during major festivals.
 &HT;    With 487 spacious rooms, the Holiday Inn Montreal-Midtown, 420
Sherbrooke St. West, (514) 842-6111, fax (514) 842-9381, is a good
bet during the peak season. Many of the rooms have views along
Sherbrooke, Montreal's Fifth Avenue. Doubles are $114 to $150.
 &HT;    For the charm of Old Montreal, the Auberge du Vieux-Port, 97 Rue
de la Commune East, (888) 660-7678, fax (514) 876-8923, is a
late-19th-century stone building converted to a hotel. The 27
neo-classical rooms, in great demand, have brass beds, stone or
brick walls, and large casement windows overlooking the port docks.
Doubles are $129 to $179, including full breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: At the junction of the busy bar, restaurant and boutique
scene, at the corner of Rue Ste.-Catherine and Rue Crescent, the
Comfort Suites, 1214 Rue Crescent, (514) 878-2711, fax (514)
878-0030, offers 96 simple, comfortable rooms, each with balcony.
Doubles: $80 to $112.
 &HT;    One block to the east, the Novotel, 1180 Rue de la Montagne,
(514) 861-6000, fax (514) 861-0992, offers slightly higher priced
rooms on a street lined with boutiques and restaurants. The 227
rooms have bright, modern decor, and there is a fitness center.
Doubles: $87 to $135.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Ritz-Carlton Montreal, 1228 Sherbrooke West, (514)
842-4212, fax (514) 842-4907, the 88-year-old empress of Montreal's
Golden Mile, has just emerged from a renovation that added luster
to its marble bathrooms, its rooms appointed with antiques, and to
its piano bar and delightful garden restaurant. The
turn-of-the-century ambience melds nicely with two-line phones in
the 229 rooms. Doubles are $288.
 &HT;    The largest of half a dozen inns to open in historic buildings
in old Montreal in recent years, the Auberge Bonaparte, 447
St.-Francois Xavier, (514) 844-1448, fax (514) 844-0272, offers
views of Montreal's historic heart from many of its 30 individually
decorated rooms. On a quiet side street, the Bonaparte has an
excellent restaurant of the same name. Doubles $98 to $132.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    It used to be said that, after language and politics, food was
the favorite topic of conversation in Quebec. But now, judging by
the expanding waistlines of the graying separatist leaders, food
may be winning out .
 &HT;    My introduction to the sensuous culinary delights of Montreal
came last winter when a waitress at Toque instructed me to place a
chunk of warm foie gras on my tongue and feel it dissolve around
the sides. In an unpretentious setting on Montreal's restaurant
row, Toque, 3842 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 499-2084, is near the top of
the city's dining pyramid. Giving Quebecois products a new spin,
the chef, Normand Laprise, serves maple-syrup-glazed quail as an
appetizer, and roasted saddle of lamb with butternut squash and
fiddlehead ferns among the main courses. Dinner for two, with wine,
was $150. Reservations are essential.
 &HT;    Within walking distance of the Sherbrooke Street hotels is an
old favorite for a quiet romantic dinner by the fireplace, Chez la
Mere Michel, 1209 Rue Guy, (514) 934-0473. As flute music warbled,
we had lobster souffle Nantua and tournedos bearnaise. Dinner for
two, with wine, was $142.
 &HT;    In heavily French-speaking East Montreal, Laloux is an elegant
restaurant popular with the business crowd at lunch. It is run by
an expatriate French chef, Andre Besson, and is at 250 Avenue des
Pins East, (514) 287-9127, on a quiet street far from the tourist
flow. Laloux offers veal escalope with dried apricots, almonds,
muscat wine sauce and linguini, or poached red snapper with white
wine, a la mandarine, and crispy vegetables. Dinner for two, with
wine, $68.
 &HT;    An affordable place in the Old Port neighborhood is Stash's
Cafe, 200 St.-Paul West, (514) 845-6611, a Polish restaurant with a
Warsaw counterculture air. Ensconced behind thick stone walls with
views of pedestrian traffic, Stash's offers four-course menus for
$13 to $16.50. Specialities include zurek (a white borscht), wild
boar and strudel.
 &HT;    Pino, 1471 Rue Crescent, (514) 289-1930, with a heavily Italian
menu, is strategically perched on a second-floor corner, with
tables placed by the curving windows for people-watching along Rue
Ste.-Catherine. Calamari with garlic butter, a three-cheese green
pasta and beers came to $36 for two.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By RYAN J. DONMOYER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It was almost midnight and my girlfriend, Patty, and I were
tiptoeing behind our guide, deep in the bush of Stewart Island, the
smallest and least populated of New Zealand's three principal
islands. So far, we had seen three possums, but I had practically
given up hope of spotting a kiwi, the furry, nocturnal, flightless
bird that has been New Zealand's national symbol for more than a
century.
 &HT;    ``Use your fingers to filter your torch,'' whispered the guide,
Matt Gaze, of Kiwi Wilderness Walks. ``Kiwis cannot tolerate strong
light.''
 &HT;    Then, about 100 feet up the track, there was movement, and our
flashlights shone in unison. A pair of red, evil-looking eyes
beamed back at us. Another possum. ``I guess we should turn back,''
Matt said with a sigh.
 &HT;    My heart sank _ after four trips to New Zealand spent trying to
see in the wild just one of the elusive, charismatic creatures,
another chance to do so was slipping away.
 &HT;    We started heading back through the ferns to the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse where we would stay overnight as part
of our five-night package. Four hours earlier, we had hiked there
after a six-seater Cessna flew us about 25 miles from Riverton on
South Island, where we spent our first night, across Foveaux Strait
to the beach in Mason Bay on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    The homestead is administered by New Zealand's Department of
Conservation and is one of only two lodging sites on Mason Bay, a
three-day walk from Oban in Halfmoon Bay, where all 350 or so of
Stewart's human residents live.
 &HT;    This is kiwi country. There are at least 10 times as many kiwis
as there are people on the 670-square-mile Stewart Island, about
the size of Oahu in Hawaii, and these endangered birds are easiest
to spot on its unpopulated west side, near Mason Bay.
 &HT;    Only 75 years ago, with no natural predators, some 5 million of
the birds roamed New Zealand. Today, because of farming and the
introduction of predators such as cats, dogs and weasel-like
stoats, only about 75,000 of the six varieties of kiwis remain in
pockets around the country.
 &HT;    Their numbers are dwindling by half every 10 years, say
researchers at the Kiwi Recovery Program, a nonprofit venture
sponsored by the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of
Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. As a
result, despite being the country's mascot, most New Zealanders
have never seen a live kiwi outside of one of the dozens of kiwi
aviaries catering to tourists.
 &HT;    Although we, too, still had not yet seen a kiwi, we were finding
plenty of evidence of them. We encountered a few trekkers who had
spun tales of seeing kiwis feeding on the beach at sunrise or
plodding along the trails in front of them in broad daylight
(unlike the country's other kiwis, the Stewart Island brown kiwi is
frequently active during the day). Matt showed us holes where the
birds had plunged their long, pointy bills into the ground in quest
of worms and insects.
 &HT;    Once, he leaned over to pluck something off the ground. ``Kiwi
feathers,'' he pronounced, handing Patty and me tiny wisps of soft,
brown down.
 &HT;    And then there was the noise _ a repetitive, high-pitched
whistle by the males, and a coarser, raspier answer by the females.
Their calls filled the forest. Unfortunately, to the untrained ear,
they are easily confused with possum.
 &HT;    Suddenly, there was rustling in the bush about 25 feet to our
left. Another false alarm, I thought, as our flashlights swarmed
across the area until I finally saw movement.
 &HT;    ``There!'' I gasped. And the kiwi, a knee-high bundle of dark,
hairlike feathers, stepped into our makeshift spotlight. It lunged
with its long beak, using the nostrils at the end of it to snuffle
through the leaves. An instant later, it was gone.
 &HT;    ``Kill your lights,'' Matt whispered. ``And don't move.''
 &HT;    A moment later, the fern next to his boot shook, and the kiwi
stepped onto the track. My heart flipped. The kiwi glanced at us,
turned and waddled up the trail, its muscular legs supporting a
squat, bristly backside. Then it made an abrupt about-face and
plodded toward us. It sniffed curiously at Matt's boot, made
another about-face, and ran up the track into the dark.
 &HT;    I realized I had been holding my breath, so I exhaled. The whole
experience had lasted less than five minutes, but it had made the
entire trip to New Zealand worthwhile. ``I'm so happy we saw his
little face!'' Patty said.
 &HT;    I was thrilled, too. Seeing a kiwi in the wild had become
something of a life goal for me since becoming obsessed with the
birds 15 years earlier, when I lived in Auckland. I had tried to
book a one-night kiwi-spotting trip on Stewart Island in 1997, but
the tour had been full.
 &HT;    Patty, although this was her first trip to New Zealand, was also
falling in love with the kiwis, and was especially impressed by the
fact that compared with humans, they exhibit opposite sex roles.
 &HT;    Although kiwis live as monogamous pairs, the female is larger
than the male and is the dominant partner; the male tends to have
primary responsibility for incubating the eggs, which weigh up to a
third of the female's body weight. ``Ouch,'' Patty said.
 &HT;    As fascinating as they were, the kiwis were just one example of
the native New Zealand birds we would encounter. Matt had already
pointed out an area where local tribes of Maori (a Polynesian
people who inhabited New Zealand for nearly a millennium before
Europeans discovered it) gathered every year for a ritual harvest
of plump muttonbird. These birds are also known as short-tailed
shearwater, and the Maori have eaten them for hundreds of years.
 &HT;    Just off the coast of Mason Bay, most of the 62 flightless
kakapo parrots known to exist thrive on predator-free Codfish
Island. Stewart Island also is home to wild parakeets, bellbirds,
shags, heron, oystercatchers, large wood pigeons, rare dotterels,
and three species of penguin.
 &HT;    There are also tuis, which resemble priests with their jet-black
feathers and white tufts at their throats, and the cheeky,
flightless weka, which is often mistaken for a kiwi.
 &HT;    A few minutes after spotting our first kiwi we saw another, and
this time we were able to watch eagerly for a good 15 or 20 minutes
before it disappeared into the bush. We were still chattering
excitedly about the two sightings as the forest gave way to a
grassy clearing and the farmhouse where we would spend the night
appeared in the moonlight. It was basically a rustic cabin with no
electricity, an outhouse, and drinking water collected from
rainfall.
 &HT;    In the morning, Matt laid out a spread of muesli, powdered milk
and fruit. He boiled water on a gas camping stove and offered us
tea, which we greedily accepted.
 &HT;    ``Should be a nice day to walk,'' he said. ``And the kiwis are
more vocal where we're going at night.''
 &HT;    It was about nine miles through a swamp on the North-West
Circuit, a rugged 80-mile trail around the northern tip of the
island, to Freshwater Landing, where we would be staying that
night. After breakfast, we hoisted on our packs and set off. We
were joined by Marijka, a Dutch woman now living in New Zealand's
Southland, who had also signed on for Matt's tour. She set a
healthy pace.
 &HT;    Patty and I held back a little, marveling at the sheer
isolation. Stewart Island, known to the Maori as Rakiura, ``Land of
the Glowing Skies,'' really is a different world.
 &HT;    The day before, when the Cessna dropped us off at Mason Bay, our
little party had been the only people on the pristine,
10-mile-long, white sandy beach. When a man and a woman emerged
from the track ahead and began walking toward us, Matt said, ``It's
getting crowded out here.''
 &HT;    The absence of humanity was evident in unexpected ways. As the
terrain changed from grassy swamp to an archway of trees marking
the entrance of a new forest, there was furious fluttering above.
 &HT;    ``The bellbirds aren't too happy with us,'' Matt said. ``We're
trespassing.''
 &HT;    After we reached Freshwater Landing, another sparse
accommodation that we shared with a dozen independent trekkers
spread over two rooms of bunks, Matt prepared a scrumptious dinner
of pasta, sundried tomatoes and mushrooms. Pouring rain prevented
another kiwi-spotting excursion, so we went to bed when the sun
went down.
 &HT;    The next morning, we caught a reserved water taxi from
Freshwater Landing to Milar's Beach, to complete the journey by
kayak with Jo Paine, a guide from the Completely Southern Sky Sea
Kayaks Tour Company. After a few minutes of instruction from Jo
(Patty had never kayaked before), we paddled off into Paterson
Inlet, which has nearly 120 miles of sheltered coastline.
 &HT;    We drifted past oystercatchers, with their black bodies and
long, red bills. We passed several varieties of cranelike shags,
which flew inches above the water, hunting for fish. Before long,
we happened on a yellow-eyed penguin _ considered the world's
rarest _ floating on its back.
 &HT;    Jo took us up the Rakeahua River, where we got one last bit of
calm before the rain. Rain falls on Stewart Island 275 days a year,
according to the guidebooks. Only parts of Chile, Argentina and a
few remote islands off the coast of South Africa and New Zealand
are closer to Antarctica than Stewart Island, and the weather can
change suddenly.
 &HT;    What began as a calm, pleasant day trip quickly became an
adventure, as we paddled into nearly horizontal rain and rapidly
growing swells. By the time we made it to the boathouse in Halfmoon
Bay, we were like a bunch of drenched rats.
 &HT;    Fortunately, our final night on Stewart Island was spent in a
guesthouse called Ngahere. It had a view of Halfmoon Bay, hot
water, a fireplace and clean sheets on a double bed. After our 48
hours in the bush, the place felt luxurious. Over a dinner of bean
salad and the freshest salmon I have ever tasted,we discussed the
birds we had seen over the last few days.
 &HT;    ``Have you ever wondered how the kiwi lost its wings?'' Matt
said. The scientific explanation, he said, is that the kiwi is part
of an order of birds that includes the emu, ostrich and moa, a
giant flightless bird hunted to extinction by the Maori. The kiwi
evolved to be flightless over 30 million years because it had no
natural predators. But, Matt explained, Maori lore tells a
different story.
 &HT;    In the Maori version, the god of the forest, Tanehokahoka,
worried that the bugs were starting to eat the trees to death. He
asked three varieties of birds to live on the forest floor and eat
the bugs, but they all refused.
 &HT;    Finally, the kiwi agreed, even though it was told that it would
lose its wings and never see the light of day again. Tanehokahoka
was angry with the other birds and punished each of them.
 &HT;    Then, the legend goes, Tanehokahoka turned to the kiwi and said:
``You, kiwi, because of your great sacrifice, you will become the
most well-known and most-loved bird of them all.''
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: A LONG HIKE TO THE LAIR OF AN ELUSIVE BIRD  
 GETTING THERE  
 &HT;    My girlfriend and I flew from Los Angeles to Auckland, New
Zealand, on Air New Zealand, (800) 262-1234. Qantas Airways, (800)
227-4500, and United Airlines, (800) 538-2929, also serve Auckland
from Los Angeles.
 &HT;    To get to Stewart Island, we caught an Air New Zealand flight to
Christchurch on South Island, rented a car and drove eight hours to
Riverton. But we could have flown to Invercargill, the country's
southernmost city, about 30 minutes from Riverton.
 &HT;    From Riverton, we flew to Stewart Island in a six-seat plane,
landing at Mason Bay, on the uninhabited side, a flight that was
part of our tour package. It is possible to get to the island's one
township, Oban in Halfmoon Bay, by commercial ferry from Bluff, or
light aircraft from Invercargill on Southern Air, (64-3) 218-9129.
 SEEING THE KIWIS  
 &HT;    We took an organized tour with Kiwi Wilderness Walks, which is
run by Evan Bloomfield at the Riverton Rock Guesthouse, 136
Palmerston St., Riverton, New Zealand, (64-3) 234-8886; fax (64-3)
234-8816; www.riverton.co.nz/html/walks.
 &HT;    Although the peak time for such tours is November through April
(the summer season), they are available all year. The five-night
tour includes air or boat transportation to Mason Bay and three
nights on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    It begins and ends with a night's stay at the comfortable
Riverton Rock Guesthouse on South Island, a restored historic inn
with a half-dozen rooms, including one with an all-scarlet decor.
 &HT;    On Stewart Island, one night is spent at the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse with outside toilets; we spent
another night at Freshwater Landing on the North-West Circuit, but
now the tour goes straight to Oban for two nights. There, we stayed
at a guesthouse called Ngahere.
 &HT;    The kiwi-spotting tours take three to 12 people with each guide.
The price is about $500 a person (based on 2.18 New Zealand dollars
to the American dollar). The cost covers all meals and
transportation and five nights' lodging. The guide cooks during the
trek, featuring fresh fish.
 &HT;    Bravo Adventures in Oban offers a four-hour boat trip to see
kiwis every other evening. It costs about $28 but fills up quickly
and should be booked several weeks ahead at (64-3) 219-1144. A
snack and tea and coffee are served.
 WHERE ELSE TO STAY  
 &HT;    With only about 350 residents, Stewart Island offers few lodging
options. The South Sea Hotel, on Elgin Terrace across from the
wharf, (64-3) 219-1059, is the most modern and comfortable
accommodation for independent travelers. There are 26 rooms,
including 9 ``studios'' with private baths and kitchens. Rates
range from $18 to $36 for a double and $44 for a room with a view
of the bay. The studios are $48.
 &HT;    Another option is Stewart Island Lodge, Post Office Box 5,
Halfmoon Bay, Stewart Island, New Zealand, phone and fax (64-3)
219-1085; www.stewartislandlodge.co.nz. It has five rooms, all with
king beds, bath and electric blankets. There is a dining room and
lounge. Rates start at about $65 a person a night, including
breakfast.
 &HT;    More information on lodging and transportation is available from
the Stewart Island Visitor Center, (64-3) 219-1130.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY ANN BANKS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is the nature of armchair travelers to stay put, reading, not
wandering. But sometimes, when the wind is right, a book can send
us on our way.
 &HT;    On a winter's night some years ago in Oxford, England, Christina
Hardyment sat before the fire and read to her daughters from ``The
Wind in the Willows.'' This was their first encounter with Toad,
one of literature's most seductive dream peddlers.
 &HT;    Toad is by nature a traveling animal. He is met ``resting in a
wicker garden chair, with a preoccupied expression on his face and
a large map spread out on his knees.'' Before long, he's expounding
to Ratty and Mole his philosophy of the Life Adventurous:
 &HT;    ``Here today and up and off to somewhere else tomorrow! Travel,
change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a
horizon that's always changing!''
 &HT;    Reading those lines stirred in Ms. Hardyment a Toadlike urge to
fling off the shackles of everyday routine. The next thing, she and
her family had set out in a yellow camper on the journey of a
lifetime, a 4,000-mile quest for the roots of storybook Europe.
They tracked Pinocchio in Tuscany, explored Hans Brinker's Holland,
looked for witches and wolves in German forests, hunted Babar in
Burgundy.
 &HT;    I picked up Ms. Hardyment's 1987 account of their adventures,
``Heidi's Alp,'' in search of a few hours diversion _ and found
myself lured into a world of daring and delightful possibilities.
 &HT;    What ``The Wind in the Willows'' had done for Ms. Hardyment,
``Heidi's Alp'' did for me. Christina Hardyment became my heroine,
an even more inspiring apostle of waywardness than Toad himself.
Toad may have followed the open road, but he didn't take along four
children in his yellow cart.
 &HT;    Not that I necessarily meant to trace Ms. Hardyment's tracks
(for one thing, I was three children short). But her breadth of
vision encouraged me to think about expanding my own family's
horizons.
 &HT;    We'd taken our school-age daughter on vacations _ to the beach,
to Grandma's _ and made the obligatory haj to Disney World. It was
time to consider voyages of discovery, the kind of travel that
challenges coping skills, stretches the imagination and allows for
the possibility of magic.
 &HT;    Our pursuit of the Life Adventurous in the last decade has taken
us to foreign countries and to back country; some trips have meant
tents, sleeping bags and whitewater rapids, others have involved
passports, strange languages and, one storybook winter, Heidi's
Swiss alp (where Kate christened our sleds Schwanly and Barli,
after Heidi's uncle's willful goats).
 &HT;    Sometimes, Kate, my husband, Peter, and I have traveled
together, a compact nuclear family. Often, it's been just Kate and
me. And on one wonderful, intergenerational occasion, my mother
took Kate and me on a driving tour of Wales, where we explored
castles and visited members of the family my grandmother had left
behind when she emigrated. (As an intrepid traveler, my mother was
easily the equal of Christina Hardyment.)
 &HT;    Whatever our destination, we've been budget-minded, given to
picnicking on a riverbank or railroad-station bench. (I don't
consider this a significant compromise, since travel with children
pretty much precludes serious dining experiences anyway.)
 &HT;    Airfare is generally the biggest expense, so I've become expert
at harvesting frequent-flier miles, discount coupons and seasonal
sales. We even volunteer to get bumped in case our flight is
overbooked; twice we've been awarded free tickets that way, and
consider it the equivalent to winning the lottery.
 &HT;    Whenever trip preparations are underway, I expect to hear
graphic warnings against ``the horrors of travel in general and
with children in particular,'' as Ms. Hardyment herself observed.
 &HT;    At first, I found myself internalizing this cautionary chorus.
What if Kate didn't like the food? What if I found unremitting
motherhood hard to take at times? What if the hotel was a dump? _ a
distinct possibility given our budget.
 &HT;    By now, all those things and more have come to pass and we've
survived. (She ate rice; I got grumpy; we changed hotels.) In the
long run, none of it has mattered much, and we've learned to allow
for both ups and downs.
 &HT;    Of course, the effort to negotiate an unfamiliar environment is
inevitably humbling. How do you pitch this tent, anyway? What's the
system in this country for using a pay phone? Will the waiters
bring plain water if you ask? And how do you ask in their language?
Nothing like total ignorance of what's expected to make you feel
frustrated and stupid _ like a kid, in fact.
 &HT;    I like traveling to strange places with Kate because it requires
me to join her on the steep learning curve that is the constant
condition of childhood. Fumbling around together has been great for
our relationship.
 &HT;    I do have an agenda _ the time-honored educational one.
Depending on our destination, we might read the ``Tales of King
Arthur'' en route to Wales, or on the way to Belize study the
nocturnal habits of parrot fish (they spin themselves a sleeping
bag from their mouths). This is as much for my benefit as for
Kate's; seeing that she gets the most out of our travels has
prevented me from getting lazy.
 &HT;    But I've tried to take a relaxed approach. If Merlin's
prophecies aren't holding our interest that day, we explore
whatever Kate finds more exciting _ a wax museum, possibly, or a
store that sells China cat figurines.
 &HT;    Here again, Christina Hardyment is my guide. In the course of
the family's travels, she found herself imposing less and less on
her children, learning to ``sit back and follow them'' instead of
trying to lead all the time. They had as much to teach her as she
them, Ms. Hardyment came to understand.
 &HT;    ``Looking at the world through the children's eyes made it look
a lot less jaded and tired and a lot more fun,'' she wrote. That
has been my experience, too.
 &HT;    I'd always admired in passing the smartly dressed Parisian
children clustered around the sailboat pond in the Luxembourg
Gardens, but with Kate for company I was no longer a mere observer.
 &HT;    Being 9, Kate was first to master the subtleties of guiding the
progress of our rented wooden sailboat with a baton, but she
generously showed me how and allowed me a turn. In a city where I
have stored up many favorite memories over many years, the
afternoon my daughter and I lingered by the boat pond tops the
list.
 &HT;    And so I maintain that kids make great traveling companions _
contrary to popular myth, and in defiance of the anticipatory
Schadenfreude that passes for friendly advice. We who can hitch a
ride on our children's curiosity and imagination are the lucky
ones.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My department at work is in charge of arranging our annual
regional conference, and we don't want to repeat last year's
disaster _ too hot, too many bugs and too many guests at the hotel.
Plus, I know that many of my co-workers would like to bring their
families. Do you know of a resort that can accommodate us in
comfort?
 &HT;     A:  One of the best places I can recommend is the Marriott
Resort &AMP; Golf Club on Marco Island in South Florida. This resort
has mastered the art of having something for everyone.
 &HT;    The resort boasts over 40,000 square feet of meeting space
spread over seven outdoor function areas and three large, versatile
ballrooms.
 &HT;    You can also make use of the in-house production company, Wizard
Studios International, to design events that are suited to your
company's needs. After hours, your co-workers can take advantage of
one of the many lounges and restaurants.
 &HT;    The resort offers daily activities _ from sailing and shelling
excursions to parasailing, kayaking and windsurfing _ that take
advantage of the miles of shimmering white sand beach and the
tranquil blue-green Gulf waters. The 18-hole championship golf
course makes good use of the natural landscape.
 &HT;    Guests can also use the 16-court tennis complex, the health club
and spa options, island bike tours, and the three pools and
whirlpool. For kids, there are daily Kids Korner activities;
ping-pong tables; an arcade; and, on weekends, the ``Dive-In,''
where, instead of sitting in cars, they can watch movies while
floating in the pool.
 &HT;    It's easy to see why the Marco Island Marriott Resort &AMP; Golf
Club has won numerous awards for its full-service meeting and
convention properties as well as being named one of ``America's Top
20 Resorts'' by Conde Nast Traveler. For more information and
reservations, call (800) GET-HERE or (941) 394-2511.
 &HT;     Q:  Can you tell me if the Plaza Hotel in New York City is
really as special and luxurious as people say it is?
 &HT;     A:  Luxurious indulgence is what you'll find at the unsurpassed
Plaza Hotel. The Plaza has delighted young and old with memorable
stays for generations.
 &HT;    Located between Central Park and Fifth Avenue, The Plaza is both
contemporary and chic, yet exudes great charm. Highly attentive
service and attention to detail are hallmarks of this legend.
 &HT;    Rooms and suites are spacious, have exceptional high ceilings
and capture the feeling of old European charm. As an added bonus,
computers are available in all rooms and suites, and a beautiful,
8,000-square-foot spa and workout room are now open.
 &HT;    The Plaza is in a class by itself, and General Manager Gary
Schweikert plans to keep it that way. Room rates vary according to
season. Double rooms range in cost from $275 to $725; suites, $500
to $15,000. For reservations and more information, call (800)
527-4727.
 &HT;     Q:  My best friend and I are looking for a good golf package in
Las Vegas. Have you heard of any lately?
 &HT;     A:  The Golden Nugget, located in the heart of downtown Las
Vegas, is offering an amazing golf package that starts at $183.15
for two people. In addition to the room, the price includes green
fees, golf cart, tee times, bag storage and tax.
 &HT;    The Golden Nugget is ideal for quick-and-easy trips to
outstanding local golf courses, such as American Golf's Badlands
Golf Club, Las Vegas National Golf Course, Painted Desert Golf
Course and the Wildhorse Golf Club.
 &HT;    Guests are free to enjoy the amenities that the Golden Nugget, a
recipient of the AAA Four Diamond award, offers. The resort boasts
breathtaking views, first-class rooms and suites, live
entertainment, shopping, several dining options and a luxury spa
and salon. For more information or reservations, call (800)
846-5336.
 &HT;     Q:  I recently completed an extensive family tree and
discovered that I am distantly related to Austrian royalty. As a
result, I will soon be visiting this country to learn more about my
heritage. Do you know of any museums or day tours there that place
an emphasis on Austrian history?
 &HT;     A:  Even better, why don't you discover what it felt like to be
Austrian royalty by spending a few nights in a 12th-century
medieval Austrian castle? The Schloss Matzen bed and breakfast is
located in the Alpbach Valley, just 30 minutes east of Innsbruck.
Here, guests are transported back in time as soon as they set foot
behind the heavy stone walls and into the medieval ambience of the
local antique decor.
 &HT;    The small community of the Alpbach Valley celebrates its local
cuisine, music, festivals and customs, which are sure to give you
plenty of insight into the lives of your Austrian ancestors.
 &HT;    For more information, call Schloss Matzen at (888) 837-0618, or
visit http://www.schlossmatzen.com
 &HT;    This unique hotel _ and others like it _ can be found in the
Spring/Summer 2000 Specialty Travel Index, which costs $10 per year
for two issues. Send orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My fiancee and I are looking for an escape from reality. We
want to eat well, pamper ourselves and feel like the world is a
million miles away. Please help us find a luxe hideaway.
 &HT;     A:  The ultraluxe and secluded Little Palm Island is exactly
what you are looking for. Located three miles offshore in the
Florida Keys, this island hideaway is only accessible by boat or
seaplane.
 &HT;    This Relais and Chateaux property is also offering an amazing
couples package through Sept. 30, 2000. The Island Indulgence
package includes four nights/five days accommodations, a welcome
bottle of wine, three gourmet meals daily, one ``hot stone''
massage per person, a daylong snorkel trip, a private sunset
cruise, tax, gratuity and airport transfers. The package is priced
at $4,790 per couple.
 &HT;    The absence of everyday nuisances, such as telephones and
televisions, at Little Palm Island make it perfect for couples who
want to spend quality time together. Whether soaking up some sun on
the beach or relaxing in your bungalow, you are sure to feel
removed from the everyday grind.
 &HT;    Also, don't miss a visit to the full-service spa, featuring
professional therapists and ecologically balanced Pevonia Botanica
products. 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    From the Green Mountains of Vermont to the Sonoran Desert of
Arizona, the United States has plenty of vacation destinations for
adventurous travelers. Here's a sampling of trips for early fall.
Prices are per person, based on double occupancy, and land-only
unless otherwise noted.
 &HT;     Butterfield &AMP; Robinson  (70 Bond St., Toronto, Ontario, Canada
M5B 1X3; 800-678-1147; www.butterfield.com) has a ``Smoky Mountains
Getaway Walking'' trip, a five-day adventure that features a stay
at Blackberry Farm, a Relais &AMP; Chateaux property. Walkers also get
to spend the night in a luxury camp, when they're not walking past
the magnolia trees and red maples of the Great Smokies. The
September departure costs $3,695.
 &HT;    For the yachting set, the ``America's Cup Getaway Bike, Walk &AMP;
Sail'' is a five-day trip to Newport, Martha's Vineyard and
Nantucket. This trip combines biking and walking with sailing on
12-meter racing yachts. The September departure is $4,995.
 &HT;     Country Walkers  (P.O. Box 180, Waterbury, Vt. 05676;
800-464-9255; www.countrywalkers.com) has ``Utah: Natural Temples
of Zion and Bryce.'' During this six-day walk, which departs in
September and October, travelers stay in classic canyon lodges.
Equal time is spent exploring the crimson-colored cliffs of Zion
and the limestone formations in Bryce. The cost is $1,879.
 &HT;    The company also offers ``Arizona: Riches of the Sonoran
Desert.'' This seven-day trip visits Ramsey, Madera and Sabino
Canyons, as well as the Chiricahua Mountains. Exotic plant life and
wildlife are highlights of this trip. There are September and
October departures, and the cost is $1,969.
 &HT;     Equitour  (P.O. Box 807, Dubois, Wyo. 82513; 800-545-0019;
www.ridingtours.com) has a seven-day ``Redwood Coast Ride'' along
the coast of California that goes through Jackson State Forest and
includes a ride along 10 Mile Beach. In fact, much of the time is
spent riding on northern California's beaches.
 &HT;    Departures are in September and October, and the cost is $1,795.
This trip is perfect for intermediate riders, who can expect
upwards of five hours a day of riding.
 &HT;    Beginners might enjoy the ``Green Mountain Inn to Inn Ride.''
Timed for participants to enjoy foliage season in September, the
six-day ride is $1,650 and goes through Vermont's lakes region.
Riders stay in period inns and can expect to spend five to six
hours in the saddle daily.
 &HT;     New England Hiking Holidays  (P.O. Box 1648, North Conway, N.H.
03860; 800-869-0949; www.nehikingholidays.com) has a five-day trip
called ``North Carolina: Blue Ridge Mountains'' that follows the
route of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Hikers go through Moses Cone
National Park and have the option of ascending Grandfather
Mountain. There are departures in October, and the cost is $1,175.
 &HT;    ``Virginia: Shenandoah Mountains'' is a five-day hike through
Shenandoah National Park and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Highlights
include ascents of two, 4,000-foot peaks _ Mount Pleasant and Mount
Pompey. The cost is $1,175, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;     The Northwest Passage  (1130 Greenleaf Ave., Wilmette, Ill.
60091; 800-RECREATE; www.nwpassage.com) does international
destinations such as Crete and the North Pole, but it also focuses
on perhaps the most overlooked area in the United States for
adventure travel: the Midwest.
 &HT;    Their ``Isle Royale-Lake Superior'' trip is an eight-day
sea-kayaking voyage. The trip to the island, located 22 miles
offshore, offers what the company says is ``the most realistic
sealike destination for sea kayakers in the Midwest.'' This camping
trip runs in September and costs $825.
 &HT;    The ``Porcupine Mountains-Michigan'' is a four-day
hiking/camping trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The cost
for the September departure is $295.
 &HT;    River Odysseys West (P.O. Box 579, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho 83816;
800-451-6034; www.rowinc.com) offers a large number of western
rafting trips, although most of them will be completed by midsummer
due to water levels.
 &HT;    The exception is the five-day ``Snake Rmidsummerlls Canyon''
trip, which takes rafters through the deepest river gorge in North
America, Hells Canyon. On the border with Oregon and Idaho, the
river offers some of the largest rapids in the Northwest. There are

IT'S A FOXY LADY, A SMASHED GUITAR _ IT'S THE EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A purple haze has settled over Seattle and it's not going away.
Make that a red, silver, gold and baby blue haze with a purple
accent.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gehry's design for the Experience Music Project is a
rising tide that lifts all boats. Not only does EMP look smashing
on its own, it casts a festive air over its drab neighbors. They
include most of the buildings at Seattle Center, those forlorn
survivors from the 1962 World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
   The Monorail also gets a big boost. Thanks to Gehry, there's
finally a reason to ride it. Its trains cruise through the
undulating folds of his building's exterior, causing adults to
blink and babies to chortle.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Center owes a big debt to the Los Angeles architect, but
he in turn owes one to Seattle Center. The place is perfect for
what he wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   That goal is easy to define: He wanted to make something new.
With this painted aluminum, glass and steel extravaganza, he
succeeded. As he put it himself when he was in town last month,
``Nobody has seen this before or will see it again. Nobody will
build another one.''
</P>
<P>
   The voluptuous splendor of Gehry's Guggenheim Museum, which
opened in 1997 in Bilbao, Spain, earned him worldwide acclaim.
Acclaimed work has its downside, because it becomes the measure of
everything else an architect does.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry didn't want EMP to be Bilbao II. EMP isn't as elegant, but
it wasn't designed to be elegant. It strikes out on its own to
pursue different ends and come to different conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Bilbao put a dazzling cap on 20th-century architecture, and EMP
greets the new century with a novel way for a building to take up
space yet stay in motion.
</P>
<P>
   EMP is Gehry's first major foray into 21st-century architecture,
and it was inspired by rock 'n' roll. Since rock 'n' roll got its
start in the 1950s, Gehry dipped back to a 1950s/early 1960s
futurism to animate his building.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Seattle Center needs to take a bow. When it comes
to back-to-the-future chic, few places are as well-endowed. The
Space Needle and the Monorail are classics of the genre, as is the
center's fountain, that stranded, soaker-hose of a flying saucer.
</P>
<P>
   EMP could be a stage set for an updated version of the old movie
serial, ``Terry and the Pirates,'' especially inside, where the
walls give the impression of being on the verge of shrinking in on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Flash Gordon wouldn't need to go inside. He could fight off evil
forces with the lightning bolts he'd send zigzagging from the
flying edges of the building's colorful gown.
</P>
<P>
   If Bilbao were a jewel, you'd have to insure it and keep it in a
bank vault. If EMP were a jewel, you could buy it at Woolworth's
and wear it to upstage the queen.
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll is democratic. I.M. Pei's Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame Museum in Cleveland is high-toned, and it's a disaster. Paul
Allen and his sister Jody Patton wanted Gehry to do more than
create a house for their memories of rock music.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted the building to be a kind of rock music, and that's
what it is. It gives physical form to a backbeat as basic as a
heart's.
</P>
<P>
   Rock has acquired its own highly educated experts, but the music
has been hedonistic from the start. To convey this, Gehry got
another gift from Seattle Center. EMP is right next to the Fun
Forest amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   The front entrance to EMP on Fifth Avenue is not the best place
to see it. For the full effect, stroll through the amusement park
on the west side.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry's building picks up on the blue water rippling down the
front of the log ride, amplifies it and bounces it back off the
multicolored roller coaster. What was a vacancy at the heart of the
park now has focus and direction. The once-tired Fun Forest is born
again, and this time it's born to boogie.
</P>
<P>
   Because he prefers Haydn to Hendrix, Gehry said he relied on his
staff for rock 'n' roll expertise. Thinking that over as reporters
wrote it down, he went on to claim some familiarity with 1960s
rock, from Rambling Jack Elliott to the Mamas and the Papas. ``Cass
Elliott (Mama Cass) was a friend,'' he said. EMP and Elliott: The
two have a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that Allen's $100 million tribute to his idol, Jimi
Hendrix, is actually a tribute to Gehry's friend? Remember, she was
the large one who could dazzle when she danced.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the kind of grace Gehry's building has, the grace
of a fat person with fleet feet.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five feet high at its top, EMP is broad of beam, flaring
out in lumbering sections to curve in at a surprisingly dainty
base.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry loves the exuberant assemblages of Robert Rauschenberg,
and it's easy to see Rauschenberg's influence in the lumbering
blocks of the building's colors nestled side to side like buffaloes
at a watering hole.
</P>
<P>
   But EMP is even closer to Gaston LaChaise's bronze homages to
the fine figure of his wife early in the last century. Her huge
breasts, belly, hips and thighs extend down to tiny, tapered feet.
She floats in place as if she were made of air.
</P>
<P>
   LaChaise's nudes have an unabashed sexuality never seen before
in American sculpture. EMP is sexy, too. It's a building devoted to
the spirit of a sexy fat girl. It honors Elliott and all the other
big mamas in rock who just want to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the fun gets a little crowded. EMP officials say 2,250
people can be in the 140,000-square-foot museum at any one time,
but that many people better be in a friendly mood. Claustrophobics
beware: EMP's interiors will stick to you like a cheap suit.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry designed the front lobby, the bookstore and the cafe. All
are appropriately swoopy. They undulate through space with a
frenzied energy. They bear a resemblance to the stage sets for the
1919 silent movie, ``The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,'' which were
created to reflect the mind of a madman.
</P>
<P>
   The interior design of the rest of the space doesn't rise to
Gehry's level. It's Gehry-lite, but so packed with heady,
interactive experiences, it won't matter much.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, EMP is an experience worth having. Is it
based on the shape of smashed guitars, the inner ear or the outer
hills of Mongolia? Because Gehry is not a literalist, he welcomes
all metaphors, especially when they pile on top of each other. The
building is what you think it is.
</P>
<P>
   Roll over, Beethoven, and wake up, Little Susie. London may be
calling, but Seattle is now world headquarters for rock history.

SHARK ATTACKS IN GULF OF MEXICO EMPHASIZE UNPREDICTABILITY OF
SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by SHARK ATTACKS-ODDS and SHARK ATTACKS-TIPS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This mid-Saturday in June is one of the few times Kenny
Alexander, 17, has ever surfed off Texas' Padre Island and not seen
a shark. A flash of silver here. A fin over there. An underwater
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of miles away, tropical depression Bud is forming in
the Pacific, causing gradual shifts in the Gulf of Mexico's
weather. Thunderclouds pile high, and the wind picks up. The water
this day is murky with seaweed and sand kicked up by the 60,000
people attending a radio-station sponsored sandcastle contest just
down the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Rock music blares. Fishermen on the nearby pier at J.P. Luby
Surf Park dangle bloodied bait into the water. Other fishermen
farther up the shore stand in the surf, chest deep in water,
strings of recent catches dangling from lines tied to their waists.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny and his surfing pals tease one another. ``Shark! Get out
of the water!'' they yell, and then laugh. Only 14 shark attacks
have been recorded off the Texas coast since 1959.
</P>
<P>
   But within two days in this very June, three people are attacked
by sharks in the Gulf of Mexico. Kenny is one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   He is straddling his board, his feet dangling off as he paddles
out to about the third row of waves offshore. The whiteness of the
untanned sole of his foot is in contrast to the murky water. And
then comes the pain. Something is bearing down on his foot, shaking
it, then letting go. He never sees the shark. Instinctively he
yells. ``Shark!''
</P>
<P>
   He swims to shore. Blood pumps from a row of puncture wounds on
his foot. Doctors would later say he was bitten by a 4- to 6-foot
shark. Beachgoers just stare at him, dumbfounded. This doesn't
happen here.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``A shark! I've never heard of that around here. You see one
once in a while, but they never do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ellen Brody, wife of the police chief in Peter Benchley's
novel ``Jaws,'' released as a Steven Spielberg movie 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The shark that bit Kenny Alexander on June 10 severed two
tendons in his foot. One of the tendons is the one that lifts his
foot, the other is the one that lifts his big toe. It is the first
known shark attack in Texas waters in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Just the day before, on June 9, two men training for a triathlon
off the coast at Gulf Shores, Ala., were attacked by a shark. Chuck
Anderson, 44, lost his right arm a few inches below the elbow and
Richard Watley, 55, was bitten all the way up the right side of his
body. He was hospitalized for two days, then released. The incident
was the first known shark attack in Alabama waters in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   No connection has been made between the shark incidents, and
scientists haven't pinpointed why the pair of attacks happened.
</P>
<P>
   But subtle environmental changes may be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Quenton Dokken of Texas A&AMP;M's Center for Coastal Studies told an
ABC affiliate television station in Corpus Christi that after last
year's warmest year on record nationally, the water temperature in
the Gulf of Mexico is gradually increasing, making sharks more
active and thus, more likely to bite.
</P>
<P>
   H. Dickson Hoese, a retired marine biologist and co-author of
``The Fishes of the Gulf of Mexico,'' says previous serial-shark
attacks in the Gulf have been preceded by quirky environmental
shifts, such as coastal freezes or red tides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the recent drought has had some impact on the food
chain,'' Hoese theorizes. ``That's speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be the sharks were females, who come in closer to shore
in late spring or early summer to give birth, Hoese says.
</P>
<P>
   Or, then again, coincidence may be at play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you get when you kick a shark with your foot in
the surf,'' Corpus Christi Police Sgt. R.L. Merrow told The
Associated Press. That's how Merrow was bitten when he was 13. He
was dog-paddling in the surf and struck a shark with his foot. He
said there was a slight pause before the shark turned on him. Time
enough for him to wonder: ``This can't be a good thing, can it?''
Because with sharks, it's hard to tell how they will react.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely uncharacteristic, but sharks do so many
uncharacteristic things that the erratic becomes the normal. Anyone
who'd risk money _ not to mention his life _ on a prediction about
what one big shark will do in a given situation is a fool.
Personally, I don't think he's sick. There are other things that
could cause him to stay here _ many of them things we'll never
understand, natural factors, caprices. ... changes in
water-temperature or current flow or feeding patterns.''

</P>
<P>
   With so many sharks in the Gulf _ probably millions, says marine
scientist Buck Sutter of the National Marine Fisheries Service _
it's a wonder there aren't more attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, crowds of swimmers were beached on a June day when an
estimated 2,000 sharks roamed close to the Padre Island shore,
mostly in 5- to 6-foot-deep water, but some in water as shallow as
18 inches. Biologists then said they were hard-pressed to explain
the huge school, but a full moon creating strong tides, plus an
influx of shrimp, may have drawn the sharks. An aerial photograph
of the enormous group of sharks is still talked about by Padre
Island residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If sharks wanted people, they could have them. There's
gazillions of sharks out there,'' says Gulf Coast native Sgt.
Merrow of the Corpus police.
</P>
<P>
   Go to any pier or charter boat business along the 112-mile
stretch of Padre Island and you'll see the photographs of sharks
hauled ashore, sometimes from as close in as 100 feet from the
almost-white sand beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people knew how often sharks were swimming next to them,
even swimming between their legs, they'd probably never go swimming
again,'' says Darrell Echols, National Park Service resource
manager at Padre Island National Seashore. The park service is
working with a Texas A&AMP;M graduate student to set up a data base of
numbers and types of sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerhead. Blacktip. Bull shark. Tiger shark. Four to 6 feet
long are common for most sharks. Some caught in the Gulf,
particularly the hammerhead or tiger sharks, are 10 to 15 feet
long. All are known to be dangerous to humans, and all frequent the
waters off Padre Island. About 30 other types of shark also live in
the Gulf, but are unlikely to bite unless provoked, says Hoese.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Even the great white shark _ the main character in ``Jaws'' _
visits the Gulf of Mexico, but it prefers colder water and seldom
is seen near the shoreline, Hoese says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, sharks are like tornadoes. They touch down here, but
not there. They wipe out this house but suddenly veer away and miss
the house next door. The guy in the house that's wiped out says
`Why me?' The guy in the house that's missed says, `Thank God.'''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Hoese and his colleague Richard Moore attempted a study of local
shark attacks, only to find that most stories they heard were
unverifiable rumors. Even if they could trace the attack story,
they found victims are seldom able to give any information about
the type of shark responsible. Only occasionally do sharks leave
teeth behind to aid in verification. Often, the victims don't ever
see the shark coming. Sometimes, even experts can't say for sure
why a person was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1984, two girls were injured by shark bites off South
Padre Island. The attacks occurred two hours apart in different
locations, with no explanations ever surfacing.
</P>
<P>
   And even a verified case can have mysterious qualities that make
it impossible to add to a Texas data base, because researchers
can't always tell where attacks take place. The first and only
known Texas shark-bite fatality was in 1962, when a surf fisherman
on the Gulf Coast strung a line of just-caught fish too close to
his waistline. The bleeding fish drew a shark, which attacked the
fisherman. There may have been another Texas fatality. In April
1976, the remains of a young, white male were found in the stomach
of a 15-foot tiger shark caught by shrimpers in the Gulf of Mexico,
about 8 miles out off Galveston. Or maybe the attack didn't occur
in Texas waters at all.
</P>
<P>
   So much about the shark remains mysterious. Scientists know,
based on fossilized shark teeth, that sharks have changed little in
their more than 350 million years on Earth. They were alive at the
same time as dinosaurs, managing to survive even when ``T. rex''
did not. How? We don't know.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beautiful _ God, how beautiful they are! They're like
an impossibly perfect piece of machinery. They're as graceful as
any bird. They're as mysterious as any animal on earth. No one
knows for sure how long they live or what impulses _ except for
hunger _ they respond to. There are more than 250 species of shark,
and every one is different from every other one. Scientists spend
their lives trying to find answers about sharks and as soon as they
come with a nice, pat generalization, something shoots it down.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Matt Hooper, ``Jaws''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The mysterious aura of the shark lures fishermen, who use a
multistrand steel leader, 400- to 600-test-weight line, and cut
bait that bleeds to catch sharks off Padre.
</P>
<P>
   They fish in the Big, Bad and Ugly shark tournament in June,
sponsored by Sharkey's restaurant. Or families come and the little
kids want to catch a shark, says Cami Dungan, of Wharf Cat and Scat
Cat Charters.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service, concerned about
overfishing, has limited the shark catch to one 4-foot-long or
larger shark per vessel per trip, plus no more than one of the more
plentiful Atlantic sharpnose shark per person per trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep killing them at the same rate, eventually there
won't be any,'' marine scientist Sutter said.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly they are trophy fish, but the smaller sharks are good to
eat, says Debbie Ochoa, who works at the Horace Caldwell Pier on
Mustang Island. Here's her recipe: Soak shark steaks or fillets in
salt water and lime juice for one hour. Pat dry. Dip shark in
breading seasoned with garlic powder or Cajun seasoning. Fry. Fish
takes about 10 minutes per inch of thickness.
</P>
<P>
   This way, man-bites-shark.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``I was always crazy about the ocean. When I was 12 or 13, my
idea of a big time was to take a sleeping bag down to the beach and
spend the night lying in the sand listening to the waves, wondering
where they had come from and what fantastic things they had passed
on the way. What I got hooked on in college was fish, or, to be
really specific, sharks.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The shark attack on June 10 did little, if anything, to deter
Padre Island surfers and swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't get sunbathers and surfers off the beach with a
shotgun,'' says Jose Ochoa, a Horace Caldwell Pier employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure they wouldn't want me. I don't think I'd taste very
good,'' says surfer Ryan Steglich, 25, of Austin, who heard that a
surfer had been bitten, but, basically, doesn't worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure that's a freak thing. Like winning the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Alexander figures the bite was a freak thing as well. The
defensive tackle for the Flour Bluff High School Falcons football
team quit his job as a maintenance man for a Padre Island
condominium and plans on spending the summer on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor told me I am lucky I didn't lose my foot. He says I
still can if I get an infection,'' Kenny says.
</P>
<P>
   He has had one surgery to repair tendons (that's when it really
started to hurt, Kenny said). The Bay Area Medical Center doctor
who treated him says he may need another surgery, said hospital
spokesperson Julie Renniger.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny, however, would rather that didn't happen, and he is
intent on healing so that he can be well in time for football
practice in early August.
</P>
<P>
   And he says the incident won't keep him from swimming in the
warm-as-bathwater Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because I didn't lose anything, I'm pretty sure I'll
go back in the water,'' Kenny says.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are just so against a shark ever biting him again.

LOS ANGELES, A FAIRYLAND OF ILLUSION, FADS AND CARS 
</HEADLINE>
 ANGELES-4TAKES(TRIMS)-NYT  (Editors: the 4th take is 1250 words on hotels, restaurants and
attractions.) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ My earliest memories of Los Angeles are the
wisecracks of the old radio comedians. Fred Allen, as I recall,
described this as ``a nice place to live, if you happen to be an
orange,'' and Oscar Levant said that when you stripped away the
tinsel here, you uncovered more tinsel.
</P>
<P>
   I formed an indelible picture of L.A. noir from Bogart and
Bacall in ``The Big Sleep,'' Howard Hawks' sardonic, hard-boiled
tale of spoiled rich girls, con men, gunmen and other rogues, which
William Faulkner and others adapted from Raymond Chandler's novel.
Later, on television, I watched Jack Webb, as the laconic Sgt. Joe
Friday in ``Dragnet,'' probe the city's underbelly.
</P>
<P>
   More than anywhere else in America, Los Angeles has been defined
by popular culture _ that is, by the entertainment industry, which
is based, after all, in Hollywood. Most of us, even people who live
here, carry show-business images of Southern California around in
our heads. But they are mere fragments of reality, snippets of
grainy black-and-white or gaudy Technicolor, and splicing them
together into an accurate picture is a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   One might begin with the idea of the place. For several
generations of Americans it has been a 20th-century Eden, a garden
at continent's edge where almost anything seemed possible. Today
much of it is a paradise defiled, spoiled by sprawl, smog and
selfishness. Fires and mudslides, repeated riots and the Northridge
earthquake have scarred landscapes and psyches.
</P>
<P>
   Splendors remain _ and not just the chicks on Melrose Avenue and
the biceps boys on the beach at Venice. Contemplate the Santa
Monica mountains at dusk, wade into the surf at Malibu, glide
through the tunnel of lavender-blue jacaranda blossoms on Palm
Drive in Beverly Hills in May and June or walk along the placid
residential streets of Pasadena, past glorious Arts and Crafts
houses by the brothers Charles and Henry Greene, set on broad lawns
maintained only by heroic irrigation and the sweat of gardeners,
and you will understand the lasting allure of this vast, inchoate
metropolis by the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   There are days when hibiscus, jasmine and oleander scent the
air, and you imagine yourself in Grasse. There are days when the
air is so acrid with exhaust fumes that your eyes sting.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has always traded in glamour and illusion, ephemeral
merchandise that is here today and gone tomorrow, like movie sets
and the sex appeal of leading ladies. ``The back lot was 30 acres
of fairyland,'' wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald in ``The Last Tycoon,''
``not because the locations really looked like African jungles and
French chateaux and schooners at anchor and Broadway at night, but
because they looked like the torn picture books of childhood, like
fragments of stories dancing in an open fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a fairyland, the home of hype and hyperbole, and it
was also the home of two of the important presidents of the latter
half of the last century, Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Their
libraries are nearby, Nixon's in Yorba Linda, where he was born,
Reagan's in Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Colonized in 1781, as El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora la Reina de
los Angeles de Porciuncula, Los Angeles had but 102,479 people in
1900. A half-century later, it had 1,970,358 and by 1996 the city
and the satellites that surround it, spilling over mountains and
stretching out into the desert, were approaching 16 million. By
2025, demographic experts say, the region will grow by another 6
million people, roughly twice the present population of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Los Angeles already covers 34,000 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Explosive growth is creating a radically different society.
While the area's black and non-Hispanic white populations remain
relatively stable, its Asian and Hispanic populations are
skyrocketing. Drive down the streets in and around the center of
the city _ yes, skeptics, there is one _ and you see signs written
in a Babel of languages and alphabets: Korean and Hindi, Lao and
Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese, Russian and Spanish and Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Unified School District is the nation's second
biggest, after New York's, with 713,000 pupils; for 70 percent,
English is a second or third language, if spoken at all. In the
lifetime of most of those students, whites will be a minority in
the city and in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Mayor Richard J. Riordan has made education
his top priority. He succeeded last year in gaining control of the
school board, but pushing through reforms has proved harder than
building the new Staples Arena or landing the Democratic National
Convention, which will take place there in August. The dropout rate
in the district is twice the statewide average.
</P>
<P>
   As did immigrants in New York in the 20th century, newcomers
give Los Angeles much of its kinetic energy. But they present
tremendous challenges. For the foreseeable future, the region will
need to build 25,000 new housing units a year, and partly because
of the city's seemingly unstoppable expansion, the state needs
300,000 new teachers almost at once.
</P>
<P>
   Castles, Real and in the Air
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are more insecure than most,'' said Allison
Silver, the New Jersey-born opinion editor of The Los Angeles
Times. ``They come here in search of new identities, and they sense
that this place out at the end of the line is the last chance that
they will ever get to reinvent themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That has its good side and its bad side. When Tom Bradley was
mayor, he said Southern California provided people with ``a place
where they can be free, where they can do things they can't do
anywhere else.'' Such as wearing purple hair or founding sects,
both religious (like Aimee Semple McPherson's) and political (like
the John Birch Society). They cut themselves loose from the
restraints of tradition, obligation, even family.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone makes it, and not very many who make it keep it.
For every fabulous fortune, there are graveyards full of shattered
dreams. So people don't hold back. If you have a body, you flaunt
it; if you have money, you spend it. Buy a Bentley (and take it to
the Bel Air or the Peninsula for lunch so people can see it) and
build a narcissist's castle.
</P>
<P>
   Angelenos create and they innovate. They launch fads.
Eccentricity reigns, as Ogden Nash observed: ``Yes, it is true, Los
Angeles is not only erratic, not only erotic, Los Angeles is
crotchety, centrifugal, vertiginous, esoteric and exotic.'' Carey
McWilliams, who knew the place well, described it as ``a circus
without a tent.''
</P>
<P>
   The zaniest zaniness of all is the city's love-hate relationship
with its cars. ``Hand wash'' shops are everywhere. People drive two
blocks to buy a loaf of bread; go slowly, exquisitely mad in
freeway traffic jams and show up an hour and a half late (or a
half-hour early) for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Hertz feels compelled to warn those who rent its vehicles here,
``Unfortunately, many Californians are in a hurry and usually
ignore yellow lights (and sometimes red lights).''
</P>
<P>
   In ``L.A. Story,'' Steve Martin had a hilarious go at the car
culture, putting pedestrians in gas masks. He lampooned the city's
mania for decaf, diets and nose jobs, its compulsive consumption
and its linguistic primitivism. He made even the traffic signals
speak Valley: ``Uh, Like, Don't Walk.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   But nutty or not, the place still makes converts. Michael
Karnow, a comedy writer, grew up in Washington, the son of a
Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist, Stanley Karnow, and
graduated from Harvard. Since he moved here nine years ago, he has
become an improbable Jamba Juice junkie _ ``I have their number on
my speed dial'' _ and guzzles power boost and wheat grass drinks
``to increase mental agility.'' He's into yoga and he's learning to
surf.

&HT;     CUBA BETS ITS ECONOMY ON TOURISM
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, June 25)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ This island nation, playing up its tropical good
times and rogue reputation, is in the midst of a tourist bonanza
and wants to lure even more visitors this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro expects a boost in tourism dollars to help Cuba's
11.1 million people climb out of the economic hole created by the
40-year-old U.S. trade embargo and the loss of Soviet bloc
subsidies early in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The new optimism comes at a time when the House is expected to
vote on easing the embargo banning U.S.-Cuba trade by permitting
sales of American food, medicine and medical supplies to Havana.
The Senate has passed a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   If approved this week, the House measure would have little
immediate impact on Cuba's balance sheet, experts say. While
allowing the limited sales by U.S. companies, the bill would still
forbid Cuba to sell its goods to the United States and would not
allow Havana to buy on credit.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba, which buys rice and other commodities from Asia, might
save some money on transportation costs since U.S. suppliers are
much closer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current embargo, $3 billion in direct foreign
investment has flowed into Cuba in the past 18 months, according to
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Last year, 1.6 million tourists _
60,000 of them Americans _ infused a record $1.9 billion into
Cuba's dollar-starved economy _ more than double the 1992 level.
Cuban officials hope the number of visitors will top 2 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would then be in the big leagues,'' said Tourism Ministry
adviser Miguel Alejandro Figueras, adding that only 40 nations in
the world receive more than 2 million visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism has surfaced as an antidote to the economic double
whammy that followed Castro's seizure of power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. embargo set Cuba adrift from its major trading partner.
And the downfall of the Soviet bloc between 1989 and 1991 meant the
loss of massive subsidies and trade worth more than $2 billion
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Those were dark times, literally. Cubans suffered through
frequent blackouts because of the government's cost-cutting actions
restricting the use of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Food was scarce. Tourist guide Carlos Aguiar recalls losing 40
pounds and looking emaciated. ``And I wasn't on a diet or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Cuba has reinvented itself as a dollar-based
economy, open to foreign trade, tourism and investment even while
it remains a centrally planned communist state.
</P>
<P>
   This city's skyline is dotted with new and renovated hotels,
some run by foreign firms under management contracts and others
under construction as Cuban joint ventures with European and
Canadian hotel chains. An Italian company has also overhauled the
island's telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   While Cuba is nowhere near China in opening up its economy to
free enterprise, it has transferred most of its state-owned farm
land to semi-autonomous farmer cooperatives and individual owners.
Cubans can run restaurants out of their homes and charge fees for
giving private lessons in foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, Cuba is still in a slump. It exports about $1.4
billion in sugar, nickel, cigars and other products. It imports $3
billion, much of it food, oil and other necessities on credit.
Tourism surpassed sugar in the 1990s as Cuba's main source of
revenue, providing funds that are crucial to the island's efforts
to join the world dollar economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a nominally egalitarian society, the new economy has created
a curious class division based not on education or party membership
but on access to dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans who work in hotels, restaurants and other places
frequented by tourists get dollars in tips and can buy hundreds of
consumer items that most Cubans cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the physician or lawyer or engineer who wants to be at
the hotel's front door getting the bags of tourists,'' says
Figueras. ``There are a lot of jokes about that.''
</P>
<P>
   At hotels some Cubans strike up conversations with tourists and
then offer them boxes of cigars at cut-rate prices provided the
buyers pay in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In a 98-year-old tobacco factory here workers hold up individual
cigars to visitors and mutter, ``One dollar, one dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Without dollars, life can be bleak. Reynaldo Jimenez, a social
sciences professor, and his wife, Mercedes, a dermatologist, have a
combined income in pesos equal to about $18.50 a month. Medical
care and education are free, and with rationing cards, food costs
little.
</P>
<P>
   The Jimenezes live in a small apartment at the top of three
flights of unlit stairs. Asked to recommend a nearby restaurant for
an evening meal, Reynaldo cannot say because he and Mercedes never
go out to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that a family is better off if its income is
in dollars,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Those with relatives in the United States can receive up to
$1,200 a year in cash, a fortune for the average Cuban. In all,
Cubans receive about $900 million from their relatives annually.
</P>
<P>
   Economic improvement is difficult to measure. In Havana,
tourists are shocked by the tattered condition of streets, houses
and windowless, one-room apartments.
</P>
<P>
   But Cubans like to boast that everything is becoming up-to-date
on their island. They note with pride that five years ago the
government, desperate for revenue, started taxing private income _
just like other nations.
</P>
<P>
   To build up tourism, Cuba has invested $400 million in airports
in the past 10 years to make all parts of the island accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Figueras laments that much more must be done to develop
restaurants, nightclubs, sports facilities and other tourist
attractions. ``We have no theme parks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Cuban-American opponents of Castro are
fighting hard to prevent Congress from easing the embargo. Noting
that Cuba is often slow to pay for the items it has bought from
other countries, they call it a deadbeat nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Sorzano, a leading anti-Castro spokesman and a former
national security official in the Ronald Reagan administration,
warns that if the United States eases the embargo, ``the American
taxpayer will be asked to foot the bill'' sometime in the future
when Castro cannot pay.
</P>
<P>
   But many American entrepreneurs see Cuba as a risk worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all around world are selling products to Cuba and
getting paid,'' said L. Craig Johnstone, a former State Department
official in the Reagan and Clinton administrations and now a vice
president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Would you as a
business person have to keep an eye on your business? Yes. It's an
impoverished nation, but clearly there are a number of
possibilities there.''

 &HT;    Plucky `Chicken Run' not for everyone
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hope, Emily Dickinson once said, is the thing with feathers. But
hope is in short supply for the fine feathered stars of ``Chicken
Run,'' a new stop-motion animation feature done by British
animators Nick Park and Peter Lord in the painstaking style known
as stop motion.
</P>
<P>
   You probably don't know Park and Lord by name, but you may know
their work: ``Wallace &AMP; Gromit,'' an award-winning series of shorts
based on the adventures of a daft inventor and his resourceful dog,
or ``Creature Comforts,'' a truly marvelous, Oscar-winning short
featuring interviews with some claymated zoo residents.
</P>
<P>
   However, whether a feature-length animation, pithily described
by one mogul as ```The Great Escape' but with chickens,'' will fly
is a matter of speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Set on an ominous-looking chicken farm sometime in the 1950s,
the movie begins with some rather clever homages to the Steve
McQueen classic, as well as a tip of the hat to Billy Wilder's
``Stalag 17'' (the hut where the hens gather to plot their escapes
is No. 17). See, these biddies have to produce a certain number of
eggs per week or else they end up as dinner. No wonder plucky
Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha of ``Absolutely Fabulous'') wants
out _ and often ends up, a la McQueen, in solitary confinement.
(There's a great joke in which we hear her tossing a baseball, as
McQueen did, to pass the time.)
</P>
<P>
   Things go from bad to worse when the farm's resident villainess,
Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson), decides there's more money in
chickens than eggs. She installs a frightening, Rube Goldberg-like
contraption that converts chickens into chicken pies. Enter an
unlikely rescuer: a rooster named Rocky (voiced by Mel Gibson), who
claims he can teach the hens to fly to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that animation cultists will flock (sorry)
to ``Chicken Run.'' Otherwise, it's hard to peg the film's intended
audience. Certainly not kids, who won't get the movie in-jokes or
the deadpan British-housewife humor. And probably not mainstream
moviegoers, who may find the film visually inventive but
narratively slight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you never know what will catch the public's fancy
(``Survivor,'' anyone?). I was ready to fly the coop long before
the 82 minutes were up, but if you're in the mood for something
offbeat and wacky, ``Chicken Run'' may be just your kind of amiably
birdbrained entertainment.

 LOS ANGELES: to surf.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But with so many people panning for gold here, so many people
from somewhere else, Los Angeles itself suffers from an identity
crisis. It is not so much a city as a concatenation of cities, from
Anaheim to Azusa and Cucamonga, as they said on Jack Benny's show.
Now more than ever, under the pressure of demographic and economic
change, it is hard to unify.
</P>
<P>
   The oil and aircraft industries have all but disappeared as
bulwarks of the regional economy, and most of the formerly
influential banks have been merged into out-of-town institutions.
Even The Los Angeles Times, once a pillar of the city's civic
architecture under the stewardship of the Chandler family, has been
sold to the Tribune Co., a Chicago media conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   These seismic shifts have weakened the city's power structure.
Barry Munitz, president of the J. Paul Getty Museum, probably the
pre-eminent local cultural institution, compared today's Los
Angeles to a ball poised at the top of an incline _ stuck up there
because of ``a lack of enough educational, artistic, civic,
economic and social leaders ready to shoulder the burdens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department, its once-mythic reputation in
tatters, is struggling to eradicate rampant corruption. Already
battered by evidence of officers' planting evidence, lying in court
and shooting unarmed suspects, Chief Bernard C. Parks suffered an
additional tragedy and humiliation recently when his granddaughter
was murdered in the city his men protect.
</P>
<P>
   With expansion of the city's rudimentary subway system stalled,
several sections of the city are studying the possibilities of
secession.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that the vernacular architecture, indeed the only
architecture, of Los Angeles is the ticky-tacky bungalow. But in
fact this is a place full of architectural fascination, ranging
from things that look exactly like what they are _ the Tail o' the
Pup hot dog stand, an oversize stucco and sheet-metal wiener, and
the Capitol Records tower, shaped like a stack of 45's _ to things
that evoke a world that never was, like Mann's (formerly Grauman's)
ornate Chinese Theater, whose like never graced the streets of Old
Cathay.
</P>
<P>
   In the old downtown, along Broadway, which is as animated as the
new downtown is sterile, stand the Bradbury Building (1896), chaste
tan brick on the outside, lacy metalwork and skylighted sparkle
inside, and the Grand Central Market (1917), a survival of the
city's past, where the ethnic stew of its present simmers. Lawyers
and construction workers, African- and Mexican- and
Asian-Americans, crowd the aisles, buying tin toys and purslane and
chop suey and (if they're smart) following the crowds to Roast to
Go, which has been dispensing the city's best tacos since 1952 _
soft tortillas filled with hand-chopped pork (or hog maw or tripe,
as you will) with hot red sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamble House in Pasadena (1908), with its
Japanese-influenced woodwork of unmatched elegance, is the Arts and
Crafts masterpiece of the Greene brothers. Art Deco landmarks stand
along Wilshire Boulevard, including the zigzag Moderne tower of the
old Bullocks department store (1928). For the Public Library
downtown (1930), topped with a gilded hand holding aloft the torch
of truth, Bertram G. Goodhue adopted a more pared-down if richly
allusive Deco style, and in the Textile District, Robert Derrah
produced a streamlined Moderne icon for Coca-Cola (1937), a
bottling plant masquerading as a cream-and-scarlet ocean liner,
complete with portholes, gangways and a flying bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lloyd Wright did some of his best work in the hills and
canyons on the north side of town. Two of his buildings are open
episodically to the public: the low-lying Hollyhock House (1920),
containing much of its original furniture, and the Ennis-Brown
House (1924), a ``Mayan'' temple in patterned concrete block,
clinging to a cliff overlooking the city, whose preservation has
been the life's work of Gus Brown, a former labor union official.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Viennese-born architects, Richard Neutra and Rudolph
Schindler, created what we know as the California style. Neutra's
Lovell House (1929), near the Ennis-Brown House, is a stack of
gray-and-white steel-and-stucco planes jutting from a hillside,
perhaps as good a modern building as California has. It remains a
private residence, but the innovative little house that Schindler
designed for himself in Hollywood in 1921, a series of rooms made
of cheap, utilitarian materials (concrete, canvas, composition
board) with sliding walls that open onto gardens has been turned
into a museum house. Seminal Gehry Buildings
</P>
<P>
   Frank O. Gehry, triumphant in Bilbao, planning great things for
New York, lives here and has done some of his seminal buildings
here, starting with a minimalist Hollywood studio for Lou Danziger
(1964) and continuing with the Dutch-gabled cottage in Santa Monica
that he rebuilt in 1978 (what must the neighbors have said?), using
plywood and chain-link.
</P>
<P>
   Flamboyant though he sometimes is, Gehry can also work almost
anonymously. He turned a police department garage into the Geffen
Contemporary, a highly successful branch of the Museum of
Contemporary Art, with a simple series of baffles and platforms,
and he opened the formerly dark and disorganized Norton Simon
Museum into a sunny, free-flowing series of galleries. His Disney
concert hall, some critics think, may well cap his career.
</P>
<P>
   But until the hall is completed, the building all Los Angeles
wants to see is Richard Meier's Getty Center, a series of
interconnected travertine and enameled aluminum pavilions on an
isolated hilltop near the western end of Sunset Boulevard. From
afar, it looks like a village on a Greek island; up close, it, too,
evokes the mystique of an ocean liner. Different levels linked by
railed gangways feel like different decks, and fountains project
the sound of splashing water everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.75 million people a year visit the Getty, and many of
them come just to see the gardens and the views. It is chic in
certain circles in Los Angeles to say that the pictures aren't up
to the building, but people who have bothered to look at them don't
say that. Not people who like Masaccio and Mantegna, or F.X.
Winterhalter, that sadly underesteemed portraitist of empire.
Surely not students of Rembrandt, represented here by two of his
most vibrant portraits. And van Gogh's ``Irises'' could seduce a
stone.
</P>
<P>
   In Pasadena, the great names march with no less majesty through
the halls of the Simon: Giovanni di Paolo, Bellini, van Gogh again
(his best ``Mulberry Tree''), Cezanne, Klee; reaching a climax in
Zurbaran's exquisite ``Still Life With Lemons, Orange and a Rose.''
It is one of the world's choice small collections. A mile or so
away, in manicured San Marino, the Huntington Library offers great
manuscripts, a Greene and Greene collection, thousands of roses and
Gainsborough's famous ``Blue Boy.'' Some year soon it will place on
view this continent's greatest assemblage of works by the English
designer and polymath William Morris, purchased last year from a
California collector.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest museum in town, the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, is a work in progress, with a major building program
incomplete. Only 36 years old, it has put together an encyclopedic
collection of some 150,000 works of art, including an extensive
group of German Expressionist paintings, but it of course cannot
match the Getty's staggering financial resources. The Museum of
Contemporary Art, whose red sandstone headquarters was the Japanese
architect Arata Isozaki's first American commission, has acquired
more than 120 works in the last year in a bid to keep pace with its
rival up north, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which has
spent $125 million in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Locals bemoan the fact that Los Angeles, almost alone among
world-class cities, failed to mount a gala celebration of the new
millennium. They decry the city's lack of a professional football
team, which in the eyes of some puts L.A. behind Charlotte,
Nashville and Jacksonville. They complain about the teams the city
does have, which lose so often that sports columnists call the city
Loss Angeles. [This year's NBA championship, won by the Lakers
under the avuncular coach Phil Jackson, was the city's first title
in 11 years.)

   The city's most visible industry is film, its natural vocabulary
melodramatic. From D.W. Griffith to Marilyn Monroe to Steven
Spielberg, film has carried Hollywood values around the globe.
Television joins in the pop culture wars, portraying an unreal
world filled with youth, beauty and virility.
</P>
<P>
   Legions of gawkers flock to Hollywood Boulevard, hoping like the
hicks in Nathanael West's memorable Hollywood novel, ``The Day of
the Locust,'' to catch a glimpse of a celebrity.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   As the critic Shelley Fisher Fishkin writes in a forthcoming
book, ``Landmarks of American Literature,'' these are people,
``cheated out of their dreams by the illusions Hollywood held out
to them,'' for whom ``movies and the world that surrounds them are
more real than life itself.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   But the city need make no apology for its grander artistic life,
even if New Yorkers and San Franciscans often talk as if culture in
Southern California were confined to yogurt. Hollywood actors and
directors do not often lend their talents to the legitimate stage
in Los Angeles; many limit their work to the movies, and some
prefer the London or New York theater. But there are exceptions.
Last summer, stars like Donald Sutherland, Al Pacino and Kelly
McGillis were seen at the Mark Taper Forum and Ahmanson Theater in
productions of plays by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, O'Neill and
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the arrival in 1984 of Peter Hemmings, a gentlemanly
English arts administrator, did the city have an opera company.
Hemmings, 65, is retiring as general director of the Los Angeles
Opera at the end of this season, to be replaced by Placido Domingo,
who will carry the title of artistic director, as he does in
Washington. He is bowing out with Francesca Zambello's eye-filling
production of Benjamin Britten's mordant ``Billy Budd.''
</P>
<P>
   Though criticized for excessive caution, Hemmings nurtured the
company through adolescence and lured some big Tinseltown talents,
including the painter David Hockney and the director Herb Ross, to
the Chandler Pavilion as designers and directors. He did it on an
annual budget of $20 million, compared with San Francisco's $50
million and the Met's $170 million. Philharmonic's New Home

 &HT;    `Hamlet' comes to Manhattan, with streamlined power
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ophelia goes nuts at the Guggenheim Museum. Horatio smokes
Marlboros. And Hamlet's got a gun.
</P>
<P>
   In its bare outline, a modern-day, Manhattan-based version of
Shakespeare's tragedy sounds like the bad thesis project of a New
York University film student. True enough, Michael Almereyda's
update of ``Hamlet'' flirts with the ludicrous in every reel. But
it's ultimately a compelling and streamlined vision that lives
surprisingly well in the city's hard-edged, chilly streets and
penthouses.
</P>
<P>
   No, Manhattan isn't Denmark. ``Denmark'' here is a corporation,
and the castle of Elsinor a deluxe hotel. Prince Hamlet (Ethan
Hawke) has become the brooding, twentysomething son of the
company's chief executive officer (Sam Shepard), newly dead at the
story's start. His widow, Gertrude (Diane Venora), has married her
husband's brother Claudius (Kyle MacLachlan), who takes over the
family business in a ceremony that was originally set in court but
now is a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   When the ghost of Hamlet's father first appears, it's on a video
surveillance monitor. That's more than a technological trick.
Cameras, camcorders and computers proliferate in the halls of
Denmark; the movie makes an implicit connection between Hamlet's
famed procrastination and our own e-mail age. This is a world of
voyeurs. It's not just Hamlet who seems mired in passivity, but all
of Manhattan, and by extension, those of us in the audience. Like
Hamlet, we like to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The famous play-within-a-play by which Hamlet pricks Claudius'
guilty conscience is now a video montage. That means there aren't
any traveling players in this version, we only glimpse the
gravedigger, and Yorick's skull is seen in the hands of another
actor on a video screen. Almereyda strips the script to a bare
minimum, making this ``Hamlet'' both an interpretation of the text
and a meditation on its influence on our culture. (In one witty
moment, Hamlet takes refuge under the marquee of the Broadway
theater that houses ``The Lion King,'' reminding us that the Disney
show swiped its animated Oedipal conflict from Shakespeare.)
</P>
<P>
   Like Laurence Olivier's 1948 version, this movie turns Hamlet's
monologues (the ones that survive the textual pruning) into
voice-overs, the murmur of the man's mind. That's one of the few
weaknesses here; the decision turns the speeches into something
like a soundtrack to the action. Yes, letting Hawke speak them
aloud would have seemed unnatural at first. But without this direct
connection to the viewer, the actor never has the chance to get us
actively involved in his dilemma. He's just a mope.
</P>
<P>
   The vengeful anger of Laertes (Liev Schreiber) comes as a
bracing burst of energy, opposed to Hawke's slacker pout. (Of
course, the play intentionally sets up this opposition between a
son who rushes to avenge his father's death and another who
procrastinates.) Schreiber is good, though he seems to be affecting
a semi-British accent that none of the others uses.
</P>
<P>
   Good work also comes from Bill Murray as Laertes' busybody
father, Polonius. Julia Stiles as the fragile Ophelia continues to
be one of the more fascinating actresses in her age group, tapping
considerable emotional resources for her difficult mad scene. And
MacLachlan draws on his smiley-seedy ``Showgirls'' persona to make
Claudius a believably slick cad.
</P>
<P>
   But the strongest performance comes from Venora, a Shakespearean
veteran who herself played the prince onstage. She and Almereyda
come up with a nice, sharp interpretation of her motivations to
drink her cup of poison that deepens the character and her bond
with her son.
</P>
<P>
   Theater lovers are always spouting off about the modern
relevancy of Shakespeare's plays. This ``Hamlet'' is the rare
adaptation that gives more than lip service, bringing contemporary
urgency to a dusty, overfamiliar tragedy.

<P>
   Gag's the word in gross but funny `Me, Myself &AMP; Irene It's too
bad, then, that ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' is clueless when it comes to
constructing a plot with which to thread the powerful jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey plays a Rhode Island highway patrol officer who, after a
devastating marital breakup, develops multiple personalities. He's
either mild-mannered Charlie or wild-mannered Hank. Enter Renee
Zellweger, Carrey's real-life squeeze, as Irene, a sort of
on-the-lam chick somehow caught up in bad dealings at a golf
resort. (Sadly, no matter how many times it tries _ and it tries
plenty _ the film is incapable of making her dilemma clear.)
</P>
<P>
   The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill is complaining about
how the movie pokes fun at multiple-personality disorders. They'll
just have to get in line, because ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' makes fun
of just about everyone and everything: albinos, lesbians, mothers,
cows and, ahem, the vertically challenged.
</P>
<P>
   You thought ``Austin Powers''' Mini-Me was a scream? Well,
Mini-Me, schmini-me.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey's movie has a nunchaku-twirling dynamo in Tony Cox, the
film's small but big-brained limo driver who's Charlie's first
nemesis. Michael Bowman (a movie newcomer who landed his role by
answering an ad on a Web site) also fares well as Whitey, the
albino whom Charlie/Hank and Irene team up with on their adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey, however, seems to be ever so slightly off his mark. His
Charlie is less fluid than one would expect, his Hank a little more
reserved than one might hope. The obvious problem is the script.
The plot is a washout, and the movie's cuts (whole story segments
seem to have been lopped off) keep his dual personalities, both
angling for Irene, from really clicking.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the stand-alone jokes do work. And some are
jaw-dropping gems.
</P>
<P>
   Just be smart and don't take your mother.

   Even the most devoted Peter Greenaway fans may feel he's lost
his grip with this aesthetic hogwash about a father and son who
turn Dad's fancy Swiss mansion into a fantasy brothel. The
occupants range from a nun (Toni Collette) to an equestrian (Amanda

<P>
   The cinema's chipper girl next door (Sandra Bullock) goes clean
and sober in an addiction and rehab movie that, thankfully, isn't
an appalling clinical ``comedy'' like ``Patch Adams.'' It's a
professional, appealing comedy-drama, but in trying to be all
things to all viewers (to beer-loving Bullock fans as well as
devoted 12-steppers), it never really comes into focus. (SM)1 hour,

   Well worth your time for the terrific acting. Three salesmen _ a

and an eager-beaver newcomer (Bob Facinelli) _ wait in their

</P>
<P>
   and Nia Long.

<P>
   It's one super-sized Martin Lawrence. As an FBI agent on a
neighborhood stakeout to capture a vicious bank robber, Lawrence
dons layer upon layer of prosthetics to impersonate a 325-pound,
small-town granny in Cartersville (the movie, however, was filmed
in Los Angeles). The results may be predictable, but with
Lawrence's manic comedic timing they are also occasionally quite
funny. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 39 minutes. B-

   A friendly bit of romantic fluff starring Amy Irving as a widow
who teaches English in Rio de Janeiro and is courted by a charming
attorney (Antonio Fagundes). This is both a beguiling advertisement
for a vacation in Brazil and a valentine to Irving from her
director/husband, Bruno Barreto. Think of the film as being a bit
like falling in love: light-hearted and a little silly. (ERG)1

   and Claire Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiarly old-fashioned romantic comedy trapped in college
clothing, the movie throws in one innovative switch by reversing
gender roles. Here it's the girl (Claire Forlani) who's the casual
one-night stander and the guy (Freddie Prinze Jr.) who's the
near-virginal ingenue nattering on about having ``to work at love
if you want it to last.'' (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Center Stage'' PG-13 (sexuality and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Stiefel,
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Schull and Zoe Saldana.
</P>
<P>
   An old-fashioned show biz fantasy for teenagers with leotards
and plies, ``Center Stage'' is a kind of movie that gets retooled
every 10 years or so. Its antecedents include ``Fame,'' ``Dirty
Dancing,'' ``The Turning Point'' and even ``Flashdance.'' It's the
female version of a sports movie: Sweat and inspiration lead to
love and brief heartache, but ultimately growth, self-worth and
even stardom result. (SM)1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' G
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson and
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is about some
hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their villainous
owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in chickens.
If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily deadpan,
this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained entertainment.
(ERG)1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Color of Paradise'' PG (thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   In Persian with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mohsen Ramezani
</P>
<P>
   and Hossein Mahjub.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of a young sightless boy, it's a gorgeous meditation on
blindness, both physical and spiritual. Filled with dread and
beauty, director Majid Majidi's film summons the power of a fable,
suggesting that those with sight can be the blindest of all.
Stunningly shot by Mohammad Davudi, the film puts an emphasis on
the boy's hands stretching out into the natural world. (SM) 1 hour,
30 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' PG (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of D.B. Sweeney,
</P>
<P>
   Della Reese and Julianna Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   Leapin' lizards! The prehistoric critters in Disney's
years-in-the-making, $200 million-plus computer animation do more
than leap. Alas, the plot is worth about two cents _ something
about an iguanodon raised by lemurs who helps a herd of dinosaurs
find a fabled nesting ground after a disastrous meteor shower.
Parents be aware: While most of the movie is Barney-tame, the scary
parts are quite scary. (ERG)1 hour, 24 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia 2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mickey Mouse,
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin and Bette Midler.
</P>
<P>
   The entirety of this new ``Fantasia'' isn't worth one whirling
mushroom from the 1940 original. The movie lacks the wit, charm,
warmth, humor and awe of its predecessor, underscored by the
inclusion of one old segment, ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Our
advice: Drop off the kids, go shopping, then go rent the original.
(ERG)1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' R (bloody violence and raw language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Devon Sawa,
</P>
<P>
   Ali Larter and Kerr Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' aims for young audiences with an
``X-Files/The Wonder Years'' science/suspense plot about a kid who
escaped death from a plane crash and learns more than mortals
should about death. Our hero (Devon Sawa) and six others find
they're still targeted for death. The Grim Reaper, feeling cheated,
has plans for them. (Chris Hewitt, Knight Ridder Newspapers) 1
hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flintstones
</P>
<P>
   in Viva Rock Vegas'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mark Addy
</P>
<P>
   and Stephen Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Yabba-dabba-don't. A new, needless, live-action ``Flintstones,''
with Mark Addy as Fred, Stephen Baldwin as Barney, and the
courtship of Wilma and Betty as the plot. Inoffensive and mildly
amusing in spots, but hardly worth a trip to the theater. (Stephen
Whitty, Newhouse News Service) 1 hour, 29 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dennis Quaid
</P>
<P>
   and Jim Caviezel.
</P>
<P>
   John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) hears dead people. Specifically, he
hooks up to his dad's old ham radio set in 1999 and finds himself
talking to his dad (Dennis Quaid) in 1969. More crucially, John
knows his dad, a fireman, will be killed in a failed heroic rescue
the next day. Although over-plotted, the sentimental film has that
``what if?'' fascination. It's also a mind-bender and especially
savvy about emotional button-pushing. (ERG) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief called
back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal for a
British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula garbage,
``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily outdoes
the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A few IQ points may be lost
while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun to
care. (SM)1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet'' R (some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Hawke,
</P>
<P>
   Kyle MacLachlan, Diane Venora
</P>
<P>
   and Bill Murray.
</P>
<P>
   In its bare outline, a modern-day, Manhattan-based version of
Shakespeare's tragedy sounds like the bad thesis project of a New
York University film student. True enough, Michael Almereyda's
update flirts with the ludicrous in every reel. But it's ultimately
a compelling and streamlined vision that lives surprisingly well in
the city's hard-edged, chilly streets and penthouses. (SM) 1 hour,
51 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and Basketball'' PG-13 (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps
</P>
<P>
   and Sanaa Lathan.
</P>
<P>
   All's not fair in love or basketball is one of several themes in
this flawed but appealing romance. Q (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa
Lathan) meet as kids and rival basketball players. They realize
throughout the film that they love each other as much as the game.
Director Gina Price-Bythewood (her producer is Spike Lee) may not
have scored a slam dunk, but she comes close thanks to her engaging
stars. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' R (sexual content, crude
</P>
<P>
   humor, profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Those impish filmmaking Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby,
prove yet again that, no matter how foul and nasty their humor,
they understand very clearly how to set up the joke and when to
fire the over-the-top punch. This movie, starring Jim Carrey and
Renee Zellweger, is bound to make you laugh. Too bad it's clueless
when it comes to constructing a plot with which to thread the
powerful jokes. (Bob Longino) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan has his
own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest sports
story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the back, it's
a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones in on the
1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team to a sixth
championship before retirement. (Bob Longino) 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission: Impossible 2'' PG-13 (intense sequences of violent
</P>
<P>
   action and some sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Thandie Newton.
</P>
<P>
   This underscripted sequel, directed by John Woo, is a
full-fledged Tom Cruise star vehicle as he battles baddies after an
Ebola-like virus. The movie contains overamplified kung-fu fights
and a very long motorcycle chase consisting of quick, tight shots.
The sexy Thandie Newton holds her own in the film's first half, but
gets demoted to playing the Girl for the last act. She deserves
better. So do we. (SM)2 hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like the
author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly beautiful.
It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't get, from
``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino) 22 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Trip'' R (sexuality, crude humor,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Green.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Ivan Reitman (``Animal House,'' ``Ghostbusters''),
``Road Trip'' is about a quartet of guys who try to retrieve a sex
video. The trip has its share of gross-outs _ from making fun of
large women to doing something completely disgusting with French
toast. It's a witless, dumb and dumber version of ``Animal House,''
and its saving grace, MTV genius Tom Green, isn't in it enough.
(Bob Longino)1 hour, 31 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson,
</P>
<P>
   Christian Bale and Jeffrey Wright.
</P>
<P>
   You can dig it. Sporting the original Oscar-winning theme song,
the ``Shaft'' 2000, starring Samuel L. Jackson, is one bad
I'm-messin'-with-your-head movie. While the plot is a trumped-up
trifle involving both a suspected racist killer (Christian Bale)
and whacked-out drug lord (Jeffrey Wright), the movie clicks
because of the performances. Wright steals the picture, directed by
John Singleton. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Noon'' PG-13 (action violence, some
</P>
<P>
   drug humor, profanity and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jackie Chan
</P>
<P>
   and Owen Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Martial arts whiz Jackie Chan plays a Chinese imperial guardsman
who volunteers to head to the United States to rescue a kidnapped
princess. ``Noon'' lets Chan use moose antlers, horse shoes and
pine saplings as weapons, take a big fall from a mission bell
tower, and contend with a drunken horse. The film lassos all the
revisionist laughs and action scenes that last summer's ``Wild Wild
West'' botched. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' PG (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tracey Ullman, Woody Allen,
</P>
<P>
   Elaine May and Hugh Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen remembers how to make us laugh in this comedy about
lightweight crooks who bumble into lots of cash. As Allen's
big-haired blond wife, Frenchy, Tracey Ullman is a pitch-perfect
character who can ground even her silliest role in genuine feeling.
Elaine May, who steals every scene she's in, plays Frenchy's cousin
May, easily the dimmest creature in a movie loaded with low-watt
bulbs. (SM)1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunshine'' R (nudity, sex and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Though overlong (three hours) and not a very smiley-face story
(the title is ironic), this bleak, sweeping epic is still worth
your time and effort. Oscar-winning director Istvan Szabo
(``Mephisto'') examines the first half of the 20th century through
the painful prism of three generations of a Jewish family in
Hungary. Ralph Fiennes plays the central male in each passage along
with a fine supporting cast. (ERG) 3 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' PG (some cartoon violence)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore and Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a good sign when a 'toon's backgrounds are more
interesting than the plot and characters. ``Titan'' is an animation
set in the 31st century after Earth has been destroyed. The human
race's only hope is a guy named Cale (voiced by Matt Damon) who's
the key to the missing Titan project designed by his dad. Like most
sci-fi flicks, this one is more of a super-deluxe episode of the
old ``Jonny Quest'' series. (ERG)1 hour, 30 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571''PG-13 (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey,
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton
</P>
<P>
   and Jon Bon Jovi.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey leads a reconnaissance mission to take over
a damaged German sub and capture the secret Nazi coding device
that's confounding U.S. efforts to win the war. Despite a
predictable script, blatant cliches and a penchant for
chest-beating fanfare music, ``U-571'' has plenty of furious
action, occasional suspense and lots of super-loud booms. It's no
``Das Boot,'' but it can suck you in. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 56
minutes. B-

 LOS ANGELES: rains on weekends.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of attractions:
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   BEL AIR, 701 Stone Canyon Rd., Bel Air, (310) 472-1211. The Bel
Air never, ever lapses into Hollywood-style ostentation, creating
instead the illusion that you're staying with rich, relaxed
friends. Gardenias and birds-of-paradise bloom in 12 lush acres of
gardens. Superb food on a terrace overlooking a swan-filled pond,
and superb management by Frank Bowling. Double room: $375 to $485.
</P>
<P>
   CASA DEL MAR, 1910 Ocean Way, Santa Monica, (310) 581-5533.
Built in 1926 and flawlessly restored, it faces the Pacific across
a broad beach near the Santa Monica Pier. Nothing here is
commonplace. The 129 guest rooms, decorated in sherbety
Mediterranean tones, are outfitted with wood-slatted Venetian
blinds, VCRs and pictures in the vein of Matisse. Rubber duckies
wait beside Jacuzzi tubs to soothe the road-weary. Double room:
$335 to $495.
</P>
<P>
   L'ERMITAGE, 9291 Burton Way, Beverly Hills, (310) 278-3344.
Tucked into a residential neighborhood, L'Ermitage is sleek, serene
and stylish after a four-year renovation. Guest rooms have three
phone lines, plus a cell phone, 40-inch television set, DVD player
and bar with free soft drinks; openwork sycamore panels slide shut
to divide sleeping areas from dressing rooms and bathrooms. From
the rooftop pool, you can see the Hollywood Hills _ sometimes.
Double room: $330 to $780.
</P>
<P>
   PENINSULA, 9882 South Santa Monica Boulevard, Beverly Hills,
(310) 551-2888. Bentleys and Ferraris crowd the courtyard, and
weird and wonderful people populate the lobby; this is a prime
show-biz port of call. But even lowly folk get Frette sheets on
their beds, oversize towels, breakfast served on Limoges china and
still lifes of fresh fruit. Order a Cobb salad to eat on the plane.
Double room: $395 to $450.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO EAT
</P>
<P>
   CHINOIS, 2709 Main St., Santa Monica, (310) 392-9025. This is
the restaurant where Wolfgang Puck, an Austrian, put California in
a wok and begat dishes like Shanghai lobster with ginger curry
sauce. After 16 years, the gold-faced Buddha behind the bar still
surveys a happy, noisy, well-fed crowd nightly.
</P>
<P>
   GINZA SUSHIKO, 218 North Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, (310)
247-8939. This may be the most expensive restaurant in America; I
don't know. I do know that the food is sublime _ full of pure,
miraculously fresh flavors. Fugu, or blowfish, is potentially
poisonous in the hands of lesser mortals, but in those of Masa
Takayama, in this tiny, tidy room, it is poetry. Served only rom
November to March, it will set you back $400, with tax, tip and
sake.
</P>
<P>
   LUCQUES, 8474 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, (323) 655-6277.
Lucques is hot, hot, hot. In Harold Lloyd's old brick-walled
carriage house, Suzanne Goin whips up hearty, satisfying dishes
like a Technicolor salad of heirloom tomatoes and a bone-in rib-eye
steak with reduced pan juices and a gratin of microscopically thin
potatoes. Seth, the head barman, mixes the town's best martini.
</P>
<P>
   MATSUHISA, 129 N. La Cienega Blvd., Beverly Hills, (310)
659-9639. From this unprepossessing little place grew Nobu
Matsuhisa's worldwide empire. The sushi is perfect; notice the
marbling of the pale pink toro and the subtle crunch of the fried
soft shell crab roll. But innovative hot dishes made Nobu's name.
So try the cod marinated for three days in miso, or the fabulous
fried oysters bathed in a spicy, garlicky sauce. Go at off-hours,
sit at the bar and order the Hoku Setsu sake.
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIPE, 1001 N. Alameda St., Los Angeles, (213) 628-3781.
Phillipe (say fill-EEP-ay) sells a million French dip sandwiches a
year to a motley cast of customers. The sandwich was invented here
in 1918. Stand in line, shuffle your feet in the sawdust on the
floor, order a twice-dipped beef with cole slaw and potato salad,
both delicious, on the side. Then slather the sandwich with the
house's hot house mustard and dig in.
</P>
<P>
   LA SERENATA DE GARIBALDI, 1842 E. First St., Los Angeles, (323)
265-2887. Reborn after two years of renovation, La Serenata is
again the city's favorite Mexican haunt. Once a hole-in-the-wall,
it now boasts handsome tiles, carved beams and bright textiles. The
food remains light, authentic, greaseless and glop-free; vegetables
in the fajitas, for example, are fresh and gently cooked.
</P>
<P>
   SPAGO BEVERLY HILLS, 176 N. Canon Drive, Beverly Hills, (310)
385-0880. Wolfgang Puck's surprisingly unsnobby, unshowbizzy
flagship has no weaknesses. Lee Hefter has shaped a winning menu
ranging from authentic wienerschnitzel to sweet-corn agnolotti.
Sherry Yard prowls farmers' markets for fruit in peak form for her
succulently simple desserts (boysenberries and sugar-lipped peaches
on our last visit). Michael Bonaccorsi, possibly the best young
sommelier in the country, springs surprises from California, Italy,
France and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO, 3115 Pico Blv., Santa Monica, (310) 829-4313. I know
no better Italian restaurant in the United States, nor any better
(and more fairly priced) wine list. Forget about the menu; put
yourself in the hands of Piero Selvaggio, the suave, warmhearted,
Sicilian-born owner. He will give you a taste of this and a sip of
that.: for instance richer Chianti than you ever imagined.

 &HT;    Epic `Sunshine' can be dark, but moral compass is true
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title, ``Sunshine,'' couldn't be more misleading. It
suggests a smiley-face family movie _ maybe something starring the
Olsen twins.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the three-hour ``Sunshine'' is a bleak, sweeping epic,
depicting the first half of the 20th century through the painful
prism of three generations of a Jewish family living in Hungary.
One interesting twist: In each passage, the major male figure is
played by Ralph Fiennes, which imposes an added layer of fated
destinies.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonnenscheins _ the name translates as ``sunshine,'' thus
the title _ make their fortune at the turn of the century with a
health elixir called Taste of Sunshine. They move to Budapest,
where the eldest son, Ignatz (Fiennes), becomes a lawyer and falls
for Valerie (Jennifer Ehle), his adopted ``sister'' _ actually his
cousin _ who's been raised with him. He also, in order to advance
his career, changes his name to the less Jewish-sounding Sors.
</P>
<P>
   The two marry and have a son, Adam (Fiennes), who furthers the
family's assimilation. In order to have a shot at becoming the
fencing champion of Hungary and being on the Olympic team, he
converts to Roman Catholicism. But when the Nazis goose-step into
Hungary, his adopted religion is no protection.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's Adam's son, Ivan (Fiennes), who survives the
concentration camps and embraces the Communist Party. But again his
religious heritage becomes a problem when the party goes
Zionist-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of compromise and its costs is one that director
Istvan Szabo has dealt with before, most memorably in his
Oscar-winning ``Mephisto.'' Thus, while ``Sunshine'' deals with
anti-Semitism in particular, it also examines the larger issues of
collaboration in any form, of going along to get along, so to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Szabo worked on the script with playwright Israel Horowitz, and
there are some clumsy, soap opera scenes. Still, overall, this is
an ambitious and affecting film, guided by a strong moral compass.
It also offers an excellent cast. Along with Fiennes, whose
passionate portrayals hold it all together, there's fine work by
Rosemary Harris as the older Valerie (nice touch; she's Ehle's
mother in real life); William Hurt as an ardent Communist done in
by his religious roots; and Deborah Kara Unger as a lusty comrade
with designs on Ivan.
</P>
<P>
   By personalizing history, the characters' plights and choices
become immediate and involving.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the family patriarch, Emmanuel (John Neville),
Fiennes' narrator notes, ``When joy approached, Emmanuel always
asked himself, `What will come of this? What price must I pay?'''
``Sunshine'' shows us that there is always a price. How you pay it
is what makes the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunshine''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes, Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris.
Directed by Istvan Szabo. Rated R for nudity, sex and violence. At
Tara. 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Long and not very sunshiny, but certainly worth the
time and effort.

DIANA KRALL: VULNERABILITY SHOWS ITSELF, IF BRIEFLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two months ago, at a tribute concert to Joni
Mitchell, Diana Krall surprised everyone by forsaking her crisply
emphatic jazz piano style to perform Mitchell's impassioned
folk-pop ballad ``A Case of You'' without the usual support of bass
and drums. Freed from the austere jazz settings she favors, Krall's
sharply accented, blues-embellished piano relaxed into a minimalist
pop mode, and her voice took on a startling dramatic intensity.
Certain lines were punched out (``Constantly in the
darkness/Where's that at?''), while other words and phrases
(especially the word ``darling'') found her trailing off into a
smoky whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a performer as diffident as Krall, the shift in mood
and style was a small revelation. Exploring the musical world of
her fellow Canadian, Krall exposed a vulnerability that had only
been hinted at in her recordings, most notably in the title song of
her recent best-selling album, ``When I Look in Your Eyes''
(Verve).
</P>
<P>
   Krall's JVC Jazz Festival concert on Wednesday evening at the
Supper Club offered two such moments. Once again, she performed ``A
Case of You'' as the unguarded meditation of someone dreaming out
loud. During her encores, she recaptured the same mood in a
performance of the Sinatra-identified ballad ``I Fall in Love Too
Easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the piano faded into the background, and Krall's clear,
dark alto transformed a sugarcoated valentine into a love junkie's
piercingly critical self-assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the concert found Krall leading a quartet (featuring
the spiky blues guitar of Dan Faehnle) through a program dominated
by the 1940s and '50s material she has always favored, but
interpreted from a wised-up perspective that makes her suggest a
jazz-oriented answer to the rock singer Chrissie Hynde. Even at her
softest, Krall never tries to be sweet and ingratiating. What
emotion she reveals tends to leak through a tough, assertive facade
as her voice momentarily cracks into a quivering vibrato.
</P>
<P>
   Krall's vocal style is really a reflection of her spare,
hard-driving pianism, whose very austerity reinforces a certain
defensiveness. When singing songs associated with that sorcerer of
seduction, Peggy Lee (the concert included ``I Love Being Here With
You'' and ``I Don't Know Enough About You''), Krall divested them
of the flirtatiousness that Lee employs to soften her toughness.
Throughout the concert, Krall maintained a rhythmic tension by
phrasing songs like an acrobat swinging from bar to bar, using
consonants to build momentum for the many quick tumbling leaps. It
was all quite impressive, if a little forbidding. &QL;

   PHILADELPHIA _ Here's a stretch: One of the more improbable
pairings in recent exhibition history puts the work of Andy Warhol
(1928-1987) with that of the Social Realist painter Robert Gwathmey
(1903-1988), the idea being that the underappreciated Gwathmey and
the canonized Warhol shared an outlook as ``social commentators''
on American life.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts here, each is given
a separate show, ``Robert Gwathmey: Master Painter'' and ``Andy
Warhol: Social Observer.'' But each is meant to complement the
other in this ill-conceived double feature. The museum's aim in
mounting the two together, it says, is nothing less than reshaping
conceptions of postwar American art.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK. It's not a bad idea to reshape conceptions from time
to time, and the pairing is certainly well-intentioned. But it's
more than a little on the silly side. Gwathmey's earnest,
injustice-hating paintings about the hardscrabble lives of black
sharecroppers in the rural South and his later meditations on the
human condition are on a different wavelength from Warhol's campy
infatuation with the sensations and celebrities of the
media-saturated American scene. Moreover, although only a
generation apart in age, he and Warhol had totally different
notions of the premises of art.
</P>
<P>
   True, Warhol caught the meretriciousness of late 20th-century
life, and his repetitive paintings of dollar signs, for instance,
could be construed as an indictment of American society's prime
priority. But in Warhol _ nevertheless a far more complex and
interesting artist than Gwathmey _ there is more cynical acceptance
than social criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gwathmey's work, like that of his better-known
colleagues Philip Evergood, Jacob Lawrence and Ben Shahn, found a
ready audience in the protest era and aftermath of the Great
Depression _ the '30s, '40s and '50s _ it fell out of fashion when
the doctrine of art for art's sake came in. Social protest, too,
ran low on fuel as the United States surmounted the Depression. The
reformist '60s saw some renewal of interest in Gwathmey, but from
1972 to the late '90s, no museum show was held. Trying to introduce
Gwathmey to a new generation, the Butler Institute of American Art
in Youngstown, Ohio, has organized this touring survey of his work,
including more than 60 oils, drawings and watercolors, now making
its final stop.
</P>
<P>
   Gwathmey, an eighth-generation white Virginian, grew up in
modest circumstances in Richmond. As a child, his visits to
relatives in the Tidewater countryside acquainted him with the
struggles of rural black people. Their striving, which had its full
impact on the artist only years later, became a major theme of his
spare, highly stylized paintings, works that deal with the rigors
of sharecropping and racial inequities, but also _ more positively
_ with the flavor of black family life.
</P>
<P>
   His work developed, it's worth noting, at the same time and with
similar content as that of photographers like Walker Evans,
Dorothea Lange and Marion Post Wolcott, who worked for the federal
government's Farm Security Administration documenting American life
during the Depression. Gwathmey himself often took inspiration from
photographs of sharecroppers and tenant farmers by his wife,
Rosalie, also a Southerner.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the Pennsylvania Academy and then for years a
teacher _ including a long stint at Cooper Union in New York City _
Gwathmey was an innovative colorist and a clever designer of
pictorial space. His primary influences were Picasso and Cubism,
from which he learned respect for the flat, two-dimensional canvas
surface. A less felicitous source of imagery was medieval
stained-glass windows, which inspired the bold linearities that
define Gwathmey's forms and give his compositions an overly
schematized, at times even cartoonish, look. His figures, as in the
unusually lighthearted beach scene ``Winter's Playground'' (1947),
more than occasionally suggest the anatomical dummies used in art
classes.
</P>
<P>
   His subjects, too, while often moving and tender, like
``Children Dancing'' (1948), a view of mother, father and children
in a sweet family celebration, can be sentimental and derivative,
like ``The Ballad Singer'' (1939-40), a Picassoesque study of a
black guitarist, mouth open in song. Set within a geometric space,
the singer's presence is asserted _ and assaulted _ by the heavy
lines that accentuate his body.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Gwathmey's most effective work deals with contrasts
between his have-not subjects and their materialistic surroundings.
In ``The Hitchhiker'' (circa 1936), one of his earliest surviving
paintings, the figure of a man, presumably in search of work,
thumbing a ride is backed by an array of billboards advertising
out-of-reach consumer goods. The more satirical ``Poll Tax
Country'' (1945) pits a posturing group of white Southern racists
against a crowd of black laborers. As a pompous speaker exhorts the
laborers, they go unheedingly about their chores. A black bird,
Gwathmey's ubiquitous symbol for Jim Crow, is perched above the
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gwathmey, who was under surveillance by the FBI from 1942 to
1969 because of left-wing sympathies, took up other subjects in his
later years, like the horrors of war, exemplified in ``Homo
Sapiens, Late Twentieth Century'' (1973). In it, two battling
figures struggle while a solar eclipse goes on above. The barren
ground they fight on is a horrific no man's land. But Gwathmey was
more at home exploring his native turf than wallowing in
apocalypse, and paintings like these are not the works to remember
him by. If he was not a great artist, he was certainly a committed
one.
</P>
<P>
   The Warhol show, organized by Jonathan P. Binstock, assistant
curator at the museum, is bigger, with more than 80 paintings,
photographs, prints and a film ranging over the artist's career.
This reprise is arranged in seven sections that include death and
disaster, politics, celebrities, advertising and symbolism. On
view, yet again, are famous icons like his ``Self Portrait''
(1986), the artist as a mystery guru with feathers jutting from his
head and amorphous abstractions playing across his face; the
repetitive close-ups of Jacqueline Kennedy taken at the time of the
president's assassination in 1963; the four-image ``Electric
Chair'' series and ``Race Riot'' (both 1964); and the screen prints
of Mao and Nixon (the latter is titled ``Vote McGovern'') from
1972.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt is to show that the artist's famous facade of
blandness and disengagement from social issues was a giant miscue;
that the chosen seven themes characterized his involvement ``with
what he perceived as socially relevant issues in art and life,''
Binstock writes in his catalog essay. To make this exhibition a tad
more relevant to the Gwathmey show, a photograph of an early
Gwathmey work, ``Street Scene'' (1938), is included in the Warhol
catalog, which notes that a 1970 monograph by the art historian
Rainer Crone described Warhol as ``socially conscious, politically
motivated, and heir to the tradition of American Social Realists
such as Ben Shahn and Robert Gwathmey.'' But by Gwathmey's
standards, Warhol had the social conscience of a grasshopper.
</P>
<P>
   Binstock's shilly-shallying arguments are unconvincing. He
himself admits in his essay that Warhol leaves us with feelings of
ambivalence. ``In the end, Warhol did care about people, politics
and current events,'' he writes, ``and from time to time he did
choose sides. But it is also fair to conclude that he probably
would have preferred not to.''

IMPOSSIBLE TO REDEEM DISMAL `IRENE'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: F  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news about Jim Carrey's ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' is pretty
much all bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's by far the worst comedy either he or the Farrelly Brothers
have ever made _ so abysmal in every way that it makes their last
collaboration, 1994's ``Dumb and Dumber,'' look like a comic
masterpiece in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey plays a hard-luck Rhode Island state trooper who, after
being jilted by his wife for a midget, gradually develops a split
personality and becomes two people: Charlie, a mild-mannered chump,
and his alter ego, Hank, a sadistic tough guy who speaks in a low,
Clint Eastwood-like growl and frequently explodes into violence.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, this must have seemed an inspired idea that would give
the star _ still glowing from his ``Truman Show'' and ``Man on the
Moon'' reviews _ an opportunity to do more than just mug through
the sex gags. But in execution, his Jekyll-and-Hyde routine is
painfully unfunny: almost none of it works and some of the routines
just go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Farrellys _ still glowing from their
``Something About Mary'' reviews _ also have decided to expand
themselves, by trying to make their film work not just as a comedy
and psychological study, but as a love story and a thriller as
well. Both tracks are half-baked, to say the least, and further add
to the movie's excruciating air of tedium.
</P>
<P>
   In between this relative seriousness, of course, the movie is
also out there with the usual Farrelly gross-outs and the familiar
litany of cruelty, sex jokes, bathroom humor, racial slurs and
in-your-face visual incongruities _ most of them pale repeats of
what they've given us in earlier movies and signifying a definite
wan of inspiration on their part.
</P>
<P>
   And since these gags are merely thrown in here and there and
work against the plot line (and against Rex Allen Jr.'s ponderously
folksy narration), they never add up to the kind of guilty pleasure
that, say, ``Kingpin'' was. Here, when we're suddenly treated to an
explicit close-up of a Great Dane defecating on the lawn _ or
worse, Carrey defecating on the lawn _ it's not funny, it's just a
repulsive intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an ugliness between the lines of this movie that's
shocking even in context of a summer gross-out comedy, and that's
its gleefully cavalier attitude toward violence against children.
At one point, we see Hank torturing what appears to be a 7-year-old
girl by repeatedly dunking her head under water, holding it down
and growling, ``Take that, f---face.''
</P>
<P>
   If a moment _ even a brief, tongue-in-cheek, throw-away moment _
as criminally mean-spirited as this one isn't considered by the
MPAA rating board to be offensive and dangerously irresponsible
enough to earn a movie an NC-17 rating, why even bother to have a
rating system?
</P>
<P>
   Me, Myself &AMP; Irene. Directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly.
Written by Bobby and Peter Farrelly &AMP; Mike Cerrone. Cast: Jim
Carrey, Renee Zellweger, Chris Cooper, Robert Forster, Richard

   GORE-HILLARY-PROBES (Washington) _ Separate actions by
government prosecutors deal Vice President Al Gore a potential
political setback and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton a
begrudging exoneration in connection with their activities at the
White House. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., says a senior Justice
Department prosecutor has recommended that Attorney General Janet
Reno appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Gore's
fund-raising activities in 1996. Special prosecutor Robert Ray,
meanwhile, concluded a protracted investigation to the White House
firing of travel office employees in 1993, declining to prosecute
the first lady despite finding ``substantial evidence that she had
a role in the decision'' to sack the workers. By STEWART M. POWELL.

&HT;     THE CASE FOR U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE SUFFERS A SETBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     A News Analysis 
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A thaw in relations on the Korean peninsula and
North Korea's decision to stop testing intercontinental ballistic
missiles have dramatically undercut the rationale for a costly U.S.
missile defense system, military experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the continuing U.S. debate over whether President Clinton
should give the go-ahead to the proposed National Missile Defense
program, supporters of the $36 billion anti-missile system have
cited North Korea's potential threat as the major reason to develop
a National Missile Defense _ a network of rocket interceptors,
radars, sensors and computers.
</P>
<P>
   But peace appears to be breaking out on the Korean peninsula, as
evidenced by the historic visit last week by South Korean President
Kim Dae Jung to North Korea, where he met with his counterpart, Kim
Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was widely heralded as ending 55 years of intense
hostility between the two Koreas and was followed by North Korea's
promise to halt long-range missile tests after the United States
announced it was ending some economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   An array of independent defense analysts say these developments
blunt the argument in favor of the U.S. National Missile Defense
program.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate with the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, a non-profit think tank, said
that `if you take North Korea out of the equation, the missile
threat all but disappears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if the North Korean threat were to disappear, there is no
other threat in the world that justifies a rush to deploy a
National Missile Defense system,'' Cirincione added.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, North Korea had been spewing harsh rhetoric
against South Korea and the United States while rushing to develop
long-range missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatically isolated and economically backward nation was
one of two so-called ``rogue nations'' cited as potentially capable
of launching missiles against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Defense Secretary William Cohen told a Senate panel
in April that the purpose of NMD was to protect the United States
``against a rogue nation attack, a limited missile attack, a few
missiles that might be fired from North Korea or from Iran or some
other country.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department last week officially dropped the ``rogue
nation'' category and substituted ``nation of concern'' to cover
North Korea, Iran and several other nations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence assessments say that North Korea could have
such a missile in place by 2005, and Iran possibly by 2010 or
sometime shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Blair, a strategic weapons expert with the non-profit
thinktank Center for Defense Information, said that if North Korea
is sincere about terminating its ballistic missile program, ``then
that pulls the rug out from under national missile defense'' for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   John Steinbrunner, director of the Center for International and
Security Studies at the University of Maryland, said North Korea's
missile program was far ahead of Iran's. If North Korea terminates
its program, ``one would be hard-pressed to find an alternative
source for this missile technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Mendelsohn, a former U.S. negotiator on the Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks with the Soviet Union, said that with the North
Korean missile program shut down, ``the worse-case missile threat
to the U.S. would be undercut.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rhinelander, a former legal adviser for the State
Department in the Nixon administration who helped negotiate the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union, said that
``the rationale for National Missile Defense was weak to start
with. Now, the rationale disappears and would be undercut
severely'' if the North Korea shuts down its missile program.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, boosters of the missile defense plan insist that
the program should still go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General George Roberston said Thursday that ``the
real issue NMD is addressing is the potential for proliferation of
ballistic missiles. That is not confined to one country.''
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. Air Force's top officer, Gen. Michael Ryan, said
Wednesday that there ``are other nations striving to be able to
deliver weapons of mass destruction ... North Korea is not the only
one.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. efforts to develop a missile defense system have been
hindered by the demanding technology required in order to ``hit a
bullet with a bullet,'' as one scientist put it.
</P>
<P>
   A key test is scheduled for July 7 over the Pacific Ocean. If it
is deemed a success, Cohen is expected to recommend to Clinton that
the system be built.

`RUDY BURCKHARDT AND FRIENDS': FACES OF YOUTHFUL ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RUSSELL   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the summer's freshest and most rewarding
exhibitions is ``Rudy Burckhardt and Friends: New York Artists of
the 1950s and 1960s'' at the Grey Art Gallery at New York
University. It may not sound like a grabber: Downtown no longer has
the open-minded and almost collegial interconnectedness it had 40
and 50 years ago. Marketing, salesmanship and hype have sprouted
all over. And Burckhardt was never a ``celebrity'' in the
post-Warhol sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he wish to be. But he was, as the poet and critic
Vincent Katz says in the show's catalog, ``simultaneously the
ultimate `insider' and a disinterested observer,'' who got on as
well with poets as with painters, composers, choreographers and
avant-garde moviemakers.
</P>
<P>
   He was best known as a photographer who for many years took New
York City as his main subject and recorded it in an ever-observant
and subtly original way. He got everything just right, whether he
was stalking a bygone Times Square at dusk in 1948 or surveying
Astor Place from a high window in 1947 or dropping in on Willem de
Kooning when he was working on his great ``Woman, I'' in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to commissions from Thomas B. Hess, he made a portrait
gallery of rising artists for Art News magazine, and it is an
irreplaceable document of its day.
</P>
<P>
   This he did (as in his portraits of Willem and Elaine de
Kooning) with a tenderness peculiar to himself. Many of his
portraits have a lingering poetry that is heightened by the fact
that so many of the sitters were still young with faces unlined by
the travail of aging and with bodies still lithe and slender. When
we look at Joan Mitchell as he painted her in 1957, we recognize
her as the rambunctious talker who had painted a picture, now in
this show, called ``George Went Swimming at Barnes Hole, but It Got
Too Cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1936 and 1997 Burckhardt made 95 avant-garde movies,
nine of which are being screened at the Grey Gallery. No two were
alike, and he could do things that no other moviemaker would have
thought of. (In one, Aaron Copland plays the part of a young
painter and Paul Bowles and Virgil Thomson make fleeting
appearances as moviegoers.)
</P>
<P>
   What makes this show wonderful is, first, the discretion of
Burckhardt. He never jockeyed for ``importance.'' In 1950, when Tom
Hess asked him to photograph Jackson Pollock at work, he went ahead
and made the revelatory images that are in this exhibition. But it
was not in his nature to exploit them as the key images that they
were to become.
</P>
<P>
   Burckhardt contradicted himself at every turn. Though he was
born in Basel, Switzerland, in 1914 and bore one of the great Swiss
family names, he made nothing of it and detested Basel, which he
once summed up as ``lonely and empty and proper and clean.'' (He
once said of Paris that although he liked being there, it was ``not
far enough from Basel.'')
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, when he turned 21, he had a legacy that enabled him to
live wherever he liked. His first visit to New York in that year
and at that susceptible age had such an overwhelming effect upon
him that it was two years before he felt able to use his camera
there. The sheer size, the energy, the life of the streets _ all
astounded him.
</P>
<P>
   Burckhardt never promoted himself as ``a friend of. . . .'' But
when he was drafted into the American Army in 1941, de Kooning gave
him a little gouache that he kept with him in his locker until he
obtained an honorable discharge (on grounds of ``nervous
disability'') some years later. The present exhibition is rich in
diminutive but telling souvenirs of the years when, as is said by
Vincent Katz, the co-curator of the show with Lynn Gumpert, ``the
New York art world was a private place. There was little money
involved, only the intensity of the work itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In that private world, Burckhardt became an indispensable
presence, prized by all who knew him. Like his lifelong friend,
Edwin Denby, the foremost American dance critic of the day, he had
a sense of quality that never deserted him.
</P>
<P>
   The particular magic of this show is related to the sumptuous
array of paintings that have been brought out primarily from the
collection of New York University. This collection is, as Gumpert
says, ``little-known and rarely seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the context of the New York School and of those of its
early members who were friends of Burckhardt, it makes a stunning
effect. That impact is heightened by loans from the Albright-Knox
Art Gallery in Buffalo, where Seymour Knox was an early and
discerning patron of the New York School.
</P>
<P>
   There are paintings here that are little known and for that
reason come across with their freshness intact and enhanced. One is
the very large (80 by 68 inches) ``Farm Scene, 1963'' by Jane
Freilicher. Another is the memorably violent painting of a bull by
Elaine de Kooning. Painted in 1958 when she was teaching in
Albuquerque and was going every weekend to the bullfights in
Juarez, Mexico, this has a headlong, tearaway abandon.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that paintings like these are shown with Burckhardt's
seemingly casual portraits of the artists gives the visitor a sense
of domesticity. It is as if we were making studio visits, 40 or
more years ago, and were welcome to stay as long as we liked.
</P>
<P>
   The Tibor de Nagy Gallery has a smaller but concentrated show of
photographs by Burckhardt, dated from 1940 to the year of his
death, 1999. Between the extremes of still life in close-up and
views of the far distances of New York, it gives very good
grounding in its enormous subject.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a smaller room filled with reminiscences of
Burckhardt's friends. Among them, Alex Katz, Red Grooms, Duncan
Hannah and Avigail Schimmel stand out.

   GORE-HILLARY-PROBES (Washington) _ Separate actions by
government prosecutors deal Vice President Al Gore a potential
political setback and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton a
begrudging exoneration in connection with their activities at the
White House. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., says a senior Justice
Department prosecutor has recommended that Attorney General Janet
Reno appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Gore's
fund-raising activities in 1996. Special prosecutor Robert Ray,
meanwhile, concluded a protracted investigation to the White House
firing of travel office employees in 1993, declining to prosecute
the first lady despite finding ``substantial evidence that she had
a role in the decision'' to sack the workers. By STEWART M. POWELL.

A PIONEER IN A MAN'S WORLD, SHE WAS TOUGH ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Calif.)   By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Give people a picture or two with the news, and
they'll come crying for more. When Joseph Pulitzer bought the
faltering New York World in 1882, he planned to increase
circulation by inserting sensational woodcuts, then gradually
decreasing their number to restore the paper to dignity. A trade
journal condemned the new images as pandering to low interests and
predicted they would persuade people that ``a newspaperman has no
conscience, and that when he enters the house it is a good time to
lock up the spoons.'' But readers would not give them up. When
Pulitzer began to weed out the woodcuts, circulation plummeted
until he gave the public what it wanted once again.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't only sensation people wanted, though that helped. It
was sensation with pictures, news with pictures, stories with
pictures. By the turn of the century, when newspapers began to
print photographs in some numbers, readers had their own cameras,
courtesy of Kodak, and had decided that the medium had advantages.
In 1900, The Daily Mail in London, which dished out news and gossip
in small servings generously garnished with photographs, was the
first British paper to achieve a circulation of one million. Press
photography had become a profession.
</P>
<P>
   The profession was difficult, poorly paid and cordially
despised, but that never stopped a photographer. A few women, a
very few, even got into the act. One of them, Jessie Tarbox Beals
(1870-1942), is currently being celebrated in a show called
``Jessie Tarbox Beals: On Assignment,'' at the New-York Historical
Society. Beals, hired by The Buffalo Inquirer in 1902, was the
first woman hired as a newspaper staff photographer. She never sat
still long; In 1904 she parted company with the paper and headed
west to St. Louis in pursuit of big news: the World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons so few women entered the profession was that
equipment was so heavy. Small cameras like Kodaks were not reliable
in adverse conditions. Beals carried an 8-by-10 view camera, glass
plates and a tripod, close to 50 pounds of equipment. (She was
further encumbered by a whalebone corset and a hat the size of a
flying saucer.) Still, when a judge in a murder trial locked the
photographers out, she climbed a tall bookcase up to a transom
window, snapped a picture before she was detected and had a
five-column front-page photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Beals' pictures of the World's Fair Air Show contest are
remarkable technically and historically: technically because she
managed, with slow and cumbersome equipment, to record moving
airships and people rushing to see them; historically because they
provide an extended glimpse into early attempts to fly. The Wright
brothers had achieved 59 seconds of powered flight in 1903, but not
many people knew about it or believed it, and the Wrights could not
yet sustain and control heavier-than-air flight. On both sides of
the Atlantic, men feverishly strove to overcome gravity.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, the air was full of gliders and propeller-driven
dirigibles. Beals, who had difficulty getting access to the fair
but finally became the only woman officially recognized as a
photographer there, had herself photographed in the gondola of one
of the airships: she had a knack for self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Her pictures of the exhilarating attempt to conquer the skies
are the most compelling in the show. Beals was a good journalist
but was more exceptional for who she was and what she did than for
brilliant images. Early in the century, when news photographers
were almost entirely anonymous and did not expect to be otherwise,
she was famous because she got the pictures, had what she called
the ``hustle'' that photojournalists require _ she once insisted
that a colonel on dress parade make his troops halt so she could
get a photograph _ and had honed her talent for publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1905 she moved to New York, but even her St. Louis fame could
not get her a newspaper job, so she freelanced and ran her own
studio. Her portraits of celebrities, many of them writers and
artists, were praised at the time as equal to those of Gertrude
Kasebier and Alvin Langdon Coburn, both important portraitists,
because she used sharp focus, as news photographers did, rather
than soft, artistically inclined pictorialism.
</P>
<P>
   Today the comparison seems wrongheaded. She did make a
contribution to history, taking numerous pictures of professional
women (including Emily Post, the social arbiter of manners,
luxuriously dressed and curled up on a sofa with her typewriter in
her lap) when women in professions were still a phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Beals left the studio behind to photograph her subjects in their
own surroundings, with available light, but sometimes the
surroundings reduced the sitter to the dominant piece of furniture.
Her close-up of the Japanese-born Sadakichi Hartmann, a major
photography critic, achieves real force through the ravaged face
and emotional openness of the man, a telling example of the
subject's power to take over a portrait sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Beals took some strong pictures of immigrant and tenement life,
but these are not on display. Then, in 1917, she separated from her
husband, Alfred Tennyson Beals, moved to Greenwich Village and
opened an art gallery. She photographed bohemian society and the
tea rooms and clubs that catered to it, often selling the images as
postcards. These unprepossessing pictures have the easy naturalness
and the sense of casual, momentary observation that painters like
George Luks, John Sloan and Everett Shinn had been putting on
canvas for a decade or more. These painters, who had all been
newspaper men and trained as quick and sharp observers, believed
that urban life deserved its chroniclers. The camera was a natural
for this kind of focus on modern life, and it seems fitting that a
newspaper photographer would follow the same path.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneering woman that she was, Beals faced some of the problems
that confront all working women, problems that photojournalism
compounds. She trained her husband in photography and he became her
assistant, particularly in the darkroom, but the marriage was
troubled, and who knows if Beals was willing to take a back seat to
her hustle and her fame?
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I had abnormal strength,'' she wrote in her diary.
``Mere feminine, delicate, Dresden china type of women get nowhere
in business or professional life. They marry millionaires, if they
are lucky. But if a woman is to make headway with men, she must be
truly masculine.'' She told an interviewer, regretfully, that
because she had to work and be away, she had no time to cuddle her
daughter or sing her lullabies.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, her very success worked against her. Her publicity
and frequent lectures encouraged other women to follow in her
footsteps, and by the mid-1920s there were said to be 150 female
professional photographers in New York. Jessie Tarbox Beals, by
then in her 50s, found the competition too stiff and went to
California for a while to take pictures of Hollywood estates.
</P>
<P>
   Constrained to earn a living for herself and her daughter, she
took every kind of photograph rather than concentrating on one area
or style. ``I had too many keys that opened too many doors, in too
many places,'' she said. This left her without a distinctive
signature, but she could have signed her name ``Pioneer.''

$6 MILLION RAISED FOR ONLINE WINE MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 By TED APPEL   
 Santa Rosa, Calif., Press Democrat   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Winebusiness.com, a publishing company in
Sonoma, has raised $6 million to start an online marketplace for
winery supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the latest to enter the increasingly crowded
business-to-business market, which uses the Internet to facilitate
transactions between vintners and their suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Winebusiness.com plans to start its e-commerce site in the
United States and France before the grape harvest this fall, said
Richard Shell, the company's founder and chief executive. Localized
versions of the online marketplace will follow in other
wine-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The site currently offers access to the company's two trade
publications, Wine Business Insider and Wine Business Monthly,
along with a job board and calender of industry events. Later this
year, the site will be expanded to include a virtual market for
bulk wine, grapes, bottles, corks, barrels, equipment and other
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our online efficiencies will allow wineries to cut procurement
costs while accessing a larger array of suppliers, at the same
time,'' Shell said.
</P>
<P>
   Two wine industry suppliers were the major investors in
Winebusiness.com's second round of financing: Sabate SA, the
world's second-largest cork manufacturer, and Diosos SA, the
world's largest cooperage company.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to financing, the two French companies will provide
access to their international clients bases and will share
technical content and expertise. Shell said that neither company
would have an advantage over other suppliers on the Web site.
Winebusiness.com hopes to attract other investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shell was part of a group that acquired publishing company in
bankruptcy court in 1998. In February, Shell bought out the
majority owner, New World Wine Group, after raising $1 million in
the company's first round of financing.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from publishing into the business-to-business market is
``a natural extension,'' Shell said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which employs about 20 people in Sonoma and San
Francisco, plans to double its work force as it beefs up technology
and sales departments, Shell said.
</P>
<P>
   Wine Business Monthly has a circulation of 9,100, sent to almost
every winery and major supplier in the United States, Shell said.

   SHOWTIME _ Diversity, thy name is premium cable. Last year,
after prolonged finger-wagging by civil rights groups and
predictable hand-wringing by the major television networks, a deal
was struck to put more minorities on both sides of the camera. But
while NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox are still figuring out how to honor
that promise in their upcoming fall lineups, cable's Showtime
network is unveiling a pair of weekly dramas this summer that are
deliciously, and daringly different. ``Soul Food'' is based on the
1997 box office sleeper of the same name, and ``Resurrection
Boulevard'' revolves around a multi-generational Mexican family. In
their own way, both shows prove it's possible to produce top-notch
television with minority casts and grown-up themes. (LHarris,

&HT;     RULING PARTY CANDIDATE IN UPHILL BATTLE FOR PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In years past, Francisco Labastida Ochoa would
have been a shoo-in for the Mexican presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He is a stalwart of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI),
which has ruled Mexico since 1929, steadily climbing the ranks to
hold some of the highest posts in the government.
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida's ascendancy comes as the political landscape is
changing in Mexico, where the people are demanding greater
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   As the July 2 presidential election approaches, Labastida is in
the midst of a shootout with a real opponent.
</P>
<P>
   An energetic, experienced politician and economist who has
worked in government for 37 of his 57 years, he is the first
candidate in modern Mexican history to face a bona fide challenge
for the country's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from five generations of public servants, 200 years. I
have it in my blood,'' the PRI candidate said in a recent
interview. ``My family wanted me to become an electrical engineer
so I could have a reasonable economic life, but it's not what I
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Labastida said, ``I never imagined one day that I would
be running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in the small town of Los Mochis in western Sinaloa state,
Labastida said his father, a doctor who treated the rural poor free
of charge, instilled in him a compassion for the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was never nouveau riche,'' he said. ``I always
imagined what I could do if I had money.''
</P>
<P>
   Before launching his candidacy last year, Labastida was minister
of the interior, overseeing internal security in the Cabinet's most
powerful post.
</P>
<P>
   From 1987 until 1992, he was governor of Sinaloa when drug lords
threatened his wife and killed his bodyguard. Because of that, he
left the country in 1993 to become the ambassador to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   He has served as secretary of agriculture and energy secretary
in Mexico City. In between government posts, he taught and
published books about the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, in a country where a PRI candidate has never lost
the presidency, Labastida would be practically assured of winning
the election.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he and his party face a serious challenge from an
opponent, Vicente Fox Quesada, who has linked Labastida to the
corruption that has defined some PRI governments.
</P>
<P>
   Recent opinion polls show a virtual dead heat between Labastida
and Fox, the candidate of the center-right National Action Party,
and many observers believe Fox has a good chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   In these tense electoral days, nothing irks the PRI more than
the notion expressed by political pundits that for there to be true
democracy in Mexico, the PRI must be kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida predicts he will win by a margin of 10 percent in an
election in which nearly 50 million people, 70 percent of eligible
voters, are expected to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's prediction is not coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has been accused of voter fraud in past elections,
notably in 1988, and Fox has said that if Labastida wins by less
than 5 percent, the result would be tainted. Such a scenario could
lead to post-electoral violence and instability, many political
analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility of fraud is zero,'' Labastida maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the assertive and towering Fox, Labastida, who is
almost rail-thin from tennis, golf and scuba diving, can seem
lacking in charisma. He is a tireless campaigner, often putting in
18-hour days. But in many Labastida rallies, the energy that marks
Fox's public gatherings is missing.
</P>
<P>
   An avid reader, he is most at ease with small circles of
supporters and reporters. He makes jokes and has ready, snappy
answers to the array of charges made against his party by
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox is 90 percent image and 10 percent substance,'' said
Javier Trevino, Labastida's senior campaign adviser. ``When you
take the image away, there is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But image counts, and this election has been marked by more
U.S.-style, negative television ads than previous campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida got off to a victorious start after the party's
first-ever presidential primary election in November. He faced
three PRI opponents, but was viewed as the ``official'' candidate,
the heir to President Ernesto Zedillo, and he won in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the outgoing Mexican president selected the PRI
candidate in an internal elimination process. But Zedillo, who
leaves office in December after a six-year term, ended the practice
to the surprise of most Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of free trade and closer U.S. ties, the primary was
one of many attempts at a democratic opening to clean up the PRI's
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new PRI, closer to you,'' is a party slogan.
</P>
<P>
   At the start, Labastida touted change and renovation. But as Fox
rose in the polls, the PRI fell back on some of its discredited
veterans _ the so-called dinosaurs _ whose methods may have been in
question but not their ability to win elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``By linking arms with the party's dinosaurs, Labastida is
betraying the party's modernizers,'' political analyst Denise
Dresser wrote in the weekly Proceso magazine. ``The PRI's strategy
of bringing back the dead and mobilizing the party's machine is
going to backfire.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A fiscal conservative respected by the business community
because he would maintain Mexico's international trade ties,
Labastida proposes continuing Mexico's steady 5 percent annual
economic growth, the creation of new jobs _ through incentives for
small-and medium-size businesses _ and building 700,000 new units
of public housing.
</P>
<P>
   Although his pitch is not much different from that of Fox,
Labastida is believed to have an edge with women voters, who make
up 52 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see what's on their minds, women are just as worried
about the economy, security and the system,'' said Victoria
Rodriguez, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin who
is completing a book about women's roles in Mexican elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just more skittish about change.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Labastida's biggest assets is his wife, Maria Teresa
Uriarte, a respected historian at the National Autonomous
University in Mexico City who is rallying the female vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is a real man, not a macho,'' she said recently,
referring to the rugged-looking Fox who has been compared by the
news media to John Wayne and the ``Marlboro Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say that Labastida will revitalize the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is a big organization. There are many voices but only
one leader, and that is Labastida,'' Trevino said. ``You will see
the great transformation of the PRI on Dec. 2, when he is
president.''

BUMPER CARS ARE RISKY ON NASCAR TRACKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   They say payback is hell. Ask Dale Earnhardt about that.
</P>
<P>
   In the one-day-delayed Pocono 500 at the Pocono Raceway in Long
Pond, Pa., on Monday, Earnhardt saw certain victory go skating off
the track when Jeremy Mayfield tapped him from behind on the last
lap, causing Earnhardt, nicknamed the Intimidator, to momentarily
lose control of his car.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he recovered, Mayfield had taken the checkered flag
and Dale Jarrett and Ricky Rudd had darted under Earnhardt as well
to leave him a furious fourth.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Earnhardt, who got his nickname in part because
he has never been bashful about knocking other drivers out of his
way, did not criticize Mayfield's move publicly.
</P>
<P>
   But he did come up alongside Mayfield on the cool-down lap and
make several animated gestures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just letting him know he was No. 1,'' Earnhardt said,
his voice laced with sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many have complained that Earnhardt gets away with
moves NASCAR would never tolerate from other drivers because he is,
well, Earnhardt, and he made his reputation by bumping and banging
in close quarters.
</P>
<P>
   At last season's second race in Bristol, Tenn., Earnhardt spun
leader Terry Labonte on the last lap, winning the race but leaving
crumpled cars, including Labonte's, in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the most unpopular victories in NASCAR history,
with Earnhardt greeted by a resounding chorus of boos as he
celebrated in the victory lane. Incidents like that leave NASCAR
officials in a difficult situation. Bumping and close-quarter
racing are what make the sport, but there has to be a limit.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberately putting another competitor into a spin means
putting him in harm's way, and serious injury, or worse, could
result.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, racing is risky. What should a driver do when
the lead car cuts in front of him to prevent a pass? Should there
be a rule that drivers must always leave a lane at the bottom of
the track? How could NASCAR ever enforce that?
</P>
<P>
   And should the faster driver be content to follow a slower one
just because the driver in front won't let the one behind him by?
</P>
<P>
   About the only rule that applies now is common sense.
Competitors need to have enough respect for each other to keep
things under control.

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; State of His Union &QL;   &UR; By Laura J. Winter &QL;  &QC;  C. 2000 States
News Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON (June 22) - He organizes.
</P>
<P>
   From every corner of the political map all parties must contend
with the union this son of Philadelphia commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an ally he is great to have. You tell Jerry what you need
and he finds some way to achieve it,'' said Ed Rendell, the
chairman of the National Democratic Committee, and Philadelphia's
former mayor. ``As an enemy, he's tough. Real tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry McEntee, international president of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, is coming back
to the very spot where his father organized the city employees
first union in 1938 - Philadelphia. Starting Monday some 7,000
AFSCME delegates will descend upon the city for the union's 34th
international convention.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.3 million-strong union is a modern-day pillar of the
AFL-CIO with councils across the nation and in Puerto Rico and
Panama. McEntee, 65, is expected to be re-elected international
president Thursday for his sixth consecutive four-year term.
McEntee first took over the reins in 1981, after the death of Jerry
Wurf.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts between the city, the hospitals and Philadelphia's
105,000 AFSCME members are due to expire the last day of the
convention, Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This week-long fete registers high enough on the ``must do''
list that President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, House
Minority Leader Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Senate hopeful Rep.
Ron Klink, D-Murraysville, are expected to don their blue-collar
shirts inside the Pennsylvania Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and their campaign managers know that showing
support for McEntee in front of AFSCME's rank and file can result
in an organized army of volunteers hunting and gathering money and
votes for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The power of organizing was evidenced early to McEntee by
growing up in a family involved in the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you grew up in the McEntee house, you talked about the
labor movement breakfast, lunch and dinner,'' said long-time friend
Ed Keller, the executive director of AFSCME's Council 13,
representing Pennsylvania's state and county workers.
</P>
<P>
   McEntee's father Bill, a Sanitation Department truck driver, led
the strike that eventually forced the city to recognize and
negotiate with the union. McEntee, just a child at the time, ate
his scrapple while his father told the family about pitched battles
between city workers, the mounted police and the scabs under their
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The unionists' weapons of choice included Molotov cocktails
dropped from bridges onto tarpaulin-covered trash trucks. Flung
from the hands of strikers, milk bottles, fresh from the dairy,
smashed through windshields into the faces of scabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the days when the Republican machine ran the whole
city. It was in the days of the patronage system when you job
depended on politics,'' McEntee said. ``When they won the strike
they got another nickel or another dime, but what was more
important was that they started a union in the city. They were now
involved in the political arena.''
</P>
<P>
   McEntee represents AFSCME as the chairman of AFL-CIO's Political
Committee. And he endowed enough clout that when the vice president
named Treasury Secretary Bill Daley to the post of campaign
chairman Saturday, he and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney were
invited over to Gore's private residence for a huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it was important that two of us be there to
confirm the fact that we are speaking on behalf of the total labor
movement,'' Sweeney said. ``He is highly respected by the vice
president as well as the president.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first union job with the Philadelphia's Department of
Transportation, McEntee conducted the city's business from behind
the wheel of a blue Chevy coupe. He was doing organizing of a sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had writing on the side which said 'Bureau of Traffic
Engineering,' which sounded so important,'' McEntee said.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with determining whether an intersection was in
need of a traffic light, a stop sign or nothing at all - to improve
safety and the flow of traffic. In order to make the determination,
he was supposed to stake out an intersection and count the number
of cars and trucks going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I would give certain intersections stop signs that
they really didn't deserve. Right? Or red lights. Or maybe I'd mix
them up,'' McEntee said. ``So if you are ever in Philadelphia and
in traffic jam well maybe because I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be very funny but he can also express himself very well
when is not funny - as people on the wrong side of him have
learned.'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   As was evidenced in the 1998 mid-term elections when the
Republican majority in both houses of Congress was drastically cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did extremely well. We beat the hell out of Gingrich.
Right? He had to go back to Atlanta. Quit the House. He was no
longer the speaker,'' McEntee said. ``We whacked 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, McEntee is planning on getting enough
labor-friendly candidates elected to take back the Congress - to
have the majority votes on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   And locally he may have some influence too.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell believes that McEntee and the convention could cut down
on the negotiation time for a new four-year contract between AFSCME
members and the city and the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry was helpful in bringing about cooperation in '92. He was
helpful in ironing out the kinks in '96,'' Rendell said. ``I think
that in the city's position there is a framework for a contract. I
think the city needs to do some things that are good for the
laborers and the union needs to give a little to the city. And I
think Jerry will lend a force to help that come to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry is a great motivator,'' Rendell said. ``When you get
Jerry you get the whole package.''

HIGH TIME FOR HIGH TECH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., Switzerland)   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, with no established
exhibition like the Biennial surveys of contemporary work at the
Whitney Museum of American Art, has decided to do the next best
thing: Take a theme, in this case technology, and take the pulse of
contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   ``01.0.01: Art in Technological Times'' will be one giant
exhibition in two parts. At one minute after midnight on Jan. 1 the
museum, in collaboration with Intel, will open a show of Web-based
work that will be available on the museum's Web site,
www.sfmoma.org, and on a museum gallery site presented by Intel,
www.Artmuseum.net.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the show, from March 2 to July 8, consists of
more than two dozen installations, video works, sound pieces and
digital projects in the museum's galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by five curatorial departments _ painting and
sculpture, photography, architecture, design, and media arts and
education _ the exhibition is to include about 35 artists,
architects and designers whose work is responding to technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web has become the greatest venue for public art,'' said
David A. Ross, the museum's director. ``It reaches directly to the
viewer in a way that bypasses the museum as a physical space.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding on a way of capturing what is happening in
contemporary art, Ross said, ``art making in this moment is defined
by technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest chip maker, has helped finance
several art projects, notably ``American Century Art and Culture:
1900-2000'' at the Whitney last year, and the San Francisco show
dovetails perfectly with the core of its business, said Kevin
Teixeira, program manager for arts and technology at Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest is to see how artists are responding to our time
and the impact technology is having,'' he said. While neither
Teixeira nor Ross would say just how heavily Intel has invested in
the exhibition, people involved in the project say the figure is
close to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a survey exhibition would become a regularly scheduled
event, Ross (who was director of the Whitney for seven years,
overseeing its Biennial) said nothing had been decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the West Coast there is no periodic exhibition to take the
temperature of art of our time,'' he said. ``Let's see how people
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen Up
</P>
<P>
   FREE AT THE WHITNEY
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney Museum never offered visitors audio guides until
this spring's Biennial. But while most museums charge visitors to
use an audio guides, the Whitney's was free.
</P>
<P>
   It was also popular. About 30 percent of the 124,153 visitors to
the show used it, twice the proportion who generally opt for a
museum audio tour. This high success rate prompted the Whitney,
with support from Cendant, the direct-marketing and hotel-franchise
company, to begin offering visitors audio tours of its permanent
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in October visitors will be able to take an audio
guide tour of the prewar work on the fifth floor and a new
installation of postwar and contemporary collection on the second
floor. The tour will trace the development of American art since
the turn of the century, with voices of critics, collectors,
curators and other scholars. Visitors will also hear interviews
with artists culled from the museum's archives as well as music.
</P>
<P>
   The tour will also be accessible at the museum's Web site,
www.whitney.org, so that visitors can see images online and preview
selected works from the tour before going to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this to be universally accessible,'' said Maxwell L.
Anderson, the Whitney's director.
</P>
<P>
   The audio guides will offer new random-access equipment so
visitors may view the collection in whatever order they choose. The
guides will also be available in several languages yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   For tour groups the museum will offer a new kind of audio guide
system. Each person will have a unit the size of a cellular phone,
and the guide will speak into a headset microphone, so the group
can clearly hear what is being said without disturbing other
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   HELLO, SUNSHINE
</P>
<P>
   Florida is becoming a hotbed of art and antiques fairs. Every
February Palm Beach is the site of the International Art and
Antique Fair. Now the organizers of Art Basel, the giant modern-
and contemporary-art event held every June in Switzerland, are
taking their show on the road. From Dec. 12 to 16 they will present
a smaller version of the Basel fair in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This month the fair's management signed a multiyear contract
with the City of Miami Beach and the Miami Beach Convention Center.
About 270 dealers participate in the fair in Switzerland; in Miami
the organizers expect 100 to 150. ``We also want the event to
include architecture,'' said Samuel Keller, the show's manager. As
a result the organizers plan to use various indoor and outdoor
spaces throughout Miami Beach to show art. ``It's important to have
it in a cultural context,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Beach has its own contemporary-art scene, and Keller said
fair organizers hoped to attract exhibitors and collectors from all
over the United States as well as Latin America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   GOODBYE, GETTY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Walsh announced this week that he was stepping down as vice
president of the J. Paul Getty Trust and director of the Getty
Museum after 17 years, effective on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The news came as no surprise in the art world. Even before the
museum opened it sprawling $1 billion campus on a hilltop in Los
Angeles two years ago, there were rumors that he was planning to
leave once the building was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is being replaced by Deborah Gribbon, the museum's chief
curator, who has also been the Getty's deputy director for two
years, overseeing the museums day-to-day operations.

 &HT;    GORE'S ``MOVING PICTURES'' HEADED IN WRONG DIRECTION
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore's presidential campaign strategists like to
dismiss national polls as ``moving pictures,'' signifying very
little beyond the moment. But a lot of ``moving pictures'' are
moving in the wrong direction for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The latest is the Voter.com-Battleground poll released Thursday
showing Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican
presidential nominee, widening his lead over Gore, the presumptive
Democratic nominee, by a margin of 12 percentage points, double
Bush's lead in May.
</P>
<P>
   It comes on the same day that a Gallup poll shows Bush leading
by 4 points, a day after an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll showed
Bush with an 8-point lead, a week after a Los Angeles Times poll
showed Bush leading by 10 points and nearly two weeks after a
Washington Post-ABC poll showed Bush with a 4-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Gore campaign officials in Nashville insisted
Thursday that the vice president's campaign is right on track.
``The campaign is ready for the fall election,'' said Mark Fabiani,
the Gore campaign's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, however, Gore has to reverse the polling trend
that has favored Bush since the two men secured their parties'
presidential nominations this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane has repeatedly said that
``polls are moving pictures,'' without much significance prior to
the presidential nominating conventions this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, polls taken in June in past presidential elections have
not necessarily predicted the winner in November. In 1968, 1980,
1988 and 1992 the leader in June lost in November. Two of those
elections involved Bush's father, former President George Bush, who
trailed in June 1988 but won and led in June 1992 but lost.
</P>
<P>
   But last April, after Gore and Bush had vanquished their primary
foes, the Gore campaign pointed to the polls at that time showing
the two candidates in a virtual dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Gallup had Bush holding a statistically
meaningless 46-45 percent lead over Gore. But since then, the Texas
governor has been inching away from Gore. Gallup had Bush at 48
percent and Gore at 44 percent in their poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Voter.com-Battleground 2000 poll, widely
respected for its bipartisanship, showed Bush and Gore in a virtual
dead heat in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But in May, the poll showed Bush leading 48-42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the poll released Thursday, the last before the Republican
and Democratic conventions this summer, shows Bush widening his
lead to 52-40 percent over Gore in June.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Goeas, the Republican pollster who conducts the Battleground
poll, said the Bush campaign ``appears to be healthy and in full
force'' following a tougher-than-expected primary contest with Sen.
John McCain of Arizona and is reaching a broad spectrum of voters,
including such Democratic-leaning groups as seniors, union
households and women.
</P>
<P>
   His only cautious word about the Bush campaign was that the
governor has just about ``maximized'' his appeal to core Republican
voters and must be careful not to lose the moderate swing voters -
``the voters you can rent but never buy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, his Democratic counterpart in the Battleground
poll, said Bush has benefited from a Republican base ``much more
energized'' that traditional Democratic voters, but insisted that
the upcoming Democratic convention would focus their attention on
the race, especially women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have kids, work, laundry to juggle,'' she said. ``Women
have traditionally been late to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goeas argued that Gore's lag in the poll is the result of
the vice president's inability to connect with voters rather than
the voters' attention being elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``By last count, the Gore campaign has tried to reinvent
candidate Al Gore five or six times,'' he said. ``The message the
Gore campaign seems to be sending, and reinforcing, with the voters
is that Al Gore is an empty shell.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake said turnout would be crucial to a Democratic victory.
``We'll need a strong grass-roots campaign to win in November,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Voter.com queried 1,000 likely voters between June 11 and 13.
The poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Gallup
polled 1,032 likely voters June 6 and 7. Its margin of error was 3
percent.

COLUMN: WHEN IT COMES TO OIL, IT'S DEMAND THAT COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Why are gasoline prices so high?
</P>
<P>
   It's the demand, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   For those who remember the 1970s, there is something familiar
about oil ministers meeting in Vienna, Austria, to decide whether
to open the production taps a bit further as analysts debate
whether 700,000 barrels a day of additional production will make
much difference.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, it won't. Because if that extra supply would
change things very much, that supply would vanish. The oil crisis,
circa 2000, is not a supply-side phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the oil market is nothing like a normal market.
In a normal market, the marginal producer, the one who provides the
last bit of supply, is the high-cost producer. If prices rise a
lot, that producer can finally make a profit and starts to increase
supply. That supply meets rising demand and helps to hold down
prices.
</P>
<P>
   In oil, however, that situation is turned on its head. The
marginal suppliers are the Gulf states, principally Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait. They are also the lowest cost producers, and the ones
with reserves that will last for decades. The high-cost producers,
such as many wells in this country, are pumping all out and will
not add production anytime soon no matter how high the price goes.
</P>
<P>
   When demand is weak, oil prices can collapse because many oil
producers need revenue and will pump all they can. That happened
most recently in 1998, when Asian economies went in the tank. But
when demand is strong, as it is now, it is futile to rely on oil
producers to start cheating and driving the price down, or to hope
that diplomacy can have much of an effect.
</P>
<P>
   What would lead the Saudis to start pumping enough oil to bring
down prices? In a word, fear. If they feared that a worldwide
recession was imminent and knew that would cause demand to plummet,
they might act. There is no such fear now.
</P>
<P>
   But the other fear is a longer-range one. A trend away from oil
would be a scary phenomenon to the oil-rich Saudis, and they would
hate to see a renewal of the 1970's trends toward better fuel
economy and alternative energy sources. They are no doubt thrilled
that the U.S. law mandating high fuel economy for cars has a huge
loophole classifying gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles as trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices have entered the political debate, but not in any way
that should scare the Saudis. Republicans blast pollution rules for
driving up the cost of gasoline in the Midwest. Democrats suspect
oil companies are seizing an opportunity to increase profit
margins. Both are right, at least to some extent, but both are
beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   The real mistake in Washington came in the years after the last
oil crisis, when oil prices were weak and Americans lost interest
in energy conservation. Higher gas taxes and less loophole-laden
fuel-economy rules would have helped avert the current problem.
</P>
<P>
   Such actions were not taken because no effective lobbying groups
were backing them and because they didn't sound like vote winners.
The last president to really push energy conservation was Jimmy
Carter _ remember the sweaters he wore as he urged us to turn down
the heat in our homes _ and everyone knows what happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   So now oil prices are high, and they are likely to remain above
$25 a barrel until growth slows significantly in an important
region of the world _ or until the Saudis grow worried that this
country will again get serious about energy conservation and
research into alternative energy sources. It's the demand that
counts.

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; State of His Union &QL;   &UR; By Laura J. Winter &QL;  &QC;  C. 2000 States
News Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON (June 22) - He organizes.
</P>
<P>
   From every corner of the political map all parties must contend
with the union this son of Philadelphia commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an ally he is great to have. You tell Jerry what you need
and he finds some way to achieve it,'' said Ed Rendell, the
chairman of the National Democratic Committee, and Philadelphia's
former mayor. ``As an enemy, he's tough. Real tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry McEntee, international president of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, is coming back
to the very spot where his father organized the city employees
first union in 1938 - Philadelphia. Starting Monday some 7,000
AFSCME delegates will descend upon the city for the union's 34th
international convention.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.3 million-strong union is a modern-day pillar of the
AFL-CIO with councils across the nation and in Puerto Rico and
Panama. McEntee, 65, is expected to be re-elected international
president Thursday for his sixth consecutive four-year term.
McEntee first took over the reins in 1981, after the death of Jerry
Wurf.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts between the city, the hospitals and Philadelphia's
105,000 AFSCME members are due to expire the last day of the
convention, Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This week-long fete registers high enough on the ``must do''
list that President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, House
Minority Leader Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Senate hopeful Rep.
Ron Klink, D-Murraysville, are expected to don their blue-collar
shirts inside the Pennsylvania Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and their campaign managers know that showing
support for McEntee in front of AFSCME's rank and file can result
in an organized army of volunteers hunting and gathering money and
votes for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The power of organizing was evidenced early to McEntee by
growing up in a family involved in the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you grew up in the McEntee house, you talked about the
labor movement breakfast, lunch and dinner,'' said long-time friend
Ed Keller, the executive director of AFSCME's Council 13,
representing Pennsylvania's state and county workers.
</P>
<P>
   McEntee's father Bill, a Sanitation Department truck driver, led
the strike that eventually forced the city to recognize and
negotiate with the union. McEntee, just a child at the time, ate
his scrapple while his father told the family about pitched battles
between city workers, the mounted police and the scabs under their
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The unionists' weapons of choice included Molotov cocktails
dropped from bridges onto tarpaulin-covered trash trucks. Flung
from the hands of strikers, milk bottles, fresh from the dairy,
smashed through windshields into the faces of scabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the days when the Republican machine ran the whole
city. It was in the days of the patronage system when you job
depended on politics,'' McEntee said. ``When they won the strike
they got another nickel or another dime, but what was more
important was that they started a union in the city. They were now
involved in the political arena.''
</P>
<P>
   McEntee represents AFSCME as the chairman of AFL-CIO's Political
Committee. And he endowed enough clout that when the vice president
named Treasury Secretary Bill Daley to the post of campaign
chairman Saturday, he and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney were
invited over to Gore's private residence for a huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it was important that two of us be there to
confirm the fact that we are speaking on behalf of the total labor
movement,'' Sweeney said. ``He is highly respected by the vice
president as well as the president.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first union job with the Philadelphia's Department of
Transportation, McEntee conducted the city's business from behind
the wheel of a blue Chevy coupe. He was doing organizing of a sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had writing on the side which said 'Bureau of Traffic
Engineering,' which sounded so important,'' McEntee said.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with determining whether an intersection was in
need of a traffic light, a stop sign or nothing at all - to improve
safety and the flow of traffic. In order to make the determination,
he was supposed to stake out an intersection and count the number
of cars and trucks going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I would give certain intersections stop signs that
they really didn't deserve. Right? Or red lights. Or maybe I'd mix
them up,'' McEntee said. ``So if you are ever in Philadelphia and
in traffic jam well maybe because I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be very funny but he can also express himself very well
when is not funny - as people on the wrong side of him have
learned.'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   As was evidenced in the 1998 mid-term elections when the
Republican majority in both houses of Congress was drastically cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did extremely well. We beat the hell out of Gingrich.
Right? He had to go back to Atlanta. Quit the House. He was no
longer the speaker,'' McEntee said. ``We whacked 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, McEntee is planning on getting enough
labor-friendly candidates elected to take back the Congress - to
have the majority votes on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   And locally he may have some influence too.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell believes that McEntee and the convention could cut down
on the negotiation time for a new four-year contract between AFSCME
members and the city and the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry was helpful in bringing about cooperation in '92. He was
helpful in ironing out the kinks in '96,'' Rendell said. ``I think
that in the city's position there is a framework for a contract. I
think the city needs to do some things that are good for the
laborers and the union needs to give a little to the city. And I
think Jerry will lend a force to help that come to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry is a great motivator,'' Rendell said. ``When you get
Jerry you get the whole package.''

 &HT;    Young missionaries from Hobe Sound Bible College spend a week in
the wilds of Okeechobee
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH FLORIDA _ Thirty miles north of Lake Okeechobee, past a
dirt road that peters out into two ruts in the woods, 18-year-old
Levi Adams is preparing to spend four weeks in South Africa
preaching the Word.
</P>
<P>
   And sweating _ a lot. It's 88 degrees in the shade and the shade
is the closest thing to air conditioning in sight. This is
missionary boot camp, South Florida style, and the order of the day
is readying 30 teenage and twentysomething evangelists like Adams
for a month in the mission fields of some far-flung places.
Sweating is part of that preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he going to South Africa? ``I think the Lord wants me to
go,'' said Levi. ``I'm hoping to put an impact on the kids' lives
so when they get older they'll remember that there is a God and
that no matter what kind of poverty they are in or whatever, they
can still feel loved.''
</P>
<P>
   During the five-day camp, the four groups heading to Mongolia,
Alaska, the Dominican Republic and South Africa help build and
maintain the handful of structures on the 26-acre camp, memorize
Bible verses, cook in a rustic kitchen and take part in games and
exercises to build cohesiveness. At night they sleep in tents and
by day they are strictly graded on how well they clean their camp
sites and do their chores.
</P>
<P>
   It's a clean-cut and high-spirited crew from all over the United
States. The boys wear blue pants and the girls wear blue,
ankle-length denim skirts with their hair in braids. Everybody has
on the same blue and white T-shirts with the name of their
destination on the back. Reveille is at dawn and the first order of
business is to run an obstacle course worthy of Fort Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough but if I wasn't here I'd be a bum sleeping till 2
every day,'' said April Delgado, an 18-year-old from Hollywood,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 13th year the Hobe Sound Bible College has run the
camp. The hardships shared by the kids are designed to teach them
to rely on one another and to prepare them for life away from the
comforts of the United States. Ideally, says Director George
Vernon, when they arrive at their destinations they will be able to
help the full-time missionaries already there spread the Gospel,
and not waste too much time acclimating to their new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to break them down a little bit and then build them up
so they'll be stronger,'' says Vernon. ``We want them to operate as
a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The interdenominational Protestant camp is part of the Bible
college's Touching Lives for Christ program (TLC) which tries to
spread the Christian Gospel through service projects. To pay for
their trips the kids raise about $2,500 a piece, usually by
soliciting friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Camps like this are becoming more popular since they first began
in the 1960s. About 20,000 kids will train this summer in one- and
two-week courses across the country before heading out to mission
fields all over the world. Though the TLC program is evenly split,
overall the trips tend to attract about twice as many girls as
boys.
</P>
<P>
   Teen Missions International on Merritt Island is the granddaddy
of the teen boot camps, growing from just a handful of kids 30
years ago to 1,500 this summer. Programs have gotten so popular
that in the last few years the camp opened courses for 10- to
13-year-olds and, more recently, for 7- to 9-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all started because when we began taking kids to the
mission fields they were a danger to themselves and they had
terrible culture shock,'' said Camille Haddock, a camp director at
Teen Missions International. ``This makes them much more
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Curriculum at these camps typically stresses how to travel
safely, work with people from other cultures and evangelize
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The group from TLC heading to Mongolia, for instance, learned
never to point, pass anything with their left hand and to expect
some pushing and shoving when they are waiting in line. And if they
accidentally step on someone's toes in a crowd? Shake hands and
smile.
</P>
<P>
   They also learn what to do if they are abducted or arrested.
(Maintain a physical and mental routine and try to remain
positive.)
</P>
<P>
   Youth organizations like TLC and Teen Missions International are
major feeding grounds for full-time, adult missionaries, said
Haddock. There are about 40,000 missionaries from the United States
working abroad at any given time, according to Operation World in
Colorado Springs, Col., an organization that compiles missionary
statistics. About 35,000 are Protestant and 5,000 are Catholic.
Most missionaries spend two to four years abroad and then come back
to the United States for a year to meet with their sponsors and
raise money.
</P>
<P>
   What makes missionary work so fulfilling, says Bud Hannold, a
TLC camp counselor and a veteran of four missions, is that in most
Third World countries people are more willing to listen to the
Gospel than they are in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very hardened here,'' Hannold said. ``People are
much more open in the places where we go. They're a lot easier to
talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   The sort of evangelical work the teens will do is pretty basic,
said Hannold. Mostly they will teach children Bible stories and
songs and pass out religious pamphlets. In Mongolia they will work
at a missionary orphanage. The aim of that particular orphanage is
to teach the children to become evangelists to their countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really fun to teach and to watch people grow with the
Lord,'' said Leah Delamarter, a 22-year-old team leader who grew up
the daughter of missionary parents in Papua, New Guinea. She has
taught Bible class since she was 9 years old. ``We tell them a
story, a true story, and they decide whether to follow it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they decide to follow it, it can make their lives better
and that feels good to see.''

IT'S A FOXY LADY, A SMASHED GUITAR _ IT'S THE EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A purple haze has settled over Seattle and it's not going away.
Make that a red, silver, gold and baby blue haze with a purple
accent.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gehry's design for the Experience Music Project is a
rising tide that lifts all boats. Not only does EMP look smashing
on its own, it casts a festive air over its drab neighbors. They
include most of the buildings at Seattle Center, those forlorn
survivors from the 1962 World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
   The Monorail also gets a big boost. Thanks to Gehry, there's
finally a reason to ride it. Its trains cruise through the
undulating folds of his building's exterior, causing adults to
blink and babies to chortle.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Center owes a big debt to the Los Angeles architect, but
he in turn owes one to Seattle Center. The place is perfect for
what he wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   That goal is easy to define: He wanted to make something new.
With this painted aluminum, glass and steel extravaganza, he
succeeded. As he put it himself when he was in town last month,
``Nobody has seen this before or will see it again. Nobody will
build another one.''
</P>
<P>
   The voluptuous splendor of Gehry's Guggenheim Museum, which
opened in 1997 in Bilbao, Spain, earned him worldwide acclaim.
Acclaimed work has its downside, because it becomes the measure of
everything else an architect does.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry didn't want EMP to be Bilbao II. EMP isn't as elegant, but
it wasn't designed to be elegant. It strikes out on its own to
pursue different ends and come to different conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Bilbao put a dazzling cap on 20th-century architecture, and EMP
greets the new century with a novel way for a building to take up
space yet stay in motion.
</P>
<P>
   EMP is Gehry's first major foray into 21st-century architecture,
and it was inspired by rock 'n' roll. Since rock 'n' roll got its
start in the 1950s, Gehry dipped back to a 1950s/early 1960s
futurism to animate his building.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Seattle Center needs to take a bow. When it comes
to back-to-the-future chic, few places are as well-endowed. The
Space Needle and the Monorail are classics of the genre, as is the
center's fountain, that stranded, soaker-hose of a flying saucer.
</P>
<P>
   EMP could be a stage set for an updated version of the old movie
serial, ``Terry and the Pirates,'' especially inside, where the
walls give the impression of being on the verge of shrinking in on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Flash Gordon wouldn't need to go inside. He could fight off evil
forces with the lightning bolts he'd send zigzagging from the
flying edges of the building's colorful gown.
</P>
<P>
   If Bilbao were a jewel, you'd have to insure it and keep it in a
bank vault. If EMP were a jewel, you could buy it at Woolworth's
and wear it to upstage the queen.
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll is democratic. I.M. Pei's Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame Museum in Cleveland is high-toned, and it's a disaster. Paul
Allen and his sister Jody Patton wanted Gehry to do more than
create a house for their memories of rock music.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted the building to be a kind of rock music, and that's
what it is. It gives physical form to a backbeat as basic as a
heart's.
</P>
<P>
   Rock has acquired its own highly educated experts, but the music
has been hedonistic from the start. To convey this, Gehry got
another gift from Seattle Center. EMP is right next to the Fun
Forest amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   The front entrance to EMP on Fifth Avenue is not the best place
to see it. For the full effect, stroll through the amusement park
on the west side.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry's building picks up on the blue water rippling down the
front of the log ride, amplifies it and bounces it back off the
multicolored roller coaster. What was a vacancy at the heart of the
park now has focus and direction. The once-tired Fun Forest is born
again, and this time it's born to boogie.
</P>
<P>
   Because he prefers Haydn to Hendrix, Gehry said he relied on his
staff for rock 'n' roll expertise. Thinking that over as reporters
wrote it down, he went on to claim some familiarity with 1960s
rock, from Rambling Jack Elliott to the Mamas and the Papas. ``Cass
Elliott (Mama Cass) was a friend,'' he said. EMP and Elliott: The
two have a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that Allen's $100 million tribute to his idol, Jimi
Hendrix, is actually a tribute to Gehry's friend? Remember, she was
the large one who could dazzle when she danced.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the kind of grace Gehry's building has, the grace
of a fat person with fleet feet.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five feet high at its top, EMP is broad of beam, flaring
out in lumbering sections to curve in at a surprisingly dainty
base.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry loves the exuberant assemblages of Robert Rauschenberg,
and it's easy to see Rauschenberg's influence in the lumbering
blocks of the building's colors nestled side to side like buffaloes
at a watering hole.
</P>
<P>
   But EMP is even closer to Gaston LaChaise's bronze homages to
the fine figure of his wife early in the last century. Her huge
breasts, belly, hips and thighs extend down to tiny, tapered feet.
She floats in place as if she were made of air.
</P>
<P>
   LaChaise's nudes have an unabashed sexuality never seen before
in American sculpture. EMP is sexy, too. It's a building devoted to
the spirit of a sexy fat girl. It honors Elliott and all the other
big mamas in rock who just want to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the fun gets a little crowded. EMP officials say 2,250
people can be in the 140,000-square-foot museum at any one time,
but that many people better be in a friendly mood. Claustrophobics
beware: EMP's interiors will stick to you like a cheap suit.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry designed the front lobby, the bookstore and the cafe. All
are appropriately swoopy. They undulate through space with a
frenzied energy. They bear a resemblance to the stage sets for the
1919 silent movie, ``The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,'' which were
created to reflect the mind of a madman.
</P>
<P>
   The interior design of the rest of the space doesn't rise to
Gehry's level. It's Gehry-lite, but so packed with heady,
interactive experiences, it won't matter much.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, EMP is an experience worth having. Is it
based on the shape of smashed guitars, the inner ear or the outer
hills of Mongolia? Because Gehry is not a literalist, he welcomes
all metaphors, especially when they pile on top of each other. The
building is what you think it is.
</P>
<P>
   Roll over, Beethoven, and wake up, Little Susie. London may be
calling, but Seattle is now world headquarters for rock history.

EYE CONTACT: JAMES MARSDEN TALKS ABOUT `X-MEN'

Berry in a scene from ``X-Men.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Sometimes your best fans are your worst enemies.
 &HT;    James Marsden, who plays Cyclops in ``X-Men,'' knows that untold
numbers of X-maniacs are counting the days until the release of
director Bryan Singer's megamovie.
 &HT;    And Marsden also knows that those selfsame aficionados of ``The
Uncanny X-Men,'' the planet's most popular comic book, are already
more than a little keyed up and concerned about the July 14
release.
 &HT;    ``When somebody is a big fan of something and has been reading
it their whole life, they have certain expectations,'' the actor
says. ``That's not me, actually, because I haven't ever really been
into comic books.
 &HT;    ``But I do know how seriously people take `X-Men,''' he adds.
``After I got the role and read the comic, I wanted to go by the
comic.''
 &HT;    Like the comic book, the film introduces us to Scott Summers,
a.k.a. Cyclops, a mutant who can fire a concussive, explosive beam
of red light from his eyes _ a beam which can be controlled only by
a visor holding ruby-quartz lenses. Cyclops is one of the good
guys, joining Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his followers in
combating the machinations of Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant
determined to annihilate mankind.
 &HT;    Marsden _ best known as the chiseled star of the television
series ``Party of Five'' and the films ``Disturbing Behavior''
(1998) and ``Gossip'' (2000) _ describes Cyclops as young, stoic
and deadly serious, though the film does make time to explore the
love triangle between Cyclops and fellow X-Men Jean Grey (Famke
Janssen) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).
 &HT;    The pairing of the 26-year-old Marsden and the 35-year-old
Janssen has created a stir among die-hard fans, who know Scott and
Jean as contemporaries, classmates at Professor X's school for
mutants.
 &HT;    ``To be completely honest, the age issue was Bryan's problem
through the whole casting period,'' Marsden says. ``I met Bryan
five or six times, and around the fourth time he said, `Well, look,
if I go younger you have the role.' Thank God he decided to go
younger!
 &HT;    ``People freak out because, in the comic, Scott and Jean are the
same age,'' Marsden says by telephone from his Los Angeles home.
``I don't worry about it too much, because I don't see any reason
why you can't have an older woman with a younger guy. You see it so
often in Hollywood, where it's a way-older guy with a younger girl.
 &HT;    ``When I say `older woman,' in our case it's by just a few
years,'' he hastens to add. ``I also have to point out that `X-Men'
has been out for 37 years, and the characters have all aged five
years. So we've got to start somewhere if we're going to do this as
a franchise.''
 &HT;    The comic-book Cyclops is a troubled, brooding character, torn
between his duties as team leader and the isolation imposed by his
potentially lethal power. But Marsden reports than this aspect of
the role is largely absent from the movie.
 &HT;    ``In the early versions of the script, there was a bit of Scott
being insecure and struggling with the idea of being the group's
leader,'' Marsden says. ``He didn't feel well suited for the group,
and felt everyone was at risk being around him.
 &HT;    ``Some of that's still there, but there are so many story lines
and characters that it was hard to get in the last little detail
from the comic,'' the actor says. ``The tragic-hero element is not
really in the movie, but I tried to show a little of it in my
scenes. People can decide for themselves if it's in there.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Marsden emphasizes, ``X-Men'' does retain the
comic book's overall theme of outsiders fighting for acceptance by
mainstream society.
 &HT;    ``We're not preaching to anybody,'' he says, ``but Bryan saw a
great story in this group of people who, by nature, against their
will, have been condemned and threatened by the human race, but who
need to figure out a way to live with the human race.
 &HT;    ``If, in real life, you're any sort of minority, you've probably
felt that way,'' he adds. ``Everybody has felt like an outcast, and
everybody wants to fit in and belong. That's the idea that Bryan
liked about the comic, and he just went with that raw
information.''
 &HT;    Next up for Marsden is the comedy ``Sugar and Spice,'' opposite
Mena Suvari. After that he'll plunge into ``Ocean Warrior,'' a
biopic in which he'll portray Greenpeace founder Paul Watson.
 &HT;    And after that Marsden might slip on Cyclops' visor again _
always assuming, of course, that ``X-Men'' is popular enough to
warrant a sequel, which the actor thinks it will be.
 &HT;    ``Bryan is a really talented director,'' he says. ``The film
won't have a silly, tongue-in-cheek style, with people running
around in leotards. It's a grounded-in-reality movie.
 &HT;    ``If Bryan's going to do a comic-book movie, he's going to do
one that will shock the world.''

U.N. PLANS INTERNATIONALLY RUN COURT IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The head of the U. N. mission in Kosovo,
Bernard Kouchner, plans to create an internationally run court to
try war and ethnic crimes in the province, which has lacked a
credible judicial system under his administration.
</P>
<P>
   The new court, the Kosovo War and Ethnic Crimes Court, would be
headed by international judges and prosecutors, and supplemented by
equal numbers of Albanian, Serb and other ethnic minority jurists.
The court is expected to break new ground in the pursuit of
postconflict justice, providing the impartiality and scope of an
international tribunal with the immediacy of locally executed
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed by a commission of Albanian and international legal
experts last year, the court has languished as only an idea until
now, neglected as the U.N. administration tried to put a local
judiciary in place.
</P>
<P>
   But as Serb judges have refused or been intimidated from serving
on the local courts, leaving the judicial system hopelessly
one-sided, the special court has emerged as the crucial element,
and perhaps the last chance, to bring justice and reconciliation to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The court is conceived as a local specialized court, with
primacy over other local courts, and concentrating specifically on
war crimes committed during the armed conflict in Kosovo, and on
serious crimes committed on racial, ethnic or political grounds
since the war ended. Its mandate would cover war crimes committed
by Serbs during the conflict, and the court would also try
Albanians responsible for the abductions and killings of Serbs and
other ethnic minorities during and after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner is expected to sign a regulation bringing the court
into existence within the next 15 days, and according to one U.N.
official close to him, he has made the decision in recognition that
attempts to give the local judiciary a chance to dispense justice
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kouchner thinks we need a credible judiciary. Taking stock of
one year in office, that is our failure,'' the official said,
referring to the lack of a court system. ``The only way to kick
start it now is with internationals.''.
</P>
<P>
   As violence continues to simmer between the majority Albanian
and the dwindling Serb communities here, a judicial system is
essential if international peacekeepers, police and administrators
are to stabilize the province, said Kosovare Kelmendi, an Albanian
lawyer who heads the Pristina office of the Humanitarian Center for
Law. ``It has to start as fast as possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian victims of war crimes committed by Serbian forces
during the armed conflict have yet to see justice done in the
courts a year after the conflict ended and the United Nations took
over. While the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague has
issued indictments against Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president, and four others, and is preparing more, prosecutors
admit that they cannot handle all the cases.
</P>
<P>
   It could take as long as two years before the first Serbs go on
trial for war crimes in Kosovo, Graham Blewitt, deputy prosecutor
of the tribunal, said during a visit to Kosovo this week. But the
Kosovo war crimes court could start trying cases as early as the
fall. Also, officials said they would not limit their sights to
only low-level perpetrators or the less significant crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, gypsies and other ethnic minorities, victims of revenge
attacks and abductions by Albanians, have also seen months of
lawlessness go unchecked. Some local courts have now begun working
but offer little promise of a fair trial since the panel of judges
are predominantly Albanian. Serb defence lawyers have already
requested for trials to be referred to the special court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first court of its nature, it is a response
to such a need for justice,'' said Fernando Castanon, head of the
prosecution services in the U.N. administration, who is
coordinating the installation of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Castanon who headed the truth commission in Guatemala, and had
experience in postwar justice in African countries, agreed he is
breaking new ground with this court. He explained that however a
war ends, with a peace treaty or victory of one side, ``there is
always a question of what to do with the crimes of the past or the
most serious crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternatives to date have been the ad hoc solutions of the
international war crimes tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, or
local courts which are often not ready to respond. Castanon's plan
for the Kosovo special court would provide, he says, a sustainable
solution that could serve as a blueprint for many other postwar
societies.
</P>
<P>
   The court is intended to complement the Hague Tribunal, which
would retain primacy, and could demand to transfer a trial to the
Hague. Yet, unlike the Hague, it would implement local law in
Kosovo which the local communities could see and understand. ``They
can see the building, they know lawyers are going in there, they
have at least, in practice, justice,'' Castanon said.
</P>
<P>
   The international leadership of the court would remove the
pressure and intimidation that local jurists, both Serb and
Albanian, are already experiencing in Kosovo. The offices of the
prosecution, defence and trial chambers will all be headed by
internationals and each panel of judges trying cases will have one
or two international judges, one Albanian, and one Serb or other
ethnic minority judge.
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of almost 100 people, approximately half of them
internationals, and extras like a witness protection program, the
court is expected to cost $10 million a year.

`DATELINE': INSURANCE DENIED ... IS SECOND OPINION TO CUT COSTS? 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Alaska, Idaho)  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By DAVID DeWITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1993 Lecreca Duffy of Alaska was in an auto accident. In 1992
Cindy Robinson of Idaho was in an auto accident. Each woman's
doctor diagnosed activity-reducing injuries and suggested extensive
treatment. Each woman's auto insurance company required a second
medical opinion before authorizing payment.
</P>
<P>
   Each company _ actually, the same company in both cases _
sharply reduced compensation based on that second opinion, each
time from evaluators who had never met the patient and based their
report solely on a review of medical records.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, known as a ``paper review,'' falls under the
critical gaze of ``Dateline NBC'' Friday night in a segment that
proves network news magazines can still produce compelling reports
in a genre that has lately seemed desperate for material.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Dateline'' segment, titled ``The Paper Chase,'' is based
on a 15-month investigation. The correspondent, John Larson,
narrates the bureaucratic and apparently profit-minded system that
denied payment for vital treatment to Duffy, Robinson and, by
implication, many other policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Each woman had a policy with State Farm Insurance, which often
employs outside companies, as do other large insurance companies,
for objective analyses of medical information when it evaluates
claims. The ``Dateline'' report acknowledges that such analyses may
be medically useful, but not in the chilling practices of two such
paper review companies, Comprehensive Medical Review and Medical
Claims Review Services.
</P>
<P>
   In Duffy's case, for instance, ``Dateline'' interviews a former
employee of Comprehensive Medical Review. He is a journalist who
acknowledges he has no medical training; he says he basically
cobbled his reports from stock paragraphs suggested by the company,
almost all intended to minimize injuries. Injury is a word that
company policy suggests writers avoid because it is
``inflammatory.'' Pain is also risky, the policy says; it suggests
discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   These reports are supposed to be approved by doctors, but
another company insider, interviewed on camera with features
obscured, says such approvals amount to little more than
``autograph sessions'' by often uninterested doctors handling 30 or
more files an hour. Worse, Duffy's report bears the approval of a
doctor who says his signature was forged; ``Dateline'' suggests the
evaluation was approved not by a medical expert, but by management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could this really be true?,'' Larson asks after one such
revelation, a hype-inducing moment atypical of this mostly sober,
authoritative report. ``The Paper Chase'' concentrates on the
larger systemic issues of its subject, focusing on the human
consequences of paper reviews and their apparent motivation: money.
``Dateline'' interviews a former State Farm executive who says,
``There's only one motivation for using a paper review, and that's
to increase profits by reducing costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The disturbing comment resonates in the context of the struggles
of Duffy and Robinson, who are shown grappling with pain, debts and
despair. Both women have since reached settlements, but they retain
reason to distrust their insurance. After seeing this report, many
viewers may feel the same way. &QL;

HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON ON EXECUTIONS; FIX A FRACTURED JUDICIAL
SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The evidence continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, death penalty cases are mishandled at an
alarming rate, with defendants often provided inappropriate counsel
and scant hope of relief in appellate courts. Americans can't
continue to ignore legal incompetence, ineffective defense and
perfunctory judicial oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Until the states enact meaningful reform, it's time to stop
executing criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Let us be clear: There is little question in most cases that the
person involved needs to be in prison. What is less clear is
whether this society has taken all available steps to determine
that they deserve to be put to death. It is that process that
separates us from them.
</P>
<P>
   This issue runs deeper than election-year politics. Republicans
and Democrats, death penalty supporters and opponents alike want a
criminal justice system that is fair and efficient, and respects
due process for all.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports indicate that this is not the case in America
today. The Chicago Tribune recently studied the 131 death penalty
cases in Texas that were carried out since January 1993. The
results confirm the anecdotal evidence that once someone is facing
capital punishment in Texas, that person is at the mercy of a
judicial system so tilted toward imposing death sentences that
meaningful constitutional protections are rendered virtually moot.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune found that one-third of the defendants in the Texas
cases were represented at trial (or in initial appeals) by
attorneys who had been or were later disbarred, suspended or
sanctioned in some other way.
</P>
<P>
   In 40 of the cases, either no evidence or only one witness was
presented during the sentencing phase of the trial. In 23 cases,
testimony from fellow inmates _ notorious for its lack of
credibility _ played a role during the sentencing or guilt phases
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   And 29 of the cases included testimony by a psychiatrist whom
the American Psychiatric Association labeled unethical and
untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, seven cases involved testimony by one psychiatrist,
Dr. Walter Quijano, who used a statistical model to infer that a
defendant's race was a predictor of ``future dangerousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Quijano's ``junk science'' was roundly rejected by
Attorney General John Cornyn, who has initiated a review of all
cases involving such testimony, it would be foolish to say that
this is indicative of a system that works.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is just one example. Evidence of equally egregious
problems was found in Illinois, where the pro-death-penalty
governor has taken the bold stand of calling for a moratorium on
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   How can Americans know for sure that every capital defendant has
received a fair trial in light of cases in which defense attorneys
were unqualified and less-than-reliable witnesses and questionable
evidence are presented _ and accepted?
</P>
<P>
   How can we believe that due process is upheld when criminal
appeals courts find no reversible error in cases with sleeping
lawyers and determinations of a defendant's ``future
dangerousness'' that rely heavily on ethnicity?
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty is not merely about criminals or a society's
collective sense of justice served. To exact the most final of
penalties, we must demand rigorous safeguards. And it is incumbent
upon the 39 states that use capital punishment as a sentencing
option to put those safeguards into place.
</P>
<P>
   For Texas, state Sen. Rodney Ellis's judicial reform package is
a start.
</P>
<P>
   _ Standardize and fund indigent defense systems throughout the
state to ensure vigorous, qualified counsel for all defendants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use DNA testing in the post-conviction phase when a
defendant's identity is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create an oversight commission with subpoena powers to review
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come for a moratorium on the death penalty in
America. The Texas Legislature can do its part by following the
lead of Illinois Gov. George Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   This editorial should not be seen as a stand against imposing
the death penalty. This isn't about lessening sentences or
shielding criminals from their deserved punishment.
</P>
<P>
   It's about defending constitutional protections and securing
justice for all.

 &HT;    THOSE WHO FOUGHT FOR GAY RIGHTS RECALL THE STRUGGLE TO BECOME
VISIBLE
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This weekend's Atlanta Gay Pride celebration boasts a
float-filled parade down Peachtree Street; 30 grand marshals,
including Mayor Bill Campbell; and a performance in Piedmont Park
by the B-52's. Organizers are bracing for an estimated 300,000
attendees from across the South.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1970, Atlanta's first Gay Pride rally comprised a ragtag
group of about 100 people, mostly white men in jeans and T-shirts,
bravely strolling down a downtown sidewalk carrying ``Equal Rights
for Gays'' placards. The event marked the first anniversary of a
1969 police raid and subsequent riot at the Stonewall Inn, a gay
bar in New York's Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with acceptance of homosexuality at an all-time high
across the nation, Stonewall's anniversary is widely celebrated.
Atlanta Gay Pride has become a Midtown party endorsed by mainstream
politicians and funded by corporations. Sponsors including Coors,
Pepsi, Jose Cuervo, Stoli and Showtime have donated about $250,000
in cash and services for Pride 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1970, when gays were very much on the fringe, Atlanta was
one of only a handful of cities to hold a rally marking Stonewall.
There were no big-bucks sponsors _ most Atlantans paid little
attention at all until anti-gay activist and singer Anita Bryant
appeared here at the time of a march in 1978 _ but there was also
little harassment and no major attempt to block the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta had a liberal leadership and attitudes that were
compassionate and peaceful,'' says Sam Massell, who became mayor in
1970. ``Not only for lesbians and gays but for blacks, Jews and all
people. The city's gay population also exhibited a willingness to
become a part of the larger community as well. That helped with the
city's acceptance of such activities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta being the cradle of the civil rights movement only
helped the gay rights movement,'' says Gene Holloway, 43, of
Norcross, who helped organize the 1976 event. ``It's unlike any
other city in the South because of Dr. King. People always say
there's a difference between the movements. To my thinking, a
struggle is a struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the early years of Pride, some attendees chose to hide
their faces under bags or costume masks.
</P>
<P>
   A photo from 1973's march published in ``The Atlanta Barb,'' one
of the city's first gay newspapers, shows a woman marching with a
paper sack over her head. One hand firmly grasps the bag while the
other holds a sign: ``If I Showed My Face I Would Lose My Job. How
Would You Like to Live Like This?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I marched next to a woman once who was fired after her boss
saw her on the news,'' recalls Linda Bryant, 52, who opened Charis
Books &AMP; More, one of the nation's first feminist bookstores, in
Little Five Points in 1974. ``Even being self-employed, there have
been times in my life when I would not allowed myself to be on the
front of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Living section. When my
son was in high school, I was very aware that he could be hurt by
my actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Brown, 62, is now a high-profile gay figure who has helped
raise $2 million for the city's AIDS service organizations. But he
was wary of Pride in the early years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a while to even go to Pride,'' he says. ``If you
were part of corporate America, you just didn't march down
Peachtree Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Murphy, an editor of the Pride Guide 2000 magazine to be
distributed in Piedmont Park this weekend, first marched in 1976 as
a Georgia Tech architecture student.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dangerous thing to do,'' Murphy, 45, says of walking
down the one-lane parade route on Peachtree Street. ``All these
things were running through my mind: What if one of my classmates
sees me? What if a carload of rednecks drives into us?
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time it was exhilarating. It was an incredible
feeling of not being alone anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally grew from 1970 to '71, when marchers obtained their
first permit to make the event an official parade. About 150
marchers received cheers from onlookers along the parade's
Peachtree Street route. Kendall Green, a member of the city's newly
formed Gay Liberation Front, told a United Press International
reporter that the march was evidence ``the gay people in Atlanta
are proud, they are good citizens and are not ashamed of their
homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Massell appointed Charles St. John, a youthful Atlanta
Journal copy runner _ now deceased, who is credited with obtaining
that first parade permit _ to the city's Community Relations
Commission. The appointment of an openly gay man to a city
commission was a first. Pride grew to a weeklong celebration and
was featured on the cover of the Great Speckled Bird, the city's
alternative newspaper. More than 300 people attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a melding of the civil rights, anti-Vietnam, feminist
and gay rights movements,'' says Dave Hayward, who was a
21-year-old aspiring actor and writer in 1972. ``The moment was
ours to seize, and we did it. We walked down the street chanting,
`What do we want? Gay rights! When do we want them? Now!' It was
all very militant.''
</P>
<P>
   According to accounts published in Atlanta Barb, the 1973 Pride
event attracted more than 200 marchers. Hand-painted signs read:
``Homosexuals Are Human'' and ``Better Blatant Than Latent.''
</P>
<P>
   A weeklong event in 1974 began with a press conference at the
2-year-old, gay-centric Metropolitan Community Church, which held
services in a movie theater in Virginia-Highland. A carnival,
beauty contests, worship services, film screenings, a parade,
picnic and multiple ``rap sessions'' followed.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of the nation's Bicentennial, the city's gay
rights movement was attracting young people from across the South.
Holloway, then an energetic 19-year-old from Daytona Beach, Fla.,
pitched in to help organize the event. ``It was empowering,
especially as a young black person,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the crowd of 3,000 along the Peachtree
Street parade route resulted in Channel 5 dispatching a cameraman.
Clifford Martin, a recent Florida State theater graduate, took a
break from performing Gladys Knight and Aretha Franklin songs in
his drag persona as Tina DeVore at the Onyx bar downtown to watch
the marchers go by.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were selling drink specials out on the sidewalk, but I
wasn't very political then. I was young, and it was before AIDS. I
was there for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Martin says he felt isolated from the rest of the parade
participants. ``In 1977, the drag community was not terribly
welcome to join Pride. The organizers wanted to sweep that element
under the carpet. They certainly didn't want us representing the
gay population in front of those TV cameras. It wasn't until the
1980s that we were invited to really be a part of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Pride organizers moved activities to the weekend of
June 10 and relocated marchers to the Georgia World Congress Center
downtown. Inside, anti-gay crusader Bryant was attending the
Southern Baptist Convention. Her appearance proved to be a turning
point for Gay Pride in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of several thousand gathered outside to chant ``Out of
the closet and into the streets'' and ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, Anita
Bryant's got to go.'' Many carried oranges, a reference to Bryant's
role as a pitchwoman for orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with a microphone, activist Maria Helena Dolan
addressed the protesters. ``It was important to speak out against
Bryant,'' says Dolan, now 46 and a MARTA quality assurance
engineer. ``Now she's a forgotten joke, but in 1978 ... we had to
let her know that she didn't have the power she thought she had.
She had to know that our unity for rights was stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the mainstream press thoroughly covered the
Pride rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday, I walked into my job as a diesel mechanic in a shop
with 70 men,'' Dolan says. ``About 30 of the guys came up, patted
me on the back and said, `We saw you on TV giving that lady hell!'
It was a shock to find that level of acceptance from a group of
ultra-macho straight guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anita Bryant actually helped our movement here grow,'' says
Gene Holloway, who also attended the Baptist Convention protest.
``What she was doing offended so many people that it brought new
folks out to Pride who had never marched before. It brought out
(ticked)-off straight people who said, `These people are our
friends, our neighbors, our children, our brothers, our sisters. We
won't allow you to treat them like this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And those people have been involved with Pride ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, ``Celebrate'' banners are hung on utility poles
across Midtown, and throngs are expected to attend what's more a
party than political statement. Still, some fear remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people, mainly schoolteachers, have e-mailed me on the
Pride Web site or have sent in checks supporting the event but
informing me that they can't attend. By being seen on TV or in the
newspapers, people can still lose their jobs,'' says Pride 2000
executive director Donna Narducci. ``Those paper bags might not
physically be there now, but there's still work to be done.''

 &HT;    B-52's can still add altitude to any party
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roam if you want to, but don't go too far or you'll miss a free
show by one of this state's most popular party bands ever, the
B-52's.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Wilson, Kate Pierson, Fred Schneider and Keith Strickland
are making their first appearance at the Atlanta Pride Festival for
its 30th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The B-52's' music has always displayed a definite gay
sensibility from the band's formation in Athens in the late 1970s.
The obvious points of reference are the campiness of Wilson and
Pierson's outrageous outfits and wigs and lyrical references to
dyed poodles named ``Quiche Lorraine,'' but they've also been a
magnet for the young outsiders of the past 20 years. in 1980, a
Rhode Island teenager named Aaron Fricke won a battle to take a
male date to his high school prom. When he later told the story in
a book, it was titled ``Reflections of a Rock Lobster'' in homage
to the first B-52's single ``Rock Lobster,'' which he and his date
danced to at that difficult prom.
</P>
<P>
   The band also has a sadder connection to the gay community. In
1985, original guitarist Ricky Wilson died of AIDS complications.
He was one of the most prominent early casualties of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The B-52's have always been regarded as being out of the
mainstream,'' says his sister, vocalist Cindy Wilson, ``and we
embrace Pride's mission to show that every member of the community
contributes to the good of the whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't be too proud to dance, because the B-52's are still
one of the best party starters there is.

 &HT;    It's Showtime for minorities in new dramas
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diversity, thy name is premium cable.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after prolonged finger-wagging by civil rights groups
and predictable hand-wringing by the major television networks, a
deal was struck to put more minorities on both sides of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   But while NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox are still figuring out how to
best fulfill that promise, cable's Showtime network is unveiling a
pair of weekly dramas that are deliciously and daringly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soul Food'' is based on the 1997 box office hit of the same
name, and ``Resurrection Blvd.'' revolves around a
multigenerational Mexican family in East Los Angeles. In their own
ways, both hourlong shows prove it's possible to produce top-notch
television with minority casts and grown-up themes.
</P>
<P>
   Like the movie, ``Soul Food'' the TV series is produced by
LaFace music mogul and one-time Atlantan Kenneth ``Babyface''
Edmonds along with his wife, Tracey. The original actors, including
Vivica A. Fox, Nia Long and Michael Beach, have been replaced by a
cast of lesser-known but equally talented performers.
</P>
<P>
   The story follows the domestic exploits of three
African-American sisters in Chicago after the death of the family
matriarch who kept her troubled clan together with homespun wisdom
and mouth-watering Sunday dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the movie may be disappointed to find the show has
stronger language and sexual content. The early episodes give
plenty of screen time to the lead actors' chiseled physiques, which
appear to have been nourished by Lean Cuisine rather than Mama's
high-calorie cooking.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot, baby sister Bird (Malinda Williams) is in the
final month of her pregnancy while enjoying a rare romantic
interlude with her hubby, Lem (Darrin Dewitt Henson), an ex-con
struggling to straighten out his life. It's a warm and fuzzy moment
until Lem makes a request that ruins the mood for Bird, and which
may put a damper on viewers expecting more family friendly fare.
</P>
<P>
   During the second episode, middle sister Maxine (Vanessa
Williams, no relation to the movie star in the film) has a
memorable scene with her precocious 14-year-old son, Ahmad (Aaron
Meeks), who also is the show's narrator. After being accepted into
a snobby prep school, Ahmad is mortified when his mom insists on
chaperoning his class on a school trip and then winds up
breast-feeding his baby sister on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   When it clicks, ``Soul Food'' is a feast of strong drama and
incisive, knowing humor. When it doesn't, it plays like a sudsy
nighttime soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soul Food'' screenwriter and co-producer Felicia D. Henderson
says the show isn't about being raunchy or risque for shock value.
It's about keeping it real, even if it that means having uptight
elder sister Teri (Nicole Ari Parker) falling in love with hunky
delivery man.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, a University of Georgia business school grad, says
many of the stories were inspired by the experiences of her
thirtysomething friends juggling careers, relationships and
children. She says that perspective often is missing from
mainstream TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the language and the nudity that we're trying to
convey,'' says Henderson, an African-American. ``My goal is to open
up every episode with some real slices of life ... things anybody
can identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Dennis E. Leoni captures that same appeal with a
distinctly Latino flavor in ``Resurrection Blvd.'' Tony Plana
(``JFK'') is Roberto Santiago, a bull-headed widower who presides
over an extended family battling for survival inside and outside
the boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   Plana and his co-stars are first-rate. The cast includes Michael
DeLorenzo (''New York Undercover'') as eldest son Carlos; Elizabeth
Pena as lovingly meddlesome Aunt Bibi; Cheech Marin of Cheech
andChong fame as Roberto's boss; and comedian Paul Rodriguez as a
boxing promoter and friend.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show telegraphs some of its punches, that doesn't
dull their impact. After winning a match that guarantees him a
title bout, Carlos has a run-in with vengeful gang-bangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection'' also handles class and color consciousness with
a deft touch: The pilot has sister Yolando Santiago (Ruth Livier)
on the verge of a fling with a WASP-y associate at her law firm.
Sister Victoria (Marisol Nichols) is the typical smart kid hanging
out with a dumb crowd because she doesn't want to be seen as a nerd
or, even worse, a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Leoni says he has been trying to bring a story about a Latino
family to TV for a decade. He had no luck with ``La Reforma,'' an
earlier, autobiographical effort first pitched to the broadcast
networks and, he says, dismissed as being ``too narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Showtime programmers also didn't bite at first but later gave
Leoni a full 22-episode deal after he retooled ``La Reforma'' with
the boxing angle to give it a grittier feel.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime ``wanted to do this kind of programming and so did I.
There's this homogenous demographic that regular TV lives in and
that advertisers want, and I wanted to created a more diverse show
where everybody is represented,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Leoni is at least half-right: HBO also has a reputation for
taking creative risks on programs.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Asians and Native Americans are mostly MIA from TV
starring roles, even on cable. And while the casts of
``Resurrection'' and ``Soul Food'' are integrated, whites often are
reduced to caricatures. Leoni and Henderson will have to do a
better job of dramatically rendering other racial and ethnic groups
in order to build crossover appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For now, executives with the NAACP and other groups involved in
the campaign to increase minority representation on TV say they're
monitoring ``Resurrection'' and ``Soul Food'' as well as shows
premiering this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``These shows are a good start, but unfortunately, they are
still unique events,'' says Lisa Navarrette, a spokeswoman for the
Latino advocacy group La Raza. ``Our hope is that these shows will
be so successful that advertisers can no longer ignore them. I
think that's what will eventually raise the bar for the broadcast
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection Blvd.'' debuts 10 p.m. Monday on Showtime

   Grade: B

   &QR;  Senior PGA Golf (4 p.m. on ESPN) _ The only golf tournament
Tiger Woods can't win.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Walt Disney World Summer Jams Concert'' (8 p.m. on ABC) _
Christina Aguilera sings ``Genie in a Bottle'' and ``What a Girl

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Biography: William S. Paley'' (8 p.m. on A&AMP;E) _ William S.
Paley would have loved the show ``Survivor.'' The founder of CBS
cultivated the image of a high-brow patron of the arts and
supporter of serious news. But at crunch time, he loved ratings and
profits, the bigger the better. This new ``Biography'' shows us the
man who gave us the careers of Ed Sullivan, Edward R. Murrow and
Lucille Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Nick at Nite 15th Anniversary'' (9 p.m. on Nickelodeon) _
Nick at Nite made reruns cool. Before Nickelodeon started packaging
oldies and marketing them in clever ways, reruns were the gum on
the sneaker of television.
</P>
<P>
   But in no small part because of Nick's giving them a hip spin,
we have national ``Brady Bunch'' mania and new generations that
appreciate ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ``The Dick Van Dyke
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate, Nick spends five hours talking to some of TV's
great sitcom creators, who then shut up and show their favorite
episodes. Among them: Norman Lear (``All in the Family''), Carl
Reiner (``Van Dyke''), James L. Brooks (``Moore''), Garry Marshall
(``Laverne &AMP; Shirley'') and, of course, Sherwood Schwartz, the man
who gave us ``The Brady Bunch'' and ``Gilligan's Island.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sex and the City'' (9 p.m. on HBO) _ You ought to know that,
yes, that is singer Alanis Morissette guest-starring as a bisexual.
She has a moment at a wild party with Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker)
in a gender-bending episode of the hormone-addled comedy.

<P>
   &QR;  ``Iron Chef in New York'' (9 p.m. Sunday on Food Network)
</P>
<P>
   The cult of ``Iron Chef'' has been growing like Thai grocers on
Buford Highway as word-of-mouth has spread about this wacky little
import. A Japanese cooking competition in which two chefs square
off in an arena-like kitchen, it's hilarious camp because of its
frenzied, life-or-death commentary and breathless play-by-play
announcing.
</P>
<P>
   This special brings the Iron Chefs to New York for the first
time, where one, Morimoto, crosses carving knives with Bobby Flay,
a New York chef who happens to have his own Food Network show. As
always, the chefs are told at the very last second what ``secret
ingredient'' must be included in all their dishes (usually it's
something unexpected like yogurt).
</P>
<P>
   As the announcer, dubbed into English, goes berserk over this
``rivalry of galactic proportions,'' the chefs prepare gourmet
feasts, all done in real time, one hour.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this special is two hours long. The 9-10 p.m.
block is a lot of silly hype and preparation, including a lengthy
plug for another Food Network show, ``Door Knock Dinners.''
``Chef''-heads should skip that and tune it at 10, when the
cleavers start flying.

   If you channel-surf your way through a weekend of films noir
full of femmes fatale, by the end you'll be on your hands and knees
barking at the set: ``For God's sake, man, don't trust her!''
Here's three to get you barking:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Palmetto'' (7 tonight on the Movie Channel) _ In this
pretty-OK 1998 flick, Woody Harrelson is the dupe who gets involved
in a faked kidnapping. Elisabeth Shue plays the rich witch who
shows Woody a thing or two.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Chinatown'' (4 p.m. Saturday on WATL) _ In Hollywood, the
script-writing classes still teach Robert Towne's 1974 screenplay
as an example of near-perfection. Faye Dunaway is more
dysfunctional than fatale, but as always in noir, it doesn't end
well for the guy, nosy Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Double Indemnity'' (8 p.m. Saturday on Oxygen) _ One of the
templates of the noir genre has Barbara Stanwyck putting Fred
MacMurray through hoops in a classic based on James M. Cain's
novel.

AIDS EPIDEMIC SHIFTS TO RURAL AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The global AIDS epidemic, long thought of as an urban
phenomenon, is shifting strongly to rural areas in the third world,
a report from UNAIDS and the Food and Agricultural Organization
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That shift has dire implications for people with the disease and
the countries that are involved. Although city dwellers can
sometimes find social services to help them or can beg on the
streets, a poor farm family often collapses when one adult is
deathly ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``HIV hits particularly young adults, and they are the core of
the labor force, the keystone of the farm household,'' said Jacques
du Guerny, an AIDS expert at the Food and Agricultural
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   When one family member cannot plow, weed or go to market and
others have to cut their workloads to care for that person or have
to sell the family ox or plow to buy medicine or pay for funerals,
the farm may collapse. That in turn cuts food supply to city
residents. Even if the family carries on, it may plant less acreage
or plant less labor-intensive and less nutritious crops, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Urban factories can usually replace unskilled workers, the
international experts said, but farm families cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is particularly bad in Africa, where many
countries have infection rates from 10 to 25 percent of adults; in
India, with a low infection rate but more than 4 million cases; and
in several Caribbean countries, including Haiti. Africa accounts
for 83 percent of AIDS death, according to UNAIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The disease spreads in rural areas in many ways. Particularly in
southern Africa, rural people migrate to the cities or mines to
look for work, become infected and return home once or twice a
year. The disease also spreads along truck routes, where
prostitution thrives, especially near borders where truckers can
wait for days.
</P>
<P>
   Rural poverty also creates vulnerability. In one example, du
Guerny said, Cambodia farmers often go bankrupt in bad years and
accept money from lenders who charge high interest rates. If the
borrowers fall behind, du Guerny said, ``traffickers come and say,
`Sell us your daughter, and we will help you repay the loan.' This
creates tremendous vulnerability and risk of infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Preventive measures like sex education and condom distribution
focus on cities and hardly exist in the countryside. Traditional
customs that can spread the disease like the central African
practice of ``cleansing'' a widow through sex with a relative of
the dead husband are stronger in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released in Rome, the headquarters of the FAO. It
had no worldwide estimate of urban-rural prevalence, and it noted
that rural HIV rates ``are harder to measure and more prone to
underreporting and misdiagnosis.'' Instead, the study reached its
conclusion by compiling case studies.
</P>
<P>
   In one Indian state, Tamil Nadu, the rate is growing faster in
the countryside than in cities. In rural Buhera, Zimbabwe, the rate
among pregnant women who visit prenatal clinics is 50.8 percent,
well above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The chief epidemiologist for UNAIDS, Bernhard Schwartlander,
said that there were no worldwide figures for the urban-rural shift
but that one rule was that the disease spread faster from cities to
countryside wherever roads and bridges were well developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Botswana, a small country with very good infrastructure and
a lot of people living near the roads,'' Schwartlander said,
``there's no difference in infection rates between urban and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in Tanzania, where it's a day's walk to get to a trading
area to sell your stuff, people only do that once or twice a
month,'' he said. ``So there's less chance to meet sex workers or
have casual sex. So the infection rate is higher in cities. But
since in poor countries more people live in the country, the total
number of infected people in the country could exceed that in the
cities.''

clearly than their very different approaches to inducing Americans
to save more money for retirement. Vice President Gore proposes
that the government provide a subsidy of as much as $3 for every $1
that you kick in to your retirement kitty, a new entitlement
program designed to favor the relative have-nots. George W. Bush
will probably endorse a plan under which the kitty will be fattened
with taxes that currently helps finance Social Security. What is
remarkable, however, is what the two sides now have in common: a

&HT;     EDUCATION STAYS IN THE CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush is about to do a very
good thing _ for education, for the country and for his own
political prospects.
</P>
<P>
   He is getting rid of a piece of right-wing ideological deadwood
that never made sense in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Republican National Convention will dump the party's
20-year-old plank demanding that the Department of Education be
abolished, which sought to formally downgrade the teaching of our
children to a status lower than, say, farming or promoting
veterans' interests.
</P>
<P>
   A Cabinet seat often carries more psychological than practical
impact. But its visibility and proximity to the presidential ear
announce to voters that the issue it represents has the highest
national priority.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolism matters.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, who says he wants to be ``the education president,''
is sending a signal that he intends to end the strait-jacket
against federal assistance to teach the young that Ronald Reagan
and the religious right embedded in the Republican platform in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he would put government money behind the new
philosophy. It can be argued that platforms don't matter. But if
Bush is elected, his secretary of education will be the first such
Republican who doesn't feel obliged to argue before Congress for
the abolition of his or her own department.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently proposed ambitious new federal spending to improve
math and science education in public classrooms. His $2.3 billion
plan does not spend as much to improve public schools as would the
programs of his rival, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a remarkable shift from the next presidential nominee
of a party that has been belittling the public schools since
Reagan's election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not given up promoting private schools. He still wants
to hand out taxpayer-funded vouchers to subsidize students who flee
from public schools, a favorite GOP theme. But Bush genuinely seems
less dogmatic about tilting educational advantages to private
schooling and away from the public schools than his Republican
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the war against the Department of Education has run its
course. The public has won and the Republicans have lost.
</P>
<P>
   When Reagan came to power, he targeted the department because it
was created by his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, and shaped by the
National Education Association (NEA), which backed Carter and
correctly viewed Reagan as anti-union. Reagan also listened to
complaints of the Christian right, which charged that public
education was immoral because it promoted what the professionally
pious called godless ``secular humanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get Congress to kill the department outright, Reagan
strangled it financially. From 1980 until 1992, its budget remained
static at $14 billion despite inflation, deterioration of school
buildings, security and equipment and steady increases in student
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton has consistently pushed for a greater
investment. The current department budget is nearly $39 billion,
still relatively small as Cabinet offices go. This year Clinton
wants a jump to more than $43 billion, which would be more than
three-fold boost from the 1992 figure.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Americans have consistently told pollsters they
want a greater federal investment in the schools, not less. They
don't buy the conservative complaint that federal money means
parents, teachers and communities will be pushed around for no
good.
</P>
<P>
   Female voters in particular have contributed to Clinton's
victories, listing education as one of their top issues.
</P>
<P>
   For years, congressional Republicans ignored this reality and
repeatedly pressed ahead with hearings to kill the Education
Department as a sign of their determination to downsize government.
</P>
<P>
   The negative response finally sank in when GOP focus groups gave
their presidential nominee, Bob Dole, an immediate thumbs down in
1996 after he vowed to kill the department during a debate with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After Dole's decisive defeat at the polls, congressional
Republicans shifted their attack from the department itself to the
NEA, which was politically satisfying to the partisan right wing
but still left the party looking anti-education. Being against
teachers is rather like being against firefighters, nurses and
other good guys that society looks to for help. Not a popular
position.
</P>
<P>
   When Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, the Republican platform
chairman, announced that at Bush's behest the Education Department
would no longer be a target, it caused little stir. The party
reaction was mostly one of relief. Some reality had set in at last.
</P>
<P>
   Education issues are more complex than the existence of a
Cabinet seat, and Bush has made his peace with the religious right
by capitulating on another controversial issue, abortion. But this
is progress nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbing the presidential nose at the importance of education
was always the wrong way to go. The symbolism was dreadful. Common
sense has prevailed. And now we can go on to the real struggles
over what works and doesn't work in public education and who should
do what about it.

SUZZY ROCHE: `SONGS FROM AN UNMARRIED HOUSEWIFE AND MOTHER '
</HEADLINE>
   By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Suzzy Roche still wears leg warmers _ colorful
striped ones on the cover of her second album away from the Roches,
the trio of singing sisters who have helped define modern-day
female bohemianism for 20 years. The Roche sisters, like those leg
warmers, are loudly and wittily themselves, unworried about the
fashion value of their eccentricities. Suzzy, the youngest, fully
finds her subject matter on this carefully produced selection of
folksy songs.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about lumpy love: prickly middle-aged couples and
never-quite-lovers, babies on roller coasters and too-young
expectant moms on commuter trains. Roche's clean, conversational
voice sounds just like a friend's on the phone, telling idle
stories that turn out to be unforgettable. With her sister Maggie
and daughter Lucy on harmonies, and help from her friends Loudon
Wainwright III, Jules Shear, David Mansfield and Curtis Stigers,
Roche is still a sister anyone would want but one with a stance all
her own.
</P>
<P>
   Suzzy Roche and friends play the Bottom Line in Greenwich
Village, (212) 228-7880.

&HT;     HOUSE NEGOTIATORS WOULD CUT SAN FRANCISCO AIDS MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Key House negotiators have cut San Francisco's
share of federal AIDS funding by millions of dollars over five
years while increasing money for 50 other cities hard hit by the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said Thursday that San Francisco's
share of federal Ryan White program money would be slowly reduced
until the city receives the same level of funding as other cities
with high rates of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the best funding of any place in the country and
they can't document that they have a greater need,'' said Coburn,
who negotiated the deal with Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., also a
member of the House Commerce Committee panel that oversees the Ryan
White Care Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryan White Care program authorizes the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services to pay for care and medication for people
with HIV and AIDS who aren't poor or sick enough to receive
Medicaid, but who don't have private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a longtime advocate for people with
AIDS, vowed to fight the House deal and warned that it could cut
millions of dollars from the city's $35 million annual funding from
the Ryan White program. She said she didn't know the exact size of
the cut and Coburn declined to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't live with that,'' Pelosi said. ``This is unfair to
us. The fact is, we can never agree to a funding level that stands
in the way of meeting the needs of people with HIV/AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said she supports a Senate-passed version of the Ryan
White care program that would freeze San Francisco's share of the
money at no less than 98 percent of the current $35.3 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Once the House passes its version of the Ryan White program, the
different House and Senate bills will go to a joint House-Senate
conference committee where negotiators will try to iron out
differences.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ryan White program began in 1991, San Francisco's share
of the money was relatively large because the epidemic was rooted
there before it spread to other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the funding formula was based on two factors: the
density of AIDS cases in a city (the ratio of people with AIDS
relative to the city's total population) and a city's cumulative
number of AIDS cases, living and dead.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress changed the funding formula so it was based on
the estimated number of people alive with AIDS in a city. That
change would have slashed San Francisco's funding because so many
AIDS patients there had died of the disease, but Congress decided
to limit any cuts to the city's funding so as not to disrupt
existing AIDS programs.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi noted that the designers of the original Ryan White
program had assumed that people would die earlier of AIDS. But then
scientific researchers developed protease inhibitors that
dramatically prolong the life of people with HIV, the virus that
leads to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a growing population of HIV patients and a
shrinking number of AIDS sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's need for federal aid ``is greater because people
are living longer,'' Pelosi said. ``We cannot be penalized for
intervening earlier and prolonging life.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said in an interview that HIV patients in other parts of
the country, especially women and minorities, must wait for someone
else in their area to die of AIDS before they can get federal
funding to pay for medications that can slow the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, executives at San Francisco AIDS
organizations are being overpaid. He cited one executive who he
said is paid $200,000 year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard position for San Francisco to defend,'' Coburn
said, adding that 16 states ran out of Ryan White money last year.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn added that his intention was not to punish San Francisco,
``although that's the perception. The perception is that they are
being picked on We're trying to do the right thing for San
Francisco as we try to do the right thing for everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said Los Angeles city officials have been leading the
charge in trying to cut San Francisco's share of the money, a
development she said was ``unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ryan White program is named after the hemophiliac teenager
from Kokomo, Ind., who contracted the disease through tainted blood
and died in 1990 at age 19. The program serves about a half-million
people each year and, since 1991, has distributed $6.4 billion to
states and local governments for local use.  &UR;  &LR;  &QL;

   TEXAS-EXECUTE (Huntsville, Texas) _ The Texas parole board
refused to block the execution Thursday evening of Gary Graham in
the latest death penalty case to put Gov. George W. Bush under
pressure as he runs for president. Graham's lawyers filed
last-minute appeals with the Supreme Court and the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals, but the state court turned him down. Both had
previously rejected his arguments that he was convicted on shaky
evidence from a single eyewitness and that his trial lawyer did a
poor job. Bush's office said the governor would not comment until
the courts had ruled. (Summary from wires) By Jim Yardley and Frank

   NY-DRUGS-COURTS (New York) _ New York will become the first
state to mandate that nonviolent criminals be offered the option of
drug treatment instead of jail time, New York chief judge Judith
Kaye announced Thursday, putting in place statewide a system that
has been tried in some parts of the state. Many states offer some
kind of drug treatment program as an option to jail time now, but
New York will be the first to do so statewide. Kaye said the new
program could divert as many as 10,000 inmates a year to drug
programs, reducing the state's inmate population by as much as 10
percent and saving $500 million a year in prison costs. By

   NADER-LABOR (Washington) _ Months after they dismissed Ralph
Nader as a fringe third-party candidate who would fade quickly,
Democratic and Republican strategists now say that the consumer
advocate has emerged as more politically potent than Patrick
Buchanan and could deeply complicate the candidacy of Vice
President Al Gore. Nader, who is expected to capture the Green
Party's nomination in Denver this weekend, is in single digits in
most polls. No one thinks he has a chance of rising to the
electoral heights of Ross Perot in 1992. Even so, Nader already is
forcing Gore to fight harder for the enthusiastic support of labor
and other groups that are reliably Democratic. Nader's potential
for mischief was on display here Thursday, when James P. Hoffa, the
Teamsters president, appeared beside him at a news conference and
ridiculed the vice president. By Richard R. Berke.

AT THE MET, NATURE ON A CHINESE TABLETOP

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The oddly shaped tabletop objects known as Chinese
scholars' rocks rate barely a mention in most art history books,
and then only as decorative accessories. But when the Asia Society
presented an exhibition of them four years ago they caused a minor
sensation and quickly became the pet rocks of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The show, drawn from the collection of Richard Rosenblum, who
died last February, was pretty strange. It displayed dozens of
rocks in a neutral setting like Western-style sculptures but it
also ganged them together, large and small, like sale items in a
boutique. The effect was freakish and theatrical, perhaps
calculatedly so: it certainly gave a viewer unfamiliar with the big
picture of Chinese art a dramatic point of entry.
</P>
<P>
   A very different show, ``The World of Scholars' Rocks: Gardens,
Studios and Paintings,'' now at the Metropolitan Museum, is also
built around Rosenblum stones, several of which are promised gifts
to the museum. But as the title suggests, it places them within the
larger Chinese cultural context, to which they belong, and offers a
lot more art to look at.
</P>
<P>
   The installation, organized by Maxwell K. Hearn, a curator in
the Asian Art department, follows chronological lines, beginning
with the Northern Song dynasty (A.D. 960-1127). Although stones of
various kinds had been revered in China from an early date, it was
during the Song that scholars' rocks were widely collected.
</P>
<P>
   The Song was the classical age of mountain-and-water landscape
painting, in which a Daoist concept of nature as an organic play of
interactive forces took definitive visual form. And rocks,
harvested from river beds and caves, shaped by tides and rain,
embodied this dynamic in miniature.
</P>
<P>
   The rocks were first domesticated for use in gardens, their
natural contours manually altered and exaggerated to imitate the
mountains that appeared in paintings. Eventually, smaller rocks,
set in basins or on trays and wooden stands, were adopted as indoor
objects, to be placed on desks or shelves for contemplation, like
little nuggets of the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Few ornamental stones can be securely dated to an early period.
(Many incised inscriptions were rubbed out during the Cultural
Revolution to prevent rocks from being destroyed as elitist
artifacts.) But the styles favored during the Northern Song dynasty
_ monumental shapes, ink-black color _ set a standard for what
followed.
</P>
<P>
   So it makes sense for the Met, near the front of the exhibition,
to mix early paintings with rocks of a later date. The handscroll
titled ``Summer Mountains'' and attributed to the 11th-century
artist Qu Ding, for example, appears beside a stone from the Qing
dynasty (1644-1911), which neatly echoes its gnarly toothlike
peaks.
</P>
<P>
   (The limestone Qing piece, incidentally, has been carefully
hollowed out to function as an incense burner. Smoke emerging
through perforations in its surface would have provided an illusion
of rising and dissipating mist similar to that seen in painted
images.)
</P>
<P>
   In some paintings, ornamental rocks themselves are depicted. In
``Palace Banquet,'' thought to date from the 10th or 11th century,
the entrance to a royal harem is flanked by dark stones that rear
like guardian lions. And in Li Gonglin's renowned 11th-century
illustrations for the ``Classic of Filial Piety,'' rocks and people
seem to interact choreographically, as if to confirm a
correspondence between nature and culture.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Color takes a central role in a section devoted to the Southern
Song dynasty (1127-1279), where the succulent blue-green tints of a
landscape scroll are picked up in a magnificent Qing-period stone.
Titled ``Soaring Jade Peak,'' it looks like a cresting wave of
gray-green ocean water.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of the highly stylized literati art in the Yuan
dynasty (1279-1368), based on calligraphic rather than naturalistic
principles, paintings and stones assumed a new relationship.
Sometimes the connection was stylistic: a slinky tree trunk in an
ink-and-brush hanging scroll by Wu Boli and a hip-slung stone on
view nearby are equally Bob Fosse-eque in posture.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere the link was more abstract and metaphorical. In his
seminal painting ``Twin Pines, Level Distance,'' the calligrapher
Zhao Mengfu transformed a landscape into a measured dance of solids
and voids, rhythmic stops and starts, a new, conceptual,
contradictory version of nature. A rock on display in the same
gallery, riddled with perforations, looking as weighty as a cliff
and as light as a sponge, might be read the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The Ming period (1368-1644), the heyday of rock mania, was an
avariciously consumerist age like our own. People were just mad for
things: great things, pretty things, silly things, exotic things.
Scholars' rocks qualified for all four categories, and appeared in
every style and shape in paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Some were actually celebrated as personalities and sat for their
portraits, as in the case of a pink-washed painting by Lan Ying
titled ``Red Friend.'' And sometimes attention paid to them took
bizarrely intense forms. In a handscroll titled ``10 Views of a
Fantastic Rock,'' by Wu Bin, the artist scrutinizes a single stone
voyeuristically from every possible angle, pushing connoisseurship
into the realm of erotic fetishism.
</P>
<P>
   The succeeding Qing dynasty was forever looking over its
shoulder to the past. It valued both rocks and an ancient mountain
myth attached to them, including the idea that certain mountain
caves were wellsprings of rejuvenating energy and even entrances to
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   A vivid handscroll titled ``Outing to Zhang Gong's Grotto,'' by
the painter Shitao, done around 1700, depicts one such cave, which,
with its fabulous stalactites and rainbow colors, might have come
straight from William Blake's visionary illustrations for Dante. It
is no wonder that even the humblest desktop rock provided rich
terrain for imaginative journeying.
</P>
<P>
   Travel takes a more prosaic form in an outsized 18th-century
Qing handscroll documenting the progress of an imperial inspection
tour of southern cities. Its minutely detailed aerial view of the
city of Suzhou shows, tucked among the shops and palaces,
pocket-parks filled with ornamental stones of exactly the kind seen
in the Met's permanent Ming-style Astor Court garden, around which
the Chinese galleries wrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World of Scholars' Rocks'' concludes, logically enough, in
the late 20th century with a handsome 1964 hanging scroll titled
``Pine Cliff and Foggy Waterfall,'' by Liu Haisu (1896-1994). But
the story could be extended to an even more contemporary work.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, the Chinese-born artist Cai Guo-Qiang,
whose work appeared with great success in this year's Whitney
Biennial, created an installation at the Queens Museum of Art
titled ``Cultural Melting Bath.'' It included a set of traditional
garden rocks imported from China surrounding a Western-style hot
tub whose waters has been treated with medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Was the piece a gentle burlesque of the West's blinkered view of
Asian traditions, which become comprehensible only when turned into
cartoons? Or was it an acknowledgment that there is no ``right''
way of approaching culture in a melting-pot world, leaving all
kinds of treasures ripe for discovery? The recent enthusiasm for
scholars' rocks in the West _ at a time when they appear to
generate little interest in China itself _ poses similar questions.
And the Met show provides a solid basis for arguing the case both
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World of Scholars' Rocks: Gardens, Studios and Paintings''
remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Ave., at 82nd
Street, (212) 835-7710, through Aug. 20.

PRAIRIE VIEW: LAW AND MEDICINE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to be an alumnus or alumna of Prairie View A&AMP;M
University or the child, parent, relative or good friend of one to
say an ``amen'' to a recommendation offered by Glenn Johnson, a
graduate from Texas' second-oldest public institution of higher
learning.
</P>
<P>
   In recent testimony before the Texas Higher Education
Coordinating Board's Task Force on Office of Civil Rights Issues,
Johnson _ no relation _ called for adding both a medical school and
a law school at Prairie View.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Houston-area real estate investor's recommendation
didn't get any play in the media, it is being passed along to make
certain that enough people hear about it to prevent its being
discarded without consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson insists that Prairie View has served the
African-American community ``with dignity and vision since 1876''
and that it has earned the opportunity to provide education in the
disciplines of medicine and law.
</P>
<P>
   He offers that suggestion as a way to help Texas satisfy the
U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights that this
state has eliminated the remaining vestiges of segregation in its
higher education system.
</P>
<P>
   One of the task force's primary duties is to explore ways to
achieve that objective. The medical and law school proposal for
Prairie View was not included in the ``Access and Equity 2000''
initiative, the third state plan for addressing Office of Civil
Rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will become part of the next initiative. There will
have to be one, because the Hopwood ruling eliminating the use of
racial criteria for admissions to state colleges and universities
dealt a serious setback to efforts to increase minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1998 status report on higher education in Texas, the
coordinating board said that the Hopwood ruling fosters a
perception that blacks and Hispanics ``are no longer welcome at
Texas higher education institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   That status report said that Hopwood struck hardest at the
state's most selective undergraduate institutions and added: ``Also
hard hit have been the state's graduate, medical and law schools.''
</P>
<P>
   That development helps make the case for Johnson's
recommendation. However, his primary justification for a medical
school at Prairie View is that it would serve a crying need for
community-oriented health-care services by increasing the pool of
minority physicians; providing hospital services in a an area of
sore need; and conducting research into health problems that beset
African-Americans at a higher rate than other segments of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   In his effort to justify the need for a law school at Prairie
View, Johnson recited a telling list of statistics relating to
juvenile incarceration. His main point was that minority youths are
being sent to correctional institutions at rates that are highly
disproportionate to their percentage of the population and to the
total numbers of youths arrested, primarily because of inadequate
legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson's case for a Prairie View law school is less
compelling than the one he makes for a medical school, he has a
good argument. If the Hopwood ruling continues to decrease the
number of African-American applicants to other law schools in the
state, a Prairie View law school could fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   One can justify Prairie View's offering both disciplines. But,
if a choice had to be made, the medical school would be the more
pressing need.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson's proposal is to stand any chance of becoming a part
of Texas' effort to remove the last vestiges of segregation from
the state's higher education system, the coordinating board must
hear from more people than him.
</P>
<P>
   One does not have to be a Prairie View alumna or alumnus to call
the coordinating board at (512) 483-6101 and express one's
sentiments on the subject. It is not a mission impossible. Florida
is evidence of that. On May 1, that state's legislature funded a
law school and a medical school at Florida A&AMP;M University.

</HEADLINE>
 ANGELES-4TAKES(TRIMS)-NYT  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (Editors: the 4th take is 1250 words on hotels, restaurants and
attractions.) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ My earliest memories of Los Angeles are the
wisecracks of the old radio comedians. Fred Allen, as I recall,
described this as ``a nice place to live, if you happen to be an
orange,'' and Oscar Levant said that when you stripped away the
tinsel here, you uncovered more tinsel.
</P>
<P>
   I formed an indelible picture of L.A. noir from Bogart and
Bacall in ``The Big Sleep,'' Howard Hawks' sardonic, hard-boiled
tale of spoiled rich girls, con men, gunmen and other rogues, which
William Faulkner and others adapted from Raymond Chandler's novel.
Later, on television, I watched Jack Webb, as the laconic Sgt. Joe
Friday in ``Dragnet,'' probe the city's underbelly.
</P>
<P>
   More than anywhere else in America, Los Angeles has been defined
by popular culture _ that is, by the entertainment industry, which
is based, after all, in Hollywood. Most of us, even people who live
here, carry show-business images of Southern California around in
our heads. But they are mere fragments of reality, snippets of
grainy black-and-white or gaudy Technicolor, and splicing them
together into an accurate picture is a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   One might begin with the idea of the place. For several
generations of Americans it has been a 20th-century Eden, a garden
at continent's edge where almost anything seemed possible. Today
much of it is a paradise defiled, spoiled by sprawl, smog and
selfishness. Fires and mudslides, repeated riots and the Northridge
earthquake have scarred landscapes and psyches.
</P>
<P>
   Splendors remain _ and not just the chicks on Melrose Avenue and
the biceps boys on the beach at Venice. Contemplate the Santa
Monica mountains at dusk, wade into the surf at Malibu, glide
through the tunnel of lavender-blue jacaranda blossoms on Palm
Drive in Beverly Hills in May and June or walk along the placid
residential streets of Pasadena, past glorious Arts and Crafts
houses by the brothers Charles and Henry Greene, set on broad lawns
maintained only by heroic irrigation and the sweat of gardeners,
and you will understand the lasting allure of this vast, inchoate
metropolis by the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   There are days when hibiscus, jasmine and oleander scent the
air, and you imagine yourself in Grasse. There are days when the
air is so acrid with exhaust fumes that your eyes sting.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has always traded in glamour and illusion, ephemeral
merchandise that is here today and gone tomorrow, like movie sets
and the sex appeal of leading ladies. ``The back lot was 30 acres
of fairyland,'' wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald in ``The Last Tycoon,''
``not because the locations really looked like African jungles and
French chateaux and schooners at anchor and Broadway at night, but
because they looked like the torn picture books of childhood, like
fragments of stories dancing in an open fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a fairyland, the home of hype and hyperbole, and it
was also the home of two of the important presidents of the latter
half of the last century, Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Their
libraries are nearby, Nixon's in Yorba Linda, where he was born,
Reagan's in Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Colonized in 1781, as El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora la Reina de
los Angeles de Porciuncula, Los Angeles had but 102,479 people in
1900. A half-century later, it had 1,970,358 and by 1996 the city
and the satellites that surround it, spilling over mountains and
stretching out into the desert, were approaching 16 million. By
2025, demographic experts say, the region will grow by another 6
million people, roughly twice the present population of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Los Angeles already covers 34,000 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Explosive growth is creating a radically different society.
While the area's black and non-Hispanic white populations remain
relatively stable, its Asian and Hispanic populations are
skyrocketing. Drive down the streets in and around the center of
the city _ yes, skeptics, there is one _ and you see signs written
in a Babel of languages and alphabets: Korean and Hindi, Lao and
Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese, Russian and Spanish and Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Unified School District is the nation's second
biggest, after New York's, with 713,000 pupils; for 70 percent,
English is a second or third language, if spoken at all. In the
lifetime of most of those students, whites will be a minority in
the city and in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Mayor Richard J. Riordan has made education
his top priority. He succeeded last year in gaining control of the
school board, but pushing through reforms has proved harder than
building the new Staples Arena or landing the Democratic National
Convention, which will take place there in August. The dropout rate
in the district is twice the statewide average.
</P>
<P>
   As did immigrants in New York in the 20th century, newcomers
give Los Angeles much of its kinetic energy. But they present
tremendous challenges. For the foreseeable future, the region will
need to build 25,000 new housing units a year, and partly because
of the city's seemingly unstoppable expansion, the state needs
300,000 new teachers almost at once.
</P>
<P>
   Castles, Real and in the Air
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are more insecure than most,'' said Allison
Silver, the New Jersey-born opinion editor of The Los Angeles
Times. ``They come here in search of new identities, and they sense
that this place out at the end of the line is the last chance that
they will ever get to reinvent themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That has its good side and its bad side. When Tom Bradley was
mayor, he said Southern California provided people with ``a place
where they can be free, where they can do things they can't do
anywhere else.'' Such as wearing purple hair or founding sects,
both religious (like Aimee Semple McPherson's) and political (like
the John Birch Society). They cut themselves loose from the
restraints of tradition, obligation, even family.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone makes it, and not very many who make it keep it.
For every fabulous fortune, there are graveyards full of shattered
dreams. So people don't hold back. If you have a body, you flaunt
it; if you have money, you spend it. Buy a Bentley (and take it to
the Bel Air or the Peninsula for lunch so people can see it) and
build a narcissist's castle.
</P>
<P>
   Angelenos create and they innovate. They launch fads.
Eccentricity reigns, as Ogden Nash observed: ``Yes, it is true, Los
Angeles is not only erratic, not only erotic, Los Angeles is
crotchety, centrifugal, vertiginous, esoteric and exotic.'' Carey
McWilliams, who knew the place well, described it as ``a circus
without a tent.''
</P>
<P>
   The zaniest zaniness of all is the city's love-hate relationship
with its cars. ``Hand wash'' shops are everywhere. People drive two
blocks to buy a loaf of bread; go slowly, exquisitely mad in
freeway traffic jams and show up an hour and a half late (or a
half-hour early) for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Hertz feels compelled to warn those who rent its vehicles here,
``Unfortunately, many Californians are in a hurry and usually
ignore yellow lights (and sometimes red lights).''
</P>
<P>
   In ``L.A. Story,'' Steve Martin had a hilarious go at the car
culture, putting pedestrians in gas masks. He lampooned the city's
mania for decaf, diets and nose jobs, its compulsive consumption
and its linguistic primitivism. He made even the traffic signals
speak Valley: ``Uh, Like, Don't Walk.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   But nutty or not, the place still makes converts. Michael
Karnow, a comedy writer, grew up in Washington, the son of a
Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist, Stanley Karnow, and
graduated from Harvard. Since he moved here nine years ago, he has
become an improbable Jamba Juice junkie _ ``I have their number on
my speed dial'' _ and guzzles power boost and wheat grass drinks
``to increase mental agility.'' He's into yoga and he's learning to
surf.

 LOS ANGELES: to surf.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But with so many people panning for gold here, so many people
from somewhere else, Los Angeles itself suffers from an identity
crisis. It is not so much a city as a concatenation of cities, from
Anaheim to Azusa and Cucamonga, as they said on Jack Benny's show.
Now more than ever, under the pressure of demographic and economic
change, it is hard to unify.
</P>
<P>
   The oil and aircraft industries have all but disappeared as
bulwarks of the regional economy, and most of the formerly
influential banks have been merged into out-of-town institutions.
Even The Los Angeles Times, once a pillar of the city's civic
architecture under the stewardship of the Chandler family, has been
sold to the Tribune Co., a Chicago media conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   These seismic shifts have weakened the city's power structure.
Barry Munitz, president of the J. Paul Getty Museum, probably the
pre-eminent local cultural institution, compared today's Los
Angeles to a ball poised at the top of an incline _ stuck up there
because of ``a lack of enough educational, artistic, civic,
economic and social leaders ready to shoulder the burdens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department, its once-mythic reputation in
tatters, is struggling to eradicate rampant corruption. Already
battered by evidence of officers' planting evidence, lying in court
and shooting unarmed suspects, Chief Bernard C. Parks suffered an
additional tragedy and humiliation recently when his granddaughter
was murdered in the city his men protect.
</P>
<P>
   With expansion of the city's rudimentary subway system stalled,
several sections of the city are studying the possibilities of
secession.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that the vernacular architecture, indeed the only
architecture, of Los Angeles is the ticky-tacky bungalow. But in
fact this is a place full of architectural fascination, ranging
from things that look exactly like what they are _ the Tail o' the
Pup hot dog stand, an oversize stucco and sheet-metal wiener, and
the Capitol Records tower, shaped like a stack of 45's _ to things
that evoke a world that never was, like Mann's (formerly Grauman's)
ornate Chinese Theater, whose like never graced the streets of Old
Cathay.
</P>
<P>
   In the old downtown, along Broadway, which is as animated as the
new downtown is sterile, stand the Bradbury Building (1896), chaste
tan brick on the outside, lacy metalwork and skylighted sparkle
inside, and the Grand Central Market (1917), a survival of the
city's past, where the ethnic stew of its present simmers. Lawyers
and construction workers, African- and Mexican- and
Asian-Americans, crowd the aisles, buying tin toys and purslane and
chop suey and (if they're smart) following the crowds to Roast to
Go, which has been dispensing the city's best tacos since 1952 _
soft tortillas filled with hand-chopped pork (or hog maw or tripe,
as you will) with hot red sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamble House in Pasadena (1908), with its
Japanese-influenced woodwork of unmatched elegance, is the Arts and
Crafts masterpiece of the Greene brothers. Art Deco landmarks stand
along Wilshire Boulevard, including the zigzag Moderne tower of the
old Bullocks department store (1928). For the Public Library
downtown (1930), topped with a gilded hand holding aloft the torch
of truth, Bertram G. Goodhue adopted a more pared-down if richly
allusive Deco style, and in the Textile District, Robert Derrah
produced a streamlined Moderne icon for Coca-Cola (1937), a
bottling plant masquerading as a cream-and-scarlet ocean liner,
complete with portholes, gangways and a flying bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lloyd Wright did some of his best work in the hills and
canyons on the north side of town. Two of his buildings are open
episodically to the public: the low-lying Hollyhock House (1920),
containing much of its original furniture, and the Ennis-Brown
House (1924), a ``Mayan'' temple in patterned concrete block,
clinging to a cliff overlooking the city, whose preservation has
been the life's work of Gus Brown, a former labor union official.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Viennese-born architects, Richard Neutra and Rudolph
Schindler, created what we know as the California style. Neutra's
Lovell House (1929), near the Ennis-Brown House, is a stack of
gray-and-white steel-and-stucco planes jutting from a hillside,
perhaps as good a modern building as California has. It remains a
private residence, but the innovative little house that Schindler
designed for himself in Hollywood in 1921, a series of rooms made
of cheap, utilitarian materials (concrete, canvas, composition
board) with sliding walls that open onto gardens has been turned
into a museum house. Seminal Gehry Buildings
</P>
<P>
   Frank O. Gehry, triumphant in Bilbao, planning great things for
New York, lives here and has done some of his seminal buildings
here, starting with a minimalist Hollywood studio for Lou Danziger
(1964) and continuing with the Dutch-gabled cottage in Santa Monica
that he rebuilt in 1978 (what must the neighbors have said?), using
plywood and chain-link.
</P>
<P>
   Flamboyant though he sometimes is, Gehry can also work almost
anonymously. He turned a police department garage into the Geffen
Contemporary, a highly successful branch of the Museum of
Contemporary Art, with a simple series of baffles and platforms,
and he opened the formerly dark and disorganized Norton Simon
Museum into a sunny, free-flowing series of galleries. His Disney
concert hall, some critics think, may well cap his career.
</P>
<P>
   But until the hall is completed, the building all Los Angeles
wants to see is Richard Meier's Getty Center, a series of
interconnected travertine and enameled aluminum pavilions on an
isolated hilltop near the western end of Sunset Boulevard. From
afar, it looks like a village on a Greek island; up close, it, too,
evokes the mystique of an ocean liner. Different levels linked by
railed gangways feel like different decks, and fountains project
the sound of splashing water everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.75 million people a year visit the Getty, and many of
them come just to see the gardens and the views. It is chic in
certain circles in Los Angeles to say that the pictures aren't up
to the building, but people who have bothered to look at them don't
say that. Not people who like Masaccio and Mantegna, or F.X.
Winterhalter, that sadly underesteemed portraitist of empire.
Surely not students of Rembrandt, represented here by two of his
most vibrant portraits. And van Gogh's ``Irises'' could seduce a
stone.
</P>
<P>
   In Pasadena, the great names march with no less majesty through
the halls of the Simon: Giovanni di Paolo, Bellini, van Gogh again
(his best ``Mulberry Tree''), Cezanne, Klee; reaching a climax in
Zurbaran's exquisite ``Still Life With Lemons, Orange and a Rose.''
It is one of the world's choice small collections. A mile or so
away, in manicured San Marino, the Huntington Library offers great
manuscripts, a Greene and Greene collection, thousands of roses and
Gainsborough's famous ``Blue Boy.'' Some year soon it will place on
view this continent's greatest assemblage of works by the English
designer and polymath William Morris, purchased last year from a
California collector.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest museum in town, the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, is a work in progress, with a major building program
incomplete. Only 36 years old, it has put together an encyclopedic
collection of some 150,000 works of art, including an extensive
group of German Expressionist paintings, but it of course cannot
match the Getty's staggering financial resources. The Museum of
Contemporary Art, whose red sandstone headquarters was the Japanese
architect Arata Isozaki's first American commission, has acquired
more than 120 works in the last year in a bid to keep pace with its
rival up north, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which has
spent $125 million in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Locals bemoan the fact that Los Angeles, almost alone among
world-class cities, failed to mount a gala celebration of the new
millennium. They decry the city's lack of a professional football
team, which in the eyes of some puts L.A. behind Charlotte,
Nashville and Jacksonville. They complain about the teams the city
does have, which lose so often that sports columnists call the city
Loss Angeles. (This year's NBA championship, won by the Lakers
under the avuncular coach Phil Jackson, was the city's first title
in 11 years.)

   The city's most visible industry is film, its natural vocabulary
melodramatic. From D.W. Griffith to Marilyn Monroe to Steven
Spielberg, film has carried Hollywood values around the globe.
Television joins in the pop culture wars, portraying an unreal
world filled with youth, beauty and virility.
</P>
<P>
   Legions of gawkers flock to Hollywood Boulevard, hoping like the
hicks in Nathanael West's memorable Hollywood novel, ``The Day of

   As the critic Shelley Fisher Fishkin writes in a forthcoming
book, ``Landmarks of American Literature,'' these are people,
``cheated out of their dreams by the illusions Hollywood held out
to them,'' for whom ``movies and the world that surrounds them are
more real than life itself.''

   But the city need make no apology for its grander artistic life,
even if New Yorkers and San Franciscans often talk as if culture in
Southern California were confined to yogurt. Hollywood actors and
directors do not often lend their talents to the legitimate stage
in Los Angeles; many limit their work to the movies, and some
prefer the London or New York theater. But there are exceptions.
Last summer, stars like Donald Sutherland, Al Pacino and Kelly
McGillis were seen at the Mark Taper Forum and Ahmanson Theater in
productions of plays by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, O'Neill and
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the arrival in 1984 of Peter Hemmings, a gentlemanly
English arts administrator, did the city have an opera company.
Hemmings, 65, is retiring as general director of the Los Angeles
Opera at the end of this season, to be replaced by Placido Domingo,
who will carry the title of artistic director, as he does in
Washington. He is bowing out with Francesca Zambello's eye-filling
production of Benjamin Britten's mordant ``Billy Budd.''
</P>
<P>
   Though criticized for excessive caution, Hemmings nurtured the
company through adolescence and lured some big Tinseltown talents,
including the painter David Hockney and the director Herb Ross, to
the Chandler Pavilion as designers and directors. He did it on an
annual budget of $20 million, compared with San Francisco's $50
million and the Met's $170 million. Philharmonic's New Home
</P>
<P>
   The disconnect between high culture and pop culture in Los
Angeles has been most visible in the 10-year struggle to build the
Walt Disney Concert Hall _ another fascinating swirl of titanium
designed by Gehry. The money has finally been raised, the
foundations are going in, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic is
scheduled to take up residence in 2002. But except for the Walt
Disney Co., none of the studios, whose executives make hundreds of
millions of dollars a year, and very few of the stars contributed a
single dime.
</P>
<P>
   Without the exertions of the city's No. 1 supporter of the arts,
Eli Broad, who heads the SunAmerica company, the fund-raising drive
might well have foundered. Broad (the name is pronounced to rhyme
with ``road'') made his money on annuities, not movies, and he
collects modern art.
</P>
<P>
   Conducted by the glamorous young Finn Esa-Pekka Salonen, managed
by the highly regarded Deborah Borda, who resigned from the New
York Philharmonic to come here, the Philharmonic plays 30 weeks in
downtown Los Angeles and 12 weeks under the stars in the Hollywood
Bowl in hillside Griffith Park. It ranks among the best orchestras
in America, a worthy challenger to the traditional Big Five bands
in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Cleveland and Chicago. Musical
life in the city deepened during the war years and afterward, when
both Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg lived here. The
orchestra has had a long series of truly outstanding conductors,
among them Otto Klemperer, Zubin Mehta and Carlo Maria Giulini.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fine high-culture facilities here,'' said Tom
Werner, the producer, with his partner Marcy Carsey, of many of the
most wildly successful situation comedies of the last decade. ``But
it isn't really that sort of place. When I was growing up in
Manhattan, when it rained on Saturday, my mother took me to the
Metropolitan Museum. When it rained on Sunday, she dragged me to
hear Leonard Bernstein's concerts. Here, it never rains on
weekends.''

<P>
   Here is a sampling of attractions:
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   BEL AIR, 701 Stone Canyon Rd., Bel Air, (310) 472-1211. The Bel
Air never, ever lapses into Hollywood-style ostentation, creating
instead the illusion that you're staying with rich, relaxed
friends. Gardenias and birds-of-paradise bloom in 12 lush acres of
gardens. Superb food on a terrace overlooking a swan-filled pond,
and superb management by Frank Bowling. Double room: $375 to $485.
</P>
<P>
   CASA DEL MAR, 1910 Ocean Way, Santa Monica, (310) 581-5533.
Built in 1926 and flawlessly restored, it faces the Pacific across
a broad beach near the Santa Monica Pier. Nothing here is
commonplace. The 129 guest rooms, decorated in sherbety
Mediterranean tones, are outfitted with wood-slatted Venetian
blinds, VCRs and pictures in the vein of Matisse. Rubber duckies
wait beside Jacuzzi tubs to soothe the road-weary. Double room:
$335 to $495.
</P>
<P>
   L'ERMITAGE, 9291 Burton Way, Beverly Hills, (310) 278-3344.
Tucked into a residential neighborhood, L'Ermitage is sleek, serene
and stylish after a four-year renovation. Guest rooms have three
phone lines, plus a cell phone, 40-inch television set, DVD player
and bar with free soft drinks; openwork sycamore panels slide shut
to divide sleeping areas from dressing rooms and bathrooms. From
the rooftop pool, you can see the Hollywood Hills _ sometimes.
Double room: $330 to $780.
</P>
<P>
   PENINSULA, 9882 South Santa Monica Boulevard, Beverly Hills,
(310) 551-2888. Bentleys and Ferraris crowd the courtyard, and
weird and wonderful people populate the lobby; this is a prime
show-biz port of call. But even lowly folk get Frette sheets on
their beds, oversize towels, breakfast served on Limoges china and
still lifes of fresh fruit. Order a Cobb salad to eat on the plane.
Double room: $395 to $450.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO EAT
</P>
<P>
   CHINOIS, 2709 Main St., Santa Monica, (310) 392-9025. This is
the restaurant where Wolfgang Puck, an Austrian, put California in
a wok and begat dishes like Shanghai lobster with ginger curry
sauce. After 16 years, the gold-faced Buddha behind the bar still
surveys a happy, noisy, well-fed crowd nightly.
</P>
<P>
   GINZA SUSHIKO, 218 North Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, (310)
247-8939. This may be the most expensive restaurant in America; I
don't know. I do know that the food is sublime _ full of pure,
miraculously fresh flavors. Fugu, or blowfish, is potentially
poisonous in the hands of lesser mortals, but in those of Masa
Takayama, in this tiny, tidy room, it is poetry. Served only from
November to March, it will set you back $400, with tax, tip and
sake.
</P>
<P>
   LUCQUES, 8474 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, (323) 655-6277.
Lucques is hot, hot, hot. In Harold Lloyd's old brick-walled
carriage house, Suzanne Goin whips up hearty, satisfying dishes
like a Technicolor salad of heirloom tomatoes and a bone-in rib-eye
steak with reduced pan juices and a gratin of microscopically thin
potatoes. Seth, the head barman, mixes the town's best martini.
</P>
<P>
   MATSUHISA, 129 N. La Cienega Blvd., Beverly Hills, (310)
659-9639. From this unprepossessing little place grew Nobu
Matsuhisa's worldwide empire. The sushi is perfect; notice the
marbling of the pale pink toro and the subtle crunch of the fried
soft shell crab roll. But innovative hot dishes made Nobu's name.
So try the cod marinated for three days in miso, or the fabulous
fried oysters bathed in a spicy, garlicky sauce. Go at off-hours,
sit at the bar and order the Hoku Setsu sake.
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIPE, 1001 N. Alameda St., Los Angeles, (213) 628-3781.
Phillipe (say fill-EEP-ay) sells a million French dip sandwiches a
year to a motley cast of customers. The sandwich was invented here
in 1918. Stand in line, shuffle your feet in the sawdust on the
floor, order a twice-dipped beef with cole slaw and potato salad,
both delicious, on the side. Then slather the sandwich with the
house's hot house mustard and dig in.
</P>
<P>
   LA SERENATA DE GARIBALDI, 1842 E. First St., Los Angeles, (323)
265-2887. Reborn after two years of renovation, La Serenata is
again the city's favorite Mexican haunt. Once a hole-in-the-wall,
it now boasts handsome tiles, carved beams and bright textiles. The
food remains light, authentic, greaseless and glop-free; vegetables
in the fajitas, for example, are fresh and gently cooked.
</P>
<P>
   SPAGO BEVERLY HILLS, 176 N. Canon Drive, Beverly Hills, (310)
385-0880. Wolfgang Puck's surprisingly unsnobby, unshowbizzy
flagship has no weaknesses. Lee Hefter has shaped a winning menu
ranging from authentic wienerschnitzel to sweet-corn agnolotti.
Sherry Yard prowls farmers' markets for fruit in peak form for her
succulently simple desserts (boysenberries and sugar-lipped peaches
on our last visit). Michael Bonaccorsi, possibly the best young
sommelier in the country, springs surprises from California, Italy,
France and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO, 3115 Pico Blv., Santa Monica, (310) 829-4313. I know
no better Italian restaurant in the United States, nor any better
(and more fairly priced) wine list. Forget about the menu; put
yourself in the hands of Piero Selvaggio, the suave, warmhearted,
Sicilian-born owner. He will give you a taste of this and a sip of
that.: for instance richer Chianti than you ever imagined.

BARAK GOVERNMENT SECURE AFTER RESIGNATIONS WITHDRAWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHOSHANA LONDON SAPPIR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak's fractious coalition
pulled back from the brink of collapse Thursday as four cabinet
ministers from the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party withdrew their threats
to quit, preserving Barak's government as he focuses on making
peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In an eleventh-hour deal, the Shas ministers made an about-face
after three left-wing ministers, who had clashed heatedly with
Shas, resigned their posts instead. The three, members of the
dovish Meretz party, pledged to continue supporting Barak's peace
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The result of Israel's two-week government crisis was to
preserve Barak's 68-52 majority in the parliament, while his Shas
partners, who hold the balance of power with 17 seats, promised not
to challenge Barak again while the peace talks continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe that Shas's continued participation in the
government is important for the state and for the challenges we are
facing,'' Barak told a meeting of his Labor Party after the Shas
ministers retrieved their letters of resignation less than an hour
before they were to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call upon all of the parties to stop with the hatred and the
fighting,'' Barak said in a speech broadcast live on Israeli radio.
``It is impossible to make peace with our neighbors unless we first
make peace amongst ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the crisis ended, Barak met with US envoy Dennis
Ross, who arrived ahead of next week's visit by Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright. Ross was shuttling between Barak and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in an attempt to close gaps in
the difficult negotiations, which aim to reach a peace treaty by
September.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's shaky coalition, made up of six parties, began to
unravel more than two weeks ago when Shas joined the opposition on
a preliminary vote calling for new elections. Shas threatened to
press ahead with elections unless the government came through with
a $6 million aid package for its network of religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Education Minister Yossi Sarid, head of the left-wing Meretz
party, had refused to provide the funds unless Shas accepted state
supervision of its schools.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks of intense negotiations, Barak's One Israel bloc
met most of Shas's demands. But a longstanding enmity between the
ultra-conservative Shas _ a party that excludes women as a matter
of principle _ and the liberal Sarid, blocked a final agreement.
The resignation of Meretz's ministers cleared the way for Shas to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our resignation was inevitable,'' Sarid said. ``We
don't want to be responsible for the collapse of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Meretz, with 10 seats in the 120-seat parliament, is eager to
see Barak conclude land-for-peace deals with the Palestinians and
with Syria, and promised its continued support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the prime minister that although we are leaving our
cabinet posts and the government, we are not abandoning him or the
goals of this administration,'' Ran Cohen, Meretz's industry and
trade minister, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Shas voters, largely observant Jews of Middle Eastern descent,
are less amenable to a peace deal that would entail Israel's
withdrawal from West Bank land it captured in 1967, calling it part
of the Jewish Biblical heritage.
</P>
<P>
   But Shas indicated it would support a peace deal if its rabbis
approved. ``As long as it is a sane and normal agreement I see no
reason Shas should vote against it,'' said Health Minister Shlomo
Benizri.
</P>
<P>
   David Franklin, political correspondent of the Jerusalem Post,
an English-language daily newspaper, said Barak might have a more
harmonious coalition with Meretz out. ``Barak has a more
disciplined Shas party, and with Sarid out, Shas has more incentive
to be disciplined,'' Franklin told the Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarid's resignation is what ended the crisis. Once he was out,
all the remaining issues were resolved. Barak agreed to make Shas a
full partner in the peace process and update Rabbi Ovadia on the
developments on a regular basis.''

U.N. PLANS INTERNATIONALLY RUN COURT IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS first two grafs to add attribution, rewrites)  
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The head of the U.N. mission in Kosovo,
Bernard Kouchner, plans to create an internationally run court to
try war and ethnic crimes in the province, according to an official
in Kouchner's admin- istration.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tribunal, the Kosovo War and Ethnic Crimes Court,
would be headed by international judges and prosecutors, and
supplemented by equal numbers of Albanian, Serb and other ethnic
minority jurists. The court is expected to break new ground in the
pursuit of postconflict justice, providing the impartiality and
scope of an international tribunal with the immediacy of locally
executed justice.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed by a commission of Albanian and international legal
experts last year, the court has languished as only an idea until
now, neglected as the U.N. administration tried to put a local
judiciary in place.
</P>
<P>
   But as Serb judges have refused or been intimidated from serving
on the local courts, leaving the judicial system hopelessly
one-sided, the special court has emerged as the crucial element,
and perhaps the last chance, to bring justice and reconciliation to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The court is conceived as a local specialized court, with
primacy over other local courts, and concentrating specifically on
war crimes committed during the armed conflict in Kosovo, and on
serious crimes committed on racial, ethnic or political grounds
since the war ended. Its mandate would cover war crimes committed
by Serbs during the conflict, and the court would also try
Albanians responsible for the abductions and killings of Serbs and
other ethnic minorities during and after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner is expected to sign a regulation bringing the court
into existence within the next 15 days, and according to one U.N.
official close to him, he has made the decision in recognition that
attempts to give the local judiciary a chance to dispense justice
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kouchner thinks we need a credible judiciary. Taking stock of
one year in office, that is our failure,'' the official said,
referring to the lack of a court system. ``The only way to kick
start it now is with internationals.''.
</P>
<P>
   As violence continues to simmer between the majority Albanian
and the dwindling Serb communities here, a judicial system is
essential if international peacekeepers, police and administrators
are to stabilize the province, said Kosovare Kelmendi, an Albanian
lawyer who heads the Pristina office of the Humanitarian Center for
Law. ``It has to start as fast as possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian victims of war crimes committed by Serbian forces
during the armed conflict have yet to see justice done in the
courts a year after the conflict ended and the United Nations took
over. While the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague has
issued indictments against Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president, and four others, and is preparing more, prosecutors
admit that they cannot handle all the cases.
</P>
<P>
   It could take as long as two years before the first Serbs go on
trial for war crimes in Kosovo, Graham Blewitt, deputy prosecutor
of the tribunal, said during a visit to Kosovo this week. But the
Kosovo war crimes court could start trying cases as early as the
fall. Also, officials said they would not limit their sights to
only low-level perpetrators or the less significant crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, gypsies and other ethnic minorities, victims of revenge
attacks and abductions by Albanians, have also seen months of
lawlessness go unchecked. Some local courts have now begun working
but offer little promise of a fair trial since the panel of judges
are predominantly Albanian. Serb defence lawyers have already
requested for trials to be referred to the special court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first court of its nature, it is a response
to such a need for justice,'' said Fernando Castanon, head of the
prosecution services in the U.N. administration, who is
coordinating the installation of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Castanon who headed the truth commission in Guatemala, and had
experience in postwar justice in African countries, agreed he is
breaking new ground with this court. He explained that however a
war ends, with a peace treaty or victory of one side, ``there is
always a question of what to do with the crimes of the past or the
most serious crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternatives to date have been the ad hoc solutions of the
international war crimes tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, or
local courts which are often not ready to respond. Castanon's plan
for the Kosovo special court would provide, he says, a sustainable
solution that could serve as a blueprint for many other postwar
societies.
</P>
<P>
   The court is intended to complement the Hague Tribunal, which
would retain primacy, and could demand to transfer a trial to the
Hague. Yet, unlike the Hague, it would implement local law in
Kosovo which the local communities could see and understand. ``They
can see the building, they know lawyers are going in there, they
have at least, in practice, justice,'' Castanon said.
</P>
<P>
   The international leadership of the court would remove the
pressure and intimidation that local jurists, both Serb and
Albanian, are already experiencing in Kosovo. The offices of the
prosecution, defence and trial chambers will all be headed by
internationals and each panel of judges trying cases will have one
or two international judges, one Albanian, and one Serb or other
ethnic minority judge.
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of almost 100 people, approximately half of them
internationals, and extras like a witness protection program, the
court is expected to cost $10 million a year.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT UNVEILS NET-BASED STRATEGY FOR THE FUTURE
 &HT;    Moving in (a) national and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ With an antitrust sword hanging over its head,
Microsoft Corp. on Thursday sought to convert itself into a
dominant force in the next generation of advanced Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say it's a 'bet the company' thing,'' Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman and co-founder, told an invited audience of
reporters and industry analysts at the company's sprawling campus
nested between Seattle and the Cascade Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Gates described a new software system, called ``Microsoft.net,''
that within a few years would let consumers and businesses use a
host of powerful and integrated services from computers, handheld
PCs, Web-enabled cell phones and TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   It would let users run all these programs from a single Internet
browser window.
</P>
<P>
   ``You no longer have to leave the browser,'' Gates said. ``You
are always in the browser.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said its new products would let users anywhere
access their favorite software and personal information, such as
schedules, contacts and e-mail, stored on Internet servers. The
products would respond to spoken as well as typed commands, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the new computing platform _ pronounced ``dot-net'' _
was the most ambitious project from the world's largest software
company since it launched the Windows graphical operating system in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy faces challenges. Large networking, database
and Internet access companies are racing to tap the same market for
Web-based services. And the court-ordered breakup of Microsoft, if
upheld on appeal, might make the plan difficult to carry out.
</P>
<P>
   The five-hour briefing by Gates and other top Microsoft
executives skirted the company's antitrust woes. But one theme
running through the often technical talk was the ``open'' quality
of Microsoft-written Internet standards and the embrace of
third-party developers and ``partners'' in seeing the plan to
fruition.
</P>
<P>
   The briefings were punctuated by a series of short video
presentations from current Microsoft ``partners.''
</P>
<P>
   In one, Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Computer Corp.,
said that ``Microsoft's vision for Microsoft.net is a whole new
level of capability, interaction, and customization in the user
experience. It will really leverage the power of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft even managed to elicit a blurb _ but not on videotape
_ from Marc Andreessen, a key prosecution figure in the 78-day
Microsoft antitrust trial that ended with a federal judge ruling
that the company was an abusive monopolist that should be split in
two.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen was a co-founder of Netscape Communications Corp., a
Microsoft arch-rival in the Internet browser wars which now has
been absorbed into America Online Inc. Microsoft's threats against
Netscape figured largely in the guilty verdict rendered by U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, which has been stayed
pending an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Andreessen chairs an advanced Web-design venture named
Loudcloud Inc. whose interests are in line with Microsoft's
ambitious plans _ ``a world of networked services.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last six months have been wild,'' said Microsoft chief
executive Steve Ballmer, who served as an enthusiastic clean-up
speaker after the other presentations ended.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer described himself as a ``caged animal'' since the
``public relations people told us we had to put this off.'' The
briefings, dubbed ``Forum 2000,'' were originally scheduled to take
place a week before Jackson's June 7 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer also assured the nervous analysts, who have watched
Microsoft lose about a third of its market value since settlement
talks with the government failed, that the company's Windows-based
revenue stream would continue for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows isn't going away,'' Ballmer said, ``but to take
advantage of this new technology, we need this new platform.''
</P>
<P>
   The first results of the initiative will not be seen until next
year, while most of the plan will not be ripe for actual use until
at least 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' Gates said, ``is to move beyond today's world of
standalone Web sites to an Internet of interchangeable components
where devices and services can be assembled into cohesive
user-driven experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Gates revealed, Microsoft will seek to impose a
common set of Internet standards for a wide range of online devices
known as extensible markup language or XML. Microsoft claims XML is
open to all. But its critics claim it is being tuned to run best on
Windows.

<P>
   When you want to orient yourself in a new city or to see a
familiar one in a new way, it is useful to have an obsession. Just
about any will do: The key is to decide how long you will yield to
it, then to let it take over. Obsessions select related bits of
information from the chaotic pool of data streaming into your
consciousness, providing focus and structure.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years I revisited three Northeastern cities I
know well: Boston, Buffalo, N.Y., and Philadelphia. During those
visits I looked at them from the idiosyncratic standpoint of what
had become of their historic theaters, those built before World War
II. I also made a trip to Washington to visit the nation's most
famous and sacred historic theater, Ford's; actually, it is a
facsimile, as the original structure in which Abraham Lincoln was
assassinated was torn down by government order soon after his
death.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of these trips I learned much about the dynamics
and histories of the cities themselves. I saw the tremendous energy
and sometimes heartbreaking compromises necessary to maintain a
performing-arts center today. And I learned how intensely it is
possible to love a theater and to believe in a city, so much so
that some people may devote most of their adult lives, sometimes as
volunteers, to keeping an old theater alive.
</P>
<P>
   I was moved to make this pilgrimage by two developments. One was
the brilliant success of renovations to several prewar theaters on
42nd Street in New York, just off Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were the buildings gracefully remodeled or restored,
but their stages are also vibrant, with plays, music and dance; and
the street is thronged with people. Was this kind of renewal
possible only in New York, or have other cities revived their
downtowns by renovating theaters from earlier eras? Could they go
forward by, in some respect, going back?
</P>
<P>
   The other motivation was my sadness over what had happened to
many theaters in my hometown, Philadelphia. A city of flourishing
theaters during the 19th and early 20th centuries, it has suffered
from a declining tax base, civic mismanagement and the depredations
of unplanned real estate development. Most of the theaters I grew
up with, including the sumptuous movie palaces, appointed for kings
and priced for laborers, are now gone, are boarded-up ruins or have
been transformed into other commercial uses. Philadelphia
</P>
<P>
   New theaters have been built in Philadelphia, but they are
small, and their designs reflect ruthless cost cutting. Only a
handful of historic theaters survive as working theaters in Center
City. In trying to bring its decaying downtown back to health,
Philadelphia has chosen to knock down much of its business
district, once lovely and humanely scaled, and build aggressively
new and much higher buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the situation has been the city's longtime hope of
establishing an Avenue of the Arts in its downtown core. Its hub is
to be a new concert hall for the Philadelphia Orchestra, which
musicians argue has outgrown the compromised acoustics and
restricted production space of the Academy of Music, its home for
most of the past century. (The new hall, partially completed, is
projected to open in September 2001. The Academy, with its
old-fashioned raked stage, will be remodeled to accommodate more
dance and opera.)
</P>
<P>
   One heartening new theater opened last year in the completely
gutted ``picture palace'' that was built in 1921 as the Karlton and
that I used to attend when it was called the Midtown. This is the
Prince Music, a producing and presenting house for films and live
performance, operated by a visionary organization founded in 1984
as the American Musical Theater Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The Prince is named for the director-producer Harold Prince, a
longtime festival board member and mentor of the festival
co-founders, Eric Salzman, Ron Kaiserman and Marjorie Samoff (who
is also the theater's producing director). It has two auditoriums:
a 450-seat hall, which includes an orchestra pit for dance and
musicals as well as equipment for the screening of films; and a
150-seat black-box space in what was one of the Karlton's two
ballrooms.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the oldest theater in the United States in
continuous use as such is in Philadelphia: the Walnut Street,
founded in 1809 as a circus for equestrian shows. When I was
growing up, it was the main showcase for traveling modern-dance
companies. Although the facade of the building was refurbished to
approach its early, simple elegance, the interior has suffered from
nearly a century of modernization. Two years ago the main
auditorium was completely gutted, rehabilitated and repainted a
light gray; the results are austere and impersonal compared to my
memories of the graciously ornamented house of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, over the last two decades, the Walnut's nonprofit
organization managed to achieve seasonal programming based on new
plays and musicals, along with some revivals. These are performed
in its main auditorium and in a smaller studio space; at least 70
percent of the audience members are subscribers. Under its current
artistic director, Bernard Havard, the Walnut functions as a
producing theater and as a theater school.
</P>
<P>
   In the company of the historic Academy of Music; the Merriam
(once the Shubert), where the Pennsylvania Ballet dances; and the
Forrest, a house used primarily for musicals but too frequently
dark these days, the Walnut keeps the flame of a theatrical
Philadelphia, whose larger memory is still cherished by many
writers, historians, librarians and natives.
</P>
<P>
   Boston
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Philadelphia, Boston has made an extraordinary
civic effort to light up its downtown with the original chandeliers
of a number of carefully restored and maintained historic theaters
and playhouses, most of them within walking distance of one another
in the historic district. Some are excellent houses for theatrical
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Among these are the sumptuous Italianate Wang Center for the
Performing Arts (1925), where the Boston Ballet performs; the
Emerson Majestic (1903, owned by Emerson College), whose proscenium
is especially well proportioned for dancers, although many kinds of
shows are presented there; the elaborately ornamented Colonial
(1900), a gilded wonder where Fred and Adele Astaire performed; the
snow-and-gold Shubert (1910); and the Charles Playhouse (1843),
built originally as a church.
</P>
<P>
   The spoken word is also accommodated beautifully in the
pristinely restored Wilbur (1914), site of the world premieres of
``Our Town'' and ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' and, a little way
across town, my favorite Boston theater, the arboreal Huntington
(1925, owned by Boston University), which is decorated with
quotations from Shakespeare and houses its own nonprofit resident
company.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with newer theaters and playhouses in Boston and
adjacent Cambridge, such historic structures help to provide city
residents with a sense that, here, history is valued.
</P>
<P>
   Although no individual can be credited completely with
leadership in a citywide effort to maintain the life of any art,
Boston's theatrical legacy would not be what it is today without
the commitment and enlightened voice of Elliot Norton, the
97-year-old drama critic and historian. His prodigious memory and
beneficial open-mindedness, developed over 48 years as a drama
critic for Boston newspapers and more than 25 years as host of a
program devoted to theater on WGBH-TV, has provided Bostonians with
a model of intellectual perspective and beneficial passion for the
subject.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT UNVEILS NET-BASED STRATEGY FOR THE FUTURE
 &HT;    Moving in (a) national and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ With an antitrust sword hanging over its head,
Microsoft Corp. on Thursday sought to convert itself into a
dominant force in the next generation of advanced Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say it's a 'bet the company' thing,'' Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman and co-founder, told an invited audience of
reporters and industry analysts at the company's sprawling campus
nested between Seattle and the Cascade Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Gates described a new software system, called ``Microsoft.net,''
that within a few years would let consumers and businesses use a
host of powerful and integrated services from computers, handheld
PCs, Web-enabled cell phones and TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   It would let users run all these programs from a single Internet
browser window.
</P>
<P>
   ``You no longer have to leave the browser,'' Gates said. ``You
are always in the browser.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said its new products would let users anywhere
access their favorite software and personal information, such as
schedules, contacts and e-mail, stored on Internet servers. The
products would respond to spoken as well as typed commands, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the new computing platform _ pronounced ``dot-net'' _
was the most ambitious project from the world's largest software
company since it launched the Windows graphical operating system in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy faces challenges. Large networking, database
and Internet access companies are racing to tap the same market for
Web-based services. And the court-ordered breakup of Microsoft, if
upheld on appeal, might make the plan difficult to carry out.
</P>
<P>
   The five-hour briefing by Gates and other top Microsoft
executives skirted the company's antitrust woes. But one theme
running through the often technical talk was the ``open'' quality
of Microsoft-written Internet standards and the embrace of
third-party developers and ``partners'' in seeing the plan to
fruition.
</P>
<P>
   The briefings were punctuated by a series of short video
presentations from current Microsoft ``partners.''
</P>
<P>
   In one, Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Computer Corp.,
said that ``Microsoft's vision for Microsoft.net is a whole new
level of capability, interaction, and customization in the user
experience. It will really leverage the power of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft even managed to elicit a blurb _ but not on videotape
_ from Marc Andreessen, a key prosecution figure in the 78-day
Microsoft antitrust trial that ended with a federal judge ruling
that the company was an abusive monopolist that should be split in
two.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen was a co-founder of Netscape Communications Corp., a
Microsoft arch-rival in the Internet browser wars which now has
been absorbed into America Online Inc. Microsoft's threats against
Netscape figured largely in the guilty verdict rendered by U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, which has been stayed
pending an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Andreessen chairs an advanced Web-design venture named
Loudcloud Inc. whose interests are in line with Microsoft's
ambitious plans _ ``a world of networked services.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last six months have been wild,'' said Microsoft chief
executive Steve Ballmer, who served as an enthusiastic clean-up
speaker after the other presentations ended.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer described himself as a ``caged animal'' since the
``public relations people told us we had to put this off.'' The
briefings, dubbed ``Forum 2000,'' were originally scheduled to take
place a week before Jackson's June 7 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer also assured the nervous analysts, who have watched
Microsoft lose about a third of its market value since settlement
talks with the government failed, that the company's Windows-based
revenue stream would continue for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows isn't going away,'' Ballmer said, ``but to take
advantage of this new technology, we need this new platform.''
</P>
<P>
   The first results of the initiative will not be seen until next
year, while most of the plan will not be ripe for actual use until
at least 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' Gates said, ``is to move beyond today's world of
standalone Web sites to an Internet of interchangeable components
where devices and services can be assembled into cohesive
user-driven experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Gates revealed, Microsoft will seek to impose a
common set of Internet standards for a wide range of online devices
known as extensible markup language or XML. Microsoft claims XML is
open to all. But its critics claim it is being tuned to run best on
Windows.

 UNDATED: the subject.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington
</P>
<P>
   Ford's, one of two theaters in the United States overseen by the
Department of the Interior (the other is at Wolf Trap in Virginia),
attracts thousands of tourists yearly. They come because of its
unfortunate notoriety: it is the place where the actor John Wilkes
Booth burst through a door and fired the shot that killed Lincoln.
From the auditorium travelers can descend to a museum devoted to
the assassination and its aftermath; they can then walk across the
street to the house where Lincoln was carried and spent his final
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ford's is an energetic producing theater as well as a
national memorial. Its artistic director, Frankie Hewitt, has been
associated with it since it was rebuilt and reopened in 1968. She
recently noted that in addition to serving adult theatergoers with
plays like Steve Martin's ``Picasso at the Lapin Agile,'' Ford's
also presents shows for young people, many of whom visit the
theater on school trips.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's is the perfect place for plays with a historical basis,
like ``Give 'Em Hell, Harry'' about Harry S. Truman and ``Will
Rogers' U.S.A.'' Ford's has a yearly production of ``A Christmas
Carol,'' based on the story by Charles Dickens, who declaimed it
himself in Carroll Hall in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's is the only theater I've been to in the United States,
outside the New Victory in Manhattan, where each member of the
audience downstairs is offered an individual upholstered chair.
(And after visiting the theater museum, I can tell you that today's
audiences at Ford's are much more cossetted than those of the
19th-century original.)
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo
</P>
<P>
   Of all the theaters I visited, however, the most affecting was
Shea's Performing Arts Center, a jewel of a civic heirloom in the
heart of Buffalo's downtown. Built as a movie palace in 1926 by
Paramount, it was immediately nicknamed Shea's after its manager,
Michael Shea. Today it is a nonprofit institution that houses
touring commercial shows.
</P>
<P>
   Its interior, designed in the Spanish Baroque style by Louis
Comfort Tiffany, is glowing burgundy and gold with cooling touches
of aquamarine. It is a wonderful place, full of light and warmth;
and its human story is wonderful, too.
</P>
<P>
   For the fact that Shea's still exists, in a tenderly renovated
condition, is directly attributable to the continuing determination
by many Buffalonians over the last 30 years not to let it go. Even
a fire that destroyed much of the surrounding downtown in 1986,
rendering the block on which the theater stands a ghost town, did
not daunt its supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the handsome entrance lobby, clad partly in real
marble and partly in a laboriously manufactured artificial marble
known as scagliola, have been painstakingly repaired and
repolished. The original swirling, marbelized abstractions once
again seem to corruscate under the light of four crystal-beaded
chandeliers, each nearly 10 feet long. Their renewed brilliance
alone represents 350 man-hours of restoration, cleaning and
rewiring, all of it performed by volunteers, who since 1997 have
worked under the leadership of Doris Collins, director of the
docent program.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers have been central to the survival of Shea's since the
day in 1975 when a group of them interposed themselves between the
building and the wrecking ball that was to reduce it to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Shea's is not currently a producing theater: it houses touring
Broadway shows, mostly, as well as some pop music groups and other
prepackaged entertainment. But Patrick Fagan, its president for the
last 14 years and the person most strongly identified with the
community's efforts to keep the theater alive, said Shea's was
operating reasonably well. In 1999 it offered some 200 events for
some 300,000 theatergoers. And it recently completed a backstage
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Further construction is needed: a second lobby, more bathrooms,
a decent coat check, more room for concession stands. The city has
contributed $2 million of the $13 million required. The remainder
will be sought from corporate sponsors and private patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo is a city with a distinguished history of private
patronage of the arts; corporate support is comparatively recent.
Over the last few years, for example, the Buffalo Philharmonic,
once sustained largely by private patrons, has been actively
looking to corporations as well. The Philharmonic's home theater is
another prized historic structure: Kleinhans Music Hall, a W.P.A.
project that opened in 1940 with a modernist design by Eliel
Saarinen, first-rate acoustics by Charles C. Potwin and poetic
lighting by Stanley McCandless.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the city has suffered economically for many decades, and
both its audiences and its leading arts patrons are aging. Neither
group seems to be readily replaced by a younger generation, even
though artists themselves keep trying to renew the Buffalo scene.
</P>
<P>
   Across Main Street from Shea's, for instance, is a newly
designed arena theater in a former store. It serves the Irish
Classical Theater Company, founded in 1990 by two young Irish
actor-brothers, Vincent and Christopher O'Neill, and by Dr. James
Warde. A recent season consisted of plays by Brecht, Ibsen, Eugene
O'Neill, Shakespeare and Martin McDonagh. I found out about the
Irish Rep when Collins, who was guiding me around Shea's, spoke
proudly of it as a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance L. Demas, the executive director of the League of
Historic American Theaters, based in Baltimore, said that many
historic theaters in the United States were restored with some
sweat equity. Shea's, though, is singular in its continuing program
to train volunteers in restoration jobs, like fine painting, for
which craftsmen are usually hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make choices about what historic theaters you
save, because you can't save them all,'' Demas said. ``People
turned to theater restoration in the 1960s and '70s. It was a time
when cities were trying to save their downtowns. Theater
restoration revives an interest in the downtown, and anecdotal
studies show that their economic impact on cities is quite
substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Restoration can also be more economical than building new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the Palace Theater in Chicago, where Elton John's `Aida'
opened,'' Demas said. ``That took $25 to $30 million to restore; to
build it new today, in a comparable space, would cost $100 million,
at least.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that we can't build theaters like the old ones
anymore,'' he continued. ``Well, we do have the craftsmen; we do
have the artisans. It's the cost. Our field is one where a lot of
these theaters get saved not because it's economically feasible but
because the people there want them to happen. They believe in them.
With the theaters they will get an important piece of their
history.''

   KOREA-ANNIVERSARY _ SEOUL, South Korea _ Fifty years after North
Korea invaded the South, triggering a war that left nearly 37,000
American soldiers dead, the border dividing the Korean Penninsula
into Communist North and Capitalist South remains the world's last
Cold War fault line, a place where U.S., South Korean and North
Korean troops face off across the most heavily militarized border
anywhere in the world. For protecting South Korea for the past five
decades, the United States has secured a strategic toehold in
Northeast Asia, at the doorstep of China and Russia, and has built
an enduring alliance with South Korea, host of the 1988 Summer
Olympic Games and home to one of the world's strongest economies.
Now, North and South Korea stand at the brink of a historic detente
that could usher in the reunification of the divided Penninsula,
shifting, yet again, the

   KOSOVO-PRISONERS _ MITROVICA, Kosovo _ There are reportedly more
than 1,500 Kosovar Albanians still held in Serb prisons without
being charged. Many of them were rounded up by Serb paramilitaries
during last spring's ethnic cleansing campaign. Serbs call them
prisoners of war, but their wives and mothers call them hostages.
The United Nations can do little to secure their release ? another
criticism people have about the U.N. It's a very politically touchy
subject. The cease-fire accords left out any mention of prisoner
releases, for a number of reasons. But now, families are left with
no recourse except to pay bribes and ransoms to get their relatives
out of jail, paying anywhere from $4,000 to $10,000. We tag along
and bear witness to one of these exchanges at the Kosovo-Serbia
border to tell the story of these families being reunited. (Coker,

   MEXICO-PRI _ MEXICO CITY _ The presidential election on July 2
has political observers and experts asking a rather unusual
question: What if the Instituational Revolutionary Party, the PRI,
doesn't retain presidential power after 71 years? If opposition
candidate Vicente Fox is able to topple PRI candidate Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, what happens to seven-decades of social
infrastructure? Is there a worst-case scenario? Mexico's
government-controlled unions used to bring out massive numbers of
voters for the PRI. They've declined in strength as Mexico has
become less centralized and authoritarian, so can they still churn
out enough voters to help the PRI's candidate win? This population
is a critical part of the PRI political machine. (Ferriss, Cox News

of the Garden of Eden, during last month's Howard Finster Fest, a
show and sale that offered a thoroughly mixed bag of 60 artists but
only one Howard. With the ailing 83-year-old artist recovering from
double pneumonia and congestive heart failure and battling
diabetes, many visitors worried it might be the last chance to see
Finster, get his autograph, hear one of his classic sermonettes.

GOVERNMENT SUPPORTERS DEFEND PRE-ELECTION VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIENDAMBUYA, Zimbabwe _ The first time Priscillah Masunda was
attacked, she said, 68 men drove up in four flatbed trucks, burned
her hut, destroyed her corn crop, and stole two cows and 53
chickens. They chanted pro-government slogans and demanded that she
join the ruling party. Another time, the men took her husband and
beat him for three days before he escaped.
</P>
<P>
   But Masunda, who openly supports the opposition to President
Robert Mugabe, isn't changing her vote.
</P>
<P>
   For four months, Zimbabwe has been jarred by state-sponsored
violence ahead of this weekend's parliamentary elections. At least
30 people have been killed. More than 1,300 commercial farms have
been attacked by thugs supporting Mugabe's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Not since independence in 1980 has an election in this southern
African nation had so much riding on it. Nationwide, the democratic
ideals of aspiring younger generations are clashing with the
hardened values of their elders, who toppled colonialism and claim
the sole right to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Without the violence, political analysts say, a labor-based
opposition would sweep into power on the people's desperation for
jobs and cheap bread. Nearly all agree that urban voters, insulated
from the rural mayhem, will vote for change this Saturday and
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of voting, as the government denies accreditation
to international monitors and as opposition candidates fend off
attacks to campaign across their districts, the key question is
whether the ruling party has kept its rural voters in line. Is
Masunda, short, plump and girlish, a courageous exception or part
of a defiant majority?
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago we were told that nobody in the rural areas
would have moved around openly,'' said Tana de Zulueta, deputy head
of a European Union observer mission. ``Now people seem more
determined and intent on exercising their right of choice. We'll
only know on the polling days.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, the newly formed Movement for Democratic Change
successfully rallied voters to reject a government-sponsored draft
constitution in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread violence began shortly after the referendum, which
not only handed Mugabe his first ballot defeat in 20 years but also
underscored the depth of popular frustration over corruption and
economic decline. Blaming the white minority and Zimbabwe's former
colonial power, Britain, for the country's woes, Mugabe encouraged
his supporters to invade white-owned commercial farms.
</P>
<P>
   Government supporters defend the violence as the only way
Zimbabwe can break foreign oppression. The opposition, they claim,
is just a puppet of Britain and white Zimbabweans and South
Africans. The party has taken money from the latter. Mugabe used
the same argument after denying accreditation to two US observer
teams this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sending monitors ``is meant to ensure that they continue to
plunder our resources and we forever remain their pawns. We are
saying `No' to this. We will never accept this,'' Mugabe was quoted
as saying in the state-owned Herald newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The EU observers this week declared Zimbabwe's pre-election
violence the worst they had ever seen, an assessment echoed by
Lorne Craner, president of the US-based Independent Republican
Institute, after his group was denied credentials. ``Zimbabwe's
pre-electoral administration and environment are so flawed that the
election process as a whole will inevitably fall below even minimal
international standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition hopes the violence will only deepen the public's
desire for change. ``People reach a cut-off point,'' said Charlene
Smith, an opposition party spokeswoman. ``We saw the same thing in
South Africa. In the beginning, when they started to torture and
terrorize, people caved. But when something like this goes on long
enough, a spirit of resistance develops.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 25,000 people turned up for the last major opposition rally
in Harare last weekend. On the same day, just 5,000 turned to hear
Mugabe across town. But Mugabe has always tapped rural Zimbabwe for
his strength, and there, the numbers were less encouraging for the
opposition. An estimated 40,000 showed up at Mugabe' rally
Wednesday in Mount Darwin, north of Harare. ``By this massive
turnout, we have demonstrated who has the support of the people,''
Mugabe told the rally.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the countryside has been hostile
terrain for the opposition. One rural opposition candidate has fled
the country. Several more have been beaten so badly that they are
hospitalized. The party cannot deploy its polling agents in four
districts, which means it cannot monitor the voting. Attacks occur
daily, Smith said, and candidates from at least half rural
districts have been affected.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many opposition candidates campaign at night,
traveling door to door under cover of darkness to spread the party
message. Ironically, the liberation movements, like Mugabe's party,
employed the same tactics prior to independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meet a lot of people who come to me in private and say they
are will us, they are fed up with the ruling party,'' said
Valentine Ziswa, an opposition candidate from a district 90 miles
east of Harare. ``But people don't feel safe enough to come out
openly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in clothes promoting the ruling party, Nickson Musonga
led a small group that broke up one of Ziswa's rallies Tuesday in
Chiendambuya, a tiny rural town far down a dirt road. They chased
the opposition candidate and destroyed his posters and leaflets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a one-party state,'' he said. ``People who did not
fight to liberate the country will never rule it.''

HEINZE WELCOMES EXPANSION DRAFT STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ When a player finds out he is left
unprotected for an expansion draft, normally that realization is
met with anxiety at the prospect of changing teams. For most, an
uncertain future can be stressful and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the case of Bruins veteran Steve Heinze, he asked to
be left unprotected when the NHL stocks Minnesota and Columbus in
Friday's expansion draft. By his own admission, Heinze had a brutal
season last year, scoring just 12 goals and 25 points in 75 games.
A native of the area, his struggles really hit home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really lived outside Route 495 in my life, so in
that case, it's time for a change,'' said Heinze, who figures he's
played his last game in a Bruins uniform. ``It's time to try
something new, not only hockeywise, but lifewise, and check out
another part of the country. Just a change of scenery can fire up
not only your personal life, but your hockey as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze is viewing the draft as a beginning, no matter where he
lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of excited actually,'' he said. ``I enjoyed playing
here and playing in front of my family and all that. The grass may
not always be greener, but when it's pretty brown where you're at .
. . a change can be good. If you get picked up by an expansion
team, you're going to be relied on. You're going to be on special
teams and out there in the last couple of minutes of the game if
it's close. Some of those things have slipped away from me over the
last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze's likely departure may be the best option for him and the
Bruins. Heinze said management, initially reluctant to the idea,
thinks a move would be for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was tough personally and teamwise,'' Heinze said.
``My ice time and things have just slowly tailed off over the last
two, maybe three years, but you only look to yourself. You blame
yourself for things. There could be other factors but I'm not going
to get into that.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one reason or another, I wasn't the player who was being
relied on like I used to be around here. That's one of the things
that brought us to the conclusion that this was a good way to get
moved out of here. (President/general manager Harry Sinden) was
accommodating from what my agent (Steve Mountain) told me. At first
it was `no' to get on the (unprotected) list and then a `maybe.' If
you see the (players) they protected, they're a core part of the
team. My agent made it sound to me as if Harry had done us a favor
and made this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze said he knows that even if Columbus or Minnesota selects
him, he could be traded. Expansion teams do a great deal of
wheeling and dealing. Heinze said if he's not taken, the Bruins
might trade him. Playing at home can be a safety net, but as Heinze
found out, struggling in front of the home crowd can be
suffocating.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as everybody means well, when you're not playing well,
everybody is in your ear,'' said Heinze. ``I'll certainly be buying
less tickets now. The only thing I'm really worried about is
logistics. What do you do with your house _ do you sell it or rent
it? I've been in the league nine years, I'm 30 years old. I'm adult
enough to know I can survive in other places. I've done a lot of
traveling throughout the world. I don't think I'm that nervous
about that. I love this town, I love living here. We appreciate
that, now it will be a chance to see if we can live without it.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Bruin likely to be selected is 27-year-old goalie Rob
Tallas. Tallas has been preparing for a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at this is as a positive,'' said Tallas. ``This
might be the best learning year I could've had. Going into games,
we were struggling and I was facing hard, hard shots and tested
every night, and no matter how you play, sometimes the outcome
wasn't what you wanted. A lot of times that is what happens in
expansion. We experienced it last year firsthand. I know how to
bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   There was very little bouncing back by the Bruins last season.
High expectations were a factor. With a first-year club, the
expectations are more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year was just one of those years where I think the guys
who had the best stats were the guys who got hurt and got out
early,'' said Tallas. ``To know I'm going to be up for expansion, I
tried to look at the positives and that's what hit me, that I'm
going to be tested a lot of nights. I'm a strong believer in that
there's a reason for everything.''

A $20 MILLION SEDAN, THE LAST WORD FROM BUICK
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25)  
 By CHERYL JENSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, Mich. _ What we have here is a failure to communicate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am sitting in the elegant Buick LaCrosse, a design study for
an elegant, futuristic sedan, at General Motors' proving ground
here. It looks as though I won't be getting out soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The LaCrosse's features include voice-activated controls. After
a brief and very gentle drive with Gary Mack, one of the car's
designers, as I conversed with the car in an attempt to make my
exit, I had the distinct sense that I was dealing with HAL, the
control-freak computer in ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' This is what
happened: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Me: LaCrosse. Door open. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: (Silence). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Me: LaCrosse. Door open. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: Dialing 921. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Me: LaCrosse. Door open. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: Out of range. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mack: Try ``Door open.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Me: Door open. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: Opening hood.
</P>
<P>
   Mack (quickly trying to take over as the hood starts to rise),
loudly: Hood close!
</P>
<P>
   It is an extremely windy day and the prospect that the fragile,
hand-built hood will fly open panics three of the car's handlers
and sends them running our way.
</P>
<P>
   A GM representative: No. No. No. It's too windy! It'll become a
sail! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mack: Hood close. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: Temperature set 79 degrees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mack: Hood close. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: Stopping trunk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mack: Hood close. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: Closing hood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such is life when driving concept cars _ which after all, are
really designed to be seen and not necessarily to be driven, or
even sometimes to be heard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to resist when GM offers a chance for even a
short drive in $20 million worth of futuristic hardware. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Driving these vehicles is not useful for evaluating vehicle
dynamics. It's an exercise in make-believe, like sitting in your
father's car in the driveway when you were 8, sawing at the
steering wheel and imagining that you were really on the road. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this is better because there is a little more than
imagining. You can drive them up to about 25 mph and get a glimpse
of what one might be like as a real car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, not far from the surly LaCrosse is the Chevrolet
SSR, for Super Sports Roadster, one of six concept vehicles on hand
and a sure bet for production. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an elegant move, I fall down and over the sill into the
cockpit, which has the visual impact of the Plymouth Prowler but is
much more practical, thanks to a pickup bed with a hard cover.
</P>
<P>
   The driver's seat doesn't slide; we don't have working
seatbelts, and the speedometer and other electronics are shut off
to save battery power. But we have plenty of other power. The
6-liter V-8 is capable of sending more than 300 horsepower to the
rear wheels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I turn the key and fire up the engine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm holding onto a large, three-spoke steering wheel, a design
cue from the past. The automatic transmission is shifted by pushing
a button on the steering wheel. Three taps and I'm in ``drive''; a
second later we're moving. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ride is a bit stiff, even on the ultra-smooth track, and the
body shakes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all hand-built cars,'' said Andre Hudson, a
23-year-old designer who worked on the SSR. ``This is actually one
of the best ones; the other ones are quite a bit more fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   The tires don't help the ride. The tread was hand-cut by
Goodyear in a pattern that mimics Chevy's bow-tie emblem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the SSR changes direction quickly and you realize how strong
a performer the SSR will be if GM can keep the weight down. It is
all too easy to imagine how great a package this could be. Plus,
when we finish the drive, it lets me out. &QL;

&HT;     PROSECUTORS HAND AMMUNITION TO RIVALS OF GORE, HILLARY
CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Separate actions by government prosecutors Thursday
dealt Vice President Al Gore a potential political setback and
handed First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton a begrudging exoneration
in connection with unrelated activities during the Clinton
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The actions involving the vice president's fund-raising
activities in 1996 and the first lady's possible role in firing
White House travel office employees in 1993 come in the midst of
heated campaigns for both. Gore faces a battle with Republican Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas for the presidency, while the first lady is
running for Senate in New York against Republican Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's bid to distance himself from President Clinton faces
fresh legal and political headaches as a result of a recommendation
by a top Justice Department prosecutor that Attorney General Janet
Reno appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the vice
president's role in raising money for the Clinton-Gore re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The development also undercuts the credibility of Gore's attacks
on the Bush fund-raising machine. The Republican has raised record
sums to finance his presidential bid without accepting federal
matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Conrad, the supervising attorney in the Justice
Department's broad inquiry into campaign fund-raising abuses four
years ago, has recommended that Reno take the investigation of Gore
to the next step, according to Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he had learned of Conrad's recommendation during a
Senate inquiry into the Justice Department's handling of the
money-raising investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that I found out about in an official
investigation,'' Specter said in an interview on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Committee on
Government Reform, welcomed disclosure of Conrad's recommendation
as ``a positive development.'' Burton said that FBI Director Louis
Freeh, former Justice Department task force leader Charles La Bella
and now Conrad ``have made it clear that Janet Reno's Justice
Department is incapable of conducting a thorough and unbiased
investigation of the president and vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad declined to publicly discuss his recommendation Wednesday
under questioning by Specter at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary
Committee's panel on administrative oversight and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has twice declined to appoint special prosecutors to
investigate Gore in connection with telephone fund-raising from the
White House in 1996. Federal law prohibits solicitation from
government property.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he would press Reno on the issue when she is
scheduled to testify before the subcommittee next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never called for her resignation; I've never called for
impeachment,'' said Specter, who served as a Republican counsel
during the Senate Watergate investigation of Richard Nixon in the
1970s. ``What I have done is lay facts on the line. There could be
a different reaction (by Reno) at this time. It's up to the
attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had no immediate comment on the developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that so I'll have to inform myself,'' Gore
told reporters during a campaign visit to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Kennedy, a senior White House spokesman, said the White
House had ``received no word'' of the development form the Justice
Department, adding: ``The Vice President has cooperated fully with
the investigation every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Deportment spokesman Myron Marlin said the investigation
into Clinton-Gore fund-raising in 1996 was ``still ongoing'' and
had already led to the prosecution of 25 individuals, adding: ``It
is inappropriate to comment on ongoing matters or internal
deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and FBI have battled over whether to
expand the investigation into the fund-raising activities since the
controversy came to light during the last presidential campaign.
Those abuses included:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democratic Party's receipt of campaign donations from
foreign donors. The party eventually returned more than $3 million
in illegal contributions from foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Personal telephone solicitations of prospective donors by Gore
from the White House office. Gore later said there was ``no
controlling legal authority'' barring such telephone solicitations,
but he promised not to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton won a legal battle but suffered a
public relations blow from special prosecutor Robert W. Ray, who
announced that he was closing a protracted investigation into the
firing of seven White House travel office employees after Bill
Clinton became president.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he unearthed ``substantial evidence'' that the first
lady ``had a role in the decision'' to sack the political
appointees, including some who had worked at the White House for 30
years. The Clintons were accused to dismissing the employees to
make way for a distant cousin of the president, Catherine
Cornelius, who was installed as the new travel office director.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray added that he had ``declined prosecution'' because ``the
evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt'' that Mrs. Clinton's statements had been ``knowingly
false.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray decried the ``substantial resistance'' from the White House
to prosecutors' quest for evidence in the case, including legal
efforts to assert ``unfounded privileges'' to protect the material,
``inadequate searches'' for requested documents and failure to
``make timely production'' of requested documents.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Dale, the former head of the White House travel office
fired by the Clintons and subsequently acquitted of federal charges
of embezzlement, said he was ``deeply disappointed'' by Ray's
refusal to prosecute Mrs. Clinton, who he said had ``falsely
accused'' him.

CHEAP THRILLS FROM A SPORTS CAR WITH JOIE DE VIVRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 25)  
 By DAN NEIL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To drive the new Toyota MR2 Spyder is to appreciate the Mazda
MX-5 Miata all over again. For more than a decade, an eternity for
a sports car, the plucky little Mazda roadster has defined the
road-going romantic idyll. The Miata is small, intimate even, with
a trunk that can handle a couple's bags for a romantic weekend
getaway. Leave the golf clubs at home; you're going no farther than
the hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   The Miata is also a terrific little open-top sports car, with
whip-smart handling, excellent balance and rorty, eager power. For
a generation of older-but-wiser fans of British sports cars, the
affordable Miata delivered all the windblown pleasures of the old
MGs and Triumphs without the fear of being becalmed by mechanical
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the Toyota MR2 Spyder, another overachieving,
underpriced small sports car intended to win over Miata lovers;
but, alas, even in Virginia, the MR2 is not for lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its midengine design _ the motor is situated behind
the seats and slightly ahead of the rear axle _ the MR2 has no
trunk. Storage is limited to a plastic bin behind the seats (you
have to move the seats to get to it) about the size of a viola
case, plus a smaller-than-a-breadbox space in the nose, next to the
spare tire. Thus, a simple trip to the supermarket becomes an
exercise in Solomonic reasoning: Who gets to sit in the passenger
seat, your spouse or the groceries? As for the cozy weekend
getaway, unless you are heading for a nudists' retreat, forget it.
Carry-on bags are not permitted; nor can you check your luggage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the MR2 has a strangely feral feel, as a car that
must be enjoyed alone _ quite a contrast to the congenial Miata.
Toyota could answer quite reasonably that utility was never part of
the car's mission statement. Yet after a week in the MR2, this
seems a miscalculation. A car with no storage is merely a toy, and
toys, as the Plymouth Prowler proves, become boring.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers, the MR2 and Miata are strikingly similar. The
MR2's length (153 inches) is a couple of inches shorter than the
Miata, though the MR2 is slightly wider and taller. The MR2 is
about 100 pounds lighter than the Miata, which can be loaded with
luxury options not available in the MR2. Both cars are powered by
1.8-liter aluminum engines, though the MR2's variable valve timing
gives it the edge in usable torque (125 pounds-feet at 4,400 rpm,
vs. the Miata's 117 pounds-feet at 5,000 rpm).
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the MR2 seems oddly derivative. The top
latches appear to have been purchased by the same supplier who
sells the parts to Mazda. Imitation is the sincerest form of
flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, however, the two cars come from very different
sides of the drafting table. Compared with the Miata, with its
lozenge-like curves, the MR2 is crisply geometric, with slab sides
punctuated by scalloped air ducts and an anthropomorphic face
reminiscent of Mike Mulligan's steam shovel _ all grin and bright
eyes. The rear of the car features a long louvered decklid and
prominent taillights above a Ferrari-like rear grille. From this
angle, the current Spyder has more in common with the
first-generation MR2 of the late 1980's _ itself a riff on the old
Fiat X1/9 _ than its immediate forebear, a sort of Mini-Me
Testarossa.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Miata, whose top folds down with the inside panel
exposed to the elements, the MR2's top folds in a Z pattern,
leaving the canvas top clamped down behind the seats and minimizing
the need for the tonneau cover.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the MR2 is well organized and comfortable, with simply
superb bolstered buckets that you may be tempted to unbolt and
install in your living room. The bluff and upright dash keeps the
climate and audio controls well sorted; handsome materials, like
brushed aluminum and dimpled vinyl on the steering wheel, dash and
door pulls, a serenely technical feel.
</P>
<P>
   The Achilles' heel in any midengine car is packaging, since the
engine takes up so much prime real estate in close proximity to the
driver. Yet the MR2's engine seems isolated from the cabin. It
makes its presence known under hard acceleration, as it should,
with a hoarse, mechanical burr; but in the putter of city streets
it remains pleasantly sotto voce. Legroom is ample for a small
midengine car (compared with the cruelties of the X1/9, for
instance), allowing you to move the seat up for a few degrees of
seat-back rake. Credit the MR2s expansive wheelbase of 96.5 inches,
which sets the wheels in the far precincts of the fenders.
</P>
<P>
   Considering its myriad packaging problems, why bother with a
midengine design, anyway? Because placing the engine near the
center of the car allows the vehicle to turn more quickly,
pirouetting around a vertical axis like a skater with her arms
drawn in tight. For pure performance, nothing beats a lightweight,
midengine, rear-drive car _ as a glance at the grid of the Indy 500
will tell you.
</P>
<P>
   The MR2s performance is sparkling, lively, alert and well
composed, transitioning evenly from one sliding corner to another.
The car's rack-and-pinion steering answers instantly to command,
and the sensations from the tires feed up through the wheel so you
intuitively know what each wheel is doing at all times. Considering
how much steel is in the car's unit body, the MR2 is remarkably
light (about 2,200 pounds unloaded), so the suspension and tires
needn't battle high inertia loads pitching from side to side. The
independent suspension (struts and springs with control links) is
supple but firm, giving up a few inches of body lean in corners
before stiffening in a muscular, shoulder-down stance.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota wisely chose to put 15-inch radials on the car. Bigger
tires might have given the car more overall grip (and filled in
what appears to be overly generous wheel wells), but the ride would
have suffered without really improving the car's fun quotient.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the MR2s toggle-like gearshift, well-placed pedals and
hearty antilock brakes all make it a wildly amusing car to drive.
The MR2 dances and darts like an aerobatic kite in a stiff spring
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves the MR2 in a virtual dead heat with the
Miata in general joie de vivre. So why would anyone choose the MR2
over a gold-plated classic with a trunk? Cheap exclusivity, for one
thing. There are about a quarter-million Miatas running around the
United States. The MR2 will be sold in limited numbers, only 5,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   So if you buy an MR2, you will definitely turn some heads. You
will have bought a car with the fit and finish of a Toyota, the
oaken solidity of a car costing thousands more. If only it didn't
make you feel so lonely. &QL;

SHAW'S SELLS REAL EASTATE AS PART OF EXPANSION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking to expand aggressively after its 1999 acquisition of
Star Markets Co., Shaw's Supermarkets Inc. is selling 19 strip
shopping centers to a consortium of buyers led by Northstar
Properties for about $117 million.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced Thursday, is for the East Bridgewater, Mass.
chain to use the money to replace old stores and open new ones.
</P>
<P>
   By exiting the real estate business, Shaw's _ it's the
second-largest supermarket chain in New England with 167 stores _
can focus on its core business of retail food, it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funds received as a result of the sale will be utilized in
continued growth and development of new stores and shopping centers
by Shaw's Supermarkets,'' said Steve Jackson, the chain's vice
president of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spaulding &AMP; Slye Colliers, the Boston real estate
firm that brokered the deal, the transaction may represent the
largest portfolio sale of strip shopping centers in the region's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping centers are in five New England states and together
represent 1.4 million square feet of floor space; 15 of the 19
centers are anchored by a Shaw's.
</P>
<P>
   About half the shopping centers are in Massachusetts, including
locations in Cohasset, Plymouth, Quincy, and Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's said it will continue to operate stores in those centers,
but as a tenant rather than as a property owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This portfolio gives us a solid base in New England and
property interests from Hawaii to Maine,'' said Fredric Leopold of
Northstar Properties. ``We plan to develop and acquire more
supermarket projects in the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling off ``ancillary businesses'' has become increasingly
common in the intensely competitive grocery business, said Jeff
Metzger, publisher of Food World and Food Trade News, two regional
trade industry publications.
</P>
<P>
   Spaulding &AMP; Slye noted that in 1996 it brokered a similar $96.3
million deal for Stop &AMP; Shop Supermarket Co. of Quincy, the
region's largest supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Stop &AMP; Shop announced plans to exit some of its
ancillary businesses, including production of its store-brand dairy
products, so it can focus on food retailing.
</P>
<P>
   A decade or so ago, it wasn't unusual for a supermarket chain to
dabble in several related businesses, Metzger said. But as the
supermarket industry has consolidated, the remaining big players
seem to be adopting a stick-to-the-basics philosophy and shedding
their sidelines, he said.
</P>

DEEP RIFT SEPARATES CONQUERERS OF HUMAN GENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS AND RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday the competing factions in the race to map the human
genome will come together in Washington, in a rare moment of
comity, to announce their completion of a ``rough draft'' readout
of all the human genes, a monumental scientific achievement that
promises to open a new era in medicine and a deeper understanding
of human life.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the smiles, handshakes and lofty rhetoric will remain
a deep rift.
</P>
<P>
   Both efforts, the federal government's massive Human Genome
Project and aggressive biotech startup, Celera Genomics Inc., want
to publish their work in an eminent research journal, Science _ the
gold standard of scientific acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   But the journal's editors have that they won't allow Celera to
publish unless the company agrees to release its data on a free
government website, called GenBank, where all the Human Genome
Project's data already resides.
</P>
<P>
   Celera, a Wall Street darling that has in some eyes made the
genome research effort a race by its rapid gene decoding, insists
its data be kept on its private website, according to scientists
close to the Rockville, Md. company. The raw data would be free to
researchers but would also allow Celera to attract potential
customers willing to pay for various pre-packaged forms of the
complex genomic code. One day, Celera says it hopes to sell
personal genetic disease tests over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Celera also worries that if its data goes on GenBank,
competitors will snatch and sell it, depriving the firm of profits
on its investment _ said to be hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two sides reportedly have forged a detente enabling
the Monday's joint appearance, the divisive publication issues were
unresolved Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No agreement has been reached yet with respect to publication
in Science,'' said a scientist familiar with the behind-the-scenes
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   One motivation for the new truce is to restore some dignity to
the genome project, which the federal government began 13 years
ago. Celera jumped into the project less than two years ago, saying
its high risk-high payoff sequencing strategy would leave the
public effort in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Several attempts at collaboration over the past few months
failed as meetings broke down amid bickering and name-calling. So
much has been made of the rivalry that scientists on both sides
worry that the public feels ``that the genomic revolution is being
left to people who can't even act civilly in public,'' said one
scientist who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest source of conflict has been Celera's determination
to withhold for a time its gene sequence data from public view, so
that its subscribers can search it for patentable genes.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves Celera's chief, former government scientist Craig
Venter, with a difficult choice: agree to Science's terms and gain
scientific legitimacy but perhaps hurt his company; or forego
publication and risk missing out on scientific immortality and a
possible Nobel prize.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kennedy, the editor of Science, said Thursday, ``We're
not active negotiators. We're very hopeful that the parties will
reach an agreement on publishing the data.''
</P>
<P>
   The original timetable for the human genome project called for
completion by 2005. Once Celera declared its intention to beat the
federal effort, that timetable shortened by at least two years.
Last January, Celera said it had decoded 90 percent of the genome.
</P>
<P>
   Government scientists point out that a large fraction of
Celera's sequence is based on public data from GenBank, whereas the
Genome Project has no access to Celera's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Celera did not return repeated calls for comment. But they
reiterated to concerned money managers, who follow Celera's
high-flying but volatile stock, that they would not relent on
demands to put their data on GenBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it clear that they firmly want to have data
available only on Celera's website,'' said Winton G. Gibbons, an
analyst with Chicago-based William Blair &AMP; Co. who spoke with
Celera officials. ``The company wants to maintain control of their
intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, five large pharmaceutical companies have paid Venter's
company for a genome subscription. But a looming problem, from a
business standpoint, is the Humane Genome Project's
ever-accelerating effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their competitive window is on the order of 5 months. They'll
need to sell their database in that window, because it will be a
rapidly wasting asset by 2001,'' said a scientist working on the
government's project.

JUSTICE AIDE SEEKS PROBE OF GORE FUNDRAISING ACTIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore could become the focus of a
new investigation by a special counsel at the height of the
presidential campaign if a recommendation reportedly made by a top
Justice Department official is accepted by Attorney General Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Conrad, the supervising attorney for the Justice
Department task force on 1996 fund-raising, has recommended that
Reno appoint a special counsel to examine Gore's solicitation of
campaign contributions, according to Senator Arlen Specter, a
Pennsylvania Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno has rejected two similar recommendations in the past
and it was far from clear whether she would act differently this
time. A Justice Department official confirmed only that Conrad had
made a preliminary recommendation, which is subject to review by
other officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the possibility of a recommendation for an
investigation plays into the hands of Republicans, who have made
clear they intend to try to make Gore's fund-raising practices at a
Buddhist Temple and elsewhere into a major campaign issue. While
Republican nominee-in-waiting George W. Bush has raised far more
money than Gore in the current campaign, Bush aides have said the
Texas governor raised his money legally while they contend Gore
solicited funds illegally in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There has speculation about whether Reno would appoint a special
counsel ever since Conrad earlier this year interviewed Clinton and
Gore about several fund-raising matters. The Gore probe has focused
on these two key questions, according to knowledgeable officials:
</P>
<P>
   --Did Gore know he was raising funds when he made an appearance
at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple in 1996? Republicans have ridiculed
Gore for soliciting funds from temple members who have taken a vow
of poverty and have noted that it is illegal to raise money from a
tax-exempt organization. Gore initially said he thought he was
doing ``community outreach'' but later said he knew the visit was
related to fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   --Did Gore knowingly raise regulated ``hard money'' at the White
House? Gore has said he did raise unregulated ``soft money,''
saying famously that there is ``no controlling legal authority''
against such solicitations. But Justice Department officials and
FBI agents have compiled documents that indicate Gore was at a 1995
meeting in which ``hard money'' solicitation was discussed. Gore
told the investigators earlier this year that he may have missed
that discussion because he was drinking a lot of iced tea during
the meetings ``which could have necessitated a restroom break.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard money refers to closely regulated contributions from
individuals that may be spent directly on political campaigns. Soft
money refers to largely unregulated donations to political parties
that can be legally used only for get-out-the-vote and other
party-building practices. Federal law is widely interpreted to
forbid raising hard money but not soft money on public property.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad and other Justice Department officials reportedly have
been investigating Gore's explanation, which may have given rise to
Conrad's recommendation that a special counsel be appointed. Even
if a special counsel is appointed, it does not mean that there has
been any conclusion about wrongdoing by Gore; it merely starts a
new, broader investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But that is exactly the kind of investigation that Gore does not
want during the presidential campaign, and his aides Thursday
sought to cast the matter as politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have heard is a Republican senator making his own
announcement,'' said Gore spokesman James Kennedy, who stressed
that the White House has received no information from the Justice
Department about a possible investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, asked about the possibility of a new fund-raising
investigation, said he knew nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're privy to news I don't have,'' Gore said during a
campaign appearance in Minnesota. ``I don't know about it, so I'll
have to inform myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign seized on the opportunity to tie the news
about Gore to the other investigations which have plagued the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush believes that the American people are tired of
all these scandals and investigations and the best way to make them
go away is to elect someone new and different,'' said Bush
spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said Thursday he ``has reason to believe'' that Conrad
made the recommendation, but declined to say how he came to that
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Specter has been pushing for years for the appointment of a
special or independent counsel. Specter has held a number of
hearings this year designed to put pressure on the Clinton
administration to release memos in which Justice Department
officials reportedly made similar recommendations to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has twice rejected recommendations that she appoint an
independent counsel to examine Gore's 1996 fund-raising practices,
and the Gore campaign had hoped the matter was behind them. But
during the presidential primaries, GOP candidate John McCain, the
Arizona senator, relentlessly ridiculed Gore and said he was an
obstacle to reform. The Republican National Committee or an
independent group allied with the GOP is expected to run television
commercials showing videotape of Gore at the Buddhist Temple and at
the White House making his ``no controlling legal authority''
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who was nominated to her position by President Clinton,
has always insisted that she decided against appointing a counsel
in the case because there was not enough evidence to warrant a
probe. But many Republicans have accused her of acting politically
to protect Clinton and Gore, with some GOP senators calling for her
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, noting that there is a much lower threshold for
appointing an special counsel than for an indictment, said there is
plenty of evidence to warrant a probe. They noted that a Gore aide
attending a key meeting wrote a note that said the fund-raising
should be ``65(percent) soft/35(percent) hard.'' In addition, when
Justice investigators interviewed former White House chief of staff
Leon Panetta about the meetings, he recalled that Gore had listened
attentively.
</P>
<P>
   Specter insisted that his timing was not political, saying that
he would have preferred that a counsel was appointed in 1998 so
that Gore would not have to face an investigation in the midst of a
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a Wednesday hearing of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on
administrative oversight and the courts, Specter asked Conrad
whether ``you made or attempted to make a recommendation'' on a
special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad said he didn't feel comfortable discussing the matter
because it is ``something that pertains to an ongoing
investigation.'' The issue is likely to be at center stage on
Tuesday, when Reno tentatively is scheduled to appear before the
same subcommittee.

   MINSK, Belarus _ Saying that Europe was poised between ``hope
and fear'' over the future of democracy in Belarus, a delegation
from the European Parliament on Thursday severely criticized
President Aleksandr Lukashenko's assault on his political opponents
and threatened to withhold a team of observers for elections he is
trying to orchestrate for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The election struggle puts the country of 10 million wedged
between Russia and Poland at a crucial junction. Lukashenko is
seeking to restore the legitimacy of his hard-line nationalist
government after he disbanded a democratically elected parliament
in 1996, installed his own rump parliament and extended his term to
2001 in a referendum that was widely condemned as rigged.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, which includes many leading figures who helped
separate Belarus from the Soviet Union in 1991 and establish an
independent state, is simply trying to remove Lukashenko by forcing
him to submit to a fair election, which they say he will lose. And
if he refuses to conduct such an election, several opposition
leaders say they will carry on the battle as best they can, even in
the streets, where some warned that a confrontation was looming.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Chigir, who was Lukashenko's first prime minister before
breaking with him over the 1996 dissolution of Parliament, said on
Thursday that he intended to run for Parliament this fall and for
president next spring if Lukashenko would allow genuine elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to continue this struggle and I have no intention
of stopping halfway,'' Chigir said after enduring eight months of
imprisonment and a political trial that left him stripped of any
right to run for office. He hopes that decision can be reversed by
pressure from Russia, Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this spring, tens of thousands of demonstrators took to
the streets of Minsk to protest Lukashenko's authoritarian rule.
Thousands of riot police broke up the largest of the rallies on
March 25, arresting and beating hundreds of protesters, including
dozens of journalists who were covering the peaceful march.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is Lukashenko himself,'' said Pavel Zhuk, an
independent newspaper editor whose publishing enterprises have
twice been shut down. ``I don't think it will end quietly,'' Zhuk
said. ``The pressure just keeps getting higher and higher.
``Something is going to happen. There will be an explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's rebuke from the visiting Europeans, who have been
trying to push Lukashenko into talks with the opposition to
guarantee fair elections, comes as both the United States and
Russian leaders are stepping up the pressure. They want Lukashenko
to come to terms with opposition forces and to allay the climate of
fear that critics say has smothered the nascent democratic
institutions that brought Lukashenko to power in 1994. His
presidential term ended in July 1999 and many Western countries,
including the United States, have downgraded their official
contacts with his government.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the House last month passed a nonbinding
resolution condemning human rights violations and the suppression
of democracy in Belarus. Several members of Congress are urging
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to meet with Belarussian
opposition leaders. In Moscow, three prominent political figures,
including former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and the Yabloko
party's leader, Grigory Yavlinsky, signed an appeal to Lukashenko
this week to liberalize the election process by allowing opposition
access to state-controlled news media and to election oversight. So
far Lukashenko has refused to do both.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of responding to his critics, Lukashenko flew to Moscow
this week to meet President Vladimir Putin of Russia and the other
leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States in their first
summit meeting since Putin's election in March. In the Russian
capital, where Lukashenko signed a treaty of union between Russia
and Belarus in December that will merge the two countries'
currencies and foster military coordination, the Belarussian leader
indulged in his favorite sport of baiting NATO and the West, which
he said feared a ``strong competitor'' on the territory of the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, he said, ``Belarus will do all it can to speed
up integration with Russia rather than slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Belarus,'' he said, ``will not turn away from our Russia _
there is no other great nation in the world _ I mean the Soviet
entity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Minsk, as the European delegation arrived for meetings with
political leaders, two prominent opposition members were sentenced
in court for political offenses related to their protest
activities. In the past year, several of Lukashenko's opponents
have been arrested, fled the country or disappeared under
suspicious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Marinus Wiersma, president of the European Parliament's
committee for relations with Belarus, that meetings with Lukashenko
and his aides had yielded little sign that they had made any
concessions in the talks on elections. In a pre-emptory move,
Lukashenko sent 16 amendments to the electoral code of Belarus to
the current Parliament, whose legitimacy is in question, but none
of the amendments give the opposition a role in the electoral
process.

DEEP RIFT SEPARATES CONQUERERS OF HUMAN GENE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS AND RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday the competing factions in the race to map the human
genome will come together in Washington, in a rare moment of
comity, to announce their completion of a ``rough draft'' readout
of all the human genes, a monumental scientific achievement that
promises to open a new era in medicine and a deeper understanding
of human life.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the smiles, handshakes and lofty rhetoric will remain
a deep rift.
</P>
<P>
   Both efforts, the federal government's massive Human Genome
Project and aggressive biotech startup, Celera Genomics Inc., want
to publish their work in an eminent research journal, Science _ the
gold standard of scientific acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   But the journal's editors have that they won't allow Celera to
publish unless the company agrees to release its data on a free
government website, called GenBank, where all the Human Genome
Project's data already resides.
</P>
<P>
   Celera, a Wall Street darling that has in some eyes made the
genome research effort a race by its rapid gene decoding, insists
its data be kept on its private website, according to scientists
close to the Rockville, Md. company. The raw data would be free to
researchers but would also allow Celera to attract potential
customers willing to pay for various pre-packaged forms of the
complex genomic code. One day, Celera says it hopes to sell
personal genetic disease tests over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Celera also worries that if its data goes on GenBank,
competitors will snatch and sell it, depriving the firm of profits
on its investment _ said to be hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two sides reportedly have forged a detente enabling
the Monday's joint appearance, the divisive publication issues were
unresolved Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No agreement has been reached yet with respect to publication
in Science,'' said a scientist familiar with the behind-the-scenes
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   One motivation for the new truce is to restore some dignity to
the genome project, which the federal government began 13 years
ago. Celera jumped into the project less than two years ago, saying
its high risk-high payoff sequencing strategy would leave the
public effort in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Several attempts at collaboration over the past few months
failed as meetings broke down amid bickering and name-calling. So
much has been made of the rivalry that scientists on both sides
worry that the public feels ``that the genomic revolution is being
left to people who can't even act civilly in public,'' said one
scientist who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest source of conflict has been Celera's determination
to withhold for a time its gene sequence data from public view, so
that its subscribers can search it for patentable genes.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves Celera's chief, former government scientist Craig
Venter, with a difficult choice: agree to Science's terms and gain
scientific legitimacy but perhaps hurt his company; or forego
publication and risk missing out on scientific immortality and a
possible Nobel prize.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kennedy, the editor of Science, said Thursday, ``We're
not active negotiators. We're very hopeful that the parties will
reach an agreement on publishing the data.''
</P>
<P>
   The original timetable for the human genome project called for
completion by 2005. Once Celera declared its intention to beat the
federal effort, that timetable shortened by at least two years.
Last January, Celera said it had decoded 90 percent of the genome.
</P>
<P>
   Government scientists point out that a large fraction of
Celera's sequence is based on public data from GenBank, whereas the
Genome Project has no access to Celera's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Celera did not return repeated calls for comment. But they
reiterated to concerned money managers, who follow Celera's
high-flying but volatile stock, that they would not relent on
demands to put their data on GenBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it clear that they firmly want to have data
available only on Celera's website,'' said Winton G. Gibbons, an
analyst with Chicago-based William Blair &AMP; Co. who spoke with
Celera officials. ``The company wants to maintain control of their
intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, five large pharmaceutical companies have paid Venter's
company for a genome subscription. But a looming problem, from a
business standpoint, is the Humane Genome Project's
ever-accelerating effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their competitive window is on the order of 5 months. They'll
need to sell their database in that window, because it will be a
rapidly wasting asset by 2001,'' said a scientist working on the
government's project.

VOTER REGISTRATION CONFUSION COULD MAR WEEKEND ZIMBABWE ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Overshadowed by the political violence that
has dogged this country for months, large-scale problems with
registration of voters remain unresolved and could lead to
significant confusion when voters arrive at the polls this weekend,
election monitors say.
</P>
<P>
   More than two million people registered to vote for the first
time in this year's election, swelling the national rolls to nearly
6 million, but inexplicably many newcomers' names have not made it
onto the books, the monitors say.
</P>
<P>
   While the central government has acknowledged the problem,
exactly what is being done to correct it is unclear, the monitors
say. They fear that many voters will only discover they are not
registered when they show up at polling stations.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the matter, voters were not given receipts when
they registered, as was done in the past, leaving them no recourse
if they discover on election day that their names were omitted.
</P>
<P>
   But adding voters to the rolls has not been the only
registration problem. Removing them has been similarly troublesome.
A study earlier this year by the U.N. Development Program found
that anywhere from 10 percent to 25 percent of the people
registered to vote were dead but remained on the rolls, raising the
possibility of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, the process was handled in a very unfortunate
way,'' said Phil Matsheza, chairman of the Zimbabwe Election
Support Network, an umbrella organization of civic groups involved
in election monitoring. ``These things will definitely affect the
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many unanswered, unresolved questions, voters here might
think that the problems are the result of something more than
benign neglect, Matsheza said. ``You want people to believe there's
transparency in an electoral process,'' he said. ``But we're all
going into the election with one question. Why? Why has the
government handled it this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Moyo, a spokesman for President Robert Mugabe's ruling
party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, said
the concerns that have been raised are unfounded, fueled by biased
Western international observers who favor the opposition and have
turned their jobs into a ``partisan exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't invite them,'' Moyo said. ``They expressed an
interest and we said fine, but they are getting carried away,
acting like we are East Timor or Somalia with no constitution and a
breakdown in the social order.''
</P>
<P>
   With the country's economy suffering and many of its people
weary of the old guard, the ruling party and its leader, President
Robert Mugabe, are facing their first bona fide political challenge
in the 20 years since they took control of this former British
colony. A new opposition party has drawn widespread support, and
the ensuing struggle between them has been ugly, and often bloody.
</P>
<P>
   The fight to lead the country has drawn considerable
international attention, and the way the government has handled
independent election monitoring has been another source of a
concern in recent days, as both local and international observers
have faced new limitations and considerable scrutiny by the central
government.
</P>
<P>
   The most restrictive step would have prohibited civic groups
from assigning more than one observer to a polling station. The
organizations, which had been planning to send four observers to
each site, complained that the strain for one monitor to shoulder
the responsibility alone during two, 12-hour days of voting would
undermine the effort. On Thursday, in a sharp turnabout, the
government said it would ease the policy.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola plans to add domestic partner health coverage
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. will be joining a growing number of
companies that provide health care benefits to same-sex domestic
partners of its employees.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, affecting all U.S. workers, will take effect
Jan. 1, the company announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola is ``currently researching its opportunities for
implementing this policy'' for employees outside the United States,
the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based beverage giant is the 99th company on the
Fortune 500 list to offer such benefits, said Kim Mills, education
director of the Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest gay
and lesbian political organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news,'' Mills said. ``We had been working with
people at Coca-Cola for some time on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke President Jack Stahl said the company ``is committed to
attracting and retaining the most diverse work force in the world.
... Today's announcement is another step toward achieving that
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 1990s, Mills said she was aware of only
about two dozen employers that offered domestic partner health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we know of more than 3,400 employers,'' she said. So
far this year, Mills added, about five employers per week have
announced new coverage for domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said the cost for employers is ``minimal'' because
enrollments in plans generally increase by only 1 percent.

 &HT;    WestPoint Stevens expands Lauren deal
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WestPoint Stevens has expanded a deal with Polo Ralph
Lauren Corp. to make more designer label goods for the licensing
giant.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next year, the West Point-based sheet and towel maker
will produce Ralph Lauren bed pillows, mattress pads, feather beds,
down comforters and blankets. WestPoint Stevens already has an
exclusive license for Ralph Lauren sheets and towels. That license
was renewed, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded, five-year deal will add $90 million to $100
million to WestPoint Stevens' annual revenue in 2002, said Lorraine
Miller, the manufacturer's new senior vice president of investor
relations. WestPoint Stevens expects to receive about half that
amount next year because the new license starts in July of 2001,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   WestPoint Stevens will take over the bedding license from rival
Pillowtex Corp. Dallas-based Pillowtex will continue to manufacture
and distribute the products until June 30, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, analysts have trimmed second-quarter earnings
estimates for WestPoint Stevens and other textile makers. Analysts
expect demand for towels and sheets to taper off a bit with the
slowdown in the housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said they expect sales at Springs Industries,
the largest U.S. home textiles producer, to fall short of Wall
Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And at least five analysts cut their estimates for WestPoint
Stevens this week. First Union cut its estimate by a nickel to 33
cents a share. Goldman Sachs decreased its estimate by 2 cents to
35 cents a share. WestPoint Stevens is expected to earn 36 cents a
share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   WestPoint Stevens is rebounding from a derailed plan to go
private. In late March, Chairman and Chief Executive Holcombe Green
Jr. led a buyout team that offered $22 a share for the company
shares they didn't already own. But the buyout plan collapsed when
rising interest rates prompted an investor to pull out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The company is expected to release a new operating plan next
week when it holds its annual stockholder meeting in Buckhead.
Analysts and investors have been frustrated in recent months with
WestPoint Stevens' secrecy as it worked out its leveraged buyout
plan.
</P>
<P>
   WestPoint Stevens' stock has lost half its value this year and
hit a 52-week low of $8.38 on Wednesday. The shares closed Thursday
at $8.81, down 19 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

 &HT;    'That girl' earning respect
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shawna Robinson can tell how much respect she has
earned since the beginning of the season by listening to the
headsets during her ARCA races.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 35, is trying to become the first woman to complete a
full schedule in a national stock-car racing series. She drives the
No. 8 Ford of Michael Kranefuss and Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   ARCA is a minor-league circuit, ranked just behind the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series. But the ARCA cars are considered to be more
similar to Winston Cup rides _ same weight, same engine _ than even
those on the Busch circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Daytona, the spotters would be telling their drivers `that
girl' was coming up on them,'' Robinson said. ``After they saw how
seriously everybody is taking this and how competitive our whole
team is, they started accepting all of us more, me and the guys as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we showed up at the first short track and gave it
everything we had, I think the respect value rose some,'' she said.
``I know this much: Now the spotters usually say, `That Kmart car'
is coming up on them, instead of `that girl.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Racing is nothing new to Robinson. She drove in the Busch Series
part-time from 1991-1995 and was the first woman to win a pole, in
1994 at Atlanta. She also finished 23rd in the Busch points
standings in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson left motorsports for four years to start a family and
build a business as an interior decorator. She got back behind the
wheel at the end of last season and will quit if she does not make
it to Winston Cup within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Through eight of the 21 races on the ARCA standings, Robinson
has four top-10 finishes and ranks fifth in the points. The mother
of two won the pole at Michigan two weeks ago. She will race
tonight in the event in Toledo, Ohio, and Saturday in DeGraff,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once that engine cranks, you don't know if it's a guy or girl
behind the wheel of the car, and it really doesn't matter,''
Mayfield, a Winston Cup driver, said. ``I think Shawna has a lot of
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she is going to run Winston Cup someday, these are the
types of cars she is going to have to push around the race
tracks,'' he said. ``I'd put her up against just about anybody in
ARCA and up against most in Busch. She probably has some Winston
Cup guys beat, too.''

TOYOTA MR2 SPYDER: A CLOTHING-OPTIONAL SPORTS CAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By DAN NEIL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To drive the new Toyota MR2 Spyder is to appreciate the Mazda
MX-5 Miata all over again. For more than a decade, an eternity for
a sports car, the plucky little Mazda roadster has defined the
road-going romantic idyll. The Miata is small, intimate even, with
a trunk that can handle a couple's bags for a romantic weekend
getaway. Leave the golf clubs at home; you're going no farther than
the hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   The Miata is also a terrific little open-top sports car, with
whip-smart handling, excellent balance and rorty, eager power. For
a generation of older-but-wiser fans of British sports cars, the
affordable Miata delivered all the windblown pleasures of the old
MG's and Triumphs without the fear of being becalmed by mechanical
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the Toyota MR2 Spyder, another overachieving,
underpriced small sports car intended to win over Miata lovers;
but, alas, even in Virginia, the MR2 is not for lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its midengine design _ the motor is situated behind
the seats and slightly ahead of the rear axle _ the MR2 has no
trunk. Storage is limited to a plastic bin behind the seats (you
have to move the seats to get to it) about the size of a viola
case, plus a smaller-than-a-breadbox space in the nose, next to the
spare tire. Thus, a simple trip to the supermarket becomes an
exercise in Solomonic reasoning: Who gets to sit in the passenger
seat, your spouse or the groceries? As for the cozy weekend
getaway, unless you are heading for a nudists' retreat, forget it.
Carry-on bags are not permitted; nor can you check your luggage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the MR2 has a strangely feral feel, as a car that
must be enjoyed alone _ quite a contrast to the congenial Miata.
Toyota could answer quite reasonably that utility was never part of
the car's mission statement. Yet after a week in the MR2, this
seems a miscalculation. A car with no storage is merely a toy, and
toys, as the Plymouth Prowler proves, become boring.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers, the MR2 and Miata are strikingly similar. The
MR2's length (153 inches) is a couple of inches shorter than the
Miata, though the MR2 is slightly wider and taller. The MR2 is
about 100 pounds lighter than the Miata, which can be loaded with
luxury options not available in the MR2. Both cars are powered by
1.8-liter aluminum engines, though the MR2's variable valve timing
gives it the edge in usable torque (125 pounds-feet at 4,400 rpm,
vs. the Miata's 117 pounds-feet at 5,000 rpm).
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the MR2 seems oddly derivative. The top
latches appear to have been purchased by the same supplier who
sells the parts to Mazda. Imitation is the sincerest form of
flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, however, the two cars come from very different
sides of the drafting table. Compared with the Miata, with its
lozenge-like curves, the MR2 is crisply geometric, with slab sides
punctuated by scalloped air ducts and an anthropomorphic face
reminiscent of Mike Mulligan's steam shovel _ all grin and bright
eyes. The rear of the car features a long louvered decklid and
prominent taillights above a Ferrari-like rear grille. From this
angle, the current Spyder has more in common with the
first-generation MR2 of the late 1980s _ itself a riff on the old
Fiat X1/9 _ than its immediate forebear, a sort of Mini-Me
Testarossa.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Miata, whose top folds down with the inside panel
exposed to the elements, the MR2's top folds in a Z pattern,
leaving the canvas top clamped down behind the seats and minimizing
the need for the tonneau cover.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the MR2 is well organized and comfortable, with simply
superb bolstered buckets that you may be tempted to unbolt and
install in your living room. The bluff and upright dash keeps the
climate and audio controls well sorted; handsome materials, like
brushed aluminum and dimpled vinyl on the steering wheel, dash and
door pulls, a serenely technical feel.
</P>
<P>
   The Achilles' heel in any midengine car is packaging, since the
engine takes up so much prime real estate in close proximity to the
driver. Yet the MR2's engine seems isolated from the cabin. It
makes its presence known under hard acceleration, as it should,
with a hoarse, mechanical burr; but in the putter of city streets
it remains pleasantly sotto voce. Legroom is ample for a small
midengine car (compared with the cruelties of the X1/9, for
instance), allowing you to move the seat up for a few degrees of
seat-back rake. Credit the MR2's expansive wheelbase of 96.5
inches, which sets the wheels in the far precincts of the fenders.
</P>
<P>
   Considering its myriad packaging problems, why bother with a
midengine design, anyway? Because placing the engine near the
center of the car allows the vehicle to turn more quickly,
pirouetting around a vertical axis like a skater with her arms
drawn in tight. For pure performance, nothing beats a lightweight,
midengine, rear-drive car _ as a glance at the grid of the Indy 500
will tell you.
</P>
<P>
   And the MR2's performance is sparkling, lively, alert and well
composed, transitioning evenly from one sliding corner to another.
The car's rack-and-pinion steering answers instantly to command,
and the sensations from the tires feed up through the wheel so you
intuitively know what each wheel is doing at all times. Considering
how much steel is in the car's unit body, the MR2 is remarkably
light (about 2,200 pounds unloaded), so the suspension and tires
needn't battle high inertia loads pitching from side to side. The
independent suspension (struts and springs with control links) is
supple but firm, giving up a few inches of body lean in corners
before stiffening in a muscular, shoulder-down stance.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota wisely chose to put 15-inch radials on the car. Bigger
tires might have given the car more overall grip (and filled in
what appears to be overly generous wheel wells), but the ride would
have suffered without really improving the car's fun quotient.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the MR2's toggle-like gearshift, well-placed pedals
and hearty antilock brakes all make it a wildly amusing car to
drive. The MR2 dances and darts like an aerobatic kite in a stiff
spring breeze.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves the MR2 in a virtual dead heat with the
Miata in general joie de vivre. So why would anyone choose the MR2
over a gold-plated classic with a trunk? Cheap exclusivity, for one
thing. There are about a quarter-million Miatas running around the
United States. The MR2 will be sold in limited numbers, only 5,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   So if you buy an MR2, you will definitely turn some heads. And
you will have bought a car with the fit and finish of a Toyota, the
oaken solidity of a car costing thousands more. If only it didn't
make you feel so lonely. &QL;

FOR A BRAZILIAN BANKER, THE HIGHEST PERCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By SIMON ROMERO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ There are the investment bankers who talk of
things like deficit figures and inflation targets when discussing
Brazil, Latin America's largest economy. Then there are the
bankers, like Francisco Gros, who talk of Piggy.
</P>
<P>
   As a high-ranking executive at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Gros
wrote in an online newsletter late last year that ``we Brazilians
suffer from what could be called `Piggy' syndrome _ we believe
ourselves to be wonderful, while others, unfortunately, do not see
us quite that way.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of Brazil's leading figures on Wall Street, Gros
developed a reputation for talking tough. Now, however, he is
toning down his approach after being named in February to one of
the most coveted posts in Brazil's government, the presidency of
the country's powerful development bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that stuff doesn't come back to haunt me,'' said Gros,
who is 57.
</P>
<P>
   He probably does not have much to worry about, given his
reputation as a consummate insider among the coterie of Ivy
League-educated economists, bankers and academics who have run
Brazil for much of the past decade. But many other Brazilians
question whether their interests are best served by a group of
bankers bent on globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Among this worldly group of financiers, perhaps none are
worldlier than Gros. The son of a French diplomat, he grew up on
three continents, in Brazil, France and the United States, and
attended Princeton as an undergraduate. After graduate school in
economics at Columbia, he returned to Brazil and began a career in
the high-flying financial circles of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he began playing the game of musical chairs that is
familiar in Brazil, in which leading figures from the private
sector accept high-profile jobs in government, then return to the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Between stints as an executive at Unibanco, one of Brazil's
largest banks, and as president of Aracruz Celulose SA, a large
manufacturer of eucalyptus pulp used in paper products, Gros served
twice as president of the country's central bank. He was also a
partner in a small investment bank, Banco BFC SA.
</P>
<P>
   After his last term at the central bank, which ended in 1992, he
returned to the private sector. He joined Morgan Stanley as its
chairman for Latin America, helping to build the institution into a
leading investment banking presence in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Jetting between his homes in New York and Rio, Gros became a
fixture on network television, discussing the direction of the
world's ninth-largest economy, his candid assessment of Brazil's
challenges making him a favorite among journalists.
</P>
<P>
   So few people were surprised by his appointment by President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso to head the National Bank for Economic
and Social Development, a secretive institution that rivals
international lending organizations like the World Bank in its
size. It is known as the BNDES, its initials in Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Banco do Brasil SA, another institution
controlled by the government that focuses more on consumer banking,
the development bank is probably the most powerful financial
institution in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a banker's dream to run the BNDES,'' said Edmar Bacha, a
former president of the development bank who now heads the New York
office of Banco BBA-Creditanstalt. ``It is the only domestic
provider of long-term capital and its size makes it one of the most
powerful institutions, financial or otherwise, in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank has the largest lending budget of any Brazilian bank,
at nearly 20 billion reais, or about $11 billion. During the
Cardoso administration, which began in 1995, a five-fold increase
in its government support transformed the bank from a financier of
infrastructure projects into the main arm of economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   As Brazil opened its economy to foreign investment and
competition, the bank was there at every step. The bank guided the
world's largest privatization program in the 1990s, selling some
$90 billion of state assets. Often, this role put it in touch with
the world's leading investment banks, which competed to handle the
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gros' tutelage, Morgan Stanley won one such contract,
serving as co-manager with Salomon Smith Barney for the $21 billion
privatization of Brazil's telecommunications monopoly in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Through its investment banking unit, modeled on the
International Finance Corp., a subsidiary of the World Bank, it
financed many of these takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   The free-wheeling use of its funds, which it provided to
companies regardless of their national origin, has been a major
source of criticism by opponents to the government's privatization
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why a public institution in a poor country like
Brazil is providing money to foreign companies that have cheap
access to borrowing overseas,'' said Aloizio Mercadante, a Sao
Paulo congressman from the Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the bank's big role in guiding policy, Gros will have
to mitigate the tension resulting from a government seeking to
rapidly modernize the economy and an opposition questioning whether
Brazil is bending too far in its rush to globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is at a stage in which it needs something more than
people who see the country as a balance sheet,'' said Clovis Rossi,
a columnist for Folha de Sao Paulo, Brazil's most widely read
newspaper. ``It may be that neo-nationalists don't help the economy
to grow further, but a collection of bankers does not seem to be
the best alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Gros is not alone among high-ranking officials in
having a background in international finance. The central bank
president, Arminio Fraga, a close friend, is a former hedge fund
manager for George Soros. Another former banker, Development
Minister Alcides Tapias, is Gros' immediate superior.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gros' tutelage, the bank is seeking to temper its worldly
investing approach with a renewed emphasis on lending to small and
medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a cosmopolitan bunch but that alone is not enough,''
Gros said. ``Accepting the inevitability of an open economy and
preparing Brazil for a growing global role are the challenges
ahead.''

 &HT;    Miller's workout impresses Hawks
 &HT;    By John Hollis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mike Miller knows a thing or two about getting things
turned around in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   He played a big part in putting the Florida Gators back on the
college basketball map over the past two seasons. Now, Miller could
be the man the Hawks select to pace what it hopes is a similar
reformation, with its sixth overall pick in Wednesday's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like we did at the University of Florida,'' said Miller,
referring to the Gators' Sweet 16 and Final Four berths during his
two-year stay in Gainesville. ``We had a young team come in and we
did a lot of special things there. I think that this organization _
from the front office to the players _ that's what they want to do
here, and I think that would be fun to be part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 6 feet 8, 218 pounds, was the most impressive of three
potential first-round draftees in a 90-minute workout before Hawks
officials at the Philips Arena practice courts Thursday morning.
Former Cincinnati guard DerMarr Johnson (6-9, 200), back for his
second workout, and former Oklahoma State forward Desmond Mason
(6-5, 215) both played well. But Miller stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the workout went well,'' said Miller, who last season
led Florida in scoring (14.1), minutes (28.6), free throws (124)
and free-throw attempts (170). ``We've been to enough teams where
it's all starting to be repetition. `` Miller already had worked
out for the Orlando Magic, Houston Rockets and Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials were impressed with Miller's overall
understanding of the game, athleticism and all-around skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very, very talented, . . . very, very fluid,'' general
manager Pete Babcock said. ``He shoots the ball so easily with deep
range. It's like a 15-foot jump shot from 3-point range. Not
everybody can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hawks coach Lon Kruger knows Miller's game, after watching
him get 19 points and nine rebounds to power Florida past his
Illinois team in this year's NCAA Tournament second-round matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's workout did nothing to change Kruger's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was going to work hard,'' the coach said. ``We knew
he was going to shoot well, and we knew he was going compete like
crazy _ all good stuff and he did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason played well, even though his luggage did not arrive on his
flight Wednesday. The new basketball shoes he wore during the
morning's workout were courtesy of the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks probably will conclude their pre-draft workouts today
with guards Courtney Alexander (Fresno State) and Justin Love (St.
Louis), and swingmen Lavor Postell (St. John's) and Quentin
Richardson (DePaul).

FOSSIL DISCOVERY THREATENS THEORY OF BIRDS' EVOLUTION

 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have discovered fossil evidence of the oldest known
feathered animal, a small reptile that probably glided among the
trees 75 million years before the earliest known bird, and they say
this challenges the widely held theory that birds evolved from
dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   The animal, Longisquama insignis, lived in Central Asia 220
million years ago, not long after the time of the first dinosaurs.
It had four legs and what appeared to be feathers on its body. From
impressions left in stone, its elongated back appendages had hollow
shafts and other characteristics closely resembling those of
feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can identify certain structures in these fossils that you
only find in feathers,'' said Terry D. Jones, a member of the
discovery team and the lead author of a report being published
Friday in the journal Science. ``So we're quite sure we're looking
at the earliest feather.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this, the oldest feather belonged to Archaeopteryx,
also recognized as the earliest bird. Archaeopteryx lived about 145
million years ago, and its fossils were found in Germany in the
19th century. Scientists who analyzed the Longisquama fossils said
the animal had a wishbone virtually identical to Archaeopteryx and
similar to modern birds.
</P>
<P>
   In the cautiously worded report of the new findings, the
scientists referred to the feathers as nonavian _ that is, not
related to birds _ and said, ``The exact relationship of
Longisquama to birds is uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews and a news release by Oregon State University
in Corvallis, one of several universities from which researchers
were drawn, members of the discovery team threw down the gauntlet
in their dispute with other paleontologists who favor a direct
evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds.
</P>
<P>
   While the new fossil evidence does not conclusively establish
that Longisquama was an ancestor of flying birds, John A. Ruben of
Oregon State said it would have lived in the right time and had the
right physical structure to have been an ancestor _ and it was
clearly not a dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he and other scientists noted, the advanced
development of the newly discovered feathers suggested that feather
evolution extended back much earlier, probably before the first
dinosaurs appeared on the scene about 240 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists have long agreed that birds evolved from
reptiles. Archaeopteryx itself is a blend of saurian and avian
traits. But were the bird ancestors dinosaurs or another reptilian
lineage? Beginning with research by John Ostrom of Yale University
in the 1970s, evidence seemed to favor a dinosaurian heritage,
though a few scientists, Ruben among them, held out against the
emerging orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Storrs Olson, an ornithologist at the Smithsonian Institution
who was not on the discovery team but has been skeptical of the
dinosaur-bird theory, agreed with the interpretation of the fossils
and the implications for understanding bird evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``These extraordinary structures really can be only feathers,''
Olson said. ``It's extremely important, more important than the
discovery of Archaeopteryx.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark A. Norell, a paleontologist at the American Museum of
Natural History in New York, and a leading exponent of a
dinosaurian ancestry of birds, said he was not ready to concede
that the fossil impressions are of true feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if these turn out to be feathers, they have not
established that Longisquama is ancestral to modern birds,'' Norell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery ruffling paleontology's feathers was made by
scientists from the University of Kansas, the Russian Academy of
Sciences, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the City
University of New York, the College of Charleston, Sonoma State
University in California, in addition to Oregon State. Jones, who
participated in the research as a graduate student at Oregon State,
is now on the faculty of Stephen F. Austin State University in
Nacogdoches, Texas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The fossils in question were excavated in 1969 in Kyrgyzstan, a
former Soviet republic. When the impressions now said to be
feathers were first identified as reptilian scales, the specimen
was put away in a drawer in Moscow and ignored. But they were
retrieved and displayed as part of a touring exhibit of Russian
fossils last year. Seeing them, Jones and Ruben said they realized
immediately that this was a very old animal with feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Other paleontologists and ornithologists were called in for a
look. Alan Feduccia of the University of North Carolina, author of
``The Origin and Evolution of Birds'' (Yale University Press), was
struck by the hollow shaft covered by a sheath, a characteristic of
bird feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dramatic finding,'' Feduccia said. ``Everything
about the feather points to aerodynamic structure, indicating that
the initial function of feathers was in an aerodynamic context.''
</P>
<P>
   A point of contention in the dinosaur-bird debate centers on the
initial function of feathers. Dinosaur partisans argue that when
some dinosaurs became warmblooded they developed down as insulation
and this led to feathers, which then gave them the ability to fly.
Their opponents contend that in some coldblooded reptiles feathers
evolved from their scales and were adapted originally for flight.
</P>
<P>
   From an examination of the Longisquama skeleton, scientists
inferred that its body feathers would have been adequate for
gliding but its musculature would not have supported powered
flight. Given more time, though, the muscles could have developed
and the feathers could have spread to the forearms, creating wings,
the discovery team suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``A point that too many people always ignored is that the most
birdlike of the dinosaurs, such as Bambiraptor and Velociraptor,
lived 70 million years after the earliest bird, Archaeopteryx,''
Ruben said in a university statement. ``So you have birds flying
before the evolution of the first birdlike dinosaurs. We now
question very strongly whether there were any feathered dinosaurs
at all.''

 &HT;    Gay rights group pressures nine firms
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia Equality Project is pressuring nine major
Georgia companies to provide gay and lesbian workers with the same
health care and other benefits offered to married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The gay and lesbian rights group plans to ask participants at
this weekend's Lesbian and Gay Pride celebration to write letters
and call the chief executives of the targeted companies. The group
won't call a boycott now, but its leaders say they have not ruled
it out.
</P>
<P>
   The nine companies are Home Depot, Atlanta Gas Light, BellSouth,
Georgia Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Wachovia, United Parcel Service,
Shaw Industries and GulfStream Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to take whatever action is necessary,'' said
Harry Knox, executive director of the Atlanta-based organization.
The group sent letters to the heads of the companies June 12 but
has not heard from any of them, Knox said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies on the GEP list said Thursday that they
are considering domestic partner benefits. None of eight companies
contacted said they would refuse to consider them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize this is an emerging issue,'' said Ken Haldin, a
spokesman for Georgia-Pacific Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for AGL Resources, parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co.,
said the issue is ``very important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we're looking at,'' said AGL spokesman Nick
Gold. ``We have to determine whether it's feasible and how many of
our 2,200 employees would be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex partners lose $2,000 to $3,000 a year in benefits that
are given to straight couples, Knox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an issue of equal work for equal pay,'' Knox said.
``My partner and I have taken on all the financial responsibilities
of being married and yet we don't get any of the benefits. These
are companies that self-insure and could offer domestic partners
benefits. The cost to employers is inconsequential.''

   Knox estimates there are 500,000 lesbians and gay men in metro
Atlanta and north Georgia _ more than the region's United
Methodists. GEP, formed in 1995 as an advocacy group, has about
1,500 members statewide and a database of more than 10,000
individuals, Knox said.
</P>
<P>
   The group's campaign comes on the heels of Coca-Cola's
announcement Thursday that it will offer domestic partner benefits.
Coke initially was among the companies GEP targeted, Knox said.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic partner benefits has been a controversial issue for a
decade, said Ken McDonnell, a research analyst with the Employee
Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit nonpartisan think tank in
Washington. About 3,000 U.S. companies and government agencies
offer the benefit, according to the Human Rights Campaign Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But fewer people than expected use the benefit. In fact,
unmarried heterosexuals are more inclined than gay couples to use
the benefit to cover partners, a recent survey by Hewitt Associates
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't cost a company any more to cover a domestic partner
than a legal spouse,'' McDonnell said.
</P>
<P>
   But it does cost gay couples, because they pay income taxes on
the value of the partner benefit. Married couples don't pay taxes
on coverage for spouses and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a low cost benefit (for companies),'' McDonnell said.
``If we look at the example of Coke, the company wants to
demonstrate that they value diversity among their work force.
Domestic partner benefit is an excellent tool to communicate that.
It makes good PR and it's cheap to do.''

GROUP TO PLUMB THE MEANING OF `WHITENESS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Paul Marcus likes to describe his early years in
working class East Hartford, Conn. as a ``life of privilege'':
During the summers, he spent the days hauling heavy boxes of
produce onto a massive truck, and the nights with his family in the
stuffy top floor of a triple decker.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this simple existence, he explains now, he had great
advantages. If his father had not risen to the top of an all-white
union, he might not have had any job at all. And if his family had
not been white, he said, he probably would have lived an even
humbler house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear to me now, even though I had a working-class
background, that I had benefits,'' said Marcus, now 47. ``We often
think privilege is only for the rich people but all whites have
some privileges because of the color of their skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus is one of the organizers of a controversial conference
being held Friday at Simmons College on ``whiteness.'' The unusual
topic, expected to draw some 100 liberal activists, religious
leaders and academics, is another sign that what was once a fringe
academic pursuit _ called ``white studies'' _ is gaining followers.
</P>
<P>
   In just the last few years, estimated those in the field, some
200 books have been written on ``whiteness.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind white studies, explained conference organizers,
is to dismantle racism by focusing on white culture, and the
privileges that come with it. Race relations, they insist, should
no longer just be a topic for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the conference, the second in Boston, is to help
whites and ``those who work with them'' to embrace white culture
while abandoning their privileges, said Marcus. Many whites, he
explained, see themselves as having no race at all _ that to be
white is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many whites that are blind to everyday realities
and racism,'' said Marcus. ``We are saying as whites we don't even
see ourselves as racialized.''
</P>
<P>
   But even supporters caution that the so-called whiteness
movement, which focuses on ``white culture,'' could provide
ammunition for white supremecist groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to study what whiteness is all about,'' said Chip
Berlay, who heads the Political Research Associates. ``But my main
concern is that there is another whiteness movement _ the white
supremist.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus worries that poor whites, who often are forced to compete
for jobs with other groups, are now the ones being labeled racist,
while white middle- and upper-class Americans, who historically
have enjoyed the best treatment, are let off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hear that South Boston is racist but you never hear
anything about Wellesley or the other surburbs,'' said Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   One of the highlights of the conference, said Marion Groot,
co-director of the Women's Theology Center, will be a tour of
Boston's neighborhoods, with tour guides like Rep. Byron Rushing on
hand to explain how white privilege and power throughout history
changed the neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, if you were to take the South End and look at the
people who lived here and then look at what has been the
demographic over time _ what you see is that people get displaced
based own their lack of economic access,'' said Groot.
</P>
<P>
   A walk through Faneuil Hall where dozens of paintings of past
white leaders in Boston hang on the walls, will also be a clear and
powerful snapshot of white dominance, said Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   That dominance has brought a windfall, argues Randall Robinson,
who rekindled the idea that black Americans should be paid
trillions in reparations with his book ``The Debt: What America
owes Blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   And as whites make up a smaller percentage of the population,
more and more of them will be forced to confront their past, said
Edward Ball, author of the nationally-acclaimed ``Slaves in the
Family,'' the story of his own family's slave-owning roots.
</P>
<P>
   Groot said the conference is an attempt to show whites that they
are a part of the country's racial dynamic. But ``white studies''
also tries to analyze white culture, in the same way that
anthropoligists might examine the common language, art, and
traditions of a far away tribe.
</P>
<P>
   As the world globalizes, Groot added, it will force a change of
attitude: ``I personally think that what is happening is that
whites can no longer assume ...that the majority of the world
population thinks just the way white people think.''

CHINA UNICOM STOCK SOARS 9 PERCENT IN HONG KONG DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a sign that China is again drawing the ardor of
foreign investors, the value of shares in the country's
second-largest telephone company soared nearly 9 percent on their
first day of trading here Thursday, even as the rest of the Hong
Kong market slumped.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price of the company, China Unicom Ltd., rose 8.9
percent, to 16.80 Hong Kong dollars, or $2.16. That followed a 12
percent jump on Wednesday in the company's first day of trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most heavily traded
stock.
</P>
<P>
   China Unicom's performance did not surprise analysts, who had
forecast a sparkling debut since the company expanded the size of
its offering to nearly $5 billion last week. Indeed, executives
close to China Unicom seemed mildly disappointed that the first-day
gain here did not match that in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Given the dowdy reputation that China Unicom once had, however,
the company has made a remarkable transformation. Its stock
offering was the largest ever in Asia outside Japan, eclipsing the
1997 offering of China Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the success reflects persistent marketing by Unicom's
executives and investment bankers. Even more reflects China's
image, which has improved since it signed deals with the United
States and Europe to enter the World Trade Organization, and won a
crucial trade vote in the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who follow this company know it from the bottom up,''
said Duncan Clark, a partner in BDA China Ltd., a consulting firm
in Beijing. ``But investors view it from the top down. They think,
`Gee, another cellular operator in the world's largest market,
which is about to enter the WTO.'''
</P>
<P>
   China Unicom's success augurs well for other Chinese state-owned
companies, which hope to enter the stock market later this year.
The nation's second-largest oil company, the China Petrochemical
Corp., plans to sell up to $5 billion in shares. Its prospects have
been brightened by a 40 percent rise in the value of the shares of
its rival, Petrochina Ltd., which went public in April.
</P>
<P>
   The improved prospects extend to smaller companies. Two Internet
start-ups, Netease and Sohu.com, are planning initial public
offerings later this year, after delays in the face of a hostile
market and skepticism about Chinese ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as in previous periods of euphoria over China stocks,
some analysts are urging caution. Investors bought into the first
wave of Chinese companies, known as ``red chips,'' in the
mid-1990s, only to find out that many were poorly managed and
cobbled together with shoddy assets.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the red chips, China Unicom is in a single line of
business, with cellular and paging franchises that have a
measurable value. The company also has indisputable growth
prospects. China's cellular market has more than tripled since
1997, to 43.2 million subscribers. With only 4.2 million customers
_ and franchises that cover 578 million people _ Unicom's horizon
is virtually limitless.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the company's future hinges on its treatment by
the Chinese government. Beijing granted Unicom several assets _
including the nation's largest paging company _ to dress it up for
the stock offering. But it must still compete against China Mobile,
which was spun off from the state telephone monopoly. China Mobile
is much larger and has stronger political connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, people are buying Unicom because it is in favor
with the government,'' said Douglas Hansen-Luke, the chief
executive of Asia Strategic, an investment research firm here.
``But that could change. It's a very dangerous reason to buy
equities.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, analysts said, investors will probably profit
by owning stock in one of only two major Chinese phone companies.
Clark said that having taken the first steps toward a more
competitive phone market in 1999, the Chinese government was
unlikely to shake things up further this year.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Beijing would probably issue the next generation of
mobile-phone licenses in 2001. There are several companies lining
up. One is China Netcom, a carrier owned by several state
ministries and backed by a son of China's president, Jiang Zemin.
Another is China Telecom, the former parent of China Mobile, which
owns the nation's dominant fixed-line network.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of its agreement to enter the WTO, China will
also allow foreigners to own 49 percent of telecommunications
companies within four years. That opens the door to well-financed
competitors like AT&AMP;T, the NTT Corp. of Japan, and Deutsche
Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen-Luke said investors in China Unicom could reap a windfall
if foreign companies chose to acquire stakes in domestic Chinese
operators rather than build their own networks. But Unicom's track
record in alliances is dismal: It spent several years and $1.6
billion unraveling a series of partnerships with foreign companies
that the Chinese government declared illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The more basic question is whether China Unicom _ with untested
management, uncertain ties in Beijing and an underdog position _
can compete in China's rapidly changing market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even an idiot can make money in a managed duopoly,'' Clark
said. ``But duopolies don't leave you in much of a position to
compete when the market opens.''

MARS HAS WATER, SCIENTISTS SAY, BUT IN UNUSUAL PLACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA scientists' announcement Thursday that they have discovered
traces of water flowing recently on Mars came wrapped in a
perplexing enigma: Water on Mars seems to crop up in all the wrong
places.
</P>
<P>
   The new images from the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft show
steep slopes that appear to reveal a layer of water just a few
hundred feet below the surface, contradicting theorists who had
been sure that any water would have to be at least 2 miles
underground.
</P>
<P>
   Even more puzzling, all the signs of water seeping from the
walls of canyons and craters seem to occur in the wrong parts of
the Martian surface, and to be flowing on slopes that face in
exactly the wrong direction. Instead of the sunniest, most tropical
slopes, where the sun's warmth might be expected to help melt
exposed ice, the seeping water and the channels it produces are all
more than 30 degrees from the equator, and on the poleward-facing
slopes where they are in perpetual cold shadow.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer unexpectedness of finding water in such places led
Kenneth Edgett, co-author of the new report to be published in
Science magazine next week, to say that ``I was dragged kicking and
screaming to (the) conclusion'' that the grooves and channels they
found must have been carved very recently by flows of running
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very much disturbed'' by the fact that the locations of
the features just don't seem to make sense, Edgett said.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Zuber, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology who specializes in Mars but was not
involved in this research, said in an interview Thursday that
``people are befuddled, because no one has thought about this. . .
. Nobody had thought about present-day (liquid) water on Mars, or
close to present day.''
</P>
<P>
   Any attempts to explain the location of these features so far,
Zuber said, amount to ``grasping at straws.''
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicable as the findings may be, they've sent a surge of
excitement through planetary researchers because water is the most
basic prerequisite for life. Michael Carr, a geologist with the US
Geological Survey who wrote a book called ``Water on Mars,'' said
the new findings are perhaps the most exciting since the first
images of river-like channels _ signs that water had flowed over
the planet in the distant past _ were sent from Mars in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The only explanation offered so far, by Edgett and Michael
Malin, the principal scientist of the Mars Global Surveyor camera
and lead author of the new report, is that in sunnier areas, any
ice that was present slowly vaporized over time, leaving not enough
in place to produce flowing water. But this doesn't explain what
source of heat eventually came along to melt the ice and produce
the steep channels seen in the new pictures.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the location of these gullies does make sense:
Many are grouped in regions that suggest large, underground
aquifers that could be the source of many individual outflows.
</P>
<P>
   And, if there are substantial aquifers present on Mars today,
that has profound implications for the future of Mars exploration.
On the one hand, they would provide the ideal setting in which to
conduct any searches for signs of microbial life on Mars. In
addition, they could provide a crucial resource for any future
human exploration of the planet, offering a source of drinking
water as well as an air supply and fuel for rockets and rovers when
the water is converted to oxygen and hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists find the evidence for liquid water compelling,
they emphasize that further work is needed and that it is possible
that someone may yet find an alternative explanation for the
features. One goal of the ongoing research is to take new pictures
of some of the same areas already examined, in hopes of finding
signs of recent changes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we see one that changes before our eyes, wow. We'll be
back'' to give another press conference, Edgett said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, scientists and amateurs alike can help in the
search for water. Some 27,500 pictures taken by the present
orbiting spacecraft have been posted on the Internet, but many have
gotten little more than a cursory look so far.
</P>
<P>
   So it is entirely possible, the scientists said, that the next
great breakthrough could come from some student or amateur
scientist studying the images at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on the science teams have not gotten close'' to being
able to scrutinize most of the images in any detail, Zuber said.
``It's going to be a treasure trove for a decade.''

&HT;     AT DAVIDIAN TRIAL, LAWYERS SPAR WITH VIDEOS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``A live witness? My goodness!'' U.S. District
Judge Walter Smith said Thursday after lawyers in the Branch
Davidian wrongful death suit against the federal government ended a
showing of videotaped depositions that ran for nearly five hours.
</P>
<P>
   The video witness, Joe Servel, an FBI agent who commanded a
Bradley tank during the 1993 Waco siege, remembered little and cast
only a slim light on the fatal events of April 19, when the home of
cult leader David Koresh and his followers burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh and 75 others died in the fire. Survivors and families of
the victims are seeking $675 million, saying the government agents
are responsible for the fiery end to the 51-day siege. The
government says the Davidians set the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI tank commander's testimony provided relief and human
touches to a courtroom so bored that Justice Department lawyer
Marie Hagen was nodding off to sleep, as The Day of the Dueling
Videos turned into the Day of the Drowsy.
</P>
<P>
   The lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, Mike Caddell, introduced
excerpts from a half-dozen videotaped depositions for the jury. In
lieu of cross-examination, federal attorney Mike Bradford, played
excerpts that were more to the government's liking.
</P>
<P>
   The videos left jurors and three dozen spectators _ half as many
as on Wednesday _ yawning.
</P>
<P>
   The video depositions were of a half-dozen men, including former
FBI Director William Sessions, who were government officials at the
time of the 1993 events near Waco. Caddell's aim was to show that
on April 19, the day of the fatal fire, the FBI brass did not
expect tanks to be used to penetrate and destroy parts of the
building, or even to enter it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the FBI officials, Danny Coulson of Arlington, Texas,
appeared in the video wearing a sport coat and open-neck shirt,
with mussed hair and bags under his eyes. He was squirming and
defensive as he spoke, sometimes drinking deeply from a white
Styrofoam cup filled with an iced beverage. Coulson looked more
like a suspect in an early morning precinct interrogation than a
law enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of halting and reluctant statements, Coulson told
his interrogators that he and a subordinate, Mike Kahoe, watched
the April tank-and-tear gas assault from a television monitor in an
FBI war room in Washington, D.C. When Kahoe first saw a tank
entering the building, crushing a wall as it went, he exclaimed
``Holy s---!'' Coulson said.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Coulson nor any of the others would flatly say that
the tank attacks were, as Caddell believes, in violation of the
orders or plan that Attorney General Janet Reno gave to field
commanders Jeff Jamar and Dick Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the final of several draft plans for the raid,
Caddell argued on the videotapes that no tank assaults should have
been made until efforts to flush out the Davidians with tear gas
had been under way for 48 hours. The assaults had begun within
minutes of the tear gas attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the rebuttal excerpts that federal lawyers chose to play, the
FBI executives defended Jamar and Rogers, saying such things as,
``any tactical plan does not presuppose that it can anticipate
anything that can occur.''

THE LATEST TREND: SELLING THE HOUSE, AT AUCTION

<P>
   IRVINGTON, N.Y. _ The auction was barely under way, but already,
Thomas and Gloria Fatato were feeling out of place in the
Tudor-style house they had built 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Strangers were nibbling on hors d'oeuvres and sipping on fume
blanc. A ponytailed musician teased out ``Puttin' on the Ritz'' and
``Cheek to Cheek'' on a Yamaha synthesizer. A veritable army of
auctioneers from the National Auction Group of Gadsden, Ala., all
wearing matching American-flag ties, were doing their officious
best to prod, prod, prod.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the bidding for the Fatatos' house stagnated at
$975,000, one of the guys with the American-flag ties, Jack Ogle,
rapped his knuckles on a glass shelf in the living room. In a
Southern drawl, he bellowed: ``That's opportunity knocking tonight
like it's never knocked before in this area!''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the modus operandi was not pitch-perfect for the
grizzled New York crowd. Still, for most people at the auction
earlier this month, this odd cocktail of one part culture clash,
one part high-stakes poker, was their first taste of a phenomenon
that has proliferated: the sale of houses and apartments at
auction.
</P>
<P>
   These slick events with the trappings of a wedding or a
fund-raiser are a far cry from the enduring image of a foreclosed
house being sold on the courthouse steps. Instead, the auctions
appeal to a faster-paced, time-pressed society accustomed to
speculating on art, stocks and everything else, in person or over
the Internet _ a society, in short, with an eBay mentality.
</P>

   ``We have a whole generation of Internet babies who love the
auctions and are used to it,'' said Lee Mills, a lawyer, investment
banker and powerboat racer from Key West, Fla., whose 13-acre
estate in Woodstock, was sold at auction for a higher-than-expected
$2 million several years ago. ``It's a lot of entertainment, a lot
of theater, and I believe it's the trend of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Auctioneers and real estate brokers estimate that there are now
at least 1,000 auctions of residential properties each year,
compared with 200 five years ago and only a handful 10 years ago.
Meanwhile, the value of all real estate sold at auction increased
to $49 billion in 1998 from $21 billion in 1986, according to the
Gwent Group, an auction-research company in Bloomington, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   On average the auctions can net 80 to 90 percent of the
property's appraised value, which is a shade below what traditional
sales can bring. But some traditional brokers dismiss the auctions
as marketing ploys or annoying competition, said Jan Tarnow,
manager of the auction department of the National Association of
Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still some of that us-versus-them mentality,'' Tarnow
said.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, these auctions usually involved lavish estates,
owned by people like former Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and the
singer Kenny Rogers. On June 8, Christie's Realty International
auctioned a newly listed 2,800-square-foot brownstone on
Manhattan's East Side designed by Philip Johnson and once owned by
Blanchette Rockefeller. The winning bid was $11.16 million _ or
more than double the estimate _ and set a record for the highest
sale price per square foot in Manhattan, according to Christie's.
(The winning bidder was not disclosed.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the auctions are becoming less stratospheric.

   On Sunday, Sheldon Good &AMP; Co. of Chicago plans to auction 50
condominiums in Battery Park City and midtown Manhattan for
$200,000 to $800,000 apiece, both in person and over the Internet,
said Steven L. Good, the company's chief executive.

   Some real estate has been sold on eBay on the Internet. But so
far, the company that has come closest to offering a consistent,
virtual real estate auction has been Homebid.com, which has sold
about 20 homes since January 1999, mainly on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In other countries, particularly Australia, selling real estate
at auction is considered the norm. But in the United States, the
word ``auction'' still conjures up bad images of fast-talking
hucksters preying upon vulnerable people. And the recent fiasco
involving a painting's price being manipulated on eBay does not
help.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And for some people, the packaging _ Want a mariachi band? A
harpist? Some bacon-wrapped quail? _ is a distraction and a
gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a circus,'' said John Aronian III, a retired surgeon in
Westchester, who attended the Fatatos' auction. ``It was good ol'
boys from down South. It was like a hog auction.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, with prime real estate in short supply in a good
economy, more buyers and sellers are willing to gamble on an
auction.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For sellers, auctions may be appealing because they can greatly
accelerate the sales process. Buyers, who must bring a certified
check _ $50,000 in the Irvington sale _ are expected to do their
own inspections or buy the house on an as-is basis. They then have
a set period of time, usually 30 days, to arrange financing and set
a closing date.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of sellers are opting for auctions because
their job or family situation has changed suddenly, or their
property is unusual, said J. Craig King, president of the J.P. King
Auction Co., in Gadsden, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   People are naturally competitive, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch the people sizing each other up: it's like, `Hmm,'''
said Barbara Corcoran, president of the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan
real estate company, which plans to auction properties solely on
the Internet. ``It puts any French cafe to shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as William R. Bone, president of the National Auction Group,
put it: ``It reaches a point where egos take over. It's not dollars
and cents; it's egos.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   On a recent Tuesday, it was the Fatatos' turn. The owner of a
beer distribution company in the Bronx, Fatato, 58, and his wife,
52, had tried unsuccessfully for more than a year to sell their
house to move to a smaller one in Rockland County. The original
price was $1.7 million, but the house was too opulent for the
neighborhood, with glass-and-mirror decor that had not changed
since it was designed 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, rain forced the event indoors. Still, there were
10 bidders, an unusually high number, most of whom did not want to
give their names.
</P>
<P>
   Some were young professionals from Manhattan. At least two
people were considering auctions for their own properties, one on
the Hudson River, the other in Litchfield, Conn. Everyone was
itching with expectation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, shortly after 8 p.m., show time. The auctioneer, Eddie
Haynes, a member of the Oklahoma Auctioneers Hall of Fame, tried to
oil the crowd with folksy charm. First, he auctioned a bottle of
Dom Perignon to Fatato for $125 for charity. Then he asked loudly:
``We having fun yet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun!'' blurted another auctioneer, Wayne Thorn.
</P>
<P>
   The Fatatos chose perhaps the riskiest method: an absolute
auction, without reserve, where the final price is the final price,
even if it is $1. The Fatatos did have the option to cancel at the
last minute, but they did not, and soon, Haynes started the bidding
at $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was loud and chaotic, with people spilling into the living,
dining, kitchen and foyer areas. And slowly, tentatively, the price
climbed; past $800,000, past $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   When the bidding halted at $975,000, Haynes tried repeatedly to
whip the crowd into a frenzy, to no avail. The hammer price was
$975,000, a bid by a young Russian family in Manhattan, said their
broker, Neil Singh.
</P>
<P>
   There was some confusion. A woman in the back, talking on a cell
phone, was apparently trying to bid $1 million, but Haynes did not
notice her. When told about it afterward, Haynes muttered with
disgust.
</P>
<P>
   The final price, actually, was almost $1.1 million, because of
the additional 10 percent charged by the auction company.
</P>
<P>
   The Fatatos were overwhelmed and exhausted by the experience.
``You put your whole life into their hands, and whatever they say,
you believe,'' Fatato said, a few days after the auction. ``Who
knows, it could have gone higher. But it happened so quick. I'm
still trying to figure it out.''

CARS SAY THE DARNDEST THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By CHERYL JENSEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, Mich. _ What we have here is a failure to communicate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am sitting in the elegant Buick LaCrosse, a design study for
an elegant, futuristic sedan, at General Motors' proving ground
here. And like Paul Newman in the chain gang in ``Cool Hand Luke,''
it looks as though I won't be getting out soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The LaCrosse's features include voice-activated controls. And
after a brief and very gentle drive with Gary Mack, one of the
car's designers, as I conversed with the car in an attempt to make
my exit, I had the distinct sense that I was dealing with HAL, the
control-freak computer in ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' This is what
happened:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Me: LaCrosse. Door open.
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: (Silence).
</P>
<P>
   Me: LaCrosse. Door open.
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: Dialing 921.
</P>
<P>
   Me: LaCrosse. Door open.
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: Out of range.
</P>
<P>
   Mack: Try ``Door open.''
</P>
<P>
   Me: Door open.
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: Opening hood.
</P>
<P>
   Mack (quickly trying to take over as the hood starts to rise),
loudly: Hood close!
</P>
<P>
   It is an extremely windy day and the prospect that the fragile,
hand-built hood will fly open panics three of the car's handlers
and sends them running our way.
</P>
<P>
   A GM representative: No. No. No. It's too windy! It'll become a
sail!
</P>
<P>
   Mack: Hood close.
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: Temperature set 79 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Mack: Hood close.
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: Stopping trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Mack: Hood close.
</P>
<P>
   LaCrosse: Closing hood.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life when driving concept cars _ which after all, are
really designed to be seen and not necessarily to be driven, or
even sometimes to be heard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to resist when GM offers a chance for even a
short drive in $20 million worth of futuristic hardware. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Driving these vehicles is not useful for evaluating vehicle
dynamics. It's an exercise in make-believe, like sitting in your
father's car in the driveway when you were 8, sawing at the
steering wheel and imagining that you were really on the road. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this is better because there is a little more than
imagining. You can drive them up to about 25 mph and get a glimpse
of what one might be like as a real car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, not far from the surly LaCrosse is the Chevrolet
SSR, for Super Sports Roadster, one of six concept vehicles on hand
and a sure bet for production. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an elegant move, I fall down and over the sill into the
cockpit, which has the visual impact of the Plymouth Prowler but is
much more practical, thanks to a pickup bed with a hard cover.
</P>
<P>
   The driver's seat doesn't slide; we don't have working
seatbelts, and the speedometer and other electronics are shut off
to save battery power. But we have plenty of other power. The
6-liter V-8 is capable of sending more than 300 horsepower to the
rear wheels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I turn the key and fire up the engine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm holding onto a large, three-spoke steering wheel, a design
cue from the past. The automatic transmission is shifted by pushing
a button on the steering wheel. Three taps and I'm in ``drive''; a
second later we're moving. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ride is a bit stiff, even on the ultra-smooth track, and the
body shakes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all hand-built cars,'' said Andre Hudson, a
23-year-old designer who worked on the SSR. ``This is actually one
of the best ones; the other ones are quite a bit more fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   The tires don't help the ride. The tread was hand-cut by
Goodyear in a pattern that mimics Chevy's bow-tie emblem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the SSR changes direction quickly and you realize how strong
a performer the SSR will be if GM can keep the weight down. It is
all too easy to imagine how great a package this could be. Plus,
when we finish the drive, it lets me out. &QL;

ALAN HOVHANESS, 89, PROLIFIC AMERICAN COMPOSER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Mass.)   By TIM PAGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Hovhaness, an original and extraordinarily prolific
American composer who embraced melody in an atonal age and drew
heavily on music of the East, died on Wednesday. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Hovhaness died at the Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. He had
suffered from a severe stomach ailment for the last three years,
Gerard Schwarz, music director of the Seattle Symphony, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of nearly half a century, Hovhaness wrote more
than 60 symphonies, an assortment of chamber music, dozens of
compositions for solo piano and hundreds of songs and choral works.
The composer John Cage once called Hovhaness a ``music tree who, as
an orange or lemon tree produces fruit, produces music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to compose,'' Hovhaness told The New York Times in
1986. ``I think orchestrally, and hear music in my head much of the
time. I spend at least an hour a day actively working, and in my
free time I do counterpoint exercises to keep my mind active. I can
compose with other music playing in the room, through anything. I
can block everything out.''
</P>
<P>
   This fecundity was only one of the reasons that Hovhaness was
considered something of an anomaly among his peers. He was more
interested in the music of India, Korea, Japan and Armenia than
that of France, Italy, Austria and Germany. He preferred the music
of the Renaissance and Baroque eras to that of the Classical and
Romantic periods. And he objected to atonality on the grounds that
it was ``against nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a center in everything that exists,'' he explained.
``The planets have the sun; the moon, the Earth. The reason I like
Oriental music is that everything has a firm center. All music with
a center is tonal. Music without a center is fine for a minute or
two, but it soon sounds all the same. I've used all techniques,
including the 12-tone technique, but I believe melody is the spring
of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human voice was the first instrument, and I believe that
all the different instruments are voices as well. So I want to give
them melodies to sing. I think melodically, and without melody I
don't have much interest in music.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kostelanetz wrote of Hovhaness in a 1978 article for the
Times, ``Essentially he is a consummate melodist who uses the modal
scales and instrumental textures of Eastern music within a
framework of Western counterpoint and structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though tonal music as such is scarcely unfamiliar, he has
nonetheless created a musical style that is instantly recognizable,
largely because of its synthesis of Oriental and Occidental
characteristics. Among American tonal composers, only Aaron Copland
has created so much uniquely identifiable music.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics found Hovhaness rather too prolific. In 1964,
reviewing the composer's Symphony No. 3 for the Times, Harold C.
Schonberg said the work was ``all very pretty, and 10 of its 15
minutes would have been ample.'' Oliver Daniel, in a 1958 article
for the Saturday Review, complained of Hovhaness' ``reiteration of
small figures that, despite minute variations, can sound intriguing
at first hearing but on a recording can become meaningless on
numerous replaying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The repetition factor in Hovhaness is not climactic but rather
mazelike and hypnotic, often ending as abruptly as a design on
ribbon would be when cut at random by a pair of scissors,'' Daniel
continued. ``It is quantitative, like music by the inch, foot or
yard _ or, more properly, music by the minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few listeners would dismiss Hovhaness as a mere
craftsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although most of Hovhaness' major compositions are
instrumental, almost every work is religious in nature,'' the
composer and critic Arnold Rosner wrote in the New Grove Dictionary
of Music and Musicians. ``This does not, however, inhibit stylistic
and psychological variety: tranquillity, fear, ecstasy, mystery and
epic chaos find expression in divergent and ever-changing
techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovhaness' mystical bent was apparent also in the titles he
chose _ his most popular works were the ``St. Vartan'' Symphony, a
tone poem called ``Mysterious Mountain'' and a Magnificat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there is something good in all religions but that
all of them are incomplete,'' he said in 1986. ``I like the ancient
philosophies of India _ the Bhagavad-Gita, for example _ and the
Armenian Church, which is more mystical than most of those in the
West. But I can't put my religious experience into words. Maybe a
Bacon or a Shakespeare could, but I don't have that gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovhaness was born Alan Vaness Chakmakjian in Somerville, Mass.,
on March 8, 1911. His father, an immigrant from Turkey, was a
chemistry professor at Tufts Medical School; his mother was of
Scottish ancestry. He adopted the name Hovhaness, in honor of a
grandfather, when he was in his early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   He learned to read music when he was 7 and immediately began to
write his own pieces. By the age of 13, he had written two operas,
``Bluebeard'' and ``Daniel,'' as well as many smaller pieces. He
studied piano with Heinrich Gebhard, and then attended the New
England Conservatory of Music, studying composition with Frederick
Converse. His early works are strongly influenced by Renaissance
music.
</P>
<P>
   Hovhaness worked with Bohuslav Martinu at Tanglewood in 1942,
and the following year began the serious study of Armenian music,
after which his work became more contrapuntally complex and
rhythmically vital. In later years, he added various experimental
and international procedures to his work _ including, on one
memorable occasion, the sound of recorded whale song in ``And God
Created Great Whales'' _ and an interest in Far Eastern music would
come to predominate.
</P>
<P>
   From 1948 to 1951, he was on the faculty of the Boston
Conservatory of Music. He lived in New York throughout the 1950s,
and moved to Seattle in 1962. In 1954, he wrote the score for the
Clifford Odets play ``Flowering Peach.'' He also provided the
soundtrack for several documentary films, including ``Assignment
India'' and ``Assignment South-East Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovhaness was a tall, gaunt man, personable but shy. He lived
quietly in Seattle, where his standard procedure was to work
through the night. ``After feeling drowsy in the early evening, I
get more and more creative as the night goes on,'' he said in 1978.
``By dawn, I'm wildly creative; it gets stronger all the time. I
don't know how to compose slowly. I correct and revise later, but
composing goes in a sweep. Sometimes I just get the beginning idea,
but more often the entire score complete with orchestration comes
into my head at once.''

FURNITE WEB SITE LAYS OFF 80 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Furniture.com Inc., which was tossed a $27 million lifeline this
week, laid off 80 employees Thursday, slashing its work force by 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Like other online retailers, Furniture.com has been struggling
to rein in costs, hoping that the capital markets will eventually
swing back into their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, these are downsizing days for dot-coms. Drkoop.com,
Salon.com, and PlanetRX.com also have laid off employees. Other
firms, including Craftshop.com and Toysmart.com, have given up.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com executives said in January they hoped to raise up
to $50 million in an initial public offering. But by April, it was
clear that Wall Street investors had lost their appetite for
Internet retail stocks.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Furniture.com formally withdrew its offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they're focusing on the bottom line and trying to
achieve profitability in a quicker time frame,'' said Jeffrey
Quinn, an analyst with Internet research firm Gomez Advisors in
Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   This is Furniture.com's second round of layoffs. In April, the
Framingham, Mass. furniture seller laid off 30 people by asking
them to sit by their desks and wait for their phones to ring.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the company's troubles, chief executive Andrew
Brooks had been urging employees to stick around. Key executives,
however, continued to walk out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Quinn said Furniture.com executives recently had
considered filing for bankruptcy, along with other options. But an
investor group led by (at)Ventures, the venture capital arm of
Andover-based CMGI Inc., rescued the firm this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support of the company continues,'' said Krista Thomas, a
spokeswoman for (at)Ventures, one of Furniture.com's original
investors. ``Everybody continues to believe that the company has
the opportunity to pursue its original strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear how the $27 million financing had been
structured, however. Dot-coms have complained that deals have
become more restrictive and more expensive. For example, eToys Inc.
raised $100 million earlier this month _ but on terms less
favorable than in previous financings.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com officials could not be reached Thursday. Thomas
said she did not know the details of the company's latest
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict that online retailers may have to wait a while
longer for the financial markets to improve. Many investors have
lost interest in unprofitable and cash-burning online stores that
have little chance of leading their respective categories, such as
toys, pets, or books.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture retailers also face unique challenges, such as selling
products that are bulky, pricier, and often more expensive to ship.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research predicts that $3.9 billion, or 5 percent of
all furniture sales, will migrate to the Internet by 2004. About 9
percent of apparel purchases and half of all software purchases are
expected to be rung up in cyperspace that same year.

ICAHN SWEETENS OFFER FOR NABISCO GROUP HOLDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Icahn, the financier who owns about 10 percent of Nabisco
Group Holdings, sweetened his offer for the company Thursday, the
second time in two days that he has raised his bid.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn's revised offer was disclosed in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission after the stock market closed.
It came after a telephone conversation he had Thursday morning with
Steven Goldstone, chairman of Nabisco Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion took place less than a day after Nabisco Group
Holdings received bids for its 80.4 percent stake in Nabisco
Holdings, the food company, and an offer from Icahn to buy the
holding company.
</P>
<P>
   The Philip Morris Cos. and a joint venture of Danone SA and
Cadbury Schweppes PLC submitted bids for the food company, The Wall
Street Journal reported. The Journal said Philip Morris had bid
close to $55 a share and the Danone-Cadbury bid was close to $50 a
share. Shares of Nabisco Holdings fell $1.6875 Thursday, to
$51.5625.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Icahn offered $28 a share for Nabisco Group
Holdings, $19 a share in cash and $9 in two-year 14 percent notes.
Icahn then revised and increased that bid Thursday. Shares of
Nabisco Group Holdings rose 6.25 cents, to $25.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Goldstone, Icahn said he was prepared to pay 88
percent of the after-tax cash price Nabisco Group Holdings receives
for the food company.
</P>
<P>
   The revised offer is structured along the lines of an offer R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Holdings reportedly made for Nabisco Group
Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Reynolds had
submitted a bid that would price the holding company at a 20
percent discount to the net proceeds received from the sale of the
food company.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Smith, a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds, declined to comment.
Spokesmen for Philip Morris and Danone also declined to comment, as
did Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although Icahn's offer is not fixed in stone, analysts said it
was clearly superior to the bid he made on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``By offering to buy Nabisco Group Holdings at a 12 percent
discount to net asset value, Mr. Icahn has raised substantially his
bid,'' said Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``The impact of this bid is that it has raised the bar
materially for other bidders for Nabisco Group Holdings, including
R.J. Reynolds.''
</P>
<P>
   Board members of Nabisco Group Holdings are expected to meet
Friday morning to consider the offers.
</P>
<P>
   But Feldman and others said they did not consider the bids
submitted thus far to be the final offers the company will receive.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed to the fact that Goldstone called Icahn and
encouraged him to raise his bid as evidence that the bidding was
not over. If Goldstone spoke with Icahn, the analysts reasoned, he
probably placed similar calls to executives at Philip Morris and
Danone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven Goldstone is going to do everything he can to grow the
sale price between now and the time the holding company and the
food company are eventually sold,'' Feldman said.

PROBER WON'T PURSUE HILLARY CLINTON'S `TRAVELGATE' ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Immersed in a tough battle for the US Senate,
Hillary Rodham Clinton dodged another political bullet Thursday as
independent counsel Robert Ray announced he would not indict her in
the long-running ``travelgate'' investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While Ray said there was ``substantial evidence'' that Mrs.
Clinton had a ``role'' in the 1993 firings of White House travel
office employees, he said he would not bring criminal charges
against her. The decision spares Mrs. Clinton from what could have
been a devastating blow to her campaign for the Senate seat in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a
reasonable doubt that any of Mrs. Clinton's statements and
testimony ... were knowingly false,'' Ray said in a statement
released by his office.
</P>
<P>
   While Ray derided the White House for what he called its
``substantial resistance'' to providing ``relevant evidence'' to
his office, he said he had ``declined prosecution of Mrs.
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said, ``The independent
counsel confirms what we have said all along. There is no evidence
that the first lady did anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart took a swipe at Ray for ``inappropriately
characterizing the results of a legally sealed report through
innuendo'' by being openly skeptical of Mrs. Clinton's statements
even while declining to indict her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Office of the Independent Counsel has further politicized
an investigation that has gone on far too long,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was in Detroit Thursday at private fund-raisers and
was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Thursday's decision on Mrs. Clinton's campaign
will be minimal, said John Zogby, an upstate New York pollster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amounts to a net zero,'' Zogby said. ``Those who hate her
guts are going to say, `This is why we hate her.' Those who love
her are going to say, `Why don't they leave her alone?' And those
who don't know her are going to say, `What didn't we already know
about this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is in a dead heat against Representative Rick
Lazio, a Long Island Republican, for the seat of retiring Senator
Daniel P. Moynihan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill charge that Mrs. Clinton
orchestrated the abrupt firing of seven career travel office
workers so the work could go to family friends Harry Thomason and
Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, who are successful Hollywood producers.
The fired employees were accused of financial mismanagement by the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who replaced independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr last
year, did find that a conversation Mrs. Clinton had with David
Watkins, the former White House chief of administration,
``ultimately influenced Watkins' decision to fire the travel office
employees.'' But Ray said there still was not enough evidence for a
jury to conclude Mrs. Clinton's testimony on the firings was
``knowingly false.''
</P>
<P>
   The travel office makes arrangements for the press to accompany
the president on official trips. The cost is paid by news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents are free to appoint whomever they want to the travel
office, but the Clintons' critics say the White House tarnished the
reputations of the travel office workers to justify firing them.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the firings, a Clinton cousin, Catherine
Cornelius, was put in charge of the office, but she was removed
soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee accused the
White House of an ``enormous and elaborate coverup operation'' and
concluded that Mrs. Clinton orchestrated the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has long denied the charges, saying she was indeed
concerned about alleged mishandling of travel office funds, but
never ordered the firings.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's announcement stunned and disappointed the Clintons'
detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision, frankly, is an outrage,'' said Larry Klayman,
chairman and general counsel of the Washington- based Judicial
Watch. The group represented the former head of the travel office,
Billy Dale, who was among those fired in May 1993. Dale was
prosecuted and acquitted in 1995 of embezzling travel office funds.
</P>
<P>
   Klayman said the independent counsel should have made his
decision based on whether there was enough evidence to indict, not
on whether a jury would convict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray broke the law, and probably for political purposes,''
Klayman said. Dale ``feels abandoned'' by the judicial system,
Klayman said of his client.
</P>
<P>
   The development is another display of the remarkable political
survival record of the first couple. Despite relentless
congressional hearings and a seven-year independent counsel
investigation that has cost more than $50 million, the Clintons
have emerged politically alive, if bruised.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was impeached by the US House on charges
related to his relationship with Lewinsky, but he was acquitted by
the Senate and now enjoys high approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Ray closed the book on the so-called Filegate
episode, concluding that neither the first lady nor any senior
White House official had broken the law when the White House
obtained hundreds of FBI personnel files early in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ray still must decide whether to bring indictments in the
Whitewater case, considered the most serious and potentially
damaging case to the Clintons. Part of the case deals with missing
billing records of Mrs. Clinton's that had been subpoenaed.
Photocopies of the documents, which related to Mrs. Clinton's work
on the Whitewater land deal, were later found on a table in the
first couple's living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   A full report on the travel office matter has been given to a
panel of three appellate judges who named Ray to the job. It will
not be made public until those mentioned in the report are given
the opportunity to respond, a process that could take several
months.

COMMENTARY: PAGING FRANK CAPRA 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Lazio, the current Republican Senate candidate from New
York, once told a reporter that his favorite movie was the old
Jimmy Stewart film ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' This is always
a popular choice among people who hope to go to Washington
themselves. But it had particular reverberations back in 1992 for
Lazio, who was running for Congress as an idealistic young hero
bucking the entrenched forces of corrupt politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels weren't perfect. For one thing, Smith was a
professional scoutmaster, while Lazio was a lawyer and longtime
protege of the Suffolk County Republican Party. Smith was a perfect
political virgin, who managed to get appointed to an interim Senate
seat without ever having noticed that his home state had been in
the grip of a corrupt machine for several decades. Things like that
do not generally occur on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   We digress, however. The idea of `` Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington'' was very much the theme of Lazio's career-defining
House campaign in 1992. His battle cry was ``No perks, no
privileges, no pay raises,'' and his pitch was that the incumbent,
Tom Downey, had become an out-of-touch, junket-taking insider.
</P>
<P>
   After his upset victory, the new congressman demonstrated his
determination not to join the Washington establishment by embarking
on a perpetual commute. Every Monday Lazio, his pregnant wife and
1-year-old daughter crammed into the family Infiniti and drove five
hours from Long Island to Washington. Every Thursday, they drove
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uninterrupted family time,'' he said. ``You can talk
about life.''
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now Lazio is running against Hillary Rodham
Clinton, and he seems to have adjusted his view on perks,
privileges, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newly released financial records show that Lazio led the New
York delegation in number of trips taken on other people's tabs in
1999. A good-government group called one outing to Virginia that
was paid for by the Mortgage Bankers Association ``a good example
of a trip that a member shouldn't take'' when he happens to be head
of a subcommittee that regulates home mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   _ He turns out to have voted for a congressional pay raise after
all. Recently Lazio told The Washington Post it was because the
bill included a provision that would help find missing children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last week Lazio skipped a close vote on a bill to create a
home heating oil reserve for the Northeast to rush home to
campaign. A spokesman said he needed to catch the last shuttle out.
</P>
<P>
   _ The New York Times recently revealed that in 1997 Lazio made
an uncharacteristically risky investment in stock options in a
company that was controlled by some of his contributors. He
realized a 600 percent gain after it became a takeover target two
weeks later. ``Some stocks you get lucky on and some you're unlucky
on,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   This was all in the last week or so _ a Senate campaign start-up
worthy of the early Hillary Clinton. There was also a flap over a
CBS report in which Lazio vowed to run a clean campaign without
acting like ``a pansy.'' When a gay journalist objected, the Lazio
campaign said he was referring to the flower.
</P>
<P>
   I think I am speaking for everyone in saying that it was a
relief when Lazio stopped dragging his family up and down the
Northeast Corridor. But you'd think he'd have hung around to
support that heating oil bill and taken the opportunity to get
re-acquainted with the federal highway system. (Defenders quickly
pointed out that five members of the New York City delegation also
left before the vote. But the New York City delegation, which has
the average intelligence of a large turnip, is not the ideal we
want to shoot for.)
</P>
<P>
   If you win your seat by running pictures of the incumbent Jet
Skiing in the Caribbean, as Lazio did in 1992, you really should
not let the Developers Tax Credit Conference fly you to Florida, as
he did in 1999. And a guy like Lazio, who never made a fancy
investment until he was appointed to two committees that regulate
the securities industry, must have known this was not the time to
start playing the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   At minimum, he ruined his chance to make an issue of Clinton's
cattle futures deal. At worst, he opened the door for us to point
out that Jimmy Stewart would have put his investments in a blind
trust.

   The head of the far-right National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen,
announced that the grandson of Charles de Gaulle will head a list
of candidates vying to represent the 20 districts of Paris in
municipal elections next year. Le Pen said he was proud to be able
to count on such an ``emblematic figure'' as the grandson, also
called Charles de Gaulle. Other family members have been outraged
at de Gaulle's affiliation with the National Front, a party long

   The National Assembly has unanimously passed a bill to make it

manipulation,'' or brainwashing. It also sets up procedures for
courts to ban a group regarded as a sect and it provides for sects,

practice of medicine, wrongful advertising or sexual abuse. The
bill has set off protests by the Church of Scientology and the

his acceptance of secret donations resembled the Nazi-era boycott
of Jewish shops. Jewish leaders said this was an ``inexcusable
gaffe,'' and politicians called the comparison ``horrendous'' and
``incredibly embarrassing.''

   BRITAIN: ROYAL UPKEEP
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers spent $22 million maintaining royal palaces last year,
a saving of $1.2 million from 1998. An auditors' report itemized
the upkeep costs on Buckingham Palace; Windsor Castle; St. James'
Palace, where Prince Charles has his office and London apartments;
Clarence House, home of the Queen Mother; and Kensington Palace,
former home of Princess Diana. Sir John Bourn, the chief auditor,
noted some delays and overruns but said, in general, ``They are
managing this work well.''

   IRELAND: ARMY MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   A British Army band will perform in Dublin today for the first
time since Irish independence from British rule in 1921. The
appearance at a charity event was seen by London and Dublin as a
sign of improved British-Irish relations, but Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said it would protest
outside the hall.

   An investigating magistrate said he plans to indict five people
next week in a continuing inquiry into possible bribery to win
lucrative Kremlin renovation contracts. The magistrate said he
would indict two heads of construction firms based in Lugano. Also
to be charged will be a Geneva lawyer and two asset managers. The
charges follow the indictment of former President Boris Yeltsin's
Kremlin property manager.

   At least 15 people were hurt in clashes at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico after a rally for Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas Solorzano, a left-leaning presidential candidate. Students
who supported a recent strike at the university attacked Cardenas
followers with burning flags, paint, eggs and chicken entrails,
causing a 10-minute brawl.

   The Zapatista guerrillas announced that they will not disrupt
voting in Chiapas State in July 2 elections. In an open letter,
Subcomandante Marcos, the Zapatista leader, acknowledged that
elections are part of the democratic process. In legislative
elections in 1997, Zapatistas did not allow polling stations in
areas they control.

THE MESSAGES THAT GOT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J., Fla.)   (For release Sunday, June 25)

<P>
   Without question, modern technology, notably in the form of the
telephone, voice mail, e-mail and the fax, has speeded
communication. Whether it has enhanced communication is another
matter. As these anecdotes indicate, haste continues to make waste,
chips prove no substitute for the human brain and many an
ill-considered word find an unintended audience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Janice M. Cauwels, a writer and consultant in Maywood, N.J., ran
into a problem when she was assisting a celebrity on a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had picked the worst possible time to contact a renowned
academic psychiatrist and ask him to double-check a chapter on
eating disorders that I had rewritten,'' Cauwels recalls.
``Impossibly busy anyway, he was preparing for two major
conferences only a few weeks apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I faxed my material to the psychiatrist, then followed up with
notes repeatedly apologizing for the inconvenience. Upon returning
to my office a few days later, I found a long voice-mail message
from him, indicating that my write-up was fine. I was one of a
`steamed group of people,' he added in what sounded like his
typical vernacular, who had been trying to reach him without
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent a thank-you note mentioning my surprise that he thought
I was angry, despite my expressed regrets for bothering him at a
bad time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back came a highly amused reply: More careful enunciation
would have made clear that actually I belonged to `an esteemed
group,' hence his prompt attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a business acquaintance who relies heavily on voice
recognition and e-mail to do his job,'' writes Jay Vivian of
Stamford, Conn. ``A year or two ago, I received a broadcast e-mail
from him addressed to about seven of us, obviously a distribution
list of people who shared an interest in investment risk
management. After discussing some ideas, he proposed a work plan
and then suggested that we get together to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``His note concluded, `I think it would be a good idea for us to
get enemas all together. Hope you agree.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that he had said into his voice recognition
microphone, `I think it would be a good idea to get en masse, all
together,' but his voice recognition software was not familiar with
the French phrase and had replaced it with the closest match in its
dictionary. He had proofread it quickly and missed the replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent it back to him, suggesting that this was an unusual way
to evaluate ideas. He was mortified.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A colleague and I had a complicated task to complete, and our
manager decided we could do it best off site, in the quiet of my
colleague's home,'' writes Nancy Cheser of Naples, Fla., recalling
her days as a systems analyst in Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two days of working, I phoned my manager, who I thought
was doing a particularly poor job of coordinating the project, to
give him a status report on our work. He was not at his desk, so I
left a message on his voice mail. I was using my colleague's
cordless phone and put it down on the desk. I then proceeded to
give a detailed rehashing of my complaints against my manager to my
co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, when Cheser returned to her office, she says:
``My manager approached me and asked me to step out into the
corridor. Apparently I had not turned off the cordless phone, and
my rampage was recorded, along with my status report, on his phone
mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I expected him to be angry, he was more concerned that
I had not approached him in person with my dissatisfaction. I still
cringe when I remember our walk in the hall.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lest all blame for miscommunication fall upon modern technology,
leave it to Horace Hone, a retired aircraft engineer in Palm Coast,
Fla., to note that this electronic age has no monopoly on
transmissions gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``A devastating example of a garbled message occurred long
before voice mail, e-mail, etc., and it ruined the day for every
British subject,'' he writes. ``After the Battle of Waterloo, a
cross-Channel transmission, probably by semaphore, was received at
Dover, saying `Wellington Defeated.'
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, maybe fog, no further details were
forthcoming. But a one-word continuation of the message the next
day changed gloom to jubilation. The word was `Napoleon.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lesson here,'' Hone concludes. ``Be careful how you
draft your communications.'' &QL;

NADER'S POPULARITY WITH LABOR POSES THIRD-PARTY THREAT TO GORE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Months after they dismissed Ralph Nader as a fringe
third-party candidate who would fade quickly, Democratic and
Republican strategists now say that the consumer advocate has
emerged as more politically potent than Pat Buchanan and could
deeply complicate the candidacy of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who is expected to capture the Green Party's nomination
in Denver this weekend, is in single digits in most polls. No one
thinks he has a chance of rising to the electoral heights of Ross
Perot, who in 1992 won 19 percent of the vote. And few people
predict that he will reach the 15 percent threshold required to
assure a spot in the nationally televised candidate debates this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Nader already is forcing Gore to compete more
vigorously for the enthusiastic support of labor and other groups
that are reliably Democratic. And many pollsters and analysts said
that in a tight general election race with Gov. George W. Bush, a
few points could make a difference _ and force Gore to reconsider
his electoral calculations in important states.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where Gore is running comfortably ahead, a Field
Poll this week showed Nader drawing 7 percent of the vote. He is
also showing strength in Oregon, Washington and New Mexico. In a
close race, he could also potentially tip the balance in Ohio,
Michigan and other battleground states of the Midwest. A Quinnipiac
University poll in Connecticut this week showed he had 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling for some Democrats is that Nader, who has
ridiculed Gore and Bush as sounding identical and has emphasized
his own record as a consumer and environmental advocate, is
becoming more and more popular with labor. By campaigning
aggressively against the China trade deal, which passed in the
House last month, Nader has effectively capitalized on labor's
distress with Gore for his support of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Nader has made the vice president battle for a
constituency that his campaign thought it could count on. In fact,
pollsters say that most of Nader's backers are not the swing voters
that Gore needs to win over, but staunch Democrats that should
already be on his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush people, I'm sure, are thrilled about Nader,'' said
one of Gore's most senior aides.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's potential for trouble was on display here on Thursday,
when James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters president, appeared beside him
at a news conference and ridiculed the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no distinction between Al Gore and George W. Bush
when it comes to trade,'' Hoffa asserted after Nader met privately
with the Teamsters' 24-member executive board. He added that Gore
was ``wrong on trade'' and that ``We agree wholeheartedly with what
Mr. Nader has said.'' Nader won a standing ovation from the board
members.
</P>
<P>
   Imploring the audience to take him seriously, Nader said,
``People are always asking, `Am I worried about taking votes away
from Gore?' No. I'm worried about Gore taking votes away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said they have moved aggressively behind the
scenes to try to keep Hoffa from endorsing Nader, to the point
where they have directed projects through federal agencies that
would use Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts may be paying off _ at least for now. ``We're not
going to hurry to endorse,'' Hoffa said on Thursday. But even Gore
aides said a Teamsters endorsement of the vice president seems
increasingly less likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have options of endorsing or not endorsing,'' Hoffa added.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the assistant Democratic leader who
is a Gore loyalist, contacted several labor leaders on Thursday,
discouraging them from defecting to Nader. In an interview, he
bluntly condemned Nader as a spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph Nader is a very selfish person and he's on an ego
trip,'' Reid said. ``He has no respect for the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, most political strategists viewed Buchanan as
the biggest third-party threat _ and a potentially big problem for
Bush. He has run twice for the Republican presidential nomination,
even winning the critical New Hampshire primary in 1996. And if he
wins the backing of the Reform Party, whose nomination he is
seeking, he would draw $12.6 million in federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Buchanan's windfall, strategists now say Nader has a
greater potential impact on the race because polls show that he
takes his support almost exclusively from Gore. Buchanan, with
backing both from protectionist Democrats and conservative
Republicans, does not appear to have as much potential to wound
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Buchanan gets the Reform Party nomination, he is
weakened because many in that party do not like him. And despite
Buchanan's staunch position against free trade, many unions see
Nader as more of a soulmate because, unlike Buchanan, he is not
conservative on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Nader is a far more popular figure than the
controversial Buchanan. Fifty percent of registered voters have a
negative view of Buchanan, while only 15 percent have a negative
view of Nader, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll
taken June 14-18. The poll found that 12 percent had a positive
view of Buchanan, while 33 percent had a positive view of Nader.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to be Al Gore looking at the third-party horizon
this year,'' said J. David Gillespie, a political scientist at
Presbyterian College in Clinton. S.C., who is an authority on
third-party candidacies. ``Nader's draw in key states may be very
crucial in determining the outcome of this election.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of the Gore and Bush campaigns thus far has been to
ignore Nader and Buchanan _ and not do anything to raise their
profile. That is why during the primaries, Bush did not join Sen.
John McCain in condemning writings by Buchanan that some Jewish
groups derided as anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, echoing some Gore advisers, insisted that he was not at
all unsettled by Nader. ``I'm not worried about it,'' he said. ``It
doesn't make much difference if Ralph Nader is an angel or not:
people aren't going to throw their votes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Most voters, he said, do not know much about Nader _ and his
backers will sour on him when they realize he is just ``a human
being'' and not a loftier figure. ``He's reached his high point
right now,'' Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   A strategist for Gore put it this way: ``In June, you're wasting
your energy if you worry about these things. In October, it would
be worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said Nader has a better
chance of holding on to his support than Buchanan because ``the
Nader voter tends to be a higher educated group of voters'' who are
less likely to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goeas, like many Republicans, said he knows not to
underestimate Buchanan, who has a history of surprising his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the grant Buchanan will get if he is the Reform
Party nominee, he said, ``Twelve million dollars is not a huge
megaphone. But it's a megaphone. And any time Pat Buchanan gets a
megaphone, that can be dangerous.''

BRITAIN CHARGES DUTCH TRUCK DRIVER IN IMMIGRANTS' DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, England _ The Dutch driver of a truck that became the
sealed tomb of 58 illegal Chinese immigrants packed into its
airtight container was charged on Thursday with manslaughter, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Kent police, Mark Pugash, said that the
driver, Perry Wacker, 32, of Rotterdam, will be arraigned on 58
charges of manslaughter, or unlawful killing, when he appears in
court on Friday. The driver has been held since the corpses of the
young immigrants were found early Monday in the rear of his truck.
</P>
<P>
   Wacker was also charged with trying to bring the victims into
the country and with facilitating the entry into Britain of two
survivors, who have been hospitalized and are being questioned by
the police. His truck had made a five-hour ferry crossing from the
Belgian port of Zeebrugge in unseasonable heat.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the charges appeared to reflect the outrage in
Britain and throughout the European Union over a case that has
highlighted the unease generated by immigration. European states
cannot decide whether to view young immigrants as a burden or a
potential benefit to their aging societies.
</P>
<P>
   Because legal immigration into states of the European Union is
almost impossible for unskilled workers, and not easy even for the
skilled, growing numbers are seeking illegal entry, most as asylum
seekers.
</P>
<P>
   This seems to have been the goal of the 60 Chinese people packed
in the truck, most of whom were in their 20s and had apparently
traveled overland from China's southern Fujian Province, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The global reality now is that you cannot stop people from
poorer countries aspiring for life in richer countries,'' said Tan
Wah-piow, a London lawyer who deals with asylum cases. ``That is
what drives these people from Fujian. But people in European states
are not ready to confront this reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Tan has become involved because four days after the discovery of
the bodies, none of the victims has been identified. He said he was
outraged by this failure and contended that it reflected the
refusal of British authorities to guarantee that any Chinese
relatives of the dead who come forward will be granted amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that these relatives may themselves be in England
illegally and are afraid to present themselves to the authorities
for fear of detention or even expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking asylum routinely destroy all their documents, so
the dead are thought to have had no identification on them.
</P>
<P>
   Pugash hinted in a radio interview on Thursday that any
relatives would be treated with understanding, but he declined to
offer any guarantees of immunity. ``We have said from the beginning
that we will welcome anyone with any information,'' he said. ``We
will treat them sympathetically. Asylum status is not an issue for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Labor government, under pressure to stem a rising flow
of immigration widely seen as placing unacceptable strain on the
welfare state, tightened its asylum laws earlier this year. In
1999, more than 70,000 people applied for asylum, compared to about
5,000 before the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Kent police have arrested two other people _ a Chinese man
and woman _ in connection with the case. The Dutch police have
arrested Arie van der Spek, 24, who lived at the address listed for
the company registered as the owner the truck, and one other man.
</P>
<P>
   The case has also acquired a Belgian dimension. The police there
are holding three Asian men arrested in April in connection with
the illegal presence of a large group of Chinese immigrants in two
villages.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether these Chinese citizens, who were
detained by Belgian authorities and then put unescorted on a train
to Antwerp, are the same group that later died in Wacker's truck.
The British police are examining fingerprints of the group made by
the Belgian police two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Belgium and Britain have been strained over
the way the Chinese were treated, with Belgian ministers curtly
rebuffing British suggestions that the arrest and subsequent
release of the group made little sense.
</P>
<P>
   These bitter exchanges have illustrated the fact that the 15
nations of the European Union have no common policy on immigration
or asylum. Some, like Belgium and Germany, are members of the
so-called ``Schengen area,'' a group of states that have
effectively dismantled the borders between them. Others, like
Britain, are not.
</P>
<P>
   China on Thursday called for tighter controls on immigration,
suggesting some European countries were too lax. ``It is worth
noting that criminal groups usually use legal loopholes in some
countries to organize secret passages,'' said Zhu Bangzao, a
foreign ministry spokesman. ``Countries concerned should coordinate
efforts and crack down severely on these crimes.''

SEPARATING THE TALKERS FROM THE DOERS

   `The Knowing-Doing Gap: How Smart Companies Turn Knowledge into
Action'
</P>
<P>
   By Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I. Sutton
</P>
<P>
   Boston, Harvard Business School Press, 2000
</P>
<P>
   Why can't companies get off the dime? Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert
Sutton have studied the ways of business for decades, and they come
away puzzled as to why so many companies fail to act on what they
know. Too often, the solution to a business problem is obvious to
all, yet the company can't bring itself to seize the nettle.
</P>
<P>
   In their pragmatic book, ``The Knowing-Doing Gap'' (Harvard
Business School Press, $27.50) Pfeffer and Sutton offer the voice
of experience about companies that know what to do but just can't.
Some businesses mistake talk for action; they perfect their plans
and presentations, yet no one follows up. And some enterprises are
too happy, creating a bliss that no one wants to disturb with
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Still others get locked in the past, sometimes because their
identities are too strong to adapt. A great many businesses are
chilled by a climate of fear that discourages feedback and
paralyzes initiative. Many, if not most, enterprises rely on faulty
yardsticks of performance, favoring financial measures that do not
truly capture their businesses. And most companies routinely do
business in a way that divides the work force and discourages
employees from cooperating with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Like most business books, ``The Knowing-Doing Gap'' instructs
mainly by example, supported here and there by hard data. The book
offers judgments, case histories, impressions, surmise. The ``gap''
is the difference between what a company knows and what it does.
The reader must take on faith that the gap is indeed pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   The book does seem a touch dated. It discusses downsizing but
not the Internet and the new economy. The argument also lacks the
surprise and paradox of the research by Clayton Christensen, the
Harvard Business School professor, about adapting to technology.
Christensen found that smart companies often missed out on emerging
technologies not because they were lax, but rather because they
were obsessed with serving their best customers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the book's judgments are good, the examples
instructive, the advice sensible, the thesis tightly argued.
Business readers will find that the shoe fits. Many will agree with
one finding in particular: ``There is far more talk than action
about using enlightened management techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors teach organizational behavior at Stanford
University, Pfeffer in the business school and Sutton in the
engineering school. They are prolific authors of books, papers and
case studies.
</P>
<P>
   True to thesis, they declare up front that reading a book, their
book or any other, is never enough _ that one has to know how to
act upon it. Their book concludes on the same note: ``This knowing
is insufficient. Action must occur.'' And the authors never leave a
topic without prescribing seven or eight steps that companies can
take.
</P>
<P>
   Their favorite enterprises include the Men's Wearhouse, a
clothing chain that puffs up its sales staff as ``wardrobe
consultants'' and insists that the employees help one another; SAS
Institute, the software company famous for its peerless benefits
and working conditions; AES, the global electric power producer,
which operates with minimal headquarters staff and expects its
units to solve their own problems; and numerous others, from Sears,
Roebuck to Intuit, Southwest Airlines, British Petroleum, Barclays
Global Investors and even the New Zealand post office.
</P>
<P>
   As the authors pick apart the failings afflicting other
companies, their own theory of the workplace emerges, chapter by
chapter. It centers on employee satisfaction and appears to mark
employee opinion as the single most important gauge of progress.
They admire Intuit, for example, which closely monitors its
employees' assessment of whether the enterprise is living up to its
values.
</P>
<P>
   In their ideal workplace, no boss would be vindictive, and the
only failure would be a failure to act. People would feel free to
take chances and make mistakes, even colossal ones. Co-workers
would cooperate to the utmost, with all their considerable juices
focused on the competition. Anyone who pursued only his own
short-term interest would be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The authors argue that even in a knowledge economy, no company
can sustain a a competitive edge simply from what it knows. The
marketplace in ideas is too efficient; the best business ideas get
around too fast. Businesses must succeed with superior execution _
by doing rather than knowing. Famed competitors like Toyota show
off their techniques to all comers, yet no one else ever appears to
match their performance.
</P>
<P>
   They also conclude that businesses do not excel at learning. If
they did, then all their branches would perform uniformly well, by
borrowing the best practices from their sister units. Yet oil
companies commonly find one refinery three times as efficient as
another. Fast-food chains live with huge differences in their
outlets' profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Some barriers to action are universal. Even the way people
handle themselves in daily corporate discourse sets up a bias
against action. When judged by others, one naturally wants to
appear smart, and negative people are consistently judged to be the
smartest. The authors cite a 1983 Harvard study of reactions to
book reviews: ``Only pessimism sounds profound,'' it found.
``Optimism sounds superficial.'' They warn that a company can wind
up with a collection of ``clever put-down artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors say that among the unsuccessful companies they
studied, they found ``a pervasive atmosphere of fear and
distrust.'' People were afraid to make mistakes, hesitant to speak
the truth. They learned to keep their heads down and to mind their
own business.
</P>
<P>
   The authors suggest some steps to expel fear and distrust:
Praise and promote people who are willing to deliver bad news to
the boss. Learn from, even celebrate, mistakes; encourage leaders
to talk about their mistakes and the lessons learned. Give people
second (and third) chances. Banish people, especially leaders, who
humiliate others. Don't punish people for trying something new.
</P>
<P>
   Yet exorcising fear can be difficult to accept. Many people
believe that a boss is supposed to be demanding. Shouldn't his or
her wrath count for something? Jack Welch of General Electric did
not become ``Neutron Jack'' by handing out cupcakes. And the
authors acknowledge the strong feelings of Andrew Grove, the Intel
chairman, that fear _ fear of the competitor, fear of failure _ is
essential in fueling a passion for winning in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Ambitiously, the authors would root out intramural competition
from the office. Competition, they say, is by its nature divisive,
pitting employee against employee and encouraging individuals to
pursue personal gain at the expense of larger, shared goals. So
they would eliminate employee recognition awards, as well as public
rankings of top performers, contests among departments or
individuals, merit raises from a small pool _ anything in which the
winners are few and everyone else is pronounced a loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing well is not the same as winning,'' they write.
``Dominating others in a zero-sum contest is just one form of
success.'' They believe that people can achieve high goals by
working cooperatively. But they acknowledge that it is tough to
persuade companies that competition is bad when the people at the
top have been winning competitions all their lives.

KINGS PROTECT GOALIES IN NHL DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Having two top-notch goaltenders isn't merely a
luxury the Kings desire. Management realizes it's a necessity in
today's NHL, especially when one looks at the recent medical
history of Stephane Fiset and Jaime Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Both goalies have suffered serious injuries in each of the last
two seasons, and twice they have been sidelined at the same time.
With that in mind, the Kings have opted to protect both Fiset and
Storr in today's NHL Expansion Draft in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials were so intent on shielding their two top
goalies that general manager Dave Taylor traded a draft choice to
Chicago for Steve Passmore, a goalie who had played at least 10 NHL
games last season and could be made available to Minnesota and
Columbus. Taylor has even had talks with both the Wild and Blue
Jackets about one of them selecting Passmore so the Kings wouldn't
lose a defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Kings opted to protect two goalies, they could protect
only three defensemen. Rob Blake and Mattias Norstrom were
no-brainers; the promising but inconsistent Aki Berg was the other
defenseman protected. First-year NHL pro Jere Karalahti did not
have to be protected.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves veteran Sean O'Donnell exposed, along with free
agent Garry Galley, Jaroslav Modry and Philippe Boucher. Neither
expansion team is likely to select a free agent, but they could be
interested in a strong stay-at-home defenseman like O'Donnell. His
loss would leave a big hole in a relatively thin Los Angeles
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Among the forwards not protected, winger Craig Johnson is the
most likely to be chosen. The speedy Johnson, who scored nine goals
and 23 points while playing a checking role last season, grew up in
Minnesota and played three years at the University of Minnesota.
The ties would seem to make him a perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wasn't going to be protected,'' said Johnson, who was
acquired by the Kings in the 1996 trade that sent Wayne Gretzky to
St. Louis. ``I would like to stay with the Kings, but if I'm
(chosen by) the Wild, then it happens and I'll make the best of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran winger Nelson Emerson is also unprotected, but he is 32
years old and his $2 million salary isn't something either
Minnesota or Columbus would be that interested in picking up.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings protected seven forwards: Luc Robitaille, Zigmund
Palffy, Jozef Stumpel, Glen Murray, Bryan Smolinski, Ian Laperriere
and Kelly Buchberger.
</P>
<P>
   According to draft guidelines, all teams except Nashville and
Atlanta will lose two players, but no more than one goalie or
defenseman. A team that loses a goaltender can't lose a defenseman.

   NEW YORK _ What makes a dancer stand out from the crowd? A
dazzling technique helps, though multiple turns and high jumps are
par for the course today. Beautiful bodies and appealing faces draw
the eye. But stages are full of performers who fit the prescribed
notion of physical perfection. There are so many dancers to claim
the heart and mind and eye, yet only a few do each season.
</P>
<P>
   Ease, physical eloquence and quiet daring are common
denominators among seven outstanding new or unfamiliar performers
who will dance this weekend in New York, as well as the three
former Alvin Ailey dancers whose new modern-dance troupe has made
its debut this week at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the
Berkshires. All occupy the stage with a look of unassuming
ownership. Each catches the eye with something more than skill or
physical beauty, an often elusive quality that remains in the mind,
like a flash of bright unexpected color on a bustling city street,
long after the curtain falls.
</P>
<P>
   Take Hope L. Boykin, who performs with Philadanco at the Joyce
Theater this weekend. Boykin would be the first to admit that she
does not have a typical dance body. Compact and round, she was told
for years that she would never become a dancer. Onstage, however,
she is so fully engaged in every moment of dancing that the vibrant
performing around her pales a little in comparison. Adam
Hendrickson has a strong, often dazzling technique, but it is the
undercurrent of sly subversiveness in his dancing that makes him
fascinating. Janie Taylor, like Hendrickson a City Ballet corps
dancer who is cast in major parts, brings a fugitive, synesthetic
perfume to all that she dances.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Thomas scorched the stage with his quiet intensity
during his years with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.
Elizabeth Roxas was a cool, still, lyrical center of the Ailey
storm. Karine Plantadit-Bageot's dancing was suffused with an
understated wit. The three dancers see their new company RhythMEK _
a name formed in part from the first initials of their own given
names _ as a response to their lives in dance.
</P>
<P>
   At American Ballet Theater, which seems to have more than its
share of attention-grabbing young performers, four corps dancers
stood out this season in a variety of roles. Sean Stewart is the
rare classical dancer who is equally believable and
committed-looking in modern dance and ballet. Like Stewart, Michele
Wiles seems to extend and expand everything she dances so that the
shape of a step or gesture and the line of her body and its
rhythmic response to music look unbounded. Herman Cornejo brings
out the fine detail in choreography without fussiness, his quick
light attack making the most of every moment. Although Marcelo
Gomes is Brazilian, he looks like the quintessential American
classicist, a dancer who just dances, big and boldly, without a
hint of ornamentation.
</P>
<P>
   How did they get where they are today? Each has a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   MARCELO GOMES
</P>
<P>
   Marcelo Gomes, who has just been promoted to soloist, began his
training at 6, studying jazz dance at a school in Manaus, in
northwest Brazil, where he was born. ``I was always dancing around
the kitchen and living room,'' Gomes, who is 20, he said. ``My
parents thought dance classes would be nice as an activity thing.''
By 9, when he had begun training with Helena Lobato and Dalal
Aschar in Rio de Janeiro, Gomes knew he wanted to be a ballet
dancer. ``Not anything else, and that was that,'' he said,
laughing. ``My family had been 100 per cent there for me. Always,
always.''
</P>
<P>
   He studied at the Harid Conservatory in Boca Raton, Fla., for
three years before leaving for a year's study at the Paris Opera
Ballet school on a Prix de Lausanne scholarship. ``I wanted to go
there because of the great tradition and training. I learned French
a little bit and ate some cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined Ballet Theater in 1997. ``I love the repertory. I love
the classical stuff, Petipa, everything about it. But contemporary
ballet and modern dance is very important for a dancer. You have to
be able to roll on the floor and then the next day become a
prince.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his big, unadorned way of dancing, Gomes said that
Brazilian dancers tend to be exaggerated about their technique but
they also give their all. ``I do that,'' he said. ``Maybe the
bigness is what Brazil gave me. In Paris, they cleaned me up. I
felt so confident about my dancing afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he will not be repeating his performance of one of
two major male roles in ``Etudes,'' Gomes recommends seeing the
Harald Lander ballet on Ballet Theater's closing weekend at the
Metropolitan Opera House, June 30 and July 1. ``If you really like
ballet, it's a great way of seeing how ballet technique has
developed.'' He is moved, he said, watching the journey from basic
tendus or foot stretches to bravura dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes will be seen in Twyla Tharp's new ``Brahms-Haydn
Variations'' on closing night, July 1. ``Twyla's stuff is very
hard, even though it looks like we're having a hell of a time.
Everything needs to be very precise in the big group. If we're not
together, you can really see it. But it is enjoyable. You can get a
lot from working with Twyla. And we're at the point now where we
have fun with the ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   HERMAN CORNEJO
</P>
<P>
   Herman Cornejo, also just promoted to soloist, began ballet at 8
in his native Buenos Aires, where he was accepted two years later
into the Teatro Colon school. ``At first it was like a game, but
when I got into Teatro Colon I knew that I loved to dance,''
Cornejo, who is 19, said. ``I just loved the music.'' His first
ballet hero was Maximiliano Guerra. ``I loved him. He jumped a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornejo, who himself has one of those dream jumps that seem to
pause at the top and hover in mid-air, was spotted by Julio Bocca
for his Ballet Argentina troupe. In 1997 Bocca entered his young
dancer in the international ballet competition in Moscow, where he
won a gold medal in 1995 in the senior category even though he was
only 15. In 1998, Cornejo joined Ballet Theater, where his sister
Erica, another promising newcomer, also dances.
</P>
<P>
   He will perform the Bronze Idol in ``La Bayadere'' on Saturday
night. ``Wow, that variation is amazing,'' Cornejo said of his
solo, a killer exercise in pyrotechnics. He may also be seen in the
Tharp ballet. Sean Stewart
</P>
<P>
   Sean Stewart dances with the silken restraint and fastidiousness
of English ballet classicism. His performing suggests that dancing
is, for him, a great private pleasure that he is willing to share
with his audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The unforced fullness of his dancing allows him to let the
choreography grow and breathe with him on the stage, an ability he
put to revelatory use this season as the Fourth Man in Martha
Graham's ``Diversion of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart started training in ballet at 12 to improve his jazz
dance technique. Dance _ both frequent performing as a child and
the physical demands even classes made _ was an escape from
problems at school in his hometown of Vacaville, in northern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's face shines with that delight in the physicality of
dance when he talks of the energy of favorite ballets like
``Etudes'' and George Balanchine's ``Theme and Variations,'' in
which he will dance next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to New York City at 15 to perform for two years with
the Joffrey II ballet, the Joffrey Ballet's junior ensemble, then
went to Paris for a year on his own to study at the Paris Opera
Ballet school. ``I just wanted to see a different kind of traning
and work on my technique,'' Stewart, who is 21, recalled.
Performing in Ballet Theater, which he joined in 1997, was ``kind
of like a big fantasy, the place to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other dreams are to dance Romeo and the slave in ``Le
Corsaire.'' ``It's really soft and powerful,'' he said of the
latter role, describing neatly his own look. ``And Romeo is so
free, the character and the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   MICHELE WILES
</P>
<P>
   Like Stewart, Michele Wiles started ballet training to improve
her jazz dance technique. She still takes jazz classes to loosen up
stiff muscles. Wiles enrolled at 10 in the Kirov Academy of Ballet
in Washington. Soon after, dancing in a children's role in ``Swan
Lake'' with the Royal Ballet of London at the Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts, she knew she wanted to dance ballet
professionally. ``I guess because the ballerina is put on such a
pedestal,'' she said. Wiles, who has just been promoted to soloist,
joined Ballet Theater in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She will dance the third solo in the ``Kingdom of the Shades''
scene in ``La Bayadere'' tonight, tomorrow afternoon and on
Tuesday. ``It's one of the most difficult variations,'' Wile said.
``So slow and controlled. You have to be right on your leg. And you
can't make any mistakes. It shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiles, who is 20, has won a number of jazz dance and ballet
awards, among them a gold medal at the international competition in
Varna, Bulgaria, in 1996. It takes aplomb to compete, and hers
shows in all that she dances. She likes to become someone else on
the stage, she said, and feel a part of a fantasy. But her primary
goal is ``to give people a good show.'' ``I want them to see how
I'm enjoying myself. I'm happy in what I do. I don't even think
about it, I just let my body do it.''
</P>
<P>
   RhythMEK
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that I was bored altogether with what I was doing
and what was out there for me,'' Karine Plantadit-Bageot said with
a throaty laugh when asked why she helped to found RhythMEK. ``I
was always very interested to see if dancers could actually
collaborate and change the recipe arond a little bit.'' Her
sentiments were not unlike those of Michael Thomas and Elizabeth
Roxas. All had performed with the Ailey troupe in the 1980s and
'90s, leaving at the same time in 1998. All went on to perform
freelance with other modern troupes, a ballroom company and on
Broadway. Plantadit-Bageot is on leave from ``Saturday Night
Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   The character of the company and its repertory evolved through
endless get-togethers in the dancers' apartments. Roxas thought
initially of a company for dancers over 40, but their ages ranged
from 33 to 42. RhythMEK, it was decided, would show off its 12
dancers, who include the three founders and Desmond Richardson,
Elizabeth Parkinson, Sarita Allen and Roger Bellamy. They would be
seen initially in a suite of 7 dances created by a wide range of
choreographers. There is ballroom dance by Gary Pierce, Broadway
dance from Bill Hastings, jazz dance by Mia Michaels and modern
dance by Thomas, Zvi Gotheiner, Dwight Rhoden and Ulysses Dove, who
will be represented by excerpts from ``Episodes.''
</P>
<P>
   Roxas said of Dove: ``He'd say that `Episodes' was about
relationships in the moment, and then move on to the next stage,''
Roxas recalled. That seemed peculiarly appropriate for RhythMEK.
Collaborating with living choreographers has had its nervous
moments, she added. But such collaborations were a part of the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we actually do it?,'' Thomas remembered the three
dancers asking themselves early on. ``It's one thing to be a dancer
and totally another to be a director, especially when you're still
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked so hard in my life. But this is ours, and it
feels so good. We know who we are and no one is trying to prove
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   JANIE TAYLOR
</P>
<P>
   Janie Taylor began her ballet studies at 4 with Gilbert Rome in
Houston, where she was born, and continued with Richard Rholden and
Joseph Giacobbe in New Orleans when her family moved there. At the
City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, where she trained
in two summer sessions before enrolling full time, she was singled
out as the 1998 recipient of the Mae L. Wien Award for promising
students. That same year she joined City Ballet and soon attracted
attention in challenging featured roles like Dewdrop in ``The
Nutcracker'' and the doomed young girl in ``La Valse,'' both
choreographed by Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   She cherished the latter role. ``It's fun to do acting as well
as the dancing,'' Taylor, who is 19, said. ``And I get to die. It's
so creepy, watching the ballet from the front.'' Taylor will be
seen tonight in Peter Martins' new ``Harmonielehre,'' set to
famously difficult music by John Adams. She talks with relish of
the ballet's difficulties. ``The partnering is really awkward,
though my partner, Jared Angle, is amazing. Peter never really said
anything to all of us about it, but it seems to be about three
different worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor seems dubious when asked about her seemingly total
confidence on stage. ``I know you should look like you're
confident,'' she said. ``I always want to reach the audience,
affect them somehow, on some sort of level.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ADAM HENDRICKSON
</P>
<P>
   For Adam Hendrickson, dancing classical ballet has been more of
an internal struggle. First there was the battle to come to terms
with ballet after the ``boot camp'' experience of nine years at the
Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet, where Hendrickson, a native of
Harrisburg, trained with Marcia Dale Weary. Next came the
relatively relaxed but still difficult demands of the School of
American Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Does he feel himself to be a dark or subversive presence on the
stage? ``Yeah,'' Hendrickson said, laughing. ``It's not so much the
ballet that I like doing, it's the energy that it requires. A lot
of my dancing is driven by anger rather than by love of it. It's
not that I'm not happy. That's just what it takes to get me going.
It's like proving _ well, I don't have anything to prove but it's
that mentality. I was always told my body's terrible, and I have
this whole short complex. I try to dance as big as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson, who is 19 and is a corps dancer like Taylor, joined
City Ballet in 1998. His sister Jessy, also considered promising,
dances with the company, too. He suffered through the misery that
hits new company members who have been acclaimed in school but now
have few challenges in the corps. Then he began to get featured
roles and was told by the company, though encouragingly, that he
would have to clean up his dancing and make it more classically
pure. Dancing the technically demanding role of Bluebird in
``Sleeping Beauty'' was his reward.
</P>
<P>
   Was there a moment when he realized he wanted to dance
professionally? ``When it happens, it's really weird. Dumb times,
like when I almost get hit by a cab. I think, Oh my God, this is my
body and that's what I use. My brain is almost worthless in my job.
I'm carrying around my whole career with me. Other people can leave
it in their computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Martins' new ``Harmonielehre,'' he adds, does require an active
brain. It is ``a cool ballet'' but difficult because of its complex
score by John Adams: ``My calves are swollen from tapping my foot
to the music in the wings,'' he said, laughing. ``Trying to hear
the beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson will spend his week off, before City Ballet opens on
July 5 in Saratoga, teaching at the Central Pennsylvania Youth
Ballet. He talks of Stanley Williams, a much-admired teacher at the
School of American Ballet who died in 1997. ``I loved Stanley to no
end. I want to teach his way. If he hadn't been there, I wouldn't
be here. And just the struggle I had keeping things up after he
died that last year made me feel like I needed to go back home and
teach there.''
</P>
<P>
   HOPE L. BOYKIN
</P>
<P>
   Hope L. Boykin is, like Hendrickson, the rare dancer who loves
to teach. It was not a skill she noticed much as a student in
Nina's School of Dance in Durham, N.C., where she was born. She was
just happy that she, a black child with her share of baby fat, was
accepted as a dancer by Nina Wheeler, the school director, and her
teacher Jennifer Potts. They encouraged her to go on to the
American Dance Festival in Durham, where she trained on a work
scholarship and came to know and be influenced by such
choreographers as Pearl Primus, Talley Beatty and Donald McKayle.
</P>
<P>
   To calm her mother's worries about her interest in dancing, she
enrolled in Howard University, where she majored in psychology
before dropping out. ``I wanted to dance, but I didn't really know
it,'' Boykin, who is 28, recalled. She began performing with the
New World Dance Company in Washington and then came north to New
York City at the encouragement of Chris Freeman, a dancer who put
her up in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   She landed a job with Rhoden's Complexions company where,
dancing with Richardson, a dance hero of hers, she suddenly
understood that she wanted a career in dance. ``I was just having a
good time at Nina's,'' she said. ``At Ailey, I was just seeing how
far I could get. Four pirouettes tomorrow instead of three today.
But standing next to Desmond I thought, `I can do this. I could
live my life like this.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Boykin joined Philadanco, her first major dance troupe, six
years ago. She will leave after the Joyce season to join Ailey,
just in time for the Lincoln Center Festival. ``I learned so much
at Philadanco,'' she said regretfully. ``There is no dancing like
the dance there.'' Much of her life and those of other black
performers of her generation will be reflected in the program in
which she will perform. Called ``On the Shoulders of Our
Ancestors,'' it pays tribute to pioneers like McKayle and Primus
and Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   She attributes her look of being entirely present in the moment
to her struggles to become a dancer. ``When you see something you
like, take it, try to nurture it,'' Boykin said. ``Take everything
you've learned and lay it on the line. I also pray for guidance
before every show. I want people to know that it is not me but my
Lord that has helped me overcome the obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   She recognizes the same struggles in her students at the
University of the Arts in Philadelphia. ``I know that times are
hard for them. Dancers are a dime a dozen. You have to have your
special thing. A lot of them can't finish school, or have been told
they can't dance, that they are too heavy. I want them to know that
if they really want this, it's theirs. They can give it away but no
one can take it from them. They have brought me so much joy. They
made me know what I want to do after the dance is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Will these performers make it into the first ranks of dance? To
be a professional dancer in a major company is to sink or rise with
equal unexpectedness. Anna Liceica, a big-eyed and piquant
ballerina who arrived at Ballet Theater via the National Ballet
School in Bucharest in Romania and the City Ballet, was surprised
when she was summoned recently to the office of Kevin McKenzie,
Ballet Theater's artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice of you to talk to each of your dancers during the
crazy Met season,'' she told McKenzie. But he had not called her in
for a chat, he said. Her heart sank. Was she about to get fired?
But the news was good, though a total surprise. She was being
promoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work for it,'' Liceica said. ``It's your dream. But it's
not going to change much. It's nice to be acknowledged, but now
I'll work even harder.''

15 NATIONS NAMED AS MONEY-LAUNDERING CENTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rich nations on Thursday named 15 countries and
territories, including Israel, the Philippines and Russia, as
potential havens for ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The list is the culmination of a decadelong effort to act
against money-laundering centers. It was issued after United States
and European officials grew concerned that bank secrecy and weak
regulation in some nations contributed to the devastating financial
turmoil in Asia and Latin America in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The action does not punish the named countries or cut them from
the world financial system. But it effectively warns banks and
brokerage houses to scrutinize all financial transactions with
customers in those countries as possibly linked to crime or
high-risk transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and several European nations said they would
follow up with bank advisories and criminal sanctions that would
have the effect of driving legitimate financial business from the
listed centers, depriving them of a lucrative source of tax
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the havens were well known in banking circles, but
wealthy nations had not agreed to identify them publicly. One
concern was diplomatic protocol. Some countries like Israel and
Russia have long been spared serious scrutiny because of their
influence. Some smaller island nations and territories relied on
former colonial masters like Britain and France to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   The list of ``noncooperative'' nations was drawn up by the
Financial Action Task Force, a body created in 1989 by the Group of
7 wealthy countries to fight money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The countries on the list are the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands,
the Cook Islands, Dominica, Israel, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, the
Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Panama, the Philippines, Russia, St.
Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland, which has a reputation for jealously guarding
banking customers' identities with a numbered system, no longer
shields criminal assets and generally cooperates with foreign
investigators, U.S. officials said. It is a member of the group
that drew up the list.
</P>
<P>
   Governments decided to pressure laundering centers in part
because the sheer volume of transactions by drug cartels, mafias
and corrupt officials has expanded dramatically, to at least $600
billion a year, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The greater impetus was from a succession of market-shaking
crises made possible, the thinking goes, by the ease of moving
giant sums of money around the globe. Speculators used financial
havens to shield themselves from scrutiny as they focused on Asian
and Latin American currencies, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Destabilizing capital flight from Russia, most notably the $7
billion handled by the Bank of New York and investigated by U.S.
officials last year, was impossible to stop, because some nations
including Russia did not have laws against laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, leading banks and regulators knew little about
transactions that Long-Term Capital Management, a giant Connecticut
hedge fund, had worked on because the fund did much of its business
through offshore centers. Long-Term Capital melted down in late
1998, rattling markets and prompting a $3.6 billion bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who made combating
laundering and tax evasion a priority for the Clinton
administration, hailed the list. Washington ``welcomes this
landmark step to limit the capacity of drug dealers, terrorists,
organized criminals and corrupt foreign officials to launder their
ill-gotten gains through safe havens,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   The final list was selected from 29 nations or territories that
do not criminalize laundering or that have serious deficiencies in
their banking regulation. The other 14, including Cyprus, Gibraltar
and Malta, have reformed their systems or passed legislation to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which has a first-world system in most respects,
appeared on the list because its Parliament has failed to pass
legislation to make laundering illegal and set up an enforcement
mechanism, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli politicians have opposed tough money-laundering
laws because they argue that Russian Jews, who have transferred
billions of dollars to Israel in recent years, might be less
willing to do so, sacrificing Israel's status as a financial haven.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they hoped that Israel
would act on laundering legislation soon.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Laurent Fabius of France said his country would
lobby other industrialized nations to pressure the 15 havens if
they do not act to be taken off the list. One option, Fabius said,
is to ban all financial transactions between those countries and
banks and brokerage houses elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan M. Winer, a former State Department official who
specialized in fighting money laundering, said most major nations
preferred to jawbone financial havens behind closed doors and long
resisted the so-called ``name and shame'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   Several nations objected to being on the list. Many issued no
formal statements.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Liechtenstein said it was being unfairly singled
out for practices that are common elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A statement by the Cayman Islands said that it was
``astonished'' that it was on the list after having worked to
comply with demands from the task force. The government said that
it had repeatedly invited representatives of the group to visit the
Caribbean territory, but that the invitation had been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``While no one can claim to be perfect,'' Financial Secretary
George McCarthy said, ``we are entitled to be accorded reasonable
opportunity to make our case.'' The Bahamas issued a similar
statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Herbalife International was built on Mark Hughes' story.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager who had spent time in a reform school, Hughes saw
his mother die from an accidental overdose of prescription diet
pills and set out to find a safer, better way to help people lose
weight. At 23, with only a ninth-grade education and after stints
with two direct-sales weight-loss companies that went out of
business, he went out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   He found a formula and started selling. His grandmother was his
first success, and her example brought in friends as new customers.
``Lose Weight Now, Ask Me How,'' became the mantra for Herbalife,
which started in the trunk of Hughes' car in 1980. It found its
footing in a small storefront in Beverly Hills, Calif., and grew
into a weight-loss, nutrition and personal care products company
with worldwide sales of nearly $1.7 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 21, the Hughes story came to a tragic, almost ironic
end when Hughes was found dead in the bedroom of the $25 million
Malibu beachfront house that he shared with his third wife, Darcy
LaPier. The company said he had drunk alcohol at a birthday party
for his 87-year-old grandmother at his home and later took the
antidepressant Doxepin, which had been prescribed to help him
sleep. Officials ruled the death an accident, noting that neither
the drugs nor the alcohol in his system would have been fatal
alone. But the combination was lethal.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the handsome and charismatic Hughes at 44 is a
serious blow for the company _ both because he was Herbalife's head
cheerleader and because of the possibility that his message of a
better life through herbal products might be diminished by the way
he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously an image problem,'' said Scott Hood, portfolio
manager at First Wilshire Securities Management, which has owned
Herbalife shares since late 1989. ``But how bad is it? It's not
like he was taking their own products.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond image, though, a number of other issues face the
executives who now run the company. A new team has taken up the
challenge of motivating and expanding a vast network of
distributors who buy the products from the company and in turn
recruit new distributors. Other worries include a slumping domestic
market for herbal products, a tight job market that could make it
more difficult to draw in distributors, a damaged relationship with
Wall Street after a failed attempt to take the company private, and
stock transactions that left investors crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 58 percent of the stock is now held in a trust. The
trustees are Christopher Pair, formerly the chief operating officer
of Herbalife and now the president and chief executive; Conrad
Klein, the chief business affairs officer and a longtime legal
adviser to the company; and Jack Reynolds, Hughes' father. (As a
young man, Hughes took his mother's maiden name.)
</P>
<P>
   Pair, who was a counselor at the reform school that Hughes
attended and later became a friend, said in an interview at company
headquarters in Los Angeles that he had no intention of trying to
substitute for Hughes, who at his death was chairman, president and
chief executive of the company..
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never fill his shoes,'' he said, adding with a
chuckle, ``I don't have his looks.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say he does not have a story to share with
distributors. When Pair was a young man, overweight and struggling
with back problems, Hughes persuaded him to try his product, a
weight-loss powder that was so new it came in plastic bags rather
than cans.
</P>
<P>
   He said he dropped 50 pounds in four months and became a
distributor for a short period before returning to the University
of Redlands in California to get his business degree. Though he
says his experience as a distributor will help him in managing the
company, he intends to focus more on operations and on mending the
relationship with Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   To motivate distributors, he said, there are plenty of other
stories to be told and thousands of hours of tapes of Mark Hughes
selling his vision.
</P>
<P>
   On Herbalife's Web site (www.herbalife.com), the voice of Hughes
still tells how his mother ``totally destroyed her life just trying
to lose 30 pounds'' as the company promotes its vision of realizing
monetary dreams through selling its vast array of products. Beyond
its core weight-loss and nutritional supplements, they feature a
wide variety of skin-care items, vitamins, shampoos, even a natural
sleep product. Among the company's competitors are Amway, Nature's
Sunshine and Weider Nutrition International.
</P>
<P>
   To keep Hughes' message fresh, Herbalife will rely more on the
stories of its top sellers. Members of the Chairman's Club, who
have networks bringing in more than $1 million a year, and members
of the President's Team, those making more than $200,000, already
train new distributors and conduct seminars, and those elite
categories give distributors a goal to strive for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success is just a reflection of his power,'' said Paco
Perez, who was a bellboy at an airport hotel in Los Angeles before
becoming Hughes' first employee and is now a member of the
President's Team. ``He taught us all by example. We're committed to
his dream.''
</P>
<P>
   To realize that dream, the network must keep growing. Despite
setbacks, it has always done just that.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, the company came under intense scrutiny by
regulators. The company paid $850,000 to settle a lawsuit by the
state of California that accused it of having made false medical
claims and having run an illegal marketing scheme. The Food and
Drug Administration forced it to remove two products from the
market for relabeling.
</P>
<P>
   Business issues have been of more concern in recent years.
Currency turmoil in Asia and Russia resulted in a steep drop in the
stock price, and Wall Street developed concerns about how the
company, which went public in 1986, was handling its stock and how
it was preparing to go private again.
</P>
<P>
   Though officials say the product and marketing issues of the
1980s did not amount to much and are of no concern now, Pair said
he would focus on rebuilding the company's relationship with Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Crawford, an analyst with B. Riley &AMP; Co., a Los Angeles
brokerage house, said, ``There's one significant hurdle standing in
the way of Herbalife regaining the trust of Wall Street, and that's
showing management is there for shareholders and not for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, whose firm stopped covering Herbalife last year, noted
that in 1998 management stock options with original strike prices
of about $14 were reset between $6.63 and $8. Such a move is not
uncommon when a company's stock price drops, as Herbalife's did
then, but this adjustment would have meant large profits for
executives had Hughes' buyback attempt gone through at $17.81 a
share. That effort, which would have repurchased all the company's
stock, was terminated because of bond market turmoil and increased
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Also of concern was a complex transaction in 1998 in which
Hughes ultimately received $18 a share for 5 million shares. Add to
that the buyback attempt, which led to a lawsuit by shareholders
who felt the offer was too low, and Pair has plenty to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we've had some very valid issues internally,'' he said,
referring to the legal fees and other costs of the buyback attempt,
``the company is extraordinarily sound, the distributor base is
absolutely committed to building the business, and we've got a
management team in place that is going to continue to do what Mark
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Pair said he would try to increase the price of the stock, which
he says is greatly undervalued. It closed at $8 Thursday on Nasdaq,
down from a 52-week high of $16.375 on Jan. 14. He declined to
offer specifics before sharing them with shareholders in July, but
he said plans call for continuing overseas expansion and adding new
products and new technology to aid distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's over 130 countries in the world; we're in 49,'' Pair
said. ``We haven't even touched China yet, which is going to be
potentially the biggest market in the world for direct selling.''
</P>
<P>
   He said at least a dozen products were being developed for the
United States, probably six to eight of which will come on the
market next year. Extensive new products are also to be introduced
in Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Some institutional investors agree that the stock is
undervalued. They note that the company, with nearly $100 million
in cash (over $3 a share) and no long-term debt, trades at 4.6
times earnings and pays a 7.8 percent dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said Herbalife's new team could send Wall Street a
strong message by buying back shares and returning the value to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   At such a low price, he said, the company is an attractive
takeover target, particularly to a company looking for a strong
distribution base. Herbalife has about 750,000 distributors
throughout the world and recently began operations in Ireland and
India. Though analysts say Herbalife has been able to maintain its
domestic sales while sales have slid at other companies selling
herbal products, there are concerns that with the job market tight
Herbalife will have a hard time holding distributors and finding
new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Herbalife said that it had not found that to be a problem and
that the strong economy was resulting in more sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Boesenberg, a Los Angeles distributor who was called at
random last week, said she would stop selling Herbalife in August
after 24 years. She said her decision was made before Mark Hughes'
death and was based on lack of sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very fickle about vitamins, and I'm tired of having
people order thousands of dollars of vitamins only to get stuck
with them,'' she said. ``There's too much other stuff out there to
choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   She also cited an increase, to 7 percent, in shipping and
handling charges, which she said she had to pay even if she drove
to a warehouse to pick up supplies. In addition, she said,
distributors who had brought her in, as well as those she had
recruited, were gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've signed up a total of five or six distributors in the time
I've done this, and they've all dropped out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hughes' death, though, she did not expect that to have
any negative effect ``for the people who believe in Herbalife.''
</P>
<P>
   A conference in Philadelphia the weekend after the coroner's
report about Hughes' death supported her speculation.
</P>
<P>
   John Tartol, a Malibu-based distributor who is part of the
Chairman's Club, said 3,500 distributors turned out.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had expected to get phone calls after the release of
the coroner's report. Only one came. He also expected distributors
at the conference in Philadelphia to have questions about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not concerned,'' he said, adding that Hughes had
struggled with pneumonia and asthma this year, perhaps coming back
to work too quickly and weakening himself. ``It's kind of
interesting there's been a new commitment. We're going to go out
there and do it for Mark.''

 OF EGGS AND SINGLE BASKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 25)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As baby boomers, we are getting a reputation. We take heat for
our questionable cell-phone habits, the big trucks we drive and our
overall obsession with money. Now investment advisers are shaking
their heads over how we invest. We are, they say, incredibly
risk-prone and oblivious to the lessons of history.
</P>
<P>
   We know that, of course, and it seems that many of us don't
care.
</P>
<P>
   But I do. I stubbornly hang on to my Coca-Cola and Disney stock,
refusing to dump these stodgy issues and invest in dot-coms. I own
Treasury bills. About 45 percent of my 401(k) account is in
money-market and bond funds, the remainder in a stock fund. I have
four children, and that makes me cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the rest of my generation, said Steven W. Kaye, president
of the American Economic Planning Group in Watchung, N.J. Kaye
advises many people my age and is amazed at the chances they take.
</P>
<P>
   ``No group in history has taken on the risks that the baby
boomer generation has,'' he said. ``People were more diversified in
the past. The generation just before the boomers had a high
concentration of health stocks, but nothing like the baby boomers
and their technology craze. The group as a whole doesn't seem to
care about risk as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mucciolo, 45, president of Medianet Inc., a Manhattan
company that teaches people how to make presentations, said he does
care _ but is confident that he has made the right choice. Almost
all of his investments are in stocks, and about 65 percent of those
are technology companies. Yes, he knows it's risky. Yes, he knows
he's not diversified. ``I'm banking on technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to an investment adviser, they'll say this guy
should have his head examined,'' Mucciolo added. ``But I'm
comfortable with the risk, because it is my risk. I have continual
earnings power and time to recover'' if the market falls.
</P>
<P>
   Howard S. Cohen, 49, a cardiologist in Warren, N.J., said he has
about 80 percent of his portfolio in technology stocks. Like
Mucciolo, he is confident in the sector, and in his ability to
recover from any downturn. Still, he said, his position makes him
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, I'm scared,'' he said about the spring meltdown in the
Nasdaq. ``When the stock market takes a 30 percent correction, and
I'm looking at my savings taking a 30 percent hit, it's very
unsettling.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he watches the market closely and that he would
become more conservative if the market fell into an extended
decline, an event he conceded he has never experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye says that is part of the problem. ``Older people have a
better chance of remembering 1972 through '74,'' he said. ``Boomers
can't conceive that the S&AMP;P could lose 50 percent over a three-year
period. We're seeing them not being afraid to put 70 percent of
their money in technology, because they think that's where the
entire future is. They don't realize that there have been other
booms and busts, like oil stocks in the early 1980's.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some boomers had another habit: loading up exclusively
on their employer's stock, leaving them doubly vulnerable if their
company falters.
</P>
<P>
   Diane M. Hogan, 43, of Flemington, N.J. accepted that risk with
her company, Charles Schwab, which at one time made up most of her
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   She bought the stock through the employee stock plan, and
although she said many friends thought she was crazy, she stuck
with the strategy for more than a decade. When she left Schwab last
year, the value of her stock had grown to about $4 million. It's
hard to point fingers when a strategy works. ``I don't want to say
that it was dumb luck, but I just left it there and forgot about
it,'' she said. ``I never thought that I would become a
multimillionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   She has since sold much of the Schwab stock, but she remains
about 70 percent invested in equities _ although in a more diverse
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very risky person,'' she said. ``I sort of feel that you
have to take some chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Not with my money, I don't. Those four college educations I'm
facing chase me to work every day, and I'm not about to start
playing with the money I've worked so hard to put aside. When my
T-bills mature, I'm planning to roll them over, not put the money
in the latest start-up. I don't have the stomach for what Mucciolo
thinks is fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game itself is the excitement, more than the actual
reward,'' he said. ``If every stock went up 1,000 percent, would I
stop playing? No, because it's about the activity, not the result
of the activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Cohen said: ``It's almost like going on a roller-coaster.
You look forward to it, it's scary, but if you get through it
successfully, it was quite a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, I hate roller-coasters.

BUSH INSISTS NO INNOCENTS EXECUTED `ON MY WATCH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, in an interview hours
before the scheduled execution of convicted murderer Gary Graham,
insisted Thursday that ``under my watch'' no innocent person has
been put to death in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's claim of innocence had been ``looked at a lot'' at all
levels of the court system, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has approved 132 executions while issuing only a
single 30-day stay since he became governor in 1995, said he wants
to know about DNA evidence when it is available because ``we should
be very careful in death penalty cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican presidential candidate said he was not swayed
by the Scripps Howard Texas Poll published Thursday in which 57
percent of Texans said they believe innocent people have been
executed, nor moved in the Graham case by the fact that ``we've got
two or three jurors who say they're not sure anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all being weighed out, there is a process in the state
of Texas,'' Bush said in an interview that was conducted just
before the Texas parole board rejected Graham's clemency appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man had access to, gosh, I want to say 30 different
judges,'' Bush said. ``This is a case that has had full analyzation
and has been looked at a lot. I understand the emotionality of
death penalty cases. A lot of people did not support the death
penalty. I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   With Texas scheduled to execute an average of one man a week
through Election Day, the death penalty has become a campaign issue
that won't go away for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators dogged Bush throughout his three-day campaign tour
of the West Coast this week, but he shruged off any consequences
the Graham execution could pose to his bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent 45 minutes Thursday fielding questions from a small
group of reporters. He commented on topics ranging from fan
violence at baseball games to his very private search for a vice
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   He touched on Northwest regional environmental issues, accusing
the Clinton administration of wanting to breach four dams on the
lower Snake River, and saying that Vice President Al Gore refuses
to take a stand on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salmon runs in the lower Columbia are the highest they've
been in years,'' Bush said. He said the government ``should not
destroy the whole way of life in Eastern Washington and Eastern
Oregon'' to restore threatened fish populations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, former part-owner of the Texas Rangers, gave reporters a
brief tour of his private office, proudly displaying two cabinets
filled with autographed baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   He said he agrees with the stiff fines and penalties handed out
by baseball's new enforcer, former Major Leaguer Frank Robinson.
``I believe in discipline,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   With the eyes of the nation on Texas, however, Bush found
himself defending his exercise of life-and-death responsibility in
a state that executed 35 prisoners in 1999 and has more than 450
people on its death row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've reviewed every case and I'm confident no innocent person
has been put to death,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was convicted and sentenced to death for killing a man
during a 1981 supermarket robbery, based on the testimony of a
single eyewitness. He was represented by Ronald Mock, an attorney
who has been disciplined five times. Mock has defended 19 capital
murder cases in which 16 of the defendants have been sentenced to
death. Three of the defendants have been executed while Bush was
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Two eyewitnesses to the 1981 murder have said the killer did not
fit Graham's appearance. ``The prosecutor gave the names and
addresses to defense counsel and they were never investigated and
never testified in a court of law,'' Jack Zimmerman, Graham's
appellate lawyer, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted that the Board of Pardons and Parole was carefully
weighing all evidence, including new evidence given by a court
bailiff. ``The bailiff said, `Well, on the way out of court, Gary
Graham said next time there won't be any living witnesses','' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he welcomes the debate over the death penalty,
believes it is ``healthy for democracy,'' and that it is ``fine''
that people have traveled to Texas to protest the execution of
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their right for people to come to express their opinion,
but I'm going to uphold the law,'' Bush said. ``I'm sworn to uphold
the law. It's my job and I'm going to uphold the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposed a 1999 legislative proposal to ban the execution of
defendants who were mentally retarded, and opposed legislation that
would have required the pardons board to put on public meetings in
cases of clemency requests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has vetoed bills requiring appointment of counsel for
indigent defendants within 20 days, and a bill that allowed
counties to take the power to appoint defense attorneys from
elected judges who have been accused of naming political cronies.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty has wide support in Texas. The Texas Poll
showed 73 percent of Texans backing executions even while, by a
57-23 ratio, believing that innocent defendants have been put to
death in the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Bush appeared highly committed to maintaining
states' rights and prerogatives when it comes to the prosecution of
high-profile crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Askd if he would support the bipartisan Innocence Protection Act
_ a U.S. Senate bill that gives a federal right to DNA testing in
death penalty cases _ Bush said he is not familar enough with
provisions of the bill to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is DNA evidence relative to the particulars of a
case, I want to know,'' he said. Bush noted DNA questions in the
one case in which he has issued a stay of execution, for a man
named Ricky McGinn convicted for the 1993 rape and murder of his
12-year-old stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes that McGinn clearly committed the murder,
but that new tests could bring his exoneration on the rape
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush voiced reservations about legislation, which passed the
Senate earlier this week, providing for an expanded federal role in
prosecuting hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some misgivings and the main misgiving is that the
federal government overrides, (resulting in) the federalization of
criminal laws at the state level,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the bill would help states like Texas
prosecute hate crimes, the Byrd case is a good example, I would
appreciate federal help in the prosecution of hate crimes,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was referring to the case of James Byrd Jr., a black man
who was dragged to his death behind a pickup truck in Jasper,
Texas. The state provided financial aid to the rural county that
successfully prosecuted his killers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lead over Gore has been growing in recent public opinion
polls, but he said the gains haven't gone to his head. ``I'm not
even close to thinking about a Cabinet,'' he said. ``I haven't even
won.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that he has a ``judgment and vision'' lacking in Gore,
and proposals for reform of Social Security and education that will
sustain the nation's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a tough competitor, by the way,'' he added. ``That's what
the primaries showed, that I could take a punch and come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he takes seriously statements by his presidential
rival Sen. John McCain that he does not want to be considered for
the vice presidency, and retired Gen. Colin Powell's statement that
he is ``genuinely not interested'' in the No. 2 spot on the GOP
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   On the selection of a running mate, Bush added, ``There's only
three people who know what's going on: Dick, myself and my wife.''
Former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney is in charge of vetting
potential GOP vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave a philosophical answer when asked about what
punishment he would suppport if abortion were once again made
illegal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission is to encourage respect for life,'' Bush replied.
He said such respect should extend not just to the unborn, but to
the elderly and children in schools who have been victims of
indiscriminate violence.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Bush added, he would ``focus on the common ground.
The common ground that exists today is on partial birth abortion.''
He said he would penalize doctors performing such operations, but
not their patients.

FLU VACCINE IS DELAYED BY MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shipments of influenza vaccine for the fall will be
significantly delayed and there may be shortages because of
manufacturing problems, federal officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In disclosing the surprising development, the officials told
clinics, hospitals and other health care providers to delay mass
influenza immunization campaigns for at least a month and to make
provisions to immunize people at highest risk first. Preparations
are now under way for the immunizations, which are usually
conducted from October through mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment delay was attributed in part to laboratory
difficulties in growing two new influenza strains in this year's
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Shipment delays of up to one month have occurred in earlier
years, but Dr. Nancy Cox, chief of the influenza branch at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said, ``We
have never had a situation where all manufacturers were having a
similar problem with a strain.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Food and Drug Administration has ordered two of the
four U.S. manufacturers to correct other production problems at
their plants. The problems were not specified.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put it all together, we have to deliver a message we
haven't had to deliver before, which is that mass vaccination
programs be held later,'' Dr. Cox said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials expect a record number of Americans to be
immunized in the fall because officials have lowered to 50 years
the age at which all people are advised to get a flu shot.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known exactly how many Americans take the vaccine each
year, but health officials estimated that 70 million were immunized
last year. An estimated 2 million to 4 million Americans 50 to 64
years old are expected to be immunized against influenza for the
first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because the influenza virus mutates, the vaccine is altered each
year to account for the strains expected to circulate during the
flu season. This year, as usual, the vaccine protects against three
strains. The two new ones are A/Panama and A/New Caledonia; the
third, B/Yamanashi, was in last year's vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the difficulties in growing the strains are
being resolved, but it will take longer to produce the same amount
of vaccine as last year,'' Dr. Cox said. Experts at the FDA and the
CDC, at a meeting in Atlanta, said it would take up to two months
to determine how much vaccine would be available for this flu
season.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said they and the manufacturers were confident
that the supply would be sufficient to immunize those at highest
risk of complications from influenza. They include people 65 and
older; those suffering from diabetes and other chronic ailments of
the heart, lungs and kidneys; and people whose immune systems are
suppressed because of cancer treatment or AIDS. The high-risk group
also includes women more than three months pregnant during the flu
season, residents of chronic care facilities and people in close or
frequent contact with high-risk groups.
</P>
<P>
   Because flu season rarely peaks before late December,
vaccination campaigns conducted in November will allow recipients
to develop immunity, a process that takes one to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown influenza vaccine to be 70 percent to 90
percent effective in preventing illness among healthy young men,
and less effective among older people and those with chronic
ailments. But the vaccine is effective in reducing
influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths among older adults.
</P>
<P>
   The four manufacturers are Evans Medical, an affiliate of Medeva
Pharmaceuticals; Aventis-Pasteur; Parkedale Pharmaceuticals; and
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said Parkedale was told in March to cease production and
distribution of influenza vaccine until it had corrected problems
the agency had identified. Wyeth-Ayerst is the other manufacturer
that the FDA has cited for production problems.

PHOTOS SUGGEST MARS MAY HAVE RESERVOIRS OF HIDDEN WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The standard description of Mars as cold, desolate
and dry may have to be revised slightly. It now appears that Mars
may have reservoirs of liquid water hidden under parts of its icy
surface, a finding that could profoundly affect the search for life
there, scientists said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures taken from orbit by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor
spacecraft have disclosed features in numerous locations that look
like gullies formed by flowing water carrying rocks and debris to
the bottom of craters, according to a study released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by Dr. Michael C. Malin and Dr. Kenneth S. Edgett of
Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, said that evidence
suggested these water flows happened in recent geological time,
perhaps just a few hundreds, thousands or millions of years ago
instead of billions of years in the past. And the researchers said
it may still be occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see features that look like gullies formed by flowing water
and the deposits of soil and rocks transported by these flows,''
said Malin, whose company built the spacecraft camera that made the
images. ``These features appear to be so young that they might be
forming today.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Thursday at NASA headquarters, the
researchers said there was ample evidence that water once flowed on
Mars in abundance, leaving ancient river beds and the markings of
huge oceans. One of the big questions about Mars, Edgett said, has
been, ``Where did the water go?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The new pictures from Global Surveyor tell us part of the
answer,'' he said. ``Some of that water went underground, and quite
possibly it's still there.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, whose study will be published next week in the
journal Science, said that they found evidence for the flow of
liquid water in 150 of 65,000 photos taken by the Surveyor's high
resolution camera over the last two years. The evidence of water
movement, in the form of gullies and channels terminating into
fan-like deltas, appears recent because surfaces around these
features are smooth and relatively light in color. Older areas on
the planet are pocked with craters and covered with a dark dust,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Both researchers said they were surprised by evidence of
possible present-day water because the finding does not fit into
current models of what Mars is like. Most of the spots that appear
to be the source of flowing water are on slopes with exposed rock
layers, they said, raising the possibility that liquid water is
trapped below these layers and is freed by a surface shift.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael H. Carr, a planetary geologist with the U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., called the images
``exciting,'' saying the gullies and channels looked like
water-worn features seen when flying over the western United
States. However, he said he was skeptical about the researchers'
theory that there was liquid water in layers 300 to 1,300 feet
below the surface that occasionally burst out from the walls of
certain craters and canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, author of ``Water on Mars'' (Oxford, 1996), said Mars is
so cold, with an average temperature of 60 degrees below zero
Fahrenheit, that any water that near the surface should be frozen
solid. While the new pictures show important, new Martian features,
he said, he is skeptical of the explanations for the apparent
flows. ``Either this interpretation is wrong or there is some
mechanism we don't know of to keep water liquid under these
conditions,'' Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   Edgett said a possible explanation for the features was that
water, kept liquid by a still-unknown means, would freeze and form
an ice dam as it flowed from an underground source. The ice dam
would retard the flow until there was enough force to break through
the barrier, sending the water in a rapid cascade down the slope,
much like a flash flood. The water would quickly freeze as its
motion slowed and then quickly boil off into gas because of the
planet's low atmospheric pressure, he said, but not before
spreading rocks and mud down the slope.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward J. Weiler, NASA's chief scientist, said that if there
was liquid water on Mars, it would have profound implications for
the question of life on the planet, both in the past and today, and
where to search for it. ``If life ever did develop there, and if it
survives to the present time, then these landforms would be great
places to look,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler said that the findings would have to be verified and
explained if they were to become widely accepted. And he cautioned
against exaggerating the discovery, alluding to some news reports
on the find in recent days. ``There is possible evidence of liquid
water,'' he said. ``They have not found lakes or rivers flowing on
Mars. They have not found hot springs. They certainly have not
found hot tubs with Martians in them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the presence of subsurface water was proved, Weiler said, it
could fuel a desire to send humans to Mars. Water would make a
human trip more feasible and economical because it could be used to
make oxygen for astronauts to breathe and hydrogen for fuel for the
return trip to Earth. But a human trip would only come after
extensive robot missions to explore the planet and find the best
landing sites, he said, an effort that could take decades.

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's aides initially thought that they had the
perfect plan for building a missile shield over the United States,
a system that would guard against nuclear, biological and chemical
threats without plunging the United States into a bitter tug of war
with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   To ease Moscow's concerns, the system would be built at Grand
Forks, N.D., the only place where a limited defense could be
deployed under an exception carved out in the Antiballistic Missile
Treaty that the United States signed with the Soviet Union in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   But then computer simulations demonstrated that the system could
not cover the westernmost islands in the Aleutians. And while only
several thousand people lived on these remote reaches of Alaska, no
one in the Clinton administration was about to tell Sen. Ted
Stevens, the powerful Alaska Republican who is chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, that the world's
most elaborate missile defense system would not protect some of his
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every computer run we ran showed that we could not get to the
four westernmost islands of the Aleutians or two westernmost
uninhabited in Hawaii,'' a former administration official said.
``The Pentagon charts had red on Alaska and Hawaii, meaning we
could not cover all parts of those states.''
</P>
<P>
   Those red spots, and a complex debate among government lawyers
over how to interpret the treaty, killed the Grand Forks option.
Soon plans were approved to put 100 missile interceptors and a new
battle-management radar in Alaska, raising the projected cost by $2
billion. The administration began pushing to amend the ABM treaty,
and Washington found itself enmeshed in a debate that has soured
relations with Russia, unnerved America's allies in Europe and
provoked fears of a new arms race in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has long argued that its plan to build a
limited missile defense was a response to emerging missile threats
from countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq. But a
reconstruction of the decision-making involved in the plan shows
that as with the decision to protect the Aleutian Islands, both the
administration and its Republican rivals have long been motivated
by domestic political calculations as well as by strategic
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   A major aim of the administration plan has been to protect
Clinton _ and more important, Vice President Al Gore, the presumed
Democratic presidential candidate _ against Republican charges that
the Democrats have been soft on defense, according to
administration officials and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's initial anti-missile plan was forged in
negotiations with congressional leaders as the White House sought
to defuse the missile defense issue before the 1996 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Gore and Governor George W. Bush of Texas have both
called for some version of a missile shield even before crucial
tests of the technology, and before U.S. intelligence experts had
completed an assessment of how Russia, China, North Korea and other
nations would be likely to respond to a such a system.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. diplomats have been sent around the world to discuss the
worries of the Russians, Chinese and Western Europeans, they are
trying to make the best case for a U.S. decision that appears to be
all but made.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may defer the deployment decision to a successor, but
there seems to be too much political momentum behind the idea of an
anti-missile system for the United States to abandon it now. While
there is still intense debate among scientists about the
feasibility of the administration's plan, the guiding assumption in
the Pentagon is that sooner or later the technology can work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, insists that
political considerations have played no role in the decision and
that the administration is tackling a complex and thankless issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proposal is based on our analysis of the emerging threat
and our commitment to maintain the core of the ABM treaty, which
contributes to stability and to the efforts of the U.S. and Russia
to control the process of reducing nuclear weapons,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   But veterans of Washington's bare-knuckled battles over arms
control say politics has played an enormous role in the debate over
whether to deploy such a system. In their view, it is politics that
is stampeding the United States into a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian, China and the NATO allies have become virtual
bystanders in this debate,'' said Thomas Graham Jr., an arms
control specialist who served as Clinton's special ambassador on
proliferation issues. ``The real fight is being waged in
Washington, and it is much more about politics than the threat.''

<P>
   The Politics: Stealing Thunder Of Republicans
</P>
<P>
   How support for a missile defense system became a political
litmus test is a tale of raw partisan politics, bitter fights over
secret intelligence reports and an evolving missile threat.
</P>
<P>
   Missile defense seemed to be little more than a footnote to
history when Clinton took office in 1992. The Soviet Union had
collapsed and seemingly with it President Ronald Reagan's bold
dream of a ``Star Wars'' defense against ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   With the encouragement of the military, the Clinton
administration reorganized the Pentagon's research on anti-missile
systems, giving priority to systems for protecting U.S. troops from
attack by short-range and medium-range rockets and playing down
defenses to protect the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But as Clinton prepared for the 1996 re-election campaign, the
politics of missile defense intensified. Republicans, after winning
control of the House in the 1994 election, pressed to revive a
version of Reagan's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that challenge, Clinton used one of his time-tested
tactics: He stole the Republicans' thunder by co-opting their
position.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, seeking to hammer out a bipartisan compromise, the
White House opened negotiations with four Senate leaders: Sam Nunn,
D-Ga.; Carl Levin, D-Mich.; John Warner, R-Va., and William Cohen,
the Maine Republican whom Clinton later appointed secretary of
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The administration promised to develop the technology for an
anti-missile system within three years. That would put the United
States in position actually to deploy an anti-missile system within
a second-three year period if new missile threats emerged, or so
the White House argued. Hence, the plan became known as ``three
plus three.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of created the Pentagon program,'' Levin said in an
interview. ``We tried to encapsulate where we were going on
development.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another important assumption behind the strategy: The
first phase of any missile defense would be based at Grand Forks,
consistent with the ABM treaty. That would enable Washington to
avoid a diplomatic rupture with the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Senate Republicans signed off on the deal, but their
more hard-line colleagues in the House balked, and the effort to
forge a bipartisan consensus on missile defense fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton had signaled that he was prepared to consider a
limited missile defense to blunt his Republican critics, and
conservative Republicans had indicated that they were prepared to
one-up the Democrats by pushing for a more ambitious system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was both a classic example of how the Congress could drive
the defense debate and an example of Clinton's `New Democrat'
approach to defense,'' said Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate
at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ``Clinton was
able to say that he was all for missile defense and put the tough
decisions off to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Intelligence: A Second Review Sounds the Alarm
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, missile defense was not a big issue during
Clinton's re-election fight; Bob Dole, his Republican challenger,
barely mentioned it.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not take long before the debate re-emerged. This time
intelligence was the battleground.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had drawn comfort from a 1995 National
Intelligence Estimate, coordinated by the Central Intelligence
Agency, that concluded that nations like North Korea would need at
least 15 years to develop a missile that could strike the
continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers, however, objected to the implication that
there was no need to speed development of a missile shield, and
they set out to challenge it.
</P>
<P>
   Their first attempt failed. To review the intelligence report,
they established a panel whose chairman was Robert M. Gates, the
director of central intelligence during the Bush administration.
But its 1996 report basically supported the view of U.S.
intelligence experts.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, however, the Republicans tried again. This time
Congress set up a panel headed by Donald Rumsfeld, who was defense
secretary under President Ford and was at George W. Bush's side
recently when he unveiled his plan to build a more expansive
missile defense system if elected this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the nine members of the commission were picked by
Democrats, including Richard Garwin, a renowned physicist who is a
Republican but known for his fierce independence. Garwin recalled
in an interview that while Rumsfeld conducted the review in a
fair-minded manner, the panel's mandate was carefully drafted to
boost the case for anti-missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charge was cooked,'' Garwin said. ``We were not asked what
where the most likely ways in which the U.S. might be attacked and
how they compared to an ICBM. We were only asked to study the
long-range missile threat. Nor did they ask us what to do about it.
If they asked us about that, we would never have reached agreement
in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the commission's mandate was particularly important
because U.S. intelligence has concluded that there is a greater
risk that a foe would try to sneak a nuclear bomb or biological
weapons into the United States than attack it with a long-range
missile.
</P>
<P>
   The Rumsfeld panel report was published in July 1998, and soon
became one of the most influential documents in modern U.S.
military planning. India and Pakistan had recently exploded nuclear
bombs, catching the United States by surprise. It was a period when
military experts were particularly anxious about both the quality
of U.S. intelligence and third world threats.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp critique, the Rumsfeld panel concluded that U.S.
intelligence officials had been far too relaxed about missile
threats and noted that there were shortcuts that could be used to
develop such a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, time-consuming Russian or U.S.-style test programs
could be eliminated and a crude, inaccurate missile could be
developed to lob a nuclear weapon or a biological warhead at the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a distant threat,'' the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the criticism, U.S. intelligence later revised its
intelligence estimate, reflecting many of the Rumsfeld panel's
arguments.

 &HT;    Execution: Bush stands firm as killer meets fate
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Austin, Texas _ On the day set for Gary Graham's execution, Gov.
George W. Bush had arranged a session with political reporters from
around the country to talk about the progress of his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both men kept their appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sat down with the reporters in his office a couple of hours
before the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole re- fused to block
Graham's execution.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published Thursday in the Dallas Morning News showed that
73 percent of Texans agreed with Bush's support of the death
penalty. But 57 percent also said they believed innocent people
sometimes are put to death in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Was that acceptable? Bush was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not acceptable, and under my watch, I'm telling you
that I've analyzed every case, and I don't believe that's the case.
I'm confident that it's not the case _ that the people who have
been put to death have been guilty of the crime charged, and have
had full access to the courts,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Texas law gives the governor only limited powers to
intervene in capital cases _ powers already exhausted in the Graham
case by former Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat _ Bush has found
himself in a political bind over the past few days. He has been
held accountable for the execution, without technically having
anything he could do about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, serving his second term as governor, expressed
reluctance about changing the law to make the governor more
directly accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the governor have the power to say yes or no? Shall we
do away with the Board of Pardons and Parole? I don't think so,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the governor has the power to grant only a 30-day
reprieve in a death penalty case (he also appoints the parole
board), Bush said he has carefully reviewed every case during his
term, including that of Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case that has had full `analyzation' and been looked
at,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He said jurors from the Graham trial who expressed doubts in
recent days about their verdict may have been influenced by ``two
weeks of publicity suggesting . . . (that Graham might not be
guilty).''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also expressed misgivings about federal legislation
proposed by Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) that would establish a
right to DNA testing for people accused in capital cases and give
the federal government a larger role in investigating hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   While he said he would ``appreciate federal help on prosecuting
hate crimes,'' such as the murder of an African-American dragged
behind a truck in Jasper, Texas, Bush said he was concerned about
the federal government encroaching on the states' role in criminal
cases.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed a similar mis- giving about the DNA legislation,
but said he favored using DNA evidence when it can be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in fielding similar questions on the campaign trail,
Bush sought to soften some of the frictions between himself and
anti-death penalty demonstrators who have dogged his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious matter and I welcome the debate. I think
it's healthy for a democracy. But I'm sworn to uphold the law.
That's my job,'' Bush said.

MIGHTY DUCKS TAKE CHANCE BY MAKING HEBERT AVAILABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Guy Hebert has been a fixture in goal for the
Mighty Ducks since the beginning. He beat out Ron Tugnutt for the
No. 1 spot early in Anaheim's inaugural season (1993-94) and is the
last remaining original Duck.
</P>
<P>
   But general manager Pierre Gauthier took what he describes as a
``calculated risk'' when he decided not to protect the 33-year old
veteran in today's NHL Expansion Draft in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier, who used a second-round draft choice to acquire
promising young goalie Jean-Sebastian Giguere from Calgary on June
10, elected to protect only one goalie (Giguere) and gamble that
neither Minnesota or Columbus would want to take on the last two
years of Hebert's hefty contract.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert's deal _ which will pay him $3.6 million next season and
$3.8 million in 2001-2002 _ also includes a no-trade clause,
another thing Gauthier hopes will discourage the expansion teams.
</P>
<P>
   When Anaheim announced that Hebert was going to be left
unprotected, Gauthier sounded very optimistic that the longtime fan
favorite would not be lost. But as the draft approaches, the GM
obviously doesn't want to sound !ital!overly optimistic even though
Minnesota and Columbus have both recently traded for young
goaltenders who might step in and become starters.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota acquired Dallas backup Manny Fernandez and Columbus
picked up Colorado backup Marc Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm confident,'' the GM said. `I'm hoping he
will be not be taken; we will have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert suffered through a sub-par season in 1999-2000, but it's
unlikely the Ducks relish the idea of beginning the 2000-2001
campaign without an established No. 1 like him. He has 161 of the
Ducks' 215 wins to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he is a better goalie (than he showed last season),''
Gauthier said. ``He has been a good goalie in this league before
and he will be again.''
</P>
<P>
   If Anaheim's gamble is successful, the Ducks could escape from
the draft relatively unharmed. Five of their top seven defensemen
are protected and first-year players Vitaly Vishnevski and Niclas
Havelid did not have to be protected. Unrestricted free agents Kip
Miller, Ted Donato, Kevin Haller and Stu Grimson are up for grabs,
but it's rare for expansion teams to risk a pick on a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves winger Jeff Nielsen, swingman Pascal Trepanier and
backup goalie Dominic Roussel as the most likely candidates to be
selected.
</P>
<P>
   No team can lose more than one goalie or defenseman, according
to the draft guidelines. A team that loses a goalie can't lose a
defenseman.

   The North Koreans: A Missile Test Surprises the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans had based their crusade for missile defense
on the Rumsfeld report alone, however, they might still be fighting
an uphill battle. But just a month after the report came out, on
Aug. 31, 1998, they gained additional ammunition when the North
Koreans sent a satellite hurtling toward space on a Taepo Dong-1
missile.
</P>
<P>
   For days, the North Koreans insisted that the satellite was
broadcasting ``immortal revolutionary hymns'' in honor of their
late leader, Kim Il Sung, and his son, Kim Jong Il. Only later
would it become clear that the satellite had never gone into orbit
and had fallen into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was up there broadcasting music, but we never
found the music,'' a Defense Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Taepo Dong-1 was not the most sophisticated system. Its
first two stages consisted of relatively primitive systems: a
liquid-fueled Scud and a liquid-fueled No Dong missile.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the third stage that surprised the United States. It
consisted of a small solid-fueled motor designed to thrust the
satellite into space. The use of the third stage reflected an
important milestone in North Korea's attempt to develop an
intercontinental-range missile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That they were doing this at all suggests they were farther
along than the intelligence community had anticipated they would
be,'' Walter Slocombe, the under secretary of defense for policy,
said in an interview. ``It would be as if you were watching a diver
who you think can only do a simple one somersault, and she tries a
3 1/2reverse, but screws up the half part. The fact she tried it at
all indicates she is better than you thought she was, and the fact
she got most of the way through indicates she is a lot farther
along than you thought she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, U.S. intelligence says the North Korean missile has
considerable limitations: It is not powerful enough to carry a
nuclear warhead to the United States, though it could carry a
lighter biological warhead. Nor is it particularly accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very inaccurate, so inaccurate that if aimed at
Honolulu it would probably land in the water,'' said a senior U.S.
official who is familiar with intelligence on the missile. ``If it
was aimed at Alaska, it would probably hit land mass but might not
land anywhere near a city.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, U.S. intelligence has concluded that the North
Koreans have abandoned work on that missile in favor of the Taepo
Dong-2, a two-stage missile that uses a cluster of No Dong engines
as a first stage and a No Dong missile as a second stage. The Taepo
Dong-2 has never been flight-tested, a vital step in developing a
missile, and cannot be test-launched under a accord that the United
States has negotiated with the North Korea. The North Koreans,
however, have continued work on the program.
</P>
<P>
   If North Korea did conduct a flight test and built another Taepo
Dong-2, it might have a rudimentary long-range missile in a matter
of months, according to U.S. intelligence officials. While such a
missile could deliver a nuclear-size payload to Alaska and Hawaii,
it could not reach the continental United States unless the North
Koreans added a third stage. But a third stage would make it less
accurate, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Even if North Korea did violate the test ban and developed an
effective intercontinental-range missile, it would have enough
nuclear material only for two warheads at most, according to U.S.
intelligence, compared with more than 6,000 missile warheads for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The missile threat from other nations is more distant, and U.S.
specialists are divided over whether Iran can field an
intercontinental-range ballistic missile by 2010. As for Iraq, U.S.
intelligence experts cannot agree on whether it can could develop a
long-range ballistic missile by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States' overwhelming military might has
deterred North Korea in the past, some senior U.S. officials say
there is no reason to think that Pyongyang would act irrationally
in the future and threaten the world's sole remaining superpower
with a missile strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea has not used its artillery against Seoul for
decades, and it could do a real number on it,'' a senior U.S.
official said. ``It has not used its Scud missiles against the rest
of South Korea. It has not used its No Dong missiles against Japan.
So you have to argue they have been deterred.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in making their case for a missile defense, advocates say
even a rudimentary ability to deliver a biological or nuclear
warhead might give North Korea a weapon it might brandish to try to
prevent Washington from coming to the aid of South Korea or Japan
in a future conflict. Although deterrence has worked in the past,
the proponents argue, there is no guarantee that it will in the
future. And if the United States has the money and technology to
develop a missile defense, it should do so, they insist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat is that nations with aggressive ambitions could
come to believe that because of their missile capability, we could
be deterred from intervening in their region,'' said Barry M.
Blechman, a member of the Rumsfeld panel and chairman of the Henry
L. Stimson Center, a Washington-based research organization. ``That
is the whole reason for defense.''
</P>
<P>
   With the White House seeking to protect its right flank during
the election year, however, the complex debate over deterrence has
received relatively short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of my colleagues in the Congress are not really
paying attention,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del. ``They think
they need to be for some kind of defense, but they don't really
know anything about it. We have not really had a debate.''

 UNDATED: a debate.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Site: From North Dakota North to Alaska
</P>
<P>
   Eager to demonstrate a new seriousness on missile defense, the
administration moved into high gear last year. It developed a new
goal: The United States should be able to build a limited
anti-missile defense by late 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Clinton insisted that he had not yet decided whether
to build a limited defense. He says his decision will depend on the
anti-missile technology that is to be tested on July 7, and on
evaluations of the threat and the implications for arms control. He
may defer a decision about deploying the system, but there is
virtually no chance that he will decide a missile defense is
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it moved forward on missile defense, however, the White
House wanted to avoid a diplomatic confrontation with Moscow. The
hope was that the initial phase of a missile defense might be
deployed at Grand Forks, which was the only U.S. site permitted for
a missile defense under the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But that hope was dashed when Republicans insisted that even a
limited system had to protect all 50 states, and the Joint Chiefs
of Staff made this a military requirement.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard they tried, U.S. military experts could not
cover all of the United States from Grand Forks.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Aleutians and some uninhabited islands in Hawaii
were outside the sphere of coverage. The White House pressed the
Pentagon to re-examine the problem, but it only seemed to get
worse. That was a huge political obstacle since Stevens headed the
Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense and Sen. Daniel Inouye of
Hawaii was the ranking Democrat on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem was how to interpret the ABM treaty with the
Russians. While Reagan administration lawyers had ruled that a
``thin defense'' at Grand Forks would not violate the treaty, now
lawyers in the State Department were insisting that a nationwide
defense would run afoul of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with these obstacles, the Clinton administration scrapped
its Grand Forks plan in early 1999, and resigned itself to
deploying 100 interceptors in central Alaska and erecting a
powerful battle-management radar on Shemya, a remote island in the
Aleutians. That would entail difficult negotiations with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the situation in 1996, it became difficult for
Clinton to endorse the idea of missile defense while putting off
tough decisions until after the next election. In the winter of
1998, an earnest Air Force lieutenant colonel who worked for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff gave several national security aides at White
House a dose of bad news: the administration was running out of
time.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the administration's goal of deploying the first phase
of its system by 2005, the colonel explained, Clinton would have to
give the final go-ahead for some of work by November 2000, the eve
of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The briefing struck the White House like a thunderclap. The
administration had thought that it could balance politics,
diplomacy and security by simply exploring the idea of a limited
defense. Now, after years of maneuvering, it was boxed into a
corner.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had not yet carried out crucial tests of the
system. It did not have the latest intelligence on how China,
Russia and North Korea might respond. Nor had it prepared its
European allies or the Russians for such a dramatic change in
defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   But it could wait no longer. It would have to open negotiations
with the Russians and conduct them during a U.S. election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, to provide Clinton with more flexibility,
administration lawyers came up with a ruling that some initial work
could be done without violating the treaty. But arms control
supporters have criticized this move, and the Russians are opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the headaches, it is not clear that the
administration's plan will even provide the political benefits the
White House had hoped for. While its defense plan is too much for
the Russians, Republicans are assailing it as too limited.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the debate, Biden asserted that the
administration had erred by trying to steal the missile defense
issue from Republicans. That, he said, has simply prompted the
Republicans to propose an even grander defense and committed the
Democrats to a premature decision on missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Berger he had made a big mistake,'' he recalls telling
the national security adviser. ``If you think `thin defense' plays
well politically, well guess what, thick plays better.''

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The head of the U.N. mission in Kosovo,
Bernard Kouchner, plans to create an internationally run court to
try war and ethnic crimes in the province, according to an official
in Kouchner's admin- istration.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tribunal, the Kosovo War and Ethnic Crimes Court,
would be headed by international judges and prosecutors, and
supplemented by equal numbers of Albanian, Serb and other ethnic
minority jurists. The court is expected to break new ground in the
pursuit of postconflict justice, providing the impartiality and
scope of an international tribunal with the immediacy of locally
executed justice.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed by a commission of Albanian and international legal
experts last year, the court has languished as only an idea until
now, neglected as the U.N. administration tried to put a local
judiciary in place.
</P>
<P>
   But as Serb judges have refused or been intimidated from serving
on the local courts, leaving the judicial system hopelessly
one-sided, the special court has emerged as the crucial element,
and perhaps the last chance, to bring justice and reconciliation to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The court is conceived as a local specialized court, with
primacy over other local courts, and concentrating specifically on
war crimes committed during the armed conflict in Kosovo, and on
serious crimes committed on racial, ethnic or political grounds
since the war ended. Its mandate would cover war crimes committed
by Serbs during the conflict, and the court would also try
Albanians responsible for the abductions and killings of Serbs and
other ethnic minorities during and after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner is expected to sign a regulation bringing the court
into existence within the next 15 days, and according to one U.N.
official close to him, he has made the decision in recognition that
attempts to give the local judiciary a chance to dispense justice
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kouchner thinks we need a credible judiciary. Taking stock of
one year in office, that is our failure,'' the official said,
referring to the lack of a court system. ``The only way to kick
start it now is with internationals.''.
</P>
<P>
   As violence continues to simmer between the majority Albanian
and the dwindling Serb communities here, a judicial system is
essential if international peacekeepers, police and administrators
are to stabilize the province, said Kosovare Kelmendi, an Albanian
lawyer who heads the Pristina office of the Humanitarian Center for
Law. ``It has to start as fast as possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian victims of war crimes committed by Serbian forces
during the armed conflict have yet to see justice done in the
courts a year after the conflict ended and the United Nations took
over. While the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague has
issued indictments against Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president, and four others, and is preparing more, prosecutors
admit that they cannot handle all the cases.
</P>
<P>
   It could take as long as two years before the first Serbs go on
trial for war crimes in Kosovo, Graham Blewitt, deputy prosecutor
of the tribunal, said during a visit to Kosovo this week. But the
Kosovo war crimes court could start trying cases as early as the
fall. Also, officials said they would not limit their sights to
only low-level perpetrators or the less significant crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, gypsies and other ethnic minorities, victims of revenge
attacks and abductions by Albanians, have also seen months of
lawlessness go unchecked. Some local courts have now begun working
but offer little promise of a fair trial since the panel of judges
are predominantly Albanian. Serb defence lawyers have already
requested for trials to be referred to the special court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first court of its nature, it is a response
to such a need for justice,'' said Fernando Castanon, head of the
prosecution services in the U.N. administration, who is
coordinating the installation of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Castanon who headed the truth commission in Guatemala, and had
experience in postwar justice in African countries, agreed he is
breaking new ground with this court. He explained that however a
war ends, with a peace treaty or victory of one side, ``there is
always a question of what to do with the crimes of the past or the
most serious crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternatives to date have been the ad hoc solutions of the
international war crimes tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, or
local courts which are often not ready to respond. Castanon's plan
for the Kosovo special court would provide, he says, a sustainable
solution that could serve as a blueprint for many other postwar
societies.
</P>
<P>
   The court is intended to complement the Hague Tribunal, which
would retain primacy, and could demand to transfer a trial to the
Hague. Yet, unlike the Hague, it would implement local law in
Kosovo which the local communities could see and understand. ``They
can see the building, they know lawyers are going in there, they
have at least, in practice, justice,'' Castanon said.
</P>
<P>
   The international leadership of the court would remove the
pressure and intimidation that local jurists, both Serb and
Albanian, are already experiencing in Kosovo. The offices of the
prosecution, defence and trial chambers will all be headed by
internationals and each panel of judges trying cases will have one
or two international judges, one Albanian, and one Serb or other
ethnic minority judge.
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of almost 100 people, approximately half of them
internationals, and extras like a witness protection program, the
court is expected to cost $10 million a year.

   NORTH BEND, Wash. _ Shortly after the second anniversary of the
day their 19-year-old son, Brandon, was killed in an automobile
accident a few blocks from their home, Amy and Tony Blount received
a phone call from the King County Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   The small white cross erected at the scene of his death, and the
shrine of flowers and photographs that his friends had maintained
around it, needed to come down, an official gently explained. It
was, after all, illegally placed on a public right of way.
</P>
<P>
   But that was eight months and about 70,000 pro-memorial petition
signatures ago. The cross is still there, and the Blounts have no
intention of allowing it to come down. Mr. Blount has even vowed to
chain himself to the cross if a road crew tries to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by friends and bolstered by their drive to gather the
signatures needed to get an initiative on the state ballot in the
fall that would make such memorials legal, the Blounts have forged
a crusade out of their grief that has generated a vigorous
political and legal debate here. But the Blounts' campaign also
points up the quandary facing highway officials in every state:
What, if anything, should be done with such memorials?
</P>
<P>
   No one has an exact count, of course. But highway officials
estimate that there are tens of thousands of memorials to the dead
on roads and highways across the nation. Officials in charge of
these traffic arteries agree that the number of such memorials has
soared in recent years, a phenomenon generally attributed to the
myriad ways in which grieving has become an ever more public
process _ and even a communal one, as evidenced by the Vietnam
Memorial in Washington, D.C., or the huge impromptu shrine at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Roadside memorials are often in the form of small wooden
crosses, erected at the scene of a traffic accident, in some cases
within hours. Some bear the initials of those killed, or a personal
message from family members or friends, and some are much more
elaborate, with flowers or mementos of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Such memorials, if placed on public property, are almost always
illegal, though some states, including Washington, have programs to
erect signs at the scenes of traffic deaths with safety messages or
warnings against drinking and driving. Often, though, the memorials
are left alone, unless they pose a clear safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Lloyd Ensley, the traffic regulations specialist for the
Washington Department of Transportation, puts it, ``over time, most
of these seem to come down on their own without us getting
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cross memorializing Brandon Blount here in North Bend,
just beyond the fringe of Seattle's eastern suburbs, has not come
down. And what is really unusual about it is the way the memorial
ignited the petition drive, which is intended to make it legal for
roadside memorials up to 2 feet high and 2 feet wide to be placed
near the scene of any traffic death.
</P>
<P>
   The Blounts are deeply angered by any suggestion that the
memorial be removed from the small hill near the spot where
Brandon, a passenger in a car driven by a friend, died in a head-on
collision with another vehicle as the two youths were headed to the
local McDonald's early one evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our son was cremated,'' Mrs. Blount, a retired owner of a
mobile delicatessen, said of Brandon, who was rated one of the
state's top chess players and graduated from Mount Si High School a
few months before his death. ``That's all we have left of him, and
this memorial is so important to us, it's just not right to remove
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go down there and there are always new little flowers, or
sculptures or necklaces. It makes me feel really good when I see
all that. It makes me feel Brandon has not been forgotten by his
friends. We raised a decent enough kid that a lot of other people
still love him, too, and he won't be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blounts need to gather a total of about 175,000 signatures
by next month to get an initiative on the November ballot, and
state officials say the Blounts really need tens of thousands more
than that to protect against duplicated or other unacceptable
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Such a law could raise thorny constitutional issues, because so
many of the memorials include a cross, a Christian symbol. It was
precisely for this reason that Oregon lawmakers shelved discussion
of a measure to legalize small roadside memorials, after it was
pointed out that so-called hate groups or fringe religious sects
considered widely offensive could assert their right to erect
memorials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you open the door, you open the door to all kinds of
memorials,'' said David Fidanque, executive director of the
American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon. ``You might not be very
happy with what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Oregon Legislature was discussing the issue, some
swastika symbols and placards with ``KKK'' and the satanic mark
``666'' were placed, anonymously, alongside cross memorials on a
few Oregon roads. In an unsigned letter to The Statesman-Journal in
Salem, Ore., someone asserted that the placards were a protest
against religious memorials on public roadsides.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of what to do with memorials has flared up in other
ways.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, state transportation officials announced this month
that they would halt, at least temporarily, a policy under which
road crews removed all roadside memorials except those involving a
victim in a drunken-driving incident.
</P>
<P>
   The policy was intended to highlight the dangers of alcohol on
the road, but friends and family members of people killed in
accidents not involving alcohol were offended that their memorials
were accorded different treatment, and by the notices road crews
had attached to them: ``We at the Texas Department of
Transportation deeply regret the death of your loved one and extend
our sympathies to you and your family. We understand your desire to
memorialize your loved one. However TxDOT permits only properly
constructed DWI-related memorials on the highway right of way.''
The notices said, ``Unapproved memorials will be removed and may be
reclaimed.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A spot check of states around the nation indicates that most
officially discourage roadside memorials, but often, in deference
to the bereaved, take their time in removing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are against the law,'' said Deborah Fehr, a spokeswoman
for the Tennessee Department of Transportation. ``But we are
sympathetic to the reason people put them up. So we don't drive
around the state trying to take them down. Generally, unless we
feel they're unsafe, we leave them in until we have some mowing or
some maintenance to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida, after banning the unofficial memorials in 1997,
instituted a program in which road crews replace crosses with
special highway safety markers noting the accident site.
(Originally in the shape used by the International Red Cross, the
design was changed to include a circular black-and-white marker
with the words ``Drive Safely'' after complaints that the cross
symbol was too evocative of a Christian cross.) In Montana, the
state has long had an informal agreement with the American Legion,
allowing that organization to erect small crosses at fatal crash
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Here in King County, which includes North Bend, officials have
backed off plans to take the Blount memorial down, which might not
be all that simple an operation. Originally a wooden cross, the
memorial was vandalized and set afire, and it is now made of steel,
embedded in about 250 pounds of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't go out of our way to remove memorials,'' said Linda
Dougherty, acting manager of the road services division for the
King County Department of Transportation. ``We have what I would
describe as a sort of a tolerance policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But some neighbors of the Blount memorial have phoned in
complaints, and Dougherty said the county continued to hope that
the Blounts would remove the memorial, perhaps reconstructing it on
their own property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will need, eventually, to come down,'' she said. ``We're
just trying to do the reasonable and right thing here.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been little solid research on whether highway
memorials constitute a safety hazard, said Julie Rochman, vice
president for communications at the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety, a nonprofit organization in Arlington, Va., financed by
insurers.The institute and several similar organizations have not
taken an official position on what to do with memorials.
</P>
<P>
   Some defenders of the memorials suggest that they improve safety
by encouraging people to slow down and realize that a death
occurred at a particular spot, but Rochman said she was skeptical
of such claims. ``I don't think, for most drivers, that it changes
their behavior,'' she said. ``Most people think they're good
drivers and aren't going to be involved in crashes. The people who
died at the spots where those memorials are placed didn't think
they were going to be involved in fatal crashes.''

FIRE TRAGEDY DEFENDANT'S BABY SUBJECT OF CUSTODY FEUD

<TEXT>
<P>
   JBOSTON _ oshua Barnes, the 2-week-old son of Julie Barnes _ the
homeless woman charged with manslaughter after December's Worcester
warehouse fire _ is the focus of a growing custody dispute that
could pit his relatives and family friends against the state
Department of Social Services.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Barnes, 19, whom relatives say is mentally disabled, has
been incarcerated since December, held on $75,000 bail and charged
in the deaths of six firefighters after Barnes and her boyfriend
allegedly started the fire by accident during an argument inside
the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The department took custody of Joshua several days after his
birth and placed him in a foster home.
</P>
<P>
   But friends and relatives of Julie Barnes, concerned they could
lose contact with the baby if he is given to an adoptive family,
are making efforts to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, an attorney for Julie's mother, Evelyn Menard, filed
a motion to become a third party in the case, allowing her to
request guardianship or visitation rights. A judge has yet to rule
on her request.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday an attorney for Debb and Tim King of Ellsworth, Maine
_ friends who are working to raise money for Julie's release _ will
file a petition of their own asking to intervene in the case and
seeking guardianship of the baby.

SENATE CLEARS AID FOR COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly a year after President Andres Pastrana of
Colombia asked the United States for emergency aid to battle
narcotics traffickers and their rebel allies, the Senate cleared
the way on Thursday for a package of $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. assistance, which is to include money for training
special Colombian army battalions and for sophisticated attack or
transport helicopters, advanced as senators approved a $13.4
billion foreign aid bill that included the money for the besieged
South American nation.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also included about $1.5 billion to keep U.S.
troops in Kosovo and an undisclosed amount _ officials estimated
about $500 million _ to fund reconstruction in Los Alamos, N.M.,
after a devastating wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials said on Thursday that they expect to
reconcile the Senate aid package for Colombia with a more generous
version approved by the House in March and then attach it to a
popular bill funding military construction as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   While the legislation approved on Thursday would provide
slightly under $1 billion to Colombia, senators said the figure
would rise to $1.3 billion in the final compromise bill with the
House.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package will result in a vastly increased U.S.
commitment in Colombia, a country in the midst of a civil war that
is the source of 90 percent of the cocaine reaching the United
States. Working closely with U.S. officials, Pastrana unveiled an
ambitious plan last year to fund a Colombian military drive into
rebel-controlled southern territory, which some estimate makes up a
third of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Included is a request for 30 highly sophisticated long-range
Blackhawk helicopters and at least 35 Huey II helicopters for
ferrying troops, Colombian officials said. The specific mix of the
aircraft remains in dispute as House lawmakers approved the more
expensive Blackhawks, while senators favored sending Hueys.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, whose aides have warned that Colombia's
viability as a nation is at stake, said he was ``grateful'' for the
Senate action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quicker we can reach agreement and show that the United
States is committed to a democracy and to fighting the drug wars in
Colombia, and to strengthening the oldest democracy in America, the
better off we're going to be,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   With strong U.S. backing, Colombian officials will be able to
seek additional support from European nations and international
financial institutions, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers said that the United States risks being drawn
into an unwinnable war _ reminiscent of Vietnam _ with Colombian
military allies that have a poor human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a profound and dramatic shift in focus from
supporting a police force in a friendly country to supporting an
army engaged in a civil war,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash. ``I
wonder who long it will be until we read the first news story of
some of this equipment showing up in the hands of rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's strategy, called the Plan Colombia, seeks at least
$3.5 billion in international aid in the next three years. In
addition to expanding law enforcement, the plan calls for public
investments to stimulate the lagging economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., said Thursday's move signaled ``a
turning point in this whole struggle'' against Colombian drug
cartels, by demonstrating a strong bipartisan resolve to step up
American support and provide training to special anti-narcotics
battalions.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian officials applauded the Senate action, which came in a
95-4 vote for the overall foreign aid bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely pleased,'' said Luis Alberto Moreno,
Colombia's ambassador to Washington. ``This means there is strong
bipartisan support behind Plan Colombia at a critical moment in
Colombian history.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno said Colombia will insist on the House-approved
Blackhawks because of their superior versatility.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Colombians voiced misgivings about the widening of
the military campaign to suppress drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, the national police chief whose
anti-narcotics leadership has won him raves from U.S. lawmakers,
said the battle would best be waged by curbing demand in the United
States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather see drug consumption drop than get any of this
aid,'' said Serrano, who is stepping down this week after more than
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate foreign aid bill was $1.7 billion less than the
Clinton administration had requested, but it has not drawn a veto
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the Pentagon, senators approved money to
keep nearly 6,000 U.S. troops in Kosovo. The Clinton administration
has fought to maintain the U.S. presence in the Balkans, despite
growing uneasiness in Congress over the open-ended U.S. commitment
in both Kosovo and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also increased spending by $30 million to $255
million for international efforts to fight AIDS, and added $10
million for a total of $66 million to battle the global spread of
tuberculosis. But it provided only $75 million in assistance to the
world's poorest countries, a reduction from the administration's
$262 million request.

MICROSOFT UNEVEILS MOVE TOWARD INTERNET-BASED SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Microsoft Thursday unveiled an ambitious effort to
transform some of the company's software into Internet-based
services, a move top officials described as one of the biggest
gambles the company has ever taken.
</P>
<P>
   The complex initiative, called Microsoft.NET, will let software
developers create Internet applications that easily interact with
each other even though they're developed in different computer
languages by different companies. The applications will be fully
usable, without modification, on personal computers, handheld
organizers and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said the threat of being split into two
companies by a pending antitrust suit won't slow their efforts to
realize Microsoft.NET, and they denied the initiative might provoke
further wrath from the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   What consumers will notice is that the new software essentially
replaces the computer's hard drive with the storage and programming
capabilities of the Internet. On a PC, people store programs such
as games or word processing on a hard drive. They use the
computer's operating system to request access to those programs.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft.NET, people will store their programs and files
on larger computers called servers, which they can access via the
Internet. A programming language called XML (for eXtensible Markup
Language) will serve the purpose of the operating system, linking
the user's request to the data needed.
</P>
<P>
   Because the programs don't need a hard drive, they will be
accessible from a wide variety of devices, such as ``smart'' cell
phones and handheld computers _ in theory, any device with a screen
and a microchip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the opportunity to take this vision of a digital world
and apply the magic of software to make this a reality,'' said
chairman and chief software architect Bill Gates, the prime mover
behind Microsoft.NET.
</P>
<P>
   Previews of the new services _ which will include online
versions of Microsoft's popular Office software and features of its
Windows operating system _ will begin in 2001, but full services
will not be widely available until at least 2002, Gates said. The
first .NET product rolled out will be Visual Studio 7, which will
let developers create .NET-compliant applications.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ballyhoo of Thursday's announcement, Microsoft is
only the latest entrant into the market for Web-based services.
Oracle Corp. has invested heavily in providing similar services to
corporations, while Sun Microsystems Inc. will unveil a Web-based
office software suite by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some analysts have said that the kind of integration
needed to make Microsoft.NET a reality could run afoul of the
company's antitrust battle. Microsoft is appealing a court-ordered
breakup after a federal judge found it had broken antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Microsoft, full speed ahead, damn the torpedoes,''
said Chris LeTocq, an analyst with the Gartner Group. ``But if the
(Justice Department) doesn't look at this and say it proves their
point, I'd be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, however, insisted the company has not further jeopardized
itself with the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the law encourage companies like Microsoft to ... do new
features and products? Yes, there's no case that's ever come out
against that at the appeals level,'' he said. ``Nothing here was
influenced by any thinking about the (District) court's influencing
it. This is the right technical direction for where software
platforms ought to go.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of now-suspended restrictions on Microsoft's business
practices, if upheld, could severely hamper the company's progress
on Microsoft.NET. Ballmer said that's not a problem, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or another'' the company will finish work on
Microsoft.NET, he said. ``It would be better for consumers if this
product was tightly integrated, but we will definitely finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft plans to take its popular software products, including
Windows, Microsoft Office and the Microsoft Network online service,
and make their features readily available over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Both home and business users would pay a monthly subscription
fee for Web-based services, said Rick Belluzzo, a Microsoft group
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Network Web sites and services will become MSN.NET,
and will continue to offer such services as free online e-mail,
bill paying, appointment management and instant messaging.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has already received backing from Compaq Computer
Corp. and Dell Computer Corp., among others, including Marc
Andreessen, founder of rival Netscape Communications Corp. and now
the chairman of Loudcloud Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Microsoft closed down 81 cents at $79.88, and fell
another 13 cents in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Material from The Associated Press was included in this report.

JOCKEY'S ALL-STAR GAME RESTRICTED BY THE UNION LABEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Believe it or not, there are some things
at the racetrack more mysterious than the exact nature of jockey
Donnie Meche's shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the past week not knowing the extent of Meche's injury.
Was it a strain, or something worse?
</P>
<P>
   The question became moot Wednesday night, when Meche returned to
the track and rode in three races.
</P>
<P>
   This much, we know: Meche, who went to his left-handed stick 15
times and not once to the injured right-handed side, isn't 100
percent. But that's not stopping him from riding a winner, as he
did in the third race.
</P>
<P>
   He's the leading jockey at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie. And
with that distinction, Meche has earned the right to represent the
track tonight in the $125,000 National Thoroughbred Racing
Association All-Star Jockey Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his participation is clear-cut. But that's not
exactly the case for the other 11 riders.
</P>
<P>
   In more than one interview, All-Star Jockey Championship
selection committee member Chick Lang has indicated one of the
loose guidelines to participation in the event is that the rider be
a member of The Jockey's Guild. It's a union, a ``players
association,'' for jockeys in North America.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of jockeys this loose guideline excludes.
Corey Nakatani has been winning Breeders' Cup races since 1996, and
he's the leading money-earner this year. Even if he's riding on the
``B-level'' Northern California circuit, Russell Baze might one day
break the world record for number of career victories. And Chris
McCarron's horsemanship is such that one person wondered out loud
if McCarron also was training a horse he rides.
</P>
<P>
   If the All-Star Jockey Championship follows a Guild-only
selection guideline, the event will fall short of what some
promoters have envisioned: horse racing's answer to Major League
Baseball's All-Star Game. It would be closer to The Guild's annual
company picnic than the ``Midsummer Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're a member of the Major League Baseball Players
Association or not, it won't help anyone get selected to the
All-Star Game. Agree or disagree with their selections, at least
baseball fans have a say in who plays in the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   The Guild, which contracts with Lone Star to put on this event,
likely will chip in with the right opinion on this one. It has in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   It's not kissing up to The Guild to say that horse racing fans
are lucky The Guild acts as the ``players association'' with
racetrack owners regarding labor issues. At least twice in the
previous decade, it seemed quite possible that the jockeys might
not hammer out an insurance agreement with racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   If the jockeys were represented by the likes of Billy Hunter,
Donald Fehr or Gene Upshaw, who led players in negotiations with
owners in the NBA, Major League Baseball and the NFL, respectively,
horse racing would have been hit with some kind of work stoppage.
Instead, the deal got done.
</P>
<P>
   That's to The Guild's credit. But regardless of how The Guild
and racetracks split the pie, the money they're splitting comes
from betting made by racing fans.
</P>
<P>
   And racing fans have been pretty good to them the past decade.
It's a good idea to always, always return the favor with the
strongest product possible.

TYSON ARRIVES AND SCOTLAND NOTICES A WEE BIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: See sidebar, BOX-TYSON) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLASGOW, Scotland _ When Mike Tyson arrived at his hotel in
downtown Glasgow on Wednesday evening, his affable Scottish hosts
were too polite to protest.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the local rape crisis center had gone to court to
bar Tyson's entry to the country; the one-year-old Scottish
Parliament had petitioned to have his Saturday fight with Lou
Savarese denied a license; and a poll of readers in the local
newspaper _ where Tyson is continually referred to in print as
``the convicted rapist'' _ had made it obvious that an overwhelming
majority of Scots did not welcome Tyson's presence.
</P>
<P>
   But when Tyson was finally here in this revived port city, there
was the shrug of indifference, hiding perhaps an aggrieved disdain
and a frustration tinged with nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of immigration law in the United Kingdom, it was
Jack Straw, the home secretary in London, who had the power to
grant Tyson permission to fight in Scotland's national soccer
stadium, Hampden Park.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decision that rankled some locales as the most recent
example of England's flaunting its will over Scotland, and it
eventually touched off a lengthy debate in the Scottish Parliament
that devolved into the centuries-old debate about Scottish
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion is easily stirred up in Glasgow's streets and
pubs, where the patrons acknowledge that Tyson's visit has everyone
``a wee bit off-temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they are trying not to show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all are very disappointed,'' said Mary Mulligan, a
member of the Scottish Parliament and head of that body's
education, sports and culture committee. ``To actually see somebody
like Tyson brought here and put up as a sporting hero is
unacceptable. Because of his prior conviction for rape and because
he's not made any efforts to say he's sorry. It flies in the face
of what we're trying to stand for. The people I talk with are all
very uneasy about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are just plain perturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kelvin of Glasgow sized up the bevy of police officers and
bodyguards surrounding the entrance to Tyson's hotel Thursday as he
worked to repave a nearby street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the security for one man in there,'' Kelvin said,
scoffing as he nodded toward the hotel. ``Come on now; he's a
boxer, not a royal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at Hampden Park, where seating capacity for boxing is
51,500, nearly 40,000 seats, priced from $50 to $850, have already
been sold. There were at least 40 people who cheered Tyson on
Wednesday and called out for autographs. As in most places Tyson
visits, there always seems to be some kind of a love-hate
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But there are theories to explain the huge expected gate as
well. Some Scots believe it is the English fans who are buying up
the tickets, turning Saturday's fight into an exhibition for
out-of-towners in a revered Scottish sporting venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody who is actually going to buy a ticket,''
Mulligan said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, meanwhile, in an interview Tuesday with The Evening Times
of Glasgow, likened himself to Scotland's national hero William
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel my situation has been very similar to his,'' the
newspaper quoted Tyson as saying. ``Wallace was betrayed by nearly
everybody he trusted, and in many ways I feel that is similar to my
fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in his only news conference of the week, Tyson was
asked how he felt about those opposing Saturday's fight _
organizations like the Glasgow Rape Crisis Center, which plans a
protest rally outside Hampden Park on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love them,'' said Tyson, who later in the day donned a kilt
during a public appearance and insisted that most Scots were
supportive of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if I can understand what they're saying,''
Tyson said, referring to Scottish accents. ``I understand their
heart and their heart is with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week ago, there were protesters at the building that
houses Glasgow's city government bearing placards and wearing
T-shirts with the slogans, ``Tyson: Money Before Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the promise of economic gain for city businesses that
many Glaswegians consider the real reason that the fight, which was
twice postponed, ended up in Glasgow. Some officials originally
estimated that the local boon could be as high as $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Few now believe _ even with Tyson's enormous entourage _ that
Glasgow will see such a windfall. Still, the pursuit of profit with
Tyson in the mix, irritated Sandy Brindley, the development officer
at the Glasgow Rape Crisis Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was particularly angering, that it came down to economic
gain,'' Brindley said. ``Because we felt that was prioritizing
economic concerns over the pain and the suffering women have
experienced because of sexual violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's arrival in Glasgow is also oddly timed. Ten or 15 years
ago, about the time Tyson was calling himself ``the baddest man on
the planet,'' people were referring to Glasgow as one of Europe's
roughest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Once the principal dropping point in the British Isles for
American tobacco and cotton during the 17th and 18th centuries,
Glasgow was later known for its lynchpin role in the Industrial
Revolution. Scotland's biggest city with more than a million
residents, it was also where, along the River Clyde, that the
mammoth and fabled ocean liners Queen Mary and QE II were
constructed.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early 1980s, the city's renowned Victorian
architecture, and the prescient, ground-breaking work of a local
architect, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, were enveloped in a
blackening soot from years of smoking industrial buildup.
</P>
<P>
   A massive clean-up operation _ aimed at more than just the
building exteriors _ was organized in 1983. The civic and cultural
renaissance took root. It was designated the cultural capital of
Europe in 1990 with more architectural and art awards following
throughout the decade, recognition usually reserved for its eastern
urban neighbor, Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Glasgow, built on blue-collar values, is also chic,
vibrant and highly progressive.
</P>
<P>
   It is into this setting that Tyson has come, to earn a purse of
about $8 million, bringing with him the controversy that has
accompanied him wherever he goes for a decade. This time, in some
measure, he has even spawned a nationalistic furor in a people to
whom he would seem to have no connection _ Tyson's William Wallace
analogies aside.
</P>
<P>
   But Mulligan, a member of the first parliament to sit in
Scotland since 1707, does not see the discord Tyson's presence has
provoked as another battle over national rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are unhappy, they should make that understood loud
and clear to the home secretary in London,'' Mulligan said. ``But
this isn't about borders; it's an issue of principle. This man is
someone who shouldn't be allowed in Scotland, to fight in a sport's
stadium, or to do anything else.''

TULSA BASKETBALL JOB STILL ALLURING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, Tulsa's basketball program has won
424 of 624 games. That's a .679 winning percentage. In 15 of those
20 seasons, Tulsa has reached postseason play, including 11 trips
to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   All those numbers and accomplishments are impressive, but not as
impressive as this fact: Tulsa has had five coaches during the past
20 years. No Division I school has had the sustained success in the
face of such frequent coaching turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a top-25 job,'' SMU coach Mike Dement said. ``And because
of the history of the coaches there leaving for better jobs, it's a
very attractive job.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Richardson left for Arkansas. Tubby Smith left for Georgia
(and is now at Kentucky). Steve Robinson left for Florida State.
Earlier this month, Bill Self cashed in his 32-5 season and left
for Illinois. Only J.D. Barnett, who was a respectable 106-65 in
six seasons as Richardson's successor, didn't make good use of his
Tulsa time.
</P>
<P>
   Self's replacement will be Buzz Peterson, hired away from
Appalachian State. Peterson is one of the nation's hottest young
coaches and eventually might win enough games that his claim to
fame won't be sharing a North Carolina dorm room with Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa athletic director Judy MacLeod, who hired Self, received
about 75 applications for the Tulsa job. Considering it is a job in
neither a major market nor in a power conference, why do so many
coaches line up at the Golden Hurricanes' drive-thru window?
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tulsa was in Dallas-Fort Worth, there's no question it
would be considered a top 25 program,'' said Southwest Missouri
State coach Barry Hinson, who followed Self as the coach at Oral
Roberts. ``But in the coaching ranks, I don't think there's much
doubt that, right now, it's a top-25 school. Tulsa used to be
viewed as a steppingstone. Now, I think it's a stone.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tulsa's Elite Eight performance last season, Golden
Hurricanes boosters boosted Self's contract. Although that kept him
from taking the Nebraska job, Illinois was too good to turn down.
While Tulsa supporters are getting tired of losing coaches to
bigger programs, they should take solace in the fact that the
school can hire a coach such as Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the community, being considered a `steppingstone' job has
been an issue,'' MacLeod said. ``When the fans have emotional ties
with the coach, there can be some hurt feelings and frustration. We
want to have a coach that other people are interested in. We've
tried to improve our program each year. Anybody can have a top-25
team one year. It takes some effort and commitment to have a top-25
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really felt like with Buzz that we got a combination of a
great recruiter and a proven head coach with a wonderful
personality. Buzz had some other coaching opportunities in the last
few years, so it was special that he thought enough of this job to
make the move. He thinks he can get to the Final Four here.''  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Dibler, director of basketball officiating for the
Mountain West Conference and a former Southwest Conference
basketball official and former director of Western Athletic
Conference officiating, deserves your thoughts and prayers.
Dibler's wife Carroll, 53, and daughter Kristin, 20, were murdered
Sunday in El Paso. William Edward Henschel, Kristin's former
boyfriend, has been charged with capital murder and attempted
capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's athletic department hopes to be under budget by
approximately $100,000 for the 1999-2000 fiscal year. If athletic
director Joe Castiglione's projections are correct, it will be the
first time in a decade that the department has had a year in the
black. Since 1989, the athletic department has borrowed nearly $8
million from the school. That debt is still on the books.
</P>
<P>
   CBS Sportsline.com has rated TCU's football schedule as the
softest in the Western Athletic Conference and Texas' schedule as
the softest in the Big 12 Conference.

TYSON DENIES SCUFFLE WITH PROMOTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BOX-GLASGOW) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLASGOW, Scotland _ Responding to published reports in several
British newspapers, Mike Tyson on Thursday denied that he recently
punched and broke the ribs of Frank Warren, the promoter of Tyson's
fight with Lou Savarese on Saturday night, during a scuffle said to
have taken place at a London hotel earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some newspapers reported the fight as only a rumor while one
London daily newspaper reported that sources said Tyson attempted
to throw Warren out a window and that the fight was over money
Tyson believed Warren owed him.
</P>
<P>
   Other reports said that Tyson broke Warren's jaw and that Warren
was treated at a London hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Tyson was asked if he hit Warren.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' Tyson said. ``I love Frank Warren.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he threatened to push Warren out a window, Tyson said,
``No, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter then asked, ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there's a long line ahead of him,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is highly unusual for a promoter not to attend the
biggest and last media event to promote his own fight, Warren did
not appear at Thursday's news conference, which had been scheduled
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Also not in attendance was Jay Larkin, a Warren associate and
the executive producer and senior vice president of Showtime, the
American network broadcasting the fight from Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Warren said that he missed his plane from
London to Glasgow and was busy with some legal matters. The
spokeswoman also said that the promoter was preparing to sue
several British newspapers for ``false and libelous statements.''
</P>
<P>
   A Showtime spokesman said Larkin was in a production meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning of Tyson about whether he did or did not scuffle
with Warren added a sense of chaos to a news conference that was
bizarre even by the eccentric standards that boxing has set.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, for example, alternately said he knew he was well liked
by the boxing public, then said he did not care if the public liked
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you why I don't care,'' Tyson said. ``I enjoy what I
do. I enjoy hurting people. That's what you come to see: to see me
hurt people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I don't know if they want to like me. Sometimes I
don't like myself.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rick Helling's five-game losing streak has
him courting personal disaster. Forget what it has done to the
Rangers' standing in the American League West, or that it has
probably ruined a once-sure chance of making the All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   The true tragedy is it has seriously damaged his chances of
winning a record-tying third consecutive Dick Siebert Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``The what?'' Helling said.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Siebert Award. Named after the distinguished longtime
University of Minnesota baseball coach, the award is given each
year to the Upper Midwest Player of the Year. Helling has won it
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has ever told me anything about it,'' Helling said
incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there it is on page 204 of the Minnesota Twins' media
guide. The award was started in 1962, one year after the Twins
moved to Minnesota and is voted upon annually by the Twin Cities
chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shouldn't there be a trophy or a plaque or something?'' said
Helling, who qualifies for the award by proudly hailing from Fargo,
N.D. ``I haven't even received a handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of winners is actually an impressive bunch, headed by
Minnesota natives Dave Winfield, Jack Morris, Terry Steinbach, Kent
Hrbek and Paul Molitor, who is the overall leader with seven
Siebert Awards. But Helling has a shot this year at becoming only
the second player in history to win the Siebert Award three
consecutive years. Former New York Mets pitcher Jerry Koosman, who
is from Appleton, Minn., accomplished that unprecedented feat in
1969-71.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty select group,'' Helling admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Molitor, now a coach for the Twins, played for Siebert at the
University of Minnesota and said he has heard of the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember winning it a few times,'' Molitor said. ``I know I
have a couple of plaques, but I think they're in a box in the
basement. I don't think they're prominently displayed.''
</P>
<P>
   At least somebody told him he won.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Helling knows the award exists, he is utterly
dismayed that his five-game losing streak could cost him a shot at
a third award. Anaheim Angels outfielder Darin Erstad is also from
North Dakota, and there's no use denying the fact that his .364
average through Wednesday's game has made him a threat to steal the
award from Helling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erstad's got to be the favorite,'' Helling admitted. ``But why
didn't he win it in '98? He was an All-Star. It just goes to show
you that some people appreciate pitching more than hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning three in a row might also induce the Rangers to
recognize Helling's achievement. Not only has he never been
notified of the award, it's not included in his official biography
in the Rangers' media guide. If not for the diligence of the Twins'
public relations staff, Helling's achievement might have been lost
to history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about five states \RMinnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa,
North and South Dakota\S that's 10 percent of the country,''
Helling said. ``Ten percent of the country considers me the best
player in the country, and I don't even get mentioned in the media
guide? That's disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with Koosman sitting out there, Helling could
eventually accomplish something much more impressive: tying
Molitor's all-time record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I don't even know if I have seven years left in my
career,'' Helling said. ``Let's see, I'd have to win five
consecutive right? The main thing is I have to turn it up in the
second half, three-peat, and then win four consecutive. I could
retire and my career would be complete: seven-time Upper Midwest
Player of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Molitor, however, is determined not to let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to have to start campaigning for Darin
Erstad,'' he said.

NO CHARGES IN WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL OFFICE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel investigating President and
Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday he would seek no criminal
charges against Clinton for her involvement in the firing of seven
longtime White House employees in 1993. But the prosecutor, Robert
Ray, said there was substantial evidence she played a greater role
in the affair than she had portrayed in her sworn testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing he will not prosecute the first lady, Ray made a
point of asserting that she ``ultimately influenced'' the decision
to fire the employees by repeatedly expressing her concerns to
senior White House officials.
</P>
<P>
   The seven employees in the White House travel office were
summarily dismissed a few months after the Clintons first occupied
the White House and were replaced with supporters and relatives of
the Clintons from Arkansas. In sworn testimony, Clinton insisted
that her role in the firings had been only peripheral.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said Thursday
night that the completion of the investigation of the travel office
firings after several years only confirmed ``what the president and
first lady have always said about this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart strongly objected to Ray's statement, which
summarized a final report on the investigation that he filed
Thursday under seal with a three-judge panel which oversees the
operation of the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``By inappropriately characterizing the results of a legally
sealed report through innuendo, the Office of Independent Counsel
has further politicized an investigation that has dragged on far
too long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first gave her version of what part she played in the
firing when questioned by congressional investigators in 1996. She
depicted her role as marginal, saying she had been only vaguely
aware of the situation in the travel office, which makes
arrangements for the White House press to accompany the president
on trips.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that she had informally asked to be kept abreast
of developments but was preoccupied with other matters and that she
had no idea how and why the shake-up was initiated.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said in his statement Thursday that his investigation
demonstrated that Clinton's conversations with several White House
officials about problems at the travel office produced the climate
that resulted in the dismissals of the employees by David Watkins,
a senior White House administrator.
</P>
<P>
   He listed several senior officials with whom she shared her
concerns about the travel office, including Watkins and said that
``these officials discussed her concerns among themselves which
produced a momentum to take immediate action.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Thus, Mrs. Clinton's concerns ultimately influenced
Watkins' decision to fire the Travel Office employees.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding not to prosecute Clinton, Ray did not use the same
kind of generous exculpatory language he used three months ago in
declaring her innocent of any wrongdoing in the investigation of
the White House's improper acquisition of hundreds of FBI files.
Instead, his words clearing Clinton Thursday were spare.
</P>
<P>
   He said that despite Clinton's role as disclosed by the
investigation, ``The evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt that any of Mrs. Clinton's statements and
testimony regarding her involvement in the Travel Office firings
were knowingly false. Accordingly, the independent counsel has
declined prosecution of Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The report filed with the special three-judge panel contains a
fuller narrative of Clinton's involvement in the firings and the
testimony of several other witnesses, including Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   The report will be kept under seal by the judicial panel for at
least three months during which time Clinton, Watkins and any other
people mentioned in it are given a chance to review portions about
them and respond if they choose. Its contents might then be
disclosed in the final weeks of Clinton's senate campaign in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said that his office had also declined to prosecute Watkins
for any false statements to investigators, particularly those in
which he said that he had been pressured by Clinton to dismiss the
employees.
</P>
<P>
   It was Watkins who initially raised questions about Clinton's
statements under oath. While she had depicted herself as marginally
involved, Watkins wrote a memorandum to Thomas F. Mack McLarty 3rd,
who was then the White House chief of staff, giving a different
version.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, which Watkins said was an effort to cleanse his soul
about the matter, said that, ``we both knew there would be hell to
pay'' if ``we failed to take swift and decisive action in
conformity with the first lady's wishes.'' In a chronology he wrote
of events leading up to the firing, Watkins quoted Clinton as
saying: ``We need those people out and we need our people in.'' He
also wrote that he spoke directly to Clinton about his efforts to
fire the travel office employees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a week before the dismissals, he was told by Harry
Thomason, a Hollywood producer and Arkansas friend of the Clintons,
that Clinton told him she was ``ready to fire them that day.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House initially said that the travel office employees
were dismissed because of evidence of financial improprieties, but
none was ever proved.
</P>
<P>
   White House political aides arranged for the FBI to conduct an
investigation after the shake-up. The head of the office, Billy R.
Dale, was prosecuted for misuse of funds but was acquitted by a
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Ray also said in his statement that the White House was
disappointingly uncooperative in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In contrast to the cooperation received from the White House
in the FBI files investigation concluded in March of this year,
this office experienced substantial resistance in its efforts to
obtain relevant evidence in the Travel Office matter,'' he said in
his statement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ray's words three months ago praising White House cooperation
seemed to signal a possible softening of relations between the
independent counsel and the White House. Ray's predecessor, Kenneth
Starr, was regularly assailed by White House aides and Clinton
supporters as someone trying to harm the president for political
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's statement and the Lockhart's response suggest his office's
relations with the White House remain strained.
</P>
<P>
   The final reports about the FBI files matter and the travel
office are two of the last three reports Ray is planning to make
before he shuts down the office. He is expected to complete a
report this fall on the Clintons activities in connection with the
Whitewater real estate development, which gave its name to the
collective investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has also said that he will decide whether the President
should be indicted after he leaves office for any offenses in
connection with his concealment of a relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.

 &HT;    Former FBI officials testify attack on compound was contrary to
approved plan
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The premature partial destruction of the Branch
Davidian compound with tanks deviated from the Washington-approved
plan to end the 51-day siege at Mount Carmel, two former top FBI
officials testified Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth day of the multimillion dollar wrongful death trial
against the government focused on the morning of April 19, 1993,
and the FBI's plan to use tear gas on David Koresh and his
followers and drive them from their sprawling home.
</P>
<P>
   Danny O. Coulson, former deputy assistant FBI director,
testifying by videotape, said he and his Justice Department
colleagues in Washington were surprised as they watched on
television as a tank plunged through a wall of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Coulson said an FBI official seated next to him uttered a
shock-induced expletive, and he said, ``I hope that's a bad camera
angle,'' as the tank rammed through the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping it didn't go into the building as far as it
looked,'' Coulson said.
</P>
<P>
   Before playing the videotaped depositions of Coulson and former
assistant FBI director Larry A. Potts, lead plaintiffs' attorney
Mike Caddell of Houston distributed copies of the FBI's proposed
operational plans to end the siege and Attorney General Janet
Reno's briefing book to the seven-member advisory jury. Caddell
told jurors the plan underwent at least five revisions before Reno
approved it.
</P>
<P>
   Coulson said the FBI's dismantling of the gym on the back side
of the compound with modified tanks known as combat engineering
vehicles was ``inconsistent with what I understood the plan to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions from Caddell, Coulson said he ``never
contemplated'' that under Reno's plan the gym would be demolished
with the roof collapsed within the first five hours of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Potts said he, too, was surprised to see the tanks taking out
huge chunks of the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, 'What are they doing going into the building? Is
there an emergency? I wasn't sure what the reason was, absent an
emergency,'' Potts said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell showed Potts a letter from the FBI on-site commanders in
Waco that recommended a tank crew for the FBI Shield of Bravery.
The letter says that the crew ``slowly and methodically began
dismantling the gymnasium in a very deliberate and surgical
manner'' at great personal risk to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Potts said he was surprised by the language in the letter of
commendation, saying that the destruction of the gym was
inconsistent with the approved plan of operation as he understood
it ``unless there were exigent circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Although tank crews reported taking heavy gunfire from Branch
Davidians, Potts said he was not aware of any conditions that would
have required the on-site commanders to change the plan without
conferring with Justice Department officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In other videotaped testimony, former FBI director William
Sessions and former deputy director Floyd I. Clarke both testified
that FBI agents in charge at scenes are given wide latitude to use
discretion when emergency situations arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a plan is in place, the people at the scene have a
tremendous amount of discretion,'' Clarke said. ``I don't think
there was a decision made to destroy the building,'' Clarke said.
``If there was a decision to do that, I would expect notification
from Waco.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Clarke acknowledged that in 30 years with the FBI, he
never told an on-site commander that he could deviate from an
approved plan without permission from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The plan approved by Reno called for the slow and deliberate
introduction of tear gas through compound windows, if possible,
using booms on the military vehicles. No weapons would be displayed
by the agents and a loud speaker would announce that the moves were
not meant to be threatening or constitute an assault.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked several of the former FBI officials, including
Sessions, if they couldn't see a conflict in announcing that the
tear-gas operation was not an assault as a tank ``is driving into
your living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Sessions conceded that under those circumstances, ``I would
assume it was an assault.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan Reno approved called for the systematic destruction of
the building only 48 hours after it was determined that the tear
gas had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh and 75 followers, including 21 children, died later than
morning after a fire swept through the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs in the lawsuit also are alleging that the government
failed to have a plan to fight the fire and held back firefighters
once it began.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorneys have said that the Davidians started the
fire and died in a fulfillment of Koresh's apocalyptic prophecies.
The fire trucks were held back because of the Davidian gunfire
earlier in the day, government officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions disagreed with Caddell's characterization that the
tanks had embarked on a course to intentionally destroy the
building. He said some damage to the building was necessary to
insert the gas and to create what the government thought would be
escape routes for the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way anybody contemplated anything other than to
get those people out safely. It was not the beginning of the
systematic destruction of the compound in a way that was not
consistent with the plan,'' Sessions said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that FBI commander Jeffrey Jamar and other FBI officials
in Waco had ``implied authority'' to order demolition of portions
of the compound without higher approval if they thought that was
necessary to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell called FBI agent Joseph Servel Jr. to the stand in the
afternoon session, a move that pleasantly surprised U.S. District
Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. after a day of videotaped deposition
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``A live witness?'' the judge asked.
</P>
<P>
   Servel said he was the leader of a tank team that fired about 65
``ferret rounds'' of tear gas into windows on the back side of
Mount Carmel. While he later learned that some military pyrotechnic
tear-gas devices were fired that morning, Servel said his crew
fired only non-explosive ferret rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell presented a snippet of an April 7, 1993, video taken by
an FBI SWAT team member. It captured a briefing by a supervisor who
had spoken with negotiators and Jamar the day before. The
supervisor noted that plans to punch holes in the building had been
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``... The reason headquarters rejected that is because it would
be perceived by the Davidians, the people inside, as an act of
aggression or an attack,'' the supervisor said. ``They're using
that as a defense already, that they were attacked by the ATF. So
for us to go in and punch holes in and throw gas in there, they're
gonna perceive that as an attack and they will retaliate, with
gunfire...''
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor said instead a fence would be put around Mount
Carmel and tear gas rounds would be lobbed into the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're accomplishing the same thing by getting gas in there
... in a less aggressive manner.''

 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   with EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Oil prices showed no sign of retreating Thursday, a day
after OPEC decided to increase production, and lawmakers stepped up
calls for investigations into ``price gouging'' in the gasoline
market.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are especially concerned about the Midwest. While pump
prices are at record levels in much of the nation, they have
skyrocketed in the Midwest. Retail prices in Milwaukee and Chicago
have soared as much as 70 cents a gallon in the last two months
because of pipeline disruptions and a federally mandated switch to
a new cleaner-burning fuel that incorporates ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 2.6 percent rise in crude-oil prices Thursday, the
price of gasoline in the Midwest may have finally leveled off, some
officials said. New supplies are coming on the market, refiners
have increased production of the new gas and wholesale prices have
fallen.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating whether the
soaring prices are a result of industry collusion, expects to
report its findings to Congress by the third week of July, said
Robert Pitofsky, the agency's chairman. The FTC is expected to
begin issuing subpoenas within days, and some lawmakers want
industry chief executives to be required to testify on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, facing a political firestorm over the issue,
said he believed that there was ``no economic explanation'' for the
high Midwest prices. Vice President Al Gore, the presumed
Democratic presidential candidate, reiterated his belief that
industry collusion was fueling the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But industry officials blame supply problems, low inventories of
gasoline and the June 1 switch to the cleaner fuel, and they point
to a recent Congressional Research Service report suggesting that
the cleaner-gas mandate and pipeline problems have added 50 cents
to the price of a gallon of gas in some parts of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices have been high this year, following OPEC's move
in March 1999 to reduce oil production. But since the beginning of
May, average pump prices for regular gasoline have soared almost 30
cents nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange on
Thursday, the price of crude oil for August delivery rose 82 cents,
to $32.19 a barrel. And the price of gasoline for July delivery,
which reflects wholesale prices, soared more than 4 cents, to
$1.0813 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The run-up has become a major political issue, as Gore and
officials at the Environmental Protection Agency have sought to
deflect criticism that the high prices are a result of the mandate
for cleaner-burning reformulated gas. They have suggested that some
companies are making money at the expense of drivers.
</P>
<P>
   For certain, industry profits are soaring. About three months
ago, Wall Street analysts were predicting second-quarter profits of
$5.5 billion for the seven major U.S. oil companies, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks corporate earnings. Now
analysts are predicting that combined profits will be about $6.5
billion. That compares with about $3 billion during last year's
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts are skeptical that federal officials will find
evidence of illegal behavior. ``This is a political sop,'' said
Philip K. Verleger, who has served as a consultant to the FTC and
the state of California on past investigations into high gas prices
and is now a senior analyst for the Brattle Group, an economic
consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. ``They aren't going to find
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican
presidential nominee and a former oilman, has taken almost $1.5
million in political contributions from the oil and gas industry,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Bush said he
welcomed the investigation into industry collusion but blamed the
Clinton administration for failing to persuade OPEC to increase
production. Lawmakers in Congress also took a swipe at OPEC on
Thursday, saying they would introduce a bill to allow the Justice
Department to look into possible antitrust violations by the
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   But OPEC ministers in Vienna, Austria, who met this week and
agreed to raise production by 708,000 barrels a day, complain that
the United States is to blame for the high prices. They blame the
new cleaner-burning gas rules, which affect about one-third of the
nation, and they also contend that American refiners cut back
purchases significantly last year to avoid buying oil at prices
they considered temporarily high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an OPEC problem,'' said Ali Rodriguez, Venezuela's
oil minister and the president of OPEC. ``In the last year,
refinery runs have been very low and we saw a great decline'' in
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Saud Nasser Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, said: ``This
is also a responsibility of the major consuming countries. They
should get their own houses in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Top Saudi officials, who have been the leading advocates of
production increases, say they are alarmed about prices they
believe are too high to be stable. But they contend that the supply
of crude oil is only a peripheral part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   One Saudi official contended that U.S. oil companies refused to
invest in added capacity even when refining margins were high, and
asserted that the cleaner-burning fuel rules were imposed without
paying attention to the situation of U.S. oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Since their decision to increase production three months ago,
OPEC ministers have said they want to keep oil trading within a
band from $22 to $28. But Saudi officials believe that the price
band is being constantly tested by the markets, and they now
believe that they should not be held hostage by short-term price
movements, especially those being driven by speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, was more
conciliatory. Having angrily denounced Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson in March, Zanganeh went out of his way Thursday to note
that there was no external pressure on OPEC this time, and said
that was the reason Iran had no difficulty in joining the OPEC
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and me and Mr. Richardson have all learned a lesson,''
Zanganeh told reporters. ``It was a very good test for the market.
Many sources expected the volume of production would decrease the
price of oil significantly, but it hasn't happened. It means we
have some new factors in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought the biggest culprit behind high oil prices
was, he said, ``RFG,'' referring to the new cleaner-burning
reformulated gasoline.

APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL RECOMMENDED IN GORE FUND-RAISING
INQUIRY

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of the Justice Department's campaign
finance unit has recommended that Attorney General Janet Reno
appoint a special counsel to investigate Vice President Al Gore's
political fund-raising activities during the 1996 presidential
campaign, government officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Conrad Jr., who heads the agency's campaign finance
team, told Reno in a meeting late last week that new evidence had
revived questions about whether Gore has been truthful to
investigators about his fund-raising activities. Gore has been
questioned five times under oath, most recently in a four-hour
interview on April 18 at the vice-presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were dissatisfied with Gore's answers during the
interview, which was conducted in a far more confrontational manner
than previous sessions had been, the officials said. At times, Gore
reacted angrily to the questions, which covered an array of issues
related to the vice president's fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Of the interview, one official said: ``It was sure as hell a
different approach. It was real confrontational and put him on the
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The rekindled inquiry has revived a long-running internal battle
within the Justice Department over the issue and, according to
several current and former officials, has pitted Conrad against
powerful advisers to Reno. Among them is Lee J. Radek, the head of
the unit within the Justice Department that investigates public
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, according to several current and former Justice
Department officials, has expressed frustration over what he views
as resistance from his superiors in the Justice Department. The
officials said that Conrad had been told to avoid putting his views
in writing and at times felt stymied in his efforts to communicate
directly with top officials.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the resurgence of an issue that had seemed to be
running out of steam could not come at a worse time for Gore. The
vice president has been attempting to reinvigorate his presidential
candidacy, and the reemergence of campaign finance problems could
hobble him with legal trouble and provide a potent weapon for
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning in Minnesota on Thursday, was asked by a
reporter whether he knew about the recommendation for appointment
of a special counsel. ``You're privy to news I don't have,'' he
said, seeming a bit startled by the question..
</P>
<P>
   James F. Neal, Gore's personal lawyer, did not return calls
placed to his law office in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, James E. Kennedy, a vice-presidential
spokesman, said his office had ``received no word from the
Department of Justice about the reported campaign finance
development.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, the vice president has cooperated fully with the
investigation every step of the way,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department spokesman, Myron Marlin, declined to
comment Thursday on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign finance task force has been investigating
irregularities in the 1996 election cycle since 1996,'' Marlin
said. ``That investigation is still ongoing and has prosecuted 25
people to date. It is inappropriate to comment on ongoing matters
or internal deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no indication that Reno has reached a decision
on Conrad's recommendation. In 1997 and then again in 1998, the
attorney general refused to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate Gore, over the objections of FBI Director Louis J.
Freeh and several senior Justice Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   The rules have changed since then. In place of the independent
counsel law, which expired in 1999, the Justice Department has
adopted regulations that give Reno the sole authority to appoint an
outside prosecutor if she determines that the department would have
a conflict of interest in an investigation, or if she decides that
an outside inquiry is in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgent inquiry is focused on several issues that the
Justice Department has investigated for years. These include a
fund-raising appearance by Gore's at a Buddhist temple in
California in 1996; fund-raising coffees for campaign donors at the
White House; and whether Gore was truthful when he told
investigators he was unaware that fund-raising telephone calls he
made from the White House in 1995 and 1996 were intended to raise
both soft money, for general campaign purposes, and hard money, for
specific re-election expenses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Conrad is the fourth lawyer to head the Justice Department's
Campaign Financing Task Force. In late December, he replaced David
Vicinanzo, a former New Hampshire prosecutor. Vicinanzo succeeded
Charles LaBella, who had repeatedly and unsuccessfully pressed for
the appointment of an independent counsel in 1998 and quit in
frustration. Laura Ingersoll was the first task force leader.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1992, Conrad had served as a federal prosecutor in
Charlotte, N.C., where he was the chief of the office's criminal
division. He has prosecuted a wide variety of criminal cases,
including public corruption, white-collar fraud, money laundering,
organized crime and drug-trafficking cases. Colleagues have
described him as both aggressive and candid.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad would not discuss the matter on Thursday. In testimony
before a Senate panel on Wednesday, he was asked whether he had
discussed the appointment of a special counsel related to Gore or
the questions that he posed to Gore in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The matters that I inquired into on April 18 are pending
matters,'' he replied. ``I don't feel at liberty to discuss the
subject matter of the examination.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has remained a highly confidential matter
within the Justice Department and the FBI. Freeh, who has long
urged an independent investigation of Gore, has met privately in
recent weeks with lawmakers in the House and Senate to avoid being
asked to appear as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh, whose relationship with the White House and with Reno has
eroded badly over the issue, told the lawmakers that he did not
want to be drawn into a public discussion of a pending inquiry, and
that he did not want give the White House further cause for
complaint. FBI officials would not comment on the matter Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's refusal to appoint an independent counsel to investigate
campaign finance has proven to be one of the most controversial
issues of her tenure. Republicans have at times demanded her
resignation, accusing her of attempting to protect the White House
from a politically perilous inquiry. House and Senate committees
are continuing to investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the controversy has resurfaced with the release
of memos from Freeh and LaBella in which both officials urged the
appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Although the vice president attended the fund-raising event at
the Hsi Lai Temple event on April 29, 1996, investigators did not
ask him about it until the April 18 interview.
</P>
<P>
   The event, a luncheon attended by about 100 community leaders,
became one of the first important campaign finance controversies to
embroil the vice president. It is unclear what Gore has told
investigators about the event that has drawn renewed scrutiny. In
public statements, Gore at first said the event was intended for
community outreach, not fund raising. Later he said it was
``finance related.''
</P>
<P>
   An official with knowledge of the interview said on Thursday
that Gore was also asked about more than 100 coffee sessions at the
White House used to reward past donors. Gore insisted in the
interview that the coffees had not been fund-raisers, an official
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The event at the temple was not among the subjects the Justice
Department was investigating in late 1997 when Reno first
considered seeking an independent counsel to investigate Gore. In
that deliberative phase, Reno pondered a single question: Whether
45 telephone fund-raising phone calls that were made from his White
House office had violated an 1883 civil service law that barred
elected officials from using government offices to raise donations
covered by federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   Over La Bella's and Freeh's strong objections, Reno concluded
that Gore's actions had been lawful. ``Evidence found by the
investigators shows that the vice president solicited only soft
money in these calls, not hard money,'' she said. Soft money
donations fall outside federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, campaign finance prosecutors focused on
whether Gore had lied to investigators during the initial inquiry
into his fund-raising phone calls. Most of Reno's advisers,
including Robert S. Litt, a highly influential political deputy at
the department, urged her to appoint an independent counsel. But
again, Reno declined to appoint an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's aides are continuing to investigate whether Gore lied
when he insisted that he did not know the difference between
regulated ``hard money'' and unrestricted ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had repeatedly told investigators he believed his White
House telephone calls were only used to raise soft-money donations,
which are not limited by campaign law. But a belatedly disclosed
fund-raising memo by David M. Strauss, a deputy chief of staff to
the vice president, suggested that in the 1997 inquiry, Gore might
not have been truthful about what he knew about his phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   According to other recently released documents, the former White
House chief of staff, Leon A. Panetta, and three other witnesses
recalled that the hard money/soft money breakdown was discussed at
a meeting where Gore was present. Ten or eleven other participants
in the meeting could not recall that discussion. Panetta also
recalled that the vice president seemed attentive when there was a
discussion of how money would be split among party accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1988 interview with the FBI, Gore said he had often been
inattentive to detail at fund-raising meetings and that he
sometimes missed parts of them, notes from the interview show. He
told the FBI that ``he drank a lot of iced tea during meetings,
which could have necessitated a restroom break.''
</P>
<P>
   An official with knowledge of the Gore inquiry said that some
investigators were ``punching holes in the iced tea defense.''
Another official said that some FBI investigators ``are really
pushing the perjury stuff, because they are convinced he lied to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   After the vice president's April 18 interview with
investigators, Gore played down the significance to reporters,
saying he was not a focus of the investigation. ``I answered every
question,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: FANS HAVE SHORTSTOP CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A -Rod! A-Rod! A-Rod!
</P>
<P>
   This chant could be heard from the famous First Base Dugout a
Cappella Choir during batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Having been taught to take nothing for granted, a journalist
ambled over to inquire, ``Say, just who is this A-Rod, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers know when they are being twitted. The fans did not
dignify the question with a response.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you already have a shortstop,'' the journalist persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's broken,'' one fan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to move on,'' another fan said.
</P>
<P>
   Cold. Very cold. But realistic, nevertheless. Even before Rey
Ordonez was injured, the Mets were already a logical candidate for
the future services of Alex Rodriguez, known to all and sundry as
A-Rod.
</P>
<P>
   A-Rod for Rich Rod! A-Rod for Rich Rod! A-Rod for Rich Rod!
</P>
<P>
   The choir also delivered this chant before the Mets played the
Phillies last night at Shea Stadium. They were referring to Rich
Rodriguez, the resident mop-up pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Rich-Rod trade reached the ears of Steve Phillips, the
general manager of the Mets, who was chatting with reporters over
the din of the public address system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't respond to trade rumors,'' Phillips said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   There are trade rumors all over the place, what with the Yankees
making feints toward Juan Gonzalez of Detroit and fakes toward
Sammy Sosa of the Cubs. The Yankees probably cannot afford A-Rod,
currently in the employ of the Seattle Mariners, but soon to become
a free agent. He is a friend of Derek Jeter, but the two are not
likely to wind up together on the left side of the Yankee infield.
Meanwhile, the cold, cold hearts behind the first base dugout at
Shea are on the case: A-Rod! A-Rod! A-Rod!
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez has, however, just become even more expensive due
to the broken left ulna suffered by Rey Ordonez on May 30. The arm
is not healing, and a plate and screws must be installed on Monday,
which will keep him out for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez is current in the first year of a four-year, $19 million
contract. Rodriguez, who can actually hit, will come even higher.
Before Ordonez was hurt, his batting average had regressed from
.258 last year to .188 this year, but the Mets' players appreciate
his fielding skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the best I've ever seen,'' said Todd Pratt, who started
at catcher last night. ``I saw Ozzie Smith when I started in '92.
Rey makes plays look ordinary that are great for other shortstops.
He's got great feet, great hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been struggling with the bat, but if he gets a little
more confidence, he could be among the greatest shortstops,'' Pratt
said. ``He's worth 15 or 20 wins a season. I don't know if you can
say that about anybody else. I see it when I catch especially. He
lowers the earned run average for every pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ordonez, who may be several years older than
his listed age of 27, does not come across as a student of the
game. If he could bunt at all, the Mets might have won their uphill
struggle against the Braves last October.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, who can keep tapping a golf ball in the air with
his wedge, could probably bunt better than Ordonez. In fact, Woods
has so much free time on his hands that he was out caddying for his
college roommate in a tournament near Las Vegas Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Tiger needs a hobby. Meanwhile, the Mets do not seem
locked in to Melvin Mora and Kurt Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done an adequate job but we're not committed to
anything,'' Phillips said. ``We're continuing to evaluate the
alternatives, to see if we could upgrade what we already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora might look like a regular if he played shortstop for a week
or two straight. And there is the very real possibility that
Ordonez, before he was injured, had already bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his minimal offensive skills, the Mets disappear into
a nether region at the bottom of the batting order. Weak hitters in
the National League only get worse from year after year of batting
ahead of the pitcher, rarely getting fat pitches. Ninth-place
hitters in the American League, with its designated hitter gimmick,
see better pitches because the top of the order is looming ahead.
You could call it the Scott Brosius Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   There are surely teams that would be thrilled to have Rey
Ordonez scooping up just about everything _ if his arm heals at a
healthy angle, that is.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Phillips and the Mets cannot avoid that growing
chorus that chants, quite rightfully: A-Rod! A-Rod! A-Rod!

 &HT;    Refined diesel pushed by FedsBy Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Federal proposals to make smelly diesel-powered trucks
and buses as clean as family cars represent the biggest step since
the advent of unleaded gas to clean up vehicle emissions, several
public interest and other groups declared Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental and public health experts said the new rules could
prevent thousands of cases of cancer, cardiovascular-related deaths
and tens of thousands of hospitalizations and emergency room visits
for asthma and other chronic lung problems.
</P>
<P>
   The experts and other representatives from a smorgasbord of
environmental and public health groups, business organizations and
state agencies spoke Thursday at a public hearing in Atlanta by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on its proposed new rules
requiring low-sulfur diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The cleaner fuel would mean that for the first time heavy-duty
trucks and buses could use pollution control devices, such as
catalytic converters, to meet emission standards just as passenger
cars have been doing for the past 25 years. The devices are
sensitive to sulfur and won't work unless sulfur levels in the fuel
are dramatically reduced.
</P>
<P>
   When the new rules are fully implemented by 2010, it will be
equivalent to removing the pollution generated by 13 million of
today's heavy-duty trucks and buses, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   The smelly, thick clouds of exhaust emissions from the vehicles
would be a thing of the past, said June Deen of the American Lung
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules will result in a very, very significant reduction in
air pollutants, and can prevent thousands of premature deaths
around the nation,'' said Ron Methier, head of the Georgia
Environmental Protection Division's air protection branch. ``It
will also greatly benefit our efforts to clean up the air in
Atlanta and Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in mid-2006, the EPA's proposal would cut sulfur levels
in diesel fuel by 97 percent. The rules also require a 95 percent
reduction in diesel-vehicle nitrogen oxide emissions (ingredients
that form ground-level ozone) and a 90 percent reduction in
particulate emissions, or soot, beginning in the 2007 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel engine manufacturers can meet the new standards, said
Marie Valentine of DaimlerChrysler Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Oil industry representatives, however, said Thursday the
proposed standards could raise diesel fuel prices by 7 to 10 cents
per gallon, instead of the EPA's estimate of 3 to 4 cents a gallon.
The cost would hurt anyone who has to fill up a tractor-trailer
rig, garbage truck or school bus, the oil spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they said, the EPA was going ``too far too fast.''
The new rules could cause fuel shortages as oil companies strive to
meet standards for low sulfur in both gasoline (required by 2004)
and diesel fuel, they warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The EPA proposal is a recipe for enormous marketplace
problems,'' said John Medley of the ExxonMobil Refining &AMP; Supply
Co.

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The head of the U.N. mission in Kosovo,
Bernard Kouchner, plans to create an internationally run court to
try war and ethnic crimes in the province, an official in
Kouchner's agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first court of its nature,'' said the
official, Fernando Castanon, who heads the prosecution services in
the U.N. administration and who will coordinate the court
installation. ``It is a response to such a need for justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tribunal, the Kosovo War and Ethnic Crimes Court,
would be headed by international judges and prosecutors, and
supplemented by equal numbers of Albanian, Serb and other ethnic
minority jurists. The court is expected to break new ground in the
pursuit of postconflict justice, providing the impartiality and
scope of an international tribunal with the immediacy of locally
executed justice.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed by a commission of Albanian and international legal
experts last year, the court has languished as only an idea until
now, neglected as the U.N. administration tried to put a local
judiciary in place.
</P>
<P>
   But as Serb judges have refused or been intimidated from serving
on the local courts, leaving the judicial system hopelessly
one-sided, the special court has emerged as the crucial element,
and perhaps the last chance, to bring justice and reconciliation to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The court is conceived as a local specialized court, with
primacy over other local courts, and concentrating specifically on
war crimes committed during the armed conflict in Kosovo, and on
serious crimes committed on racial, ethnic or political grounds
since the war ended. Its mandate would cover war crimes committed
by Serbs during the conflict, and the court would also try
Albanians responsible for the abductions and killings of Serbs and
other ethnic minorities during and after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner is expected to sign a regulation bringing the court
into existence within the next 15 days, and according to one U.N.
official close to him, he has made the decision in recognition that
attempts to give the local judiciary a chance to dispense justice
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kouchner thinks we need a credible judiciary. Taking stock of
one year in office, that is our failure,'' the official said,
referring to the lack of a court system. ``The only way to kick
start it now is with internationals.''.
</P>
<P>
   As violence continues to simmer between the majority Albanian
and the dwindling Serb communities here, a judicial system is
essential if international peacekeepers, police and administrators
are to stabilize the province, said Kosovare Kelmendi, an Albanian
lawyer who heads the Pristina office of the Humanitarian Center for
Law. ``It has to start as fast as possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian victims of war crimes committed by Serbian forces
during the armed conflict have yet to see justice done in the
courts a year after the conflict ended and the United Nations took
over. While the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague has
issued indictments against Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president, and four others, and is preparing more, prosecutors
admit that they cannot handle all the cases.
</P>
<P>
   It could take as long as two years before the first Serbs go on
trial for war crimes in Kosovo, Graham Blewitt, deputy prosecutor
of the tribunal, said during a visit to Kosovo this week. But the
Kosovo war crimes court could start trying cases as early as the
fall. Also, officials said they would not limit their sights to
only low-level perpetrators or the less significant crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, gypsies and other ethnic minorities, victims of revenge
attacks and abductions by Albanians, have also seen months of
lawlessness go unchecked. Some local courts have now begun working
but offer little promise of a fair trial since the panel of judges
are predominantly Albanian. Serb defence lawyers have already
requested for trials to be referred to the special court.
</P>
<P>
   Castanon who headed the truth commission in Guatemala, and had
experience in postwar justice in African countries, agreed he is
breaking new ground with this court. He explained that however a
war ends, with a peace treaty or victory of one side, ``there is
always a question of what to do with the crimes of the past or the
most serious crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternatives to date have been the ad hoc solutions of the
international war crimes tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, or
local courts which are often not ready to respond. Castanon's plan
for the Kosovo special court would provide, he says, a sustainable
solution that could serve as a blueprint for many other postwar
societies.
</P>
<P>
   The court is intended to complement the Hague Tribunal, which
would retain primacy, and could demand to transfer a trial to the
Hague. Yet, unlike the Hague, it would implement local law in
Kosovo which the local communities could see and understand. ``They
can see the building, they know lawyers are going in there, they
have at least, in practice, justice,'' Castanon said.
</P>
<P>
   The international leadership of the court would remove the
pressure and intimidation that local jurists, both Serb and
Albanian, are already experiencing in Kosovo. The offices of the
prosecution, defence and trial chambers will all be headed by
internationals and each panel of judges trying cases will have one
or two international judges, one Albanian, and one Serb or other
ethnic minority judge.
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of almost 100 people, approximately half of them
internationals, and extras like a witness protection program, the
court is expected to cost $10 million a year.

   A federal appeals court ruled that local governments may not
force companies that offer Internet access to share their
telecommunications lines with rival cable modem providers. But in
ruling in favor of AT&AMP;T in its case against Portland, Ore., the

DRIVERS LOOKING FOR REDEMPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; When the green flag finally drops on the NASCAR Winston West
field at Irwindale Speedway on Saturday night, four area drivers
will be fighting for a victory in the Home Depot 250.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those drivers, Bill Sedgwick of Acton and Jerry Cain of
Canyon Country, are regulars on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Woodside of Saugus, the defending Winston West champion,
will be turning double duty  &UR; _ &LR;  at Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma
during the day and at Irwindale later that night.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth area driver is Ben Walker of Canyon Country, a NASCAR
Super Late Model driver at Irwindale who has four victories in two
seasons at the half-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old Sedgwick brings tons of experience to the race.
He has 17 victories and 15 poles during his career on the Winston
West Series. Still, he considers himself a student of racing in
some aspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my experience is on short tracks,'' said Sedgwick, who has
two Winston West titles. ``We didn't have super speedways out here
when I was learning how to race. So I'm on a learning curve for
someone's who supposed to be a veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   In what Sedgwick has described as a disappointing season, coming
to Irwindale might be just the thing to turn his year around.
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick turned in two top-10 performances last year at
Irwindale, proving that he feels more at home on short tracks
rather than super speedways. In the June 19 race at Irwindale,
Sedgwick fell one lap short of winning as Steve Portegna passed him
on the last lap. On Aug. 21 1999, Sedgwick finished sixth at
Irwindale. He led 19 laps of that race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy this track. It's a state-of-the-art facility,''
Sedgwick said. ``There are three or four grooves to race on. It's
not a single-file race track. There's a lot of side-by-side racing.
It's the way the track's designed.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodside, 29, finds himself pulling a unique doubleheader. He
will race in the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series Snap-On
Tools/AAA 200 at Sears Point Raceway, a 1.949-mile road course,
then fly to L.A. and compete in the Home Depot 250 and make his
season debut on the Winston West Series.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside, who is fifth in points and has one win on the
Southwest Series, has been struggling lately. Through the battles
though, Woodside said he has been enjoying his time on the
Southwest Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every race is like a sprint. There are no pit stops. It's a
lot like Saturday night Late Models,'' said Woodside, a former
NASCAR Sportsman champion at the now defunct Saugus Speedway.
``We've been struggling a little bit and not qualifying well. When
you do that, you deserve whatever you get.''
</P>
<P>
   While Woodside appears to be excited about racing at Irwindale
Speedway and in a Winston West race, his history at Irwindale has
been far from successful. In two races at Irwindale, his best
finish was 10th. His 13th place at Irwindale on June 19 was his
second worst finish of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Leaders of the pack: The winners of both Winston West races
at Irwindale in 1999 will be returning for Saturday night's race.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Cameron of El Cajon, who won on Aug. 21, is ninth in
points on the Winston West circuit this year. Steve Portegna of
Sparks, Nev., is third in points. Both drivers won their first
Winston West races at Irwindale Speedway last year. Neither has
returned to victory lane in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Gaughan of Las Vegas leads the Winston West Series. In
his two previous races at Irwindale Speedway, Gaughan finished
ninth and 15th.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Mears entered in Home Depot 250: Making his debut in
Winston West racing will be a familiar auto racing name &UR; _ &LR;  Mears.
Clint Mears, son of former Indianapolis 500 winner Rick Mears, is
entered in the Home Depot 250.
</P>
<P>
   He's a veteran of open-wheel competition, having driven in the
Toyota Atlantic and Indy Lights circuit. However, he will be making
his first appearance in stock car racing Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean he is inexperienced in NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   He tested for a team on the NASCAR Craftsman Truck series in
1996. In fact, Mears said he is hoping for a full-time Truck Series
ride in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, however, his stint in Winston West
competition might only last this one race. He said there's also a
possibility he could race in the November event at Irwindale.
</P>
<P>
   He has tested only once on the Irwindale track. After competing
in open-wheel cars, Mears says the main difference in the two types
of cars is speed. The open-wheel cars go much faster than the
Winston West stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can hustle these cars around the track and drive a
little harder,'' Mears said. ``You have to drive aggressively. I
need to be smooth and more consistent so I can be there at the end.
I just want to finish and finish well if we can. I don't know the
drivers and I don't know what they're like.''

   REDMOND, Wash. _ Embracing an approach to computing it once
scoffed at, Microsoft unveiled a strategy Thursday that will
increasingly move its business away from the personal computer the
company has championed since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would retool its product line to shift the
very focus of computing away from hardware devices and toward a new
generation of Internet-based software allowing people to interact
with data and one another whether they are using computers, digital
cell phones or interactive televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, portrayed the long-awaited
initiative as ``more ambitious than anything we've done,'' adding,
``There is no Microsoft product that isn't touched by this
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The fanfare surrounding the announcement and demonstrations here
Thursday signaled that Microsoft considered the move as momentous
as its decision in December 1995 to ``embrace and extend'' the
Internet after being caught flatfooted by the rise of the World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's subsequent integration of a Web browser directly
into its Windows operating systems led to the antitrust case in
which a federal judge has ordered the company split in two and
imposed severe restrictions on its business practices.
</P>
<P>
   But those restrictions have now been suspended while appeals
proceed, probably for a year or more, lifting what Microsoft said
would be a serious impediment to the strategy it announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gates showed no signs Thursday of being intimidated by the
antitrust case, saying the browser, which he called a ``universal
canvas,'' would become the principal user interface for all
interaction with a variety of new services.
</P>
<P>
   In demonstrations and videos, Gates and his top executives
introduced what they portrayed as a vision of a new software
platform _ called .NET _ in which users will be surrounded by a
range of devices providing access to a universe of information,
including business and personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite like the past where there was a single device
that defines all of this,'' Gates said. ``There will be many
different devices.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy will involve repackaging some of the company's core
products, like its Office software, as subscription-based services
obtained over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the new products would be introduced in increments
beginning next year, when Microsoft plans to introduce a version of
its Windows operating system to be called Windows.Net 1.0.
</P>
<P>
   He also demonstrated a natural language interface that would
permit people to interact with a machine via voice, handwriting or
commands entered in natural human language.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maritz, a Microsoft group vice president, said the overall
initiative would be ``a long march'' that could take a decade or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft emphasized that the centerpiece of its new approach
would be an increasingly popular Internet standard, XML, that
facilitates the automatic interchange of information.
</P>
<P>
   In each example the company tried to show how the data-sharing
facility of XML would allow people who work and play together to
share information like scheduling, homework, music and videos to
collaborate seamlessly whether they were connected by PCs, cell
phones or tablet computers _ notebook-sized devices that can be
activated by pen, voice or keyboard, or read as books.
</P>
<P>
   One example of the power promised by the .NET world was a video
scenario in which a family posed for a digital portrait while on a
trip to the zoo. A child then transmitted the photo via his cell
phone to his grandparents, who were watching television. Without
leaving their couch they were able to view the image on the
television set, and then, with a simple command using the remote
control, they transferred the image to a nearby digital picture
frame.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy is striking because Microsoft's executives once
strongly resisted the notion that the personal computer might be
supplanted by competing products, from handheld devices to set-top
boxes to cell phones. In the mid-1990s the company was under
assault from competitors like Sun Microsystems, Netscape
Communications and the Oracle Corp., which were advocating an
approach called network computing that would have moved processing
power from the desktop to a centralized computer.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Microsoft's new view of computing calls for
processing to be done everywhere, from the desktop to the cell
phone to powerful network computers somewhere on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft took pains Thursday to make the case that the new .NET
strategy would be inclusive rather than exclusive and that it would
offer the new .NET services on competing platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we a company that is going to suck everything up into
itself?'' said Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's president, rhetorically
defending himself against critics who have challenged the company's
strategy as being proprietary. ``Because of XML you can have a
device on the Internet that does not run .NET software but through
XML it can participate in .NET services.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he and Gates insisted that those services would be
based on an open Internet standard, enabling users with
non-Windows-based platforms like the Palm computer and the
Macintosh to take advantage of them, the two executives
acknowledged that such users would be second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the ``richest'' interactions with the new .NET
services would require the new Windows.NET operating system.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the vision the company sketched with videotaped
endorsements from executives of hardware and software companies
like Compaq, Dell Computer, Arriba, Loudcloud and others, there was
skepticism among some industry analysts that Microsoft would be
able to rapidly attract other software developers to its vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're leading a parade and asking developers to come with
them, but what happens if nobody joins?'' said David Readerman, a
managing director at Thomas Weisel &AMP; Partners, a San Francisco
investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   But other industry analysts said they were impressed with the
vision the company articulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that despite all the problems they're dealing with
in the courts they still have a vision of the future,'' said Walter
J. Casey, a technol0gy analyst at Banc One Investment Advisors
Corp. in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday, Ballmer occupied himself with making the case that
there is a workable business strategy in the array of new products
he said the company would introduce as part of the .NET strategy.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the company would increasingly try to move to a
subscription basis for selling its products but that the existing
packaged software and royalty and licensing schemes would continue
for the forseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   He outlined a series of Internet-based services the company is
creating, including its MSN online service; a version of its Office
software to be called Office.NET; bCentral, a Web portal offering
services to small business, and a version of its Visual Studio
development environment for software developers.
</P>
<P>
   The company hedged its bets only slightly during the day. Gates
said that the bet on the .NET was equivalent to the 100 percent bet
the company placed on its shift to the Internet strategy in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer said he was confident but he realized that the strategy
was still a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bet I feel very confident about,'' he said. ``But it's
a bet.''

STUDENTS STUMBLE OVER NITS IN A LETTER TO PUTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Westerners cap the salutations of their business
letters with a colon, to wit: Dear Mr. Doe:. Not so Russians, who
fire off important missives with gunpowder, as with ``Respected
Rodion Romanovich!'' or ``Dear Mrs. Raskolnikov!''
</P>
<P>
   The exclamation point is a flyspeck of formality, a nit of
politesse. When Anya Provorova, a 17-year-old from a four-street
village in Russia's north, dashed off a letter last month that
began, ``Respected Vladimir Vladimirovich'' _ no exclamation point,
no colon, no comma _ she thought nothing more of it.
</P>
<P>
   But when Vladimir Vladimirovich's last name is Putin _ as in
President Putin _ some people here take flyspecks very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are officials of the local school district, who came
across Provorova's letter, got as far as the salutation, and
blanched.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, her grades on final examinations have been lowered,
she has lost a silver medal for academic excellence and, by some
accounts, her chances to go to medical school have been endangered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why this happened to me,'' she said in a
telephone interview this week from Vorobyovo, where she lives.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the district insists that it is all an unhappy
coincidence. In a nation where goose-stepping bureaucracy is as
Russian as cabbage pie, practically nobody believes it. Rather,
people consider it a given that Provorova's oversight would bring
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   It is a curious reward for what was, after all, merely an
attempt to liven up her school graduation party.
</P>
<P>
   In Vorobyovo, a gaunt farm town about 300 miles northeast of
Moscow, that is not a very big party. The class of 2000 at
Vorobyovo Secondary School consists of six 11th-graders (11 is the
final grade in Russian high schools) _ five girls and one boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only Anya, but all the students from this class were very
active and smart,'' the class's mathematics teacher, Augusta
Smirnova, said by telephone on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three girls have been accepted at the Vologda Pedagogical
University, the province's teaching college. Another plans to study
medicine in the northern city of Arkhangelsk. The lone boy plans to
study radioelectronics at a military institute.
</P>
<P>
   Provorova also wants to study medicine in Arkhangelsk _ she
hopes to be a plastic surgeon _ but she says she is loath to leave
her village. Why is a puzzle: a farm depression has spread poverty,
and families have fled, shrinking the Vorobyovo Secondary School by
more than two-thirds in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place that could use a lift. Last month, the class of
2000 hit on a way to get one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a big dream to film our graduation party,'' Provorova
said, ``and we read an article in the newspaper that said one
couple asked President Putin to give them something, and he gave it
to them. So we figured, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The one-page letter to Putin, handwritten on lined schoolbook
paper, began with a request for a handout. ``We would like to shoot
our graduation party on a video camera,'' it read, ``but we don't
have such a possibility. That's why we are asking you to help us.
Send us a video camera, please, and we will be grateful to you.''
</P>
<P>
   But it closed with an even cheekier request, scribbled by the
boy in the class. ``Come to visit us yourself on June 17,'' it
read. ``You will have a rest, and we will treat you to pies.''
</P>
<P>
   Signed only ``Goodbye, the 11th grade,'' the note left Vorobyovo
in late May and reached the Kremlin on June 3. The Kremlin sent it
back to the Vologda provincial government, asking for the authors'
names so it could reply. The Vologda government kicked it to the
municipal school administration, in the nearby town of Sokol.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, the trouble began. Besides the missing
exclamation point, school officials found a missing comma, as well
as a capitalization mistake made by the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ashamed that some students of our district wrote a
letter to the president on a very small and dirty piece of paper
and with mistakes,'' Nikolai Sych, the director of the municipal
educational administration in Sokol, said in a telephone interview.
``This is not what educated and smart people do.''
</P>
<P>
   The class, its final exams finished, was giddily unaware of
this. Of the six classmates, three girls had performed so well that
the school had nominated them for gold and silver medals, an honor
bestowed on perhaps 5 percent of all graduates.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision lay with reviewers in the municipal
administration, who had decided to award silver medals to Provorova
and one other girl. But on June 7, the letter to Putin landed on
the desks of Sokol's top officials.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, two inspectors from Sokol arrived at the Vorobyovo
Secondary School.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ordered the director of our school to write an
explanatory note and to come to the Sokol administration to talk
about this letter,'' Smirnova said. They also ordered the school to
find out who had actually written the note.
</P>
<P>
   And after that, Smirnova said, ``they said we should send an
application to the department to cancel this silver medal for Anya
because they thought this girl's grammatical errors were very
high.''
</P>
<P>
   No application was needed. Sokol officials later called in
reviewers to re-examine the work of Provorova and other students.
When they finished, the two silver medals had been revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Sych and other officials have offered various explanations of
why the class lost its medals. He said the decision to revoke the
awards was made before the letter was discovered. Challenged on
that, he said the school and its students were lying.
</P>
<P>
   As Moscow newspapers and television stations have seized on the
story this week, Sych has said the marks were lowered because the
first reviewers missed mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   In Russian schools, losing such an award is no small matter. One
medalist, Lena Kryazheva, had already been accepted as a science
major at the regional teaching university.
</P>
<P>
   For Provorova, who was considering medical school but had not
been accepted, it means that her sights are now set mostly on the
Vologda Dairy Academy.
</P>
<P>
   But she does have some consolation: the Vologda government has
opened an inquiry into what happened, and has pledged to punish any
wrongdoers. And on Wednesday a package arrived at the governor's
office, for delivery to the Vorobyovo Secondary School.
</P>
<P>
   It was from the Kremlin. Inside was a new video camera _ just in
time for this weekend's graduation.

HOUSE PANEL PASSES PARTISAN CAMPAIGN DISCLOSURE BILL
</HEADLINE>
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday
approved along party lines a Republican-written bill to require
tax-exempt groups that conduct political advocacy to disclose their
donors and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to broker a bipartisan bill collapsed Thursday
afternoon, and Democrats criticized the committee's legislation as
unworkable, unwieldy and unconstitutional. The margin was 23 to 14.
</P>
<P>
   The vote clouds the outlook for Congress approving legislation
this year that would at least end a provision in the tax law that
permits a growing number of secretive groups to raise money, buy
television and radio advertisements and conduct polling, but not
report their contributors or spending.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising vote two weeks ago, the Senate approved
legislation sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that imposed
such a disclosure requirement on scores of groups formed under
Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from House Republican moderates and the Senate
vote, the Republican leadership in the House reversed itself and
promised to allow a vote before the July 4 recess on a broader
political advocacy disclosure bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved on Thursday fits that description, Republican
leaders said, because it goes well beyond the narrow issue of the
Section 527 organizations to cover other tax-exempt groups, from
labor unions and trade associations, to the Christian Coalition and
the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters have a right to know what groups are running ads or
writing letters, and who is paying for them,'' said Rep. Bill
Archer, a Texas Republican who is the committee's chairman. ``It
shouldn't be disclosure for some and secrecy for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, organizations that spend more than $10,000 on
political activities would have to disclose contributions of $1,000
or more. Currently, there is no such requirement. The bill would
require all Section 527 organizations to disclose contributions and
expenses of $200 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would take effect upon enactment, leaving open
at least the possibility it could be used in the current election
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately complained that the legislation was overly
broad in defining what type of political activity or advocacy would
require disclosure. Democratic leaders also criticized the bill for
singling out labor unions, traditional Democratic benefactors, but
not for-profit corporations, whose political leanings run
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``By covering educational activities clearly beyond
electioneering activities, the bill would trigger very intrusive
donor disclosure for all advocacy groups, including those not
inherently political,'' said Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the
House Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans rejected that criticism, saying the Ways and
Means Committee did not have jurisdiction over corporations in what
would amount to wide-ranging campaign finance legislation.
Republican leaders retorted that Democrats were hypocrites for
opposing the broad disclosure requirements they have been
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``When push comes to shove, their vote clearly shows that these
Democrats are all for disclosure for their political enemies, but
not for their big labor campaign contributors nor their political
allies,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, who
opposes the bill on the grounds it violates constitutional
free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of bipartisan legislation to tighten the nation's
campaign finance and disclosure laws expressed concern over the
sharp party-line attacks traded over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any response to this problem needs to be even-handed and
bipartisan,'' Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., said. ``This base
bill should be a good starting point, but we need to work toward a
consensus and build a bipartisan solution.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was disappointed by the committee's vote: ``My
recommendation is to go back and if they can't agree on full
disclosure, at least attack the Section 527's, the most egregious
manifestations of campaign finance abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   He is to meet on Friday morning with House Republicans,
including Rep Michael Castle of Delaware and Amo Houghton of New
York, who drafted the bill passed on Thursday, to try to work out a
compromise that can win a majority in both chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Gordon Smith of Oregon,
both Republicans, have proposed their own broad-based political
advocacy disclosure bill. Senate Democrats and McCain oppose it, in
part because it does not cover corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to expand the scope so long as everybody is
included,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic
leader.
</P>
<P>
   When the House bill comes up next week, probably on Tuesday,
Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat on the Ways and Means panel,
said the bare minimum should be addressing the shadowy political
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't clean up all the mess in the campaign finance system,
but we should deal with the most horrendous consequences,'' Doggett
said.

CONVICTED MURDERER AWAITS EXECUTION AS LAWYERS MANEUVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as DEATH-PENALTY)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL AND PATRICIA KILDAY HART GLOBE
CORREPSONDENT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ After a flurry of last-minute legal appeals failed,
convicted murderer Gary Graham prepared for execution as the 135th
person put to death by Texas under Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who had promised to ``fight like hell,'' saw his
execution delayed by several hours with a series of tense legal
manuevers. He was convicted of shooting Bobby Lambert during a
bungled 1981 hold-up in a Safeway parking lot in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and top aides met in the governor's office in the state
capitol through the afternoon and early evening, waiting for the
legal process to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   After all the appeals had run out, a somber Bush appeared before
reporters Thursday night and recounted the evidence in the case.
``After considering the facts, I am confident justice is being
done,'' Bush said. ``May God bless the victims, the families of all
the victims, and may God bless Gary Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's legal wrangling began when the Bush's appointees on
the Texas Board of Paroles and Pardons refused Graham's request for
clemency. Minutes before the scheduled exection time of 6:30 pm
CDT, the US Surpreme Court ruled 5-4 not to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's lawyers then filed a civil suit in federal district
court here, alleging that the Texas clemency system was
unconstitutional. Though their argument was rejected, their appeal
forced a delay in the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Graham refused a last meal and struggled with the prison guards
who moved him to a final holding cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for the victims of Gary Graham's deadly crime spree
to have the closure they deserve and the finality that our criminal
justice system provides,'' said Texas Attorney General John Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham's defenders claimed that he had inadequate legal
representation at his trial, and was convicted on the basis of a
mistaken eyewitness's testimony. ``It is an extraordinary case of
an innocent person being executed,'' said his lawyer, Richard Burr.
</P>
<P>
   The Graham case is the latest example of how Bush's presidential
candidacy has helped revive the debate over capital punishment in
America. Bush has presided over more executions than any other
governor since the death penalty was reintroduced in 1977, and
Graham is the 23rd person put to death by the state of Texas this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Though popular support for the death penalty has dipped
recently, it remains strong, with two-thirds of Americans
supporting capital punishment in recent polls. Vice President Al
Gore reaffirmed his support for the death penalty in a campaign
appearance in Minnesota Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a recent spate of studies and stories about the dozens of
convicts who have been freed from prison _ on eight occasions from
death row _ by the advent of DNA testing has raised questions about
the fast pace of executions in America and prompted calls for a
moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared to acknowledge as much when he gave convicted
Texas murderer Ricky McGinn a 30-day stay of execution this month
so that DNA tests could be conducted on the evidence from that
case.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not likely to go away, as Texas is expected to
average an execution per week between now and Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to uphold the law of the land,'' Bush told reporters
during a campaign swing through California and Washington
Wednesday. ``If it costs me politically, it costs me politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised to ``stand my ground in the face of (a) pretty
significant movement to try to undermine the credibility of the
death penalty in the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham waited out the final hours in the Huntsville, Texas,
prison with the group of witnesses he had invited to attend his
execution, including US Representative Shiela Jackson Lee, a
Democrat from Texas, and political activists Al Sharpton, Jesse
Jackson, and Bianca Jagger.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the prison, several hundred protesters chanted
anti-death penalty slogans, under the watchful eye of Texas Rangers
and state troopers. As the time for Graham's execution approached,
about a dozen protesters charged through police lines and were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before his execution, Graham ``was amazingly
upbeat,'' Jackson said. ``There were no tears shed. He had a sense
of inner peace. He feels he was being used as a kind of change
agent to expose the system. With every passing hour ... there is
mass education around the world about what is happening in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told reporters that he dreaded watching the execution,
but had agreed to attend at Graham's request. ``I feel some need to
go all the way to the end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas parole board, appointed by Bush and generally
respectful of his wishes, voted 14 to 3 to turn down Graham's
request for a 120-day reprieve, and by 12 to 5 to reject his plea
for a lesser penalty. The board also voted unanimously against
granting Graham an unconditional pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, the governor cannot stop the execution without
a majority vote from the 18-member parole board. Aides noted that
under Texas law, the governor was powerless to step in and give
Graham a 30-day reprieve because the inmate had already received
one such stay from former Texas Governor Ann Richards in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's eleventh-hour appeal with the Supreme Court was turned
down by a 5-4 vote. Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer voting to grant the stay.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was convicted of shooting Lambert, a 53-year-old alleged
drug dealer, largely on the basis of a single, unwavering
eyewitness's testimony. Bernadine Skillern, the eyewitness in the
case, appeared on the NBC ``Today'' show Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a doubt in my mind,'' Skillern said. ``Mr.
Lambert was killed by Mr. Graham in the parking lot that night.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graham's lawyers claimed that the police unfairly influenced
Skillern's identification when they showed her a photo lineup of
five men. Four of the men in the photographs had facial hair; only
Graham fit her description of a clean-shaven killer.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was given the death penalty during the sentencing stage
of his trial after jurors heard of a two-week crime spree,
including several armed parking lot robberies and shootings, he
admittedly undertook in the days after Lambert's death.

ABC WILL TRY MIX OF COMEDY AND FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The roster of ``Monday Night Football'' during 30 seasons
featured a dozen announcers, from Keith Jackson to Dan Dierdorf.
Frank Gifford endured the longest, Don Meredith warbled and Howard
Cosell enraged and outraged.
</P>
<P>
   But Al Michaels was the last voice standing when Boomer Esiason
was fired in March and Don Ohlmeyer, the show's former producer,
was rehired to revive the series, which was ABC's highest-rated in
prime-time until ``Who Wants to Be A Millionaire'' transformed
network television.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, ABC altered the perception of a series that thought of
itself as half-sports, half-entertainment by hiring Dennis Miller,
an irreverent comic known for his witty and profane rants, to work
in the booth with Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   ABC also hired Dan Fouts, the former San Diego Chargers
quarterback, for the traditional analyst's role. But Miller's
hiring was the type of bold and risky gambit ABC officials believe
the show needs to be unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know football like a nerd,'' Miller, who stars in a weekly
HBO program, said Thursday in a conference call from Los Angeles.
``I've watched it my whole life. I have a nerd's knowledge, but I
don't know what kind of intestinal fortitude it takes to go across
the middle. So I won't try to pontificate about what someone should
or shouldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he would not inject his views on politics, which he
freely discusses on his HBO show. ``I'm on this to escape
politics,'' he said. ``The reason I watch football is to get away
from that, to see a black-and-white resolution. I'm going to be the
furthest thing from political.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Miller and Fouts caps a three-month talent
search that began with Ohlmeyer's looking to hire Jimmy Johnson and
Bill Parcells. Ohlmeyer maintained a level of secrecy about
prospective analysts rare in the sports and entertainment
businesses while auditioning 15 to 20 candidates for each job in a
small studio in Burbank. Each candidate analyzed a tape of last
January's Tennessee-Buffalo American Football Conference
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was originally on Ohlmeyer's list of candidates as
someone who might be a guest a few times during the season. Said
Michaels, ``I walked out of there thinking that Dennis knew as much
about the National Football League as anybody we've brought in.''
He added, ``Don and I walked out during a break in the session and
we were speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   Fouts is a conventional choice for analyst. But his previous
work on National Football League games for CBS and his recent
college football stint for ABC had not put him on the fast track
for ``Monday Night,'' pro football's highest rated series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I sat down and met with him and did the workout
sessions, all I had to work with what was I saw on tapes,''
Ohlmeyer said. ``I saw a competent professional, but when I pushed
him in the workout session, I saw sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dan: `The Dan Fouts I see on these tapes is not the one
I want on `Monday Night.' I want more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fouts has called college games with Jackson and Brent Musburger.
``I'm not afraid of anything,'' Fouts said. ``And last I checked,
Dennis was about 125 pounds, so we'll be able to shut him up
without any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the others who auditioned were Rush Limbaugh, the
conservative radio talk show host, and Steve Young, the newly
retired 49ers quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer denied making any attempts to try to pry John Madden,
Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long or Cris Collinsworth from their Fox
Sports contracts, although Long said he had received a call seeking
his level of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered Rush very seriously,'' Ohlmeyer said. ``He
auditioned with Al, and to listen to two professional broadcasters,
both of whom use the English language correctly, talk about sports
was a pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he felt Limbaugh could not devote the time necessary
to the show. But he expects Limbaugh to make guest appearances.
</P>
<P>
   To augment Michaels, Miller and Fouts, Ohlmeyer hired Melissa
Stark, of ESPN, and Eric Dickerson, the former Los Angeles Rams and
Indianapolis Colts running back, as sideline reporters. On
Wednesday, Ohlmeyer dismissed Lesley Visser after her two seasons
on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer said he will push the booth and sideline teams to
create a more free-flowing telecast, altering the standard rhythm
of a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer insisted that the dramatic changes in ``Monday Night''
were not initiated to recreate the singular style of the series in
the 1970s, when Gifford, Cosell and Meredith were more carnival
stars than sportscasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard is gone and Don is counting his money in Santa Fe,'' he
said. Gifford's last season was 1997; in 1998, he played a minor
role in an ill-conceived pregame studio show. Dierdorf left after
the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to recreate the past,'' Ohlmeyer added.
``We're trying to create a telecast that's relevant, accessible and
unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer's mandate for change was given to him by Howard Katz,
the president of ABC Sports and a longtime friend. ``I didn't enjoy
watching it last year as a fan,'' Ohlmeyer said. ``What I'm trying
to do is make sure that regardless of the score, people want to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there is no guarantee of success. What works well in
tryouts may not translate during the season. Ohlmeyer called the
new team a ``work in progress'' that he expects will hit its stride
in October. ``You can't manufacture chemistry,'' he said. ``It
takes time.'' &QL;

STATEMENT ON TRAVEL OFFICE INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the statement Thursday by the
independent counsel Robert Ray on his investigation of the firings
at the White House travel office in 1993:
</P>
<P>
   The office of the independent counsel has concluded an
investigation commonly known as the travel office matter. This
matter concerned allegations that David Watkins, former assistant
to the president for management and administration, and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton made false statements in violation of 18 USC
1001, committed perjury in violation of 18 USC 1621, or obstructed
justice in violation of 18 USC 1503, in connection with their
statements and testimony concerning the May 19, 1993, firing of
seven employees of the White House travel office. Independent
counsel has concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove
that Watkins or Clinton made any knowingly false statements,
committed perjury or obstructed justice in this matter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With respect to Watkins, the evidence was insufficient to show
that his statements, regarding whether Clinton ordered him to fire
the travel office employees or that she pressured him to do so,
were knowingly false. Although there was some evidence that
Clinton's involvement had the effect of pressuring him to fire the
travel office employees, that evidence was insufficient to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that Watkins' statements and testimony
regarding that issue were knowingly false. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, with respect to Clinton, there was substantial
evidence that she had a ``role'' in the decision to fire the travel
office employees. She had discussions with deputy White House
counsel Vince Foster, Chief of Staff Mack McLarty, and longtime
friend and adviser Harry Thomason, and one direct telephone
conversation with David Watkins (whose responsibilities included
oversight and management of the travel office) in which she
expressed her ``concerns'' regarding the travel office. These
individuals discussed her concerns among themselves, which produced
a momentum to take immediate action. Thus, Clinton's concerns
ultimately influenced Watkins' decision to fire the travel office
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt that any of Clinton's statements and
testimony regarding her involvement in the travel office firings
were knowingly false. Accordingly, the independent counsel has
declined prosecution of Clinton as well.
</P>
<P>
   This office reached its conclusions only after completing an
extensive investigation through the assistance of criminal
investigators and FBI agents already detailed to this office. These
conclusions are the culmination of the investigative work of these
agents and more than 10 attorneys, including assistant United
States attorneys detailed by the Department of Justice to this
Office, other career prosecutors, and senior OIC staff. The
investigation included a review of the voluminous record created by
investigations by the House Committee on Government Reform and
Oversight, the General Accounting Office, the Department of Justice
Public Integrity Section and Office of Professional Responsibility,
the inspector general for the Department of the Treasury, and the
White House Management Review.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the cooperation received from the White House in
the FBI files investigation, concluded in March of this year, this
office experienced substantial resistance in its efforts to obtain
relevant evidence in the travel office matter. For example, the
White House asserted unfounded privileges that were later rejected
in court. White House officials also conducted inadequate searches
for documents and failed to make timely production of documents,
including relevant e-mails, in their possession. Despite these and
other obstacles that substantially delayed the receipt of relevant
evidence by this office, the independent counsel has concluded that
the investigation may now be closed.
</P>
<P>
   This announcement, like the announcement at the conclusion of
the FBI files matter, is consistent with the statutory requirement
relating to the conclusion of an investigation. At that time, an
independent counsel is required by statute to submit a final report
that ``set(s) forth fully and completely the work of the
independent counsel.'' Congress has explained that the scope of
this provision requires ``independent counsel.'' Congress has
explained that the scope this provision requires ``independent
counsels. ...to provide a summary of the key steps taken in the
investigatory and prosecutorial stages of their work and to explain
the basis for their decisions.'' Congress described it as
``crucial'' to have ``a discussion of the conduct of the person for
whom the independent counsel was appointed to office.'' This
announcement serves to provide timely information to the public
concerning the findings of the investigation with respect to
Watkins and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Under the independent counsel statute, a report filed with the
special division remains under seal until such time, if at all, the
special division authorizes its public release. Historically,
public release occurs only after those persons named in a report
are notified, pursuant to the statute, and have a full opportunity
to read the relevant portions of the report that pertain to them
and to prepare and file comments. This process typically takes
several months after a report is filed.
</P>
<P>
   This office has now concluded its investigation into allegations
relating to Watkins' and Clinton's statements and testimony
concerning the travel office firings and has fully discharged both
of them from criminal liability for matters within this office's
jurisdiction in the travel office matter. The matter is now closed.

CONVICTED MURDERER EXECUTED AFTER 19 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE-BOS  
 (Ledes with execution; budgeted as Death-Penalty)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL AND PATRICIA KILDAY HART GLOBE
CORREPSONDENT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ After a flurry of last-minute legal appeals failed,
convicted murderer Gary Graham was executed Thursday night as the
135th person put to death by Texas under Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who had promised to ``fight like hell,'' saw his
execution delayed by several hours with a series of tense legal
maneuvers. He was convicted of shooting Bobby Lambert during a
bungled 1981 hold-up in a Safeway parking lot in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and top aides met in the governor's office in the state
capitol through the afternoon and early evening, waiting for the
legal process to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   After all the appeals had run out, a somber Bush appeared before
reporters Thursday night and recounted the evidence in the case.
``After considering the facts, I am confident justice is being
done,'' Bush said. ``May God bless the victims, the families of all
the victims, and may God bless Gary Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's legal wrangling began when the Bush's appointees on
the Texas Board of Paroles and Pardons refused Graham's request for
clemency. Minutes before the scheduled exection time of 6:30 pm
CDT, the US Surpreme Court ruled 5-4 not to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's lawyers then filed a civil suit in federal district
court here, alleging that the Texas clemency system was
unconstitutional. Though their argument was rejected, their appeal
forced a delay in the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Graham refused a last meal and struggled with the prison guards
who moved him to a final holding cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for the victims of Gary Graham's deadly crime spree
to have the closure they deserve and the finality that our criminal
justice system provides,'' said Texas Attorney General John Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham's defenders claimed that he had inadequate legal
representation at his trial, and was convicted on the basis of a
mistaken eyewitness's testimony. ``It is an extraordinary case of
an innocent person being executed,'' said his lawyer, Richard Burr.
</P>
<P>
   The Graham case is the latest example of how Bush's presidential
candidacy has helped revive the debate over capital punishment in
America. Bush has presided over more executions than any other
governor since the death penalty was reintroduced in 1977, and
Graham is the 23rd person put to death by the state of Texas this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Though popular support for the death penalty has dipped
recently, it remains strong, with two-thirds of Americans
supporting capital punishment in recent polls. Vice President Al
Gore reaffirmed his support for the death penalty in a campaign
appearance in Minnesota Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a recent spate of studies and stories about the dozens of
convicts who have been freed from prison _ on eight occasions from
death row _ by the advent of DNA testing has raised questions about
the fast pace of executions in America and prompted calls for a
moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared to acknowledge as much when he gave convicted
Texas murderer Ricky McGinn a 30-day stay of execution this month
so that DNA tests could be conducted on the evidence from that
case.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not likely to go away, as Texas is expected to
average an execution per week between now and Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to uphold the law of the land,'' Bush told reporters
during a campaign swing through California and Washington
Wednesday. ``If it costs me politically, it costs me politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised to ``stand my ground in the face of (a) pretty
significant movement to try to undermine the credibility of the
death penalty in the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham waited out the final hours in the Huntsville, Texas,
prison with the group of witnesses he had invited to attend his
execution, including US Representative Shiela Jackson Lee, a
Democrat from Texas, and political activists Al Sharpton, Jesse
Jackson, and Bianca Jagger.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the prison, several hundred protesters chanted
anti-death penalty slogans, under the watchful eye of Texas Rangers
and state troopers. As the time for Graham's execution approached,
about a dozen protesters charged through police lines and were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before his execution, Graham ``was amazingly
upbeat,'' Jackson said. ``There were no tears shed. He had a sense
of inner peace. He feels he was being used as a kind of change
agent to expose the system. With every passing hour ... there is
mass education around the world about what is happening in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told reporters that he dreaded watching the execution,
but had agreed to attend at Graham's request. ``I feel some need to
go all the way to the end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas parole board, appointed by Bush and generally
respectful of his wishes, voted 14 to 3 to turn down Graham's
request for a 120-day reprieve, and by 12 to 5 to reject his plea

   ``There was never a doubt in my mind,'' Skillern said. ``Mr.
Lambert was killed by Mr. Graham in the parking lot that night.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graham's lawyers claimed that the police unfairly influenced
Skillern's identification when they showed her a photo lineup of
five men. Four of the men in the photographs had facial hair; only
Graham fit her description of a clean-shaven killer.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was given the death penalty during the sentencing stage
of his trial after jurors heard of a two-week crime spree,
including several armed parking lot robberies and shootings, he
admittedly undertook in the days after Lambert's death.

COURT UPHOLDS TEXAS LAW ALLOWING PATIENTS TO HMOS
</HEADLINE>
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a major test case, a federal appeals court has
upheld a Texas law allowing patients to sue health maintenance
organizations in state court for medical malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   But the judges struck down a part of the law that gave patients
the right to an independent review of HMO decisions denying
benefits or coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In the decision on Tuesday, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals in New Orleans, ruled on the first of a wave of state laws
expanding the legal liability of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The court upheld the liability provisions of the Texas law by
construing them narrowly, allowing patients to sue an HMO for
providing substandard care, but holding that they may not sue when
a health plan denies care on the ground that it is not a covered
benefit or is not medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was not a complete victory for either patients or
insurance companies. The plaintiffs, all units of Aetna Inc., said
they were pleased with the decision. Consumer advocates said the
ruling showed why Congress must define patients' rights, including
the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down a part of the Texas law that allows
patients to seek review, from an independent panel of medical
experts, when they are denied specific benefits. Federal law
prescribes the exclusive remedies for a denial of benefits, and
states may not supplement those remedies with ``a
quasi-administrative procedure for the review of such denial,'' the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling applies only to states in the Fifth
Circuit: Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. But the reasoning could
have broad implications. Thirty-eight states have laws authorizing
independent, or external, review of health plan decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups, HMOs and insurance companies all support such
review as a way to resolve disputes without litigation. HMOs can
still provide such review voluntarily, and Aetna said it would do
so.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas law allowing patients to sue HMOs was the nation's
first, adopted in 1997. Since then at least six states _ Georgia,
California, Washington, Arizona, Oklahoma and Maine _ have passed
laws permitting patients to sue on various legal theories.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state laws are broader than the Texas statute and
allow suits in a wider range of disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The House and the Senate have passed bills to define patients'
rights, including the right to an independent review of HMO
decisions. The House bill would also make it easier for patients to
sue, but Republican senators said it would increase the cost of
health insurance. Negotiators from both houses are deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said: ``We are pleased
with the decision by the court of appeals in the Texas case. The
decision confirms federal pre-emption of all state law claims for
benefit administration and coverage disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie W. Kanwit, a lawyer who represents insurance companies
and HMOs, said the ruling ``was the first major challenge to one of
the seven states that have laws allowing a person to sue an H.M.O.
for medical malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Hustead, a lawyer at the National Partnership for Women
and Families, a consumer advocacy group, said the ruling
``underscores the need for Congress to change'' a 1974 federal law
regulating employee benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under the court decision, a patient may sue an HMO in Texas for
providing care in a negligent way. But the patient may not sue if
the HMO refused to furnish any care at all, on the ground that the
care was not covered or not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Hustead said, this distinction is untenable. The U.S.
Supreme Court observed last week that, in the real world of medical
practice, many decisions involve questions of both treatment and
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a
consumer group, said: ``This is the most harmful federal court
decision to date affecting patients' rights. If the Supreme Court
does not reverse it, consumers will be left virtually helpless when
HMOs improperly deny or delay needed health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Patrick E. Higginbotham wrote the opinion for a
three-judge panel in the Texas case, Corporate Health Insurance vs.
Texas Department of Insurance. The other members of the panel were
Judges Robert M. Parker and Nancy F. Atlas.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Higginbotham upheld the liability provisions of the Texas
law as an exercise of the state's ``police power to protect its
citizens'' by regulating ``the quality of medical practice.'' The
law, he said, imposes liability on an HMO for certain negligent
acts committed by doctors acting as agents of the health plan.

PRO-, ANTI-DEATH PENALTY DEMONSTRATORS RALLY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ A tense standoff between supporters of Gary
Graham and law enforcement officials played out on the streets
outside the Walls Unit Thursday night as the capital murder
defendant waited to learn whether a last-chance appeal would save
his life.
</P>
<P>
   As Graham supporters chanted, ``George Bush, you can't hide, we
charge you with genocide,'' Department of Public Safety troopers
dressed in riot gear tried to keep the angry throng from breaking
through barricades.
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes before the scheduled 6 p.m. execution time,
several protesters raced past troopers but were quickly arrested as
they ran in front of TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Several U.S. flags were burned in front of troopers. And as the
delay continued, Graham's supporters raced onto the streets to
block traffic and run toward Ku Klux Klan members on the other side
of the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was executed shortly before 9 p.m. Thursday after several
appeals were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere became uneasy Thursday night after a relatively
calm afternoon. Groups such as the New Black Panthers and the Klan
played to the TV cameras but caused few incidents.
</P>
<P>
   With well-known Graham supporters such as the Rev. Jesse
Jackson.MDNM/ and Bianca Jagger on hand to witness the execution,
the streets resembled a politically charged festival.
</P>
<P>
   No violence was reported in the afternoon, although Graham
supporters marched to confront Klan members about an hour before
the scheduled execution, only to be turned back. Other than an
exchange of words, DPS troopers prevented any altercations.
</P>
<P>
   Max Gorkey, 20, of Houston, demonstrated in support of Graham,
who has taken the name Shaka Sankofa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here today to support Shaka,'' Gorkey said. ``The death
penalty is inherently racist. It is inherently classist. He is the
victim here. Let the evidence be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston teacher Gloria Rubak blamed Gov. George W. Bush for
Graham's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blood is on George Bush's hands. What we are seeing here
today is a legal lynching,'' Rubak said, echoing an anti-Bush chant
that was heard throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Huntsville businesses closed early.
</P>
<P>
   As pro-death penalty demonstrators rallied behind barricades,
the scene was initially calm.
</P>
<P>
   Standing among a group of death penalty supporters, Mandy Burks
said she had no qualms about the impending execution.
</P>
<P>
   With some of her friends joking about getting drunk after
Graham's demise, Burks said the hundreds of Graham supporters
weren't considering the crimes Graham committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he shouldn't die for this one, he should for one of the
other crimes he committed,'' Burks said. ``I don't think anybody on
that other side wants to talk about all of the victims he left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burks, a Sam Houston State University student, became a
curious bystander when a dozen Ku Klux Klan members arrived about
two hours before Graham's execution.
</P>
<P>
   Low-key death penalty supporters stood in the background as
grand dragon Charles Lee said Graham should die for his crimes.

INMATE IS EXECUTED IN TEXAS AS 11TH-HOUR APPEALS FAIL
</HEADLINE>
  (2nd take will move by 11 p.m.)  
 By FRANK BRUNI with JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With Gov. George W. Bush's tacit assent, Texas
executed convicted killer Gary Graham Thursday night, after
officials at the state prison in Huntsville waited as his lawyers
worked their way through all possible appeals to spare his life.
</P>
<P>
   The execution was carried out even though five members of the
Bush-appointed parole board in Texas argued against it, and the
Supreme Court of the United States was also divided sharply over
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   As the hour when the execution was originally scheduled came and
went, tension mounted both in the state capital, where Bush issued
a statement and in front of the state prison, where an increasingly
anxious crowd grew into the hundreds. As the scheduled hour of the
execution approached, a group of armed men paraded near the prison
in a show of support for Graham.
</P>
<P>
   After Graham's appeals were exhausted, Bush spoke to reporters
in Austin, saying that he had an oath to uphold the laws of the
state. ``This is a responsibility I take very seriously because the
final determination of innocence or guilt is among the most
profound and serious decisions a person can make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that there are good people who oppose the death
penalty,'' he said. ``I have heard their message and I respect
their heartfelt point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke in a somber voice and wore a solemn expression as he
delivered a written statement about the case. He did not make eye
contact with reporters, as he typically does, and walked briskly in
and out of the room. He did not take questions.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's execution had been scheduled for 7 p.m. after the Texas
Board of Pardons and Parole declined by a vote of 12-5 to grant a
request for clemency and the U.S. Supreme Court declined in a 5-4
vote to hear a last-minute appeal by his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   A third appeal was denied by the state's Court of Criminal
Appeals, the highest criminal court in Texas. But minutes before 7
p.m., Graham's lawyers filed still another one, this time a civil
lawsuit against the board of pardons. Although it, too, was
ultimately rejected by U.S. District Judge James Nowlin, the legal
maneuver caused yet another delay.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was the 135th person to be put to death in Texas since
Bush became the governor 5-and-a-half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, Graham had to be executed by midnight or he
would receive an automatic stay. As the appeals worked through the
courts, he remained in a holding cell only steps from the death
chamber accompanied by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Al Sharpton
and Bianca Jagger, a representative of Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who had insisted he is innocent of the 1981 murder of a
man in a holdup outside a Houston supermarket, was declared dead at
8:49 local time.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the execution, as Bush was dogged
along the campaign trail by questions about Graham's fate, he said
repeatedly that he was powerless to intervene in Graham's case if
the board of pardons authorized his execution _ an interpretation
of Texas law that some legal experts disputed.
</P>
<P>
   The board gave that authorization Thursday despite clear
disagreement among the 17 members who voted today, five of whom
recommended that Graham's sentence be commuted to life in prison.
On the separate matter of whether Graham should be given a
conditional pardon, all 17 members voted no. Only a simple majority
of board members is required to allow an execution to proceed.

EXECUTION UNLIKELY TO HURT BUSH POLITICALLY, EXPERTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
and R.A. DYER c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Questions about the execution of Gary Graham may dog Gov. George
W. Bush for the rest of his presidential campaign, but several
political experts said Thursday that the debate is unlikely to
seriously impede his run for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Heckling from death-penalty opponents has become a fixture at
Bush's recent campaign events as he faces criticism for not using
his political clout to block the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, however, maintained there
was nothing the governor could have done after the state Board of
Pardons and Paroles rejected Graham's last-day pleas.
</P>
<P>
   ``His hands are really tied,'' Cornyn said of the Republican
governor.
</P>
<P>
   The execution continued to fuel national debate on whether Bush
is certain that justice has been dispensed fairly to each prisoner
on Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, within minutes after Graham's attorneys gave up
on their appeals, Bush stepped out of his Capitol offices,
appearing solemn, and issued a short statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize there are good people who oppose the death
penalty. I have heard their message and I respect their heartfelt
point of view,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Graham's murder conviction remained intact through
appeals in more than 20 state and federal courts, involving
decisions by 33 judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``After considering all of the facts, I'm confident justice is
being done,'' Bush said in a prepared statement, declining to take
questions.
</P>
<P>
   He closed by saying: ``May God bless the victims, the families
of the victims, and may God bless Mr. Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not heard the last about Graham, experts agreed. But it
was unclear how long the execution will loom large in the
presidential race, or how significant it will become, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, ultimately, it's not going to have any serious
political ramifications for George W. Bush,'' said Gregory Wawro, a
political science professor at Columbia University in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Wawro said he believes that the highly emotional debate on
whether Bush should have stepped in at the last moment was
``largely manufactured'' by Bush detractors, using the news media
as a conduit.
</P>
<P>
   The public is overlooking the more important question of whether
the appeals process is flawed in death penalty cases, Wawro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's disappointing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Warr, a criminologist and sociology professor at the
University of Texas at Austin, concurred that it is unlikely that
Graham's death will do much to derail Bush's political aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   But it may become a nuisance for the governor, at a time when
nationwide support for capital punishment appears to be eroding
somewhat, Warr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is going to do is crystallize the opposition,'' he
said. ``It's going to be the rallying point, I believe, for those
who oppose the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush will continue to be perceived as someone who
considers capital punishment to be ``morally justified.'' But
Bush's decision not to intervene in a questionable death-penalty
case could portray him as someone who ``fails to appreciate the
possibility of error in the criminal justice system,'' Warr said.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush had blocked Graham's execution, Warr added, the action
would have angered some supporters who believe strongly in the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that it would have hurt him
politically if he had intervened,'' Warr said.
</P>
<P>
   The execution of Graham, and the questions about whether he
received equal and fair justice, will be raised throughout the
campaign, said Jim Riddlesperger, political science professor at
Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   But Riddlesperger and other experts agreed that the execution
will do little to hurt Bush's core support among Republicans, who
overwhelmingly believe that the death penalty deters violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, most people who are opponents of the death
penalty were not going to vote for George W. Bush under any
circumstance,'' Riddlesperger said.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the highly charged debates over abortion and gun
control, he said, there is little evidence to suggest that capital
punishment is a ``stirring issue in terms of helping people make
voting decisions.'' &QL;

GORE PALS AROUND WITH VENTURA By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNETONKA, Minn. _ They stayed up past midnight chitchatting
about ``everything under the sun.'' Their wives went horseback
riding together. They chuckled at each other's jokes, took turns
poking fun at reporters and even dressed alike, in chinos and polo
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore visited a junior high school here on
Thursday with Gov. Jesse Ventura, combining the earnestness of a
policy forum with the forced joviality of a buddy movie, to promote
a proposal to increase federal aid for special education.
(Ventura's 16-year-old daughter, Jade, has a learning disability.)
</P>
<P>
   But the broader political point Gore seemed intent on hammering
home was his growing closeness to Ventura, a former professional
wrestler who won election on the Reform Party line in 1998 and
remains a favorite of independent voters across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that I'm reaching out to independents and
independent-minded Republicans,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Many polls suggest that Gore needs a boost with those
unaffiliated voters. Two weeks ago, for instance, a Los Angeles
Times survey showed that Gore trailing his likely Republican rival,
Gov. George W. Bush, by 23 points among independents.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his wife, Tipper, spent Wednesday night at Ventura's
home, the third get-together between the two men in four months.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint appearance on NBC's ``Today'' show, Ventura described
their budding friendship this way: ``I think the vice president
looks at me more as a break, getting away from the rigors of the
campaign trail.'' He added: ``We really don't talk that much on
issues when we get together. We talk on other things. We tell old
war stories. We, you know, enjoy the company of each other and have
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he would endorse Gore, Ventura said he would
consider it a betrayal of the third party movement. But he added
that if the vice president came up ``with a policy that I agree
with, like the one on special ed, I will come out and endorse that
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore jumped in, saying: ``I'm not working on his endorsement.
I'm working on his vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The cheerful patter continued in a joint interview on MTV, where
the famously stiff vice president said he had been trying to teach
the famously bawdy governor how to loosen up, while the bald-headed
governor said he had given the balding vice president hair-styling
tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm even thinking about a feather boa,'' Gore said, referring
to one of Ventura's favorite accouterments as a wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a joint news conference, Gore praised Ventura for
bringing a ``spontaneous, freewheeling, candid style'' to
governing. Moments later, as if on cue, Gore grabbed the cell phone
that a CBS producer had just been talking on. ``This is the vice
president,'' he said. ``Do you have a question?''
</P>
<P>
   The caller asked to speak to Ventura, so Gore passed the phone
to him. Just then, a phone belonging to a CNN producer rang, and
Gore answered it. ``Gore news conference,'' he said, and then
chatted for several minutes while the television cameras rolled and
the press corps cackled.
</P>
<P>
   In his visit to North Junior High School, Gore said he would
increase federal aid for special education to $1.5 billion in his
first year in office, from $700 million. He also called for
protecting a portion of the federal surplus each year to use
exclusively on education, including money for expanding preschool
programs, increasing teacher salaries and recruiting new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But other than announcing his spending plan, Gore said little
about the problems of special education. He did, however, praise
Ventura and his wife, Terry, for ``helping to educate me'' on the
issue.

 &HT;    A crowd divided
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ The distance was hardly a hundred yards that
divided the two camps. But it was all the difference in the world.
It was the difference between good and evil, truth and lies,
justice and injustice, black and white. And which was which
depended on who you were and where you stood.
</P>
<P>
   There was G. George, 40, of Houston. He was holding a sign high
that said, ``Send Graham to hell.'' George, who said only that he
worked inside the city of Houston in identifying himself, had not
been to a protest in a long time. The last one he remembered he was
a little boy being ``dragged around by my parents.'' At an anti-war
demonstration in the '60s. Now, when you ask him, he'll say he
couldn't even say which side of the issue his parents were on.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll tell you he wants to go back to ``electric chairs and
hard labor'' for prisoners. ``If they want to eat, let them grow
their own food. If they want clothes, let them make their own.
That's the way it used to be in Texas,'' he said. ``Everything is
out of balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, hardly that hundred yards, under a banner which
said ``Give innocence a chance. Let the evidence be heard.'' Lynn
Furray, 67, of Houston, a gray-haired, retired school teacher,
looked very much out of place among those protesting the execution.
``I'm against the death penalty and in this case I think Graham did
not have a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Furray became an activist in opposing the death penalty in 1989
after moving to Houston from Michigan where there is no death
penalty. ``I really didn't think about it until I moved down here.
I don't think people have the right to take another life. And that
includes the state,'' she said. ``As a taxpayer,'' she said, ``I
feel like I'm in cahoots with Texas executions.'' Furray said she
writes letters, lobbies and is ``very political.'' She added, ``I
don't like being here, but I think it is an obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleb Ortiz, 29, a senior majoring in criminal justice at Sam
Houston State University here, was standing next to a Confederate
flag held by someone in a group of supporters of the death penalty.
Ortiz, however said he had been visiting both sides, acknowledging
that the Klan wouldn't have him _ a Hispanic_ as a member nor would
the Nation of Islam or the New Black Panthers. ``But I can't hate
anyone. God loves everyone here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who sometimes spoke as if he was a preacher and other
times as if he was a lawyer, said he believes in any state system
that was ``man made'' there would be instances of the innocent
being punished and the guilty going free. ``I must say that in this
particular case, I think the state is justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, another young man, 24, who was wearing a mask
fashioned from a dirty mechanic's red rag, declined to give his
name, acknowledging only that he was a member of the Revolutionary
Communist Youth Brigade from Houston. He said, ``I'm very much
aware of what is happening to young black men. They are being shot,
arrested and harassed by racist police. Under communism, there
wouldn't be a death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   And while white himself, he said he had suffered as well. ``I
had run ins with police when I was young mainly because they didn't
like the way I looked. That's when I came to realize you need an
organization to spearhead the struggle for human rights for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Ray, 48, a bookseller, was here to wave the Confederate
Battle Flag and hold a sign that said, ``Die N-word, Die.'' He said
he came because he was ``tired of the media glorifying Graham. If
you will excuse me for saying so, the media has been acting like
dogs in heat.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ray flaunted the Confederate flag, the New Black Panthers
were wiping sweat from their faces onto the Texas flag and then
throwing it down to the asphalt streets and stomping it with their
boots.
</P>
<P>
   Ashanti Chimurengh, a member of the Gary Graham justice
coalition, was making her speech over a loud speaker. She was
flanked by a sign with a picture of Gov. George W. Bush that said,
``The burning Bush burns black men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two black men's children and everyday I face the fear
of them being killed by racist cops. Everyday we face it. We're
gonna win this g--d--- war. I don't know what will happen but I'm a
warrior princess. But it is important that whatever happens we must
take this struggle forward.''

MILLER WILL LEAVE THEM RANTING FOR MORE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Miller's sports resume . . .
</P>
<P>
   Lemme see, it's gotta be around here somewhere . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Master of ceremonies for ESPN's first ``ESPY'' awards show.
Made several cracks about Jimmy Johnson's hair that even the coach
laughed at.
</P>
<P>
   __ A member of ``Saturday Night Live'' when Wayne Gretzky
hosted.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sometimes wears a Pittsburgh Pirates hat when showing up to
work on his HBO show.
</P>
<P>
   __ Also hired Chet Forte, the former ``Monday Night Football''
director, to cut his show for a while. Didn't really work out that
well.
</P>
<P>
   All right? Is that enough for ya, babe?
</P>
<P>
   Any more hoops you wanna make the Mr. Bobble-head shimmy through
just to satisfy your insatiable urge to fill predetermined comic
quotas?
</P>
<P>
   Why not order just one more cavity search, just so you can feel
better about yourself while at the same time underscore your
power-hungry need to filter all the riff-raff out of the process of
putting on the most successful prime-time sports show in the
history of the idiot box?
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get off on a rant here, but Don Olhmeyer's game
plan for deciding on Miller as Al Michaels' new bobo for ``Monday
Night Football'' wasn't like deciphering the Rosetta stone.
</P>
<P>
   It's the infotainment factor of the TV age we live in, cha cha.
</P>
<P>
   Football knowledge on a weekly telecast is great, but if you can
find a way to drop in a Nietzsche reference in the same breath at
Ray Nitschke, you've found a nice niche, you knucklehead.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Miller fits _ he doesn't fit the traditional role,
that monotonous rhythm that develops between the play-by-play man
and his analyst that you can set an egg timer to.
</P>
<P>
   When Olhmeyer first thought of adding Miller to the ``MNF''
telecast, it was more as an infrequent contributor, he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you were gonna pigeon me in that Jimmy Kimmel role _
thanks,'' Miller cracked during a conference call with reporters
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out, Miller knew enough to host his own sports-talk show,
which is something anyone in these parts already knew based on the
frequent appearances he'd make with Forte and Steve Hartman when
they co-hosted the ``Loose Cannons'' show for XTRA-AM (690) several
years ago before Forte's death.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out, Miller was available. His HBO show runs from January
to August. His Monday nights in the fall are open, unless he's
pimping for another long-distance carrier or bag of candy-coated
chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out, Rush Limbaugh and Jim Rome had too many other
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   So while Dan Fouts will be there to provide the other bearded
opinion in the booth, Miller's stand-up act will have a new
platform, despite what he says about probably reining in the
obscure references for the general masses.
</P>
<P>
   At least it should be interesting. That's all any viewer can ask
for in a prime-time dumping ground of Ted Danson comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Miller's act won't work with middle America and he's
become almost a parody of his former sharp-tongued self, let
everyone else go to the sports bar to watch ``MNF'' if they can't
listen to him.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: It'll work. It's fresh.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, Olhmeyer could be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   __ How 'bout ``The Big Scab'': Striking members of the Screen
Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and
Radio Artists (AFTRA) have for the last two months been pretty loud
about feeling they've been treated unfairly by the advertising
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Shaquille O'Neal missed a few meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The two unions continue to fire off some serious threats at
O'Neal for his stooping to do the trite ``I'm going to Disneyland''
plug at the end of Game 6 at the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's agent, Leonard Armato, manages to keep a straight face
when he contends that the spots are practically public-service
announcements since Shaq is donating the proceeds to his charity
for disadvantaged kids.
</P>
<P>
   SAG officials say the media-savvy Shaq, who should know better
considering his movie career, could be fined, suspended or expelled
for this selfish indiscretion. But somehow, you know he'll get
around this, just as other athletes such as Marion Jones, Keyshawn
Johnson, Eddie George and Michael Johnson have done.
</P>
<P>
   Their agents and the companies paying them defend the
appearances by saying they're not taking jobs away from actors and
are contractually bound to shoot the spots.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods and Nomar Garciaparra, on the other hand, recently
declined doing commercials because of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tribal matters: Fox Sports Net's ``11 p.m. Regional Sports
Report'' dives off the dirt cliff Wednesday in these parts, hoping
not to make the thud you've been seeing during those inspired
commercials, on which the network might spend up to $10 million, to
announce its arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour edition wants not only to give viewers ``sports
news from the only region you care about _ yours'' but directly
compete with the local sportscasts in L.A. (which occasionally
stretch to three minutes long on a slow car-chaseless night) as
well as snuff out the ESPN ``SportsCenter'' late-night show that
continues to be more of a national focus.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Milt Weiss has already hired two anchors _
Barry LeBrock and Gaard Swanson _ but a third candidate, John
Fricke, hasn't been able to get out of his contract with Clear
Channel radio. He has six months remaining on that deal to continue
on XTRA-AM (690) as the morning show co-host. Reporters Lisa
Guerrero and Suzy Shuster have also been hired.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said he must have viewed hundreds of tapes of potential
on-air talent. But even in this personality-driven market, he says
the content of the show is what will distinguish it from other
Roggin-esque presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be less talent and more content,'' said Weiss, in
Seattle earlier this week for that regional's show launch. ``If you
don't have the information or superior highlights . . . that's the
key as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   __ All in the family: It was crazy enough that Keith Olbermann's
mom was hit in the face _ right between the eyes in fact _ by a
wild throw from Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch during a
game against the White Sox last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Even more weird, Olbermann had to narrate the clip of the
incident during Fox's baseball studio show later that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``And his throw . . . !ital!hits my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Olbermann was sitting in the season seats at Yankee
Stadium behind the first-base dugout that the family has had since
1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fine,'' Keith said this week. ``Two mild shiners.
Nothing broken. She even went back for Sunday's game, and more
applause.''
</P>
<P>
   To him, the most surreal thing about all this was seeing his mom
in the New York newspapers _ she made the front page of the Daily
News, plus three stories inside, and page three of the Post. But
Olbermann also said it's been kind of disheartening to find out
that no one from the team called to inquire about her injury.
</P>
<P>
   Only Yankees manager Joe Torre _ who did play-by-play of the
Angels in the late '80s for KTLA at the same time Olbermann was an
anchor at the station _ seemed concerned enough to ask reporters
the next day about her condition.
</P>
<P>
   But she's getting some media exposure out of this. Olbermann
promises an ``exclusive interview'' with his mom on this Saturday's
Fox pregame show before the Dodgers game in St. Louis.

   WHAT SMOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ TV Guide's somewhat gutsy move for putting out
special-edition Lakers covers on the June 24-30 issue. The series
released with pictures of the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe
Bryant, Rick Fox and Glen Rice proclaiming ``Dynasty Two'' was
actually distributed to newsstands Monday afternoon _ well before
Game 6 and before it was known if a Game 7 was needed. What if the
Lakers blew those last two games? Then they'd really be collector's
items (at just $1.79 a piece). Lakers play-by-play man Chick Hearn
wrote the story inside, comparing this team to Lakers teams of the
past, couching it with such phrases as ``the Lakers became a
championship-caliber team'' because of Phil Jackson. While the
greater Southern California market got this cover, the rest of the
country had to deal with the new cast from MTV's ``Real World.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ The quiet departure of Ferdie Pacecho from boxing telecasts
after nearly 25 years. When Showtime does the delay telecast of
Saturday night's (9 p.m.) bout in Scotland between Mike Tyson and
Lou Savarese, ``The Fight Doctor'' won't be there, having announced
his retirement during last week's broadcast of the Andrew
Golota-Orlin Norris bout. Showtime plans for a Pacecho special
called ``The Twelve Greatest Rounds of the 20th Century'' to air in
the fall. For now, the Showtime boxing team will exist with Steve
Albert and Bobby Czyz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Meanwhile, HBO's replay of last week's Shane Mosley-Oscar De
La Hoya bout, which drew $37 million from 700,000 buys at $49.95 to
make it the second-biggest nonheavyweight title bout ever, is
Saturday at 10:45 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Did you know: Tiger Woods was shown 407 times totaling 93
minutes and 23 seconds during his four-hour round Sunday at the
U.S. Open, according to sophisticated data collected by New York
Times reporter Richard Sandomir. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ NBC's Bob Costas said it on Wednesday as a guest on CBS'
Craig Kilborn's show, in reference to the rioting that took place
outside Staples Center after Game 6: ``An ESPN truck was torched .
. . by Fox Sports West.'' &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Isiah Thomas' agenda. Throughout the NBA Finals, the NBC
studio analyst danced around media speculation about his probable
future as Larry Bird's replacement as coach of the Indiana Pacers.
But then remember, Thomas predicted the Pacers would beat the
Lakers in six games. Why? ``I think the Pacers are the smartest
team playing basketball right now,'' he said before Game 1. ``If
they can keep games close, I think they can win because of their
intellectual capacity.'' Now, NBC's intellectual capacity has to be
questioned for allowing him to stay on during the series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Wonder how ESPN2 reached 70 million quicker than any other
cable channel in history? By airing quality programming such as
``Magic The Gathering'' tournaments, as it did Tuesday this week.

 &HT;    Justice was done, Bush says of execution
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On the day set for Gary Graham's execution, Gov.
George W. Bush had arranged a session with political reporters from
around the country to talk about the progress of his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both men kept their appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sat down with the reporters in his office a couple of hours
before the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole re- fused to block
Graham's execution. Graham was put to death by lethal injection
several hours later in Huntsville for the 1981 murder of a man in a
supermarket parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published Thursday in the Dallas Morning News showed that
73 percent of Texans agreed with Bush's support of the death
penalty. But 57 percent also said they believed innocent people
sometimes are put to death in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Was that acceptable? Bush was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not acceptable, and under my watch, I'm telling you
that I've analyzed every case, and I don't believe that's the case.
I'm confident that it's not the case _ that the people who have
been put to death have been guilty of the crime charged, and have
had full access to the courts,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Texas law gives the governor only limited powers to
intervene in capital cases _ powers already exhausted in the Graham
case by former Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat _ Bush has found
himself in a political bind over the past few days. He has been
held accountable for the execution without technically having
anything he could do about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, serving his second term as governor, expressed
reluctance about changing the law to make the governor more
directly accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the governor have the power to say yes or no? Shall we
do away with the Board of Pardons and Parole? I don't think so,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the governor has the power to grant only a 30-day
reprieve in a death penalty case (he also appoints the parole
board), Bush said he has carefully reviewed every case during his
term, including that of Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case that has had full `analyzation'and been looked
at,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He said jurors from the Graham trial who expressed doubts in
recent days about their verdict may have been influenced by ``two
weeks of publicity suggesting . . . (that Graham might not be
guilty).''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also expressed misgivings about federal legislation
proposed by Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) that would establish a
right to DNA testing for people accused in capital cases and give
the federal government a larger role in investigating hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   While he said he would ``appreciate federal help on prosecuting
hate crimes,'' such as the murder of an African-American dragged
behind a truck in Jasper, Texas, Bush said he was concerned about
the federal government encroaching on the states' role in criminal
cases.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed a similar mis- giving about the DNA legislation,
but said he favored using DNA evidence when it can be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in fielding similar questions on the campaign trail,
Bush sought to soften some of the frictions between himself and
anti-death penalty demonstrators who have dogged his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious matter and I welcome the debate. I think
it's healthy for a democracy. But I'm sworn to uphold the law.
That's my job,'' Bush said.

 &HT;    `Monday Night' Miller: Comedian joining football booth
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When ABC announced it would revamp the booth for
``Monday Night Football,'' the big question was the casting of the
``fan'' role that was handled so brilliantly in the 1970s by the
late Howard Cosell.
</P>
<P>
   The network answered that question Thursday by selecting
comedian Dennis Miller to the MNF booth. Miller will join returning
play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and Hall of Fame quarterback Dan
Fouts, who was drafted from ABC's college football roster to take
the Monday night stage.
</P>
<P>
   Don Ohlmeyer, who is back after producing MNF during the days of
Don Meredith and Cosell, also announced ESPN's Melissa Stark will
replace Lesley Visser as a sideline reporter and will be joined in
that role by Hall of Fame running back Eric Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to re-create the past,'' said Ohlmeyer. ``We
want to create a more enjoyable telecast that will make the game
relevant to hard-core fans, accessible to casual fans and
unpredictable to both. I didn't enjoy watching `Monday Night
Football' last year as a fan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nielsen ratings for MNF have decreased the past five
seasons, from an average of 17.8 with a booth of Al Michaels, Dan
Dierdorf and Frank Gifford in 1994, to last season's record-low of
13.7 with Michaels and Boomer Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer said Miller was chosen from a list of 15 to 20
candidates, which included radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who
wasn't ruled out for guest appearances during the season. Ohlmeyer
also said Miller was the first name he thought of, even though, ``I
didn't think he would be interested in, or capable of, being in the
booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who will continue his weekly show on HBO, secured the
job with an audition 2-1/2 weeks ago that Ohlmeyer and Michaels
both said blew them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Sebastian Janikowski slip something in Don's coffee,''
quipped Miller, referring to the arrest Wednesday of the Raiders
rookie kicker on charges of possession of an illegal drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty quirky hire. I think I can do the job, but I'm
not going to try to be Howard. In sports broadcasting, Cosell was
the most stunning talent we've had. He's the guy who always did it
best. You don't try to compete with that. I'm just going to be me,
and at the end of the year, it'll either play or it won't play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nielsen ratings for ``Monday Night Football'' have decreased
each of the past five seasons, from an average of 17.8 with a booth
of Michaels, Dan Dierdorf and Frank Gifford in 1994, to last
season's record-low for the program of 13.7 with Michaels and
Boomer Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he'll ask questions a fan might ask and give on his
thoughts or certain strategies and plays. But he won't delve into
politics, ``and I'll never question a player's fortitude. I'd look
lame doing that having never played the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where Fouts and Dickerson will come in. In
Dickerson's case, Ohlmeyer spoke of having different
responsibilities than traditional sideline reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the NFL may be more concerned about Eric's opinions
than Dennis' opinions,'' Ohlmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have a lot of television experience,'' Dickerson
said, ``but I know football. And I've always believed that honesty
is the best policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer also spoke of seeking a different rhythm for calling
the game, perhaps departing at times from the standard
``play-by-play does this, then analyst does that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This job for me is a dream come true,'' Fouts said. ``And
unlike Dennis who has another job, I will change to keep this job.
I grew up the son of a broadcaster and played 15 years with the
Chargers. The last time I worked with a coach named Don, Coryell
(the former Chargers coach), it turned out pretty well for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the disparity in ages between Visser, 46, and Stark,
26, Ohlmeyer, dismissed the question as a ``non-issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcaster Donna deVarona, 52, filed a $50 million lawsuit
against ABC Sports in April, saying she was fired because of her
age and gender.
</P>
<P>
   Visser, who joined ABC in 1994, covered a variety of sports,
including college football, figure skating, baseball and
thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer also said changes are forthcoming on the halftime show.
ESPN's Chris Berman will return, but his role will be changed, and
the show will not originate from an ESPN Zone restaurant.

AUSTIN, Texas: to proceed. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Jones, a spokesman for Bush, said early Thursday night that
he did not know what would become of the last-minute legal appeals
but that the state was waiting to make sure courts got a chance to
consider them. Bush was at the state capitol, meeting with aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in uncharted territory here,'' Jones said, referring to
the particular arguments that Graham's lawyers were pursuing and
that had clearly taken state officials by surprise. ``It's all
brand new. This is unprecedented for somebody to attempt to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   David R. Dow, a professor of law at the University of Houston,
said the last-minute uncertainty that suddenly descended over
Graham's execution reflected how sophisticated his lawyers were and
how sensitive Bush and the state of Texas were to the intensity of
public attention to the case. Under different circumstances, he
said, the state might have gone ahead with the execution, because
Graham's lawyers had already exhausted all the traditional
arguments in all the usual venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost always a new permutation that a very, very
thoughtful lawyer can think of,'' Dow said. ``But you have to have
a combination of two things _ real legal capability but also enough
of a faith in your client to think that it's worth it and crank out
papers even beyond the eleventh hour _ this is the eleventh and a
half hour.''
</P>
<P>
   If the state were not so acutely aware of all the eyes on the
case, he added, ``I don't think this would be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The Graham case attracted a remarkable amount of national and
even international attention, for many reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's conviction rested on the testimony of a single
eyewitness, his court-appointed lawyer provided only a nominal
defense and several jurors later expressed doubt that they would
have convicted him if they had been aware of certain facts and
testimony during the trial. Many legal experts cast Graham as a
perfect example of all that was wrong with the judicial system and
the death penalty, although many others noted that his appeals were
lodged in dozens of courts and been considered by an even larger
number of judges as he avoided execution for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the case also came at a time of deepening debate over
capital punishment, provoked by advances in DNA technology, new
studies that question the fairness with which the death penalty is
administered and the emergence of Bush, who presides over a state
that executes more inmates than any other, as a candidate for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The governor steadfastly maintained that he was treating this
case no differently than any other and that any action he did or
did not take would be impervious to political considerations,
immune to public protests and unaffected by a campaign that has
pivoted on his portrayal of himself as a sensitive, compassionate
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a lot of hand-wringing,'' said one adviser. ``But
everyone recognizes that the environment has changed now that he's
running for president.'' The adviser added that there was some
minimal concern _ though not too much yet _ that all the attention
to the death penalty in Texas was at times eclipsing the other
issues Bush wanted to discuss on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   But this adviser and others stressed that there was absolutely
no coordination or discussion between Bush and his campaign
advisers about the actual decisions that Bush faced on individual
death penalty cases. They said that the governor rendered these
judgments based on the merits of each case, not on any wider
political concerns.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush had taken any kind of action stop Graham's death, it
would have been the second time this month that he had intervened
to halt an execution in defiance of the board's recommendation.
Prior to June 1, he had never done so, although he did concur in
1998 with the board's vote to commute the death sentence of Henry
Lee Lucas, a confessed serial killer, to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Several political analysts said that one of the challenges
before Bush, now that almost everything he did was being evaluated
through the prism of his presidential ambitions, was not to come
across as vulnerable to public pressures or unsteady in his
convictions. Bush has repeatedly assailed Vice President Al Gore as
someone who bends too readily with the political winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for him to do is remain consistent,''
said Don Sipple, a Republican strategist. Sipple said that he
believed it was voters' impressions of Bush's constancy that
explained the high marks he received in many recent public opinion
polls for his leadership skills.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, there has been some evidence in polls of a softening in
public support for the death penalty, but those same polls showed
that roughly two-thirds of Americans are still in favor of it. And
several political analysts said that that was a large enough
majority, on a subject that was not at the top of most voters'
concerns, for Bush to rest assured that he was on the right side of
the issue. Gore also supports the death penalty and has been
relatively reticent to challenge Bush on the brisk rate of
executions in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, the governor has extremely limited discretion
if the board authorizes an execution. All the governor can do under
those circumstances is grant the inmate a one-time reprieve of 30
days, though that time often grows as the inmate undertakes new
court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said that in this case, he could not do even that. A
64-year old clause in the Texas constitution says that the governor
``shall have the power to grant one reprieve in any capital case,''
and only one reprieve. Both Bush and lawyers for the state have
interpreted that to mean that because Gov. Ann Richards had granted
Graham such a reprieve in 1993, Bush was unable to.
</P>
<P>
   But other legal experts said that the constitution could be
interpreted as permitting one reprieve per governor, not per
inmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's plain old ambiguous,'' said Dow, noting that no court in
Texas had ever considered the language or issued a ruling on its
precise meaning. He went on to say, ``It's easier to say you have
no power than to exercise it.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was convicted for the May 13, 1981, nighttime murder of
Bobby Lambert in the parking lot of a Houston grocery store. His
conviction provoked little fanfare at the time, but his case
gradually attracted the attention of death penalty opponents.
</P>
<P>
   His advocates argued that Graham's trial lawyer, Ronald Mock,
put up a lackluster defense and scarcely investigated the case. No
physical evidence linked Graham to the scene, and ballistics tests
found that a .22-caliber revolver confiscated from him did not
match the murder weapon. His conviction rested on the testimony of
a woman sitting in her car who saw the killer as he confronted and
shot Lambert about 30 feet away.

was sold for a jaw-dropping sum of money, then proceeded to lose an

EXECUTION UNLIKELY TO HURT BUSH POLITICALLY, EXPERTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
and R.A. DYER c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Questions about the execution of Gary Graham may dog Gov. George
W. Bush for the rest of his presidential campaign, but several
political experts said Thursday that the debate is unlikely to
seriously impede his run for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Heckling from death-penalty opponents has become a fixture at
Bush's recent campaign events as he faces criticism for not using
his political clout to block the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, however, maintained there
was nothing the governor could have done after the state Board of
Pardons and Paroles rejected Graham's last-day pleas.
</P>
<P>
   ``His hands are really tied,'' Cornyn said of the Republican
governor.
</P>
<P>
   The execution continued to fuel national debate on whether Bush
is certain that justice has been dispensed fairly to each prisoner
on Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, within minutes after Graham's attorneys gave up
on their appeals, Bush stepped out of his Capitol offices,
appearing solemn, and issued a short statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize there are good people who oppose the death
penalty. I have heard their message and I respect their heartfelt
point of view,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Graham's murder conviction remained intact through
appeals in more than 20 state and federal courts, involving
decisions by 33 judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``After considering all of the facts, I'm confident justice is
being done,'' Bush said in a prepared statement, declining to take
questions.
</P>
<P>
   He closed by saying: ``May God bless the victims, the families
of the victims, and may God bless Mr. Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not heard the last about Graham, experts agreed. But it
was unclear how long the execution will loom large in the
presidential race, or how significant it will become, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, ultimately, it's not going to have any serious
political ramifications for George W. Bush,'' said Gregory Wawro, a
political science professor at Columbia University in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Wawro said he believes that the highly emotional debate on
whether Bush should have stepped in at the last moment was
``largely manufactured'' by Bush detractors, using the news media
as a conduit.
</P>
<P>
   The public is overlooking the more important question of whether
the appeals process is flawed in death penalty cases, Wawro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's disappointing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Warr, a criminologist and sociology professor at the
University of Texas at Austin, concurred that it is unlikely that
Graham's death will do much to derail Bush's political aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   But it may become a nuisance for the governor, at a time when
nationwide support for capital punishment appears to be eroding
somewhat, Warr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is going to do is crystallize the opposition,'' he
said. ``It's going to be the rallying point, I believe, for those
who oppose the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush will continue to be perceived as someone who
considers capital punishment to be ``morally justified.'' But
Bush's decision not to intervene in a questionable death-penalty
case could portray him as someone who ``fails to appreciate the
possibility of error in the criminal justice system,'' Warr said.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush had blocked Graham's execution, Warr added, the action
would have angered some supporters who believe strongly in the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that it would have hurt him
politically if he had intervened,'' Warr said.
</P>
<P>
   The execution of Graham, and the questions about whether he
received equal and fair justice, will be raised throughout the
campaign, said Jim Riddlesperger, political science professor at
Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   But Riddlesperger and other experts agreed that the execution
will do little to hurt Bush's core support among Republicans, who
overwhelmingly believe that the death penalty deters violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, most people who are opponents of the death
penalty were not going to vote for George W. Bush under any
circumstance,'' Riddlesperger said.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the highly charged debates over abortion and gun
control, he said, there is little evidence to suggest that capital
punishment is a ``stirring issue in terms of helping people make
voting decisions.'' &QL;

GRAHAM EXECUTED AFTER DAY OF DELAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Defiant, combative and stalling with a
flurry of 11th-hour legal maneuvers, Gary Graham went to his death
Thursday night after his attorneys reluctantly gave up their fight
to stop the lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   The end came at 8:39 p.m., when doctors pronounced him dead, his
sentence carried out 19 years after a Houston killing that
punctuated a crime spree of at least 10 robberies, two shootings,
an abduction and a rape.
</P>
<P>
   Graham protested that he was innocent and that his execution,
which he called a ``lynching,'' was a ``murder that must be avenged
... by any means necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Graczyk of the Associated Press, who served as a pool
reporter and witness, said Graham put up a futile struggle to avoid
placement on the gurney.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials, he said, took the rare step of handcuffing
Graham to the bed in addition to using leather and Velcro straps.
</P>
<P>
   Graczyk said Graham entered the death chamber with bruises on
his arms and other parts of his body.
</P>
<P>
   While the drama and Graham's battle for life played out in the
courts, hundreds of supporters, including political leaders,
Hollywood celebrities and civil rights activists, protested outside
the Texas prison unit housing the death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's execution came more than 2 1/2 hours after he was
scheduled to die. He lost his final appeal before the U.S. Supreme
Court shortly before 6 p.m., but his attorneys then filed suit in a
federal court contending that his civil rights had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   With U.S. District Judge James R. Nowlin of Austin rejecting
that petition, Graham's attorneys decided that they had exhausted
their appeals and that it would be fruitless to take the case to
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit, legal experts speculated, was a last-ditch
attempt to win Graham a stay or keep his case in limbo until
midnight, when his death warrant would have expired and delayed the
execution at least 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles
declined by a 14-3 vote to recommend that Gov. George W. Bush grant
Graham a 120-day reprieve, a commutation or a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Graham had escaped execution in 1993 when then-Gov. Ann Richards
granted him a one-time, 30-day reprieve allowed under Texas law.
Some believed that Bush could have granted another 30-day reprieve,
even without a recommendation from the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is that `a' governor can give `a' defendant
one 30-day reprieve,'' said Jerry Perry, a government professor at
Angelo State University in San Angelo, Texas. ``I know that Ann
Richards in 1993 gave Graham a 30-day reprieve. What I don't know,
and I'm not sure anybody knows, is whether or not another governor
can give another reprieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush supported the board's recommendation, saying that 33 judges
had heard Graham's appeals and decided they were ``without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize there are good people who oppose the death
penalty,'' Bush said. ``I have heard their message and I respect
their heartfelt point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``After considering all of the facts, I'm confident justice is
being done.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham had steadfastly maintained that he was not guilty of the
killing that sent him to Death Row, the 1981 robbery-shooting death
of 53-year-old Bobby Grant Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   The execution capped almost two weeks of tense rhetoric and
demonstrations and a full day of angry protests outside
Huntsville's Walls Unit, a few hundred yards from the execution
chamber. Some demonstrators shouted anti-death penalty slogans with
bullhorns and banged drums.
</P>
<P>
   They called the execution ``a legal lynching.'' Death penalty
supporters, cordoned off in a separate area, said the condemned got
what he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Al Sharpton, along with U.S.
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, social activist Bianca Jagger
and minister Robert Muhammad watched the execution on Graham's
behalf. A protective glass separated them from the death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hanners, Lambert's grandson, was joined in a separate room
by crime-victims rights activist Dianne Clements and family friend
Rick Sandford.
</P>
<P>
   A circuslike atmosphere enveloped the area surrounding the Walls
Unit, beginning in the early afternoon. Graham supporters began
assembling on a blocked-off street that connects the prison to
downtown Huntsville about a quarter-mile to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the New Black Panthers, the Nation of Islam and
Amnesty International were among those who held out hope that an
11th-hour stay might come from the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, rejected the plea on a 5-4 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Most protesters carried signs proclaiming Graham's innocence or
suggesting that an African-American cannot be guaranteed justice in
Texas. Despite Graham's call for armed revolt a year and a half
ago, when he faced an execution date, several speakers urged the
crowd, which numbered several hundred, to remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a frequent critic of Texas' use of the death penalty,
gave successive interviews to the reporters who descended upon
Huntsville from across Texas, from the major TV networks and from
Europe. He said the decision by the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles to reject Graham's plea came as no shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pained by it, but not surprised,'' said Jackson, who had
met with Graham earlier in the day. ``Many other people might be
saved by the attention that Gary Graham has received. This system
is evil. His life will have tremendous meaning if this vicious
system is exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eastern edge of the prison unit, several hundred yards
from Graham's supporters, proponents of the execution, including
someone dressed as a Ku Klux Klansman and several others waving a
Confederate flag, applauded the parole board's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had 19 years,'' said a man wearing Army fatigues who
identified himself only as ``a Texan.'' ``That's enough. Let him
get what he deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man carried a sign saying: ``Give him old-fashioned
justice. Use a rope.'' The man said he feared retaliation from
Black Panthers if his name was published.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, whose age has been reported as 38 by prison officials
and 36 by his supporters, spent his final day in defiance. He
refused to cooperate with the order that he leave his cell on Death
Row in the Terrell Unit in Livingston. An extraction team removed
him by force and placed him in the prison bus to Huntsville, 45
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The team also had to remove Graham from the bus and place him in
the cell a few feet from the death chamber. His defiance caused
prison officials to deny him an opportunity for a farewell visit
with relatives. He also declined to order a last meal.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger, the former wife of rock star Mick Jagger, was allowed to
visit Graham, who since 1995 has called himself Shaka Sankofa to
reflect his African heritage. She described him as subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really did believe that the Board of Pardons and Paroles
would grant him a reprieve,'' Jagger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Graham case was seen as a political minefield for Bush, the
probable Republican presidential nominee who has presided over 135
executions as Texas governor. Graham's supporters urged Bush to
influence the parole board, whose members he appointed, to halt the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's conviction rested in large measure on the testimony of
one eyewitness. His lawyer did not call witnesses who later said
they could provide him an alibi during his trial. Appellate lawyers
have tried in vain to have their testimony heard in a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, said that the eyewitness testimony was
rock-solid and
</P>
<P>
   that Graham was in the midst of a violent crime spree when he
was arrested. He had been found passed out in the bed of a
57-year-old woman he had raped. Graham has admitted to the crime
spree.
</P>
<P>
   The case was a mere blip on the criminal justice radar screen
until 1993, when Graham's new lawyers gained attention as they
began pointing out what they saw as flaws in the case.
</P>
<P>
   They said others who witnessed the late-night shooting outside
of a Safeway store did not identify Graham as the gunman, and that
the gun found on Graham during his arrest was tested and proved not
to be the murder weapon. &QL;

DALEY JOINS THE GORE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ William M. Daley, the new chairman of Vice
President Al Gore's presidential campaign, acknowledged Thursday
that one of the biggest challenges facing Gore was that George W.
Bush was getting credit for the economy, the issue on which Gore
had been basing his hopes.
</P>
<P>
   But, Daley said, that was a ``knee jerk'' reaction and he hoped
to counter it by recruiting supporters from big business and labor
to come to Nashville, where Gore's campaign is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is right now,'' Daley said of Bush's receiving credit. ``I
don't know if it's just kind of a gut thing, but Republicans have
always historically got more credit for running the economy, and
being good for the economy, even at the height of the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think we've got a challenge to remind people what things
were like in 1992, and we've got a challenge to remind them that,
fine, you may take this eight years of economic expansion for
granted, but tough decisions were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Daley hastened to add that he understood the size of the
task ahead of him. ``I'm not being Pollyannish about how difficult
a presidential campaign is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, the secretary of commerce, spoke in an interview here as
he made his debut in Gore's headquarters as chairman on a day when
the Gore camp had to absorb another round of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official has recommended that an
independent counsel be named to investigate Gore's role in the
Democrats' questionable fund-raising activities of 1996. Two new
national polls showed Gore slipping further behind Bush. And James
P. Hoffa, the powerful labor leader, appeared with Ralph Nader, the
Green Party candidate who could siphon enough votes from Gore to
cost him a few key states.
</P>
<P>
   A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, taken during the start
of Gore's ``prosperity and progress tour,'' which was intended to
showcase the booming economy, put Bush ahead of Gore 49 percent to
41 percent. A bipartisan Battleground 2000/Voter.com poll showed
Bush ahead by 12 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said part of his task would be to bring business and labor
interests together and urge officials to move to Nashville to
dedicate themselves to Gore's candidacy. The Journal/NBC poll
showed that voters give Gore an advantage of only a single
percentage point _ statistically meaningless _ on his ability to
handle the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get people from labor and business down here,''
Daley said in an interview in his office, which will serve as his
command post until the November election. ``I'm asking people, `You
want to help? Fine. When are you going to leave your job and come
to Nashville?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get other validators _ Bob Rubin isn't
exactly some crazed, crazy liberal out there,'' Daley said of the
former Treasury secretary's backing of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As for internal concern that the Gore campaign lacks focus and a
theme, Daley said that at this point in 1992, Bill Clinton lacked
focus, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think there was a theme to Bill Clinton's candidacy?'' he
asked. ``I don't think that really connects until people connect,
and all of a sudden it's like, `Yeah, here's what's going on with
the race.' You can't say, `OK, there it is, there's the answer.' A
theme evolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley takes the reins officially on July 15, when he leaves his
cabinet post. He succeeds Tony Coelho, the campaign's former
chairman, who resigned last week for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho said in an interview with Bloomberg.com that his health
was worse than he had indicated last week. In addition to his
epilepsy and inflammation of the colon, he told the news service,
he has a brain cyst, though he does not know whether it is
malignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My seizures were getting worse,'' Coelho said of his epilepsy.
``I was having stomach cramps, but I would work my way through
them. I just had too much to do. Then, my sinuses above my eyes got
infected and they became inflamed and shut down, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   After arriving from Washington, Daley met with Tennessee
Democrats on Thursday morning. He then shook hands with all the
campaign staff members, including about 80 paid workers and 70
interns and volunteers, at their desks, and spoke to them
collectively for about 15 minutes. Listeners described his comments
in the meeting, which was closed to reporters, as welcoming and
inspirational.
</P>
<P>
   Daley described his message to the staff as being ``all about
grinding it out for four and a half months.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was too soon to discuss any changes he had in mind,
but cautioned that the campaign would ``not lurch this way and
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You just lay out a strategy and go for it, and you don't jump
around,'' he said. ``But I'm just getting immersed in the daily
give and take, the flow. It's really easy for someone who's not
following the ebb and flow every day to be criticizing it. You've
got to really get into it to understand what the hell's going on,
and that takes a while.''

HUNTSVILLE, Texas: the death chamber.

him by force and placed him in the prison bus to Huntsville, 45
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The team also had to remove Graham from the bus and place him in
the cell a few feet from the death chamber. His defiance caused
prison officials to deny him an opportunity for a farewell visit
with relatives. He also declined to order a last meal.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger, the former wife of rock star Mick Jagger, was allowed to
visit Graham, who since 1995 has called himself Shaka Sankofa to
reflect his African heritage. She described him as subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really did believe that the Board of Pardons and Paroles
would grant him a reprieve,'' Jagger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Graham case was seen as a political minefield for Bush, the
probable Republican presidential nominee who has presided over 135
executions as Texas governor. Graham's supporters urged Bush to
influence the parole board, whose members he appointed, to halt the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's conviction rested in large measure on the testimony of
one eyewitness. His lawyer did not call witnesses who later said
they could provide him an alibi during his trial. Appellate lawyers
have tried in vain to have their testimony heard in a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, said that the eyewitness testimony was
rock-solid and
</P>
<P>
   that Graham was in the midst of a violent crime spree when he
was arrested. He had been found passed out in the bed of a
57-year-old woman he had raped. Graham has admitted to the crime
spree.
</P>
<P>
   The case was a mere blip on the criminal justice radar screen
until 1993, when Graham's new lawyers gained attention as they
began pointing out what they saw as flaws in the case.
</P>
<P>
   They said others who witnessed the late-night shooting outside
of a Safeway store did not identify Graham as the gunman, and that
the gun found on Graham during his arrest was tested and proved not
to be the murder weapon. &QL;

GRAHAM EXECUTED AFTER DAY OF DELAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Defiant, combative and stalling with a
flurry of 11th-hour legal maneuvers, Gary Graham went to his death
Thursday night after his attorneys reluctantly gave up their fight
to stop the lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   The end came at 8:39 p.m., when doctors pronounced him dead, his
sentence carried out 19 years after a Houston killing that
punctuated a crime spree of at least 10 robberies, two shootings,
an abduction and a rape.
</P>
<P>
   Graham protested that he was innocent and that his execution,
which he called a ``lynching,'' was a ``murder that must be avenged
... by any means necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Graczyk of the Associated Press, who served as a pool
reporter and witness, said Graham put up a futile struggle to avoid
placement on the gurney.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials, he said, took the rare step of handcuffing
Graham to the bed in addition to using leather and Velcro straps.
</P>
<P>
   Graczyk said Graham entered the death chamber with bruises on
his arms and other parts of his body.
</P>
<P>
   While the drama and Graham's battle for life played out in the
courts, hundreds of supporters, including political leaders,
Hollywood celebrities and civil rights activists, protested outside
the Texas prison unit housing the death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's execution came more than 2 1/2 hours after he was
scheduled to die. He lost his final appeal before the U.S. Supreme
Court shortly before 6 p.m., but his attorneys then filed suit in a
federal court contending that his civil rights had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   With U.S. District Judge James R. Nowlin of Austin rejecting
that petition, Graham's attorneys decided that they had exhausted
their appeals and that it would be fruitless to take the case to
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit, legal experts speculated, was a last-ditch
attempt to win Graham a stay or keep his case in limbo until
midnight, when his death warrant would have expired and delayed the
execution at least 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles
declined by a 14-3 vote to recommend that Gov. George W. Bush grant
Graham a 120-day reprieve, a commutation or a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Graham had escaped execution in 1993 when then-Gov. Ann Richards
granted him a one-time, 30-day reprieve allowed under Texas law.
Some believed that Bush could have granted another 30-day reprieve,
even without a recommendation from the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is that `a' governor can give `a' defendant
one 30-day reprieve,'' said Jerry Perry, a government professor at
Angelo State University in San Angelo, Texas. ``I know that Ann
Richards in 1993 gave Graham a 30-day reprieve. What I don't know,
and I'm not sure anybody knows, is whether or not another governor
can give another reprieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush supported the board's recommendation, saying that 33 judges
had heard Graham's appeals and decided they were ``without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize there are good people who oppose the death
penalty,'' Bush said. ``I have heard their message and I respect
their heartfelt point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``After considering all of the facts, I'm confident justice is
being done.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham had steadfastly maintained that he was not guilty of the
killing that sent him to Death Row, the 1981 robbery-shooting death
of 53-year-old Bobby Grant Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   The execution capped almost two weeks of tense rhetoric and
demonstrations and a full day of angry protests outside
Huntsville's Walls Unit, a few hundred yards from the execution
chamber. Some demonstrators shouted anti-death penalty slogans with
bullhorns and banged drums.
</P>
<P>
   They called the execution ``a legal lynching.'' Death penalty
supporters, cordoned off in a separate area, said the condemned got
what he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Al Sharpton, along with U.S.
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, social activist Bianca Jagger
and minister Robert Muhammad watched the execution on Graham's
behalf. A protective glass separated them from the death chamber.

OIL AND GAS FUEL BUSH RUN FOR PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Oil and gas money has been the essential lubricant
of Gov. George W. Bush's political career.
</P>
<P>
   It financed his unsuccessful run for Congress in 1978, it helped
him win the governor's office in 1994 and it is now fueling his run
for president.
</P>
<P>
   In the current presidential contest, Bush has raised 15 times
more money from oil and gas interests than Vice President Al Gore;
his biggest lifetime patrons are employees of the Enron Oil Co. and
at least 25 of his top fund-raisers, the ``Pioneers,'' are
connected to the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has received financial support from many of the biggest
names in the oilpatch: the Hunt brothers, the Bass family, A.R.
Sanchez Jr., Kenneth Lay, Roy Huffington and David and Charles
Koch. The second-largest source of contributions for his
presidential campaign is the Houston law firm Vinson &AMP; Elkins,
which prides itself on the size and reach of its oil and gas
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has remained largely mute on the recent increase in
gasoline prices, even as Gore loudly accuses oil companies of price
gouging, antitrust violations and collusion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush blames the Clinton administration for environmental and
energy policies that discourage oil exploration and that have
contributed to the high prices consumers, particularly in the
vote-rich Midwest, are paying at the gas pumps. While he supports a
new Federal Trade Commission investigation, Bush has not even
hinted that oil industry greed could be at the root of the recent
price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that the administration has shown a lack of leadership
on the issue and called on President Clinton to lean harder on
oil-producing countries to ``open the spigots'' to bring gasoline
prices down.
</P>
<P>
   His attitude reflects his background in West Texas oil business,
as well as the views of his friends and financial backers in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He himself came out of the oil and gas business in Midland, so
his soft stance on the current oil crisis is understandable,'' said
Craig McDonald of Texans for Public Justice, a watchdog group in
Austin. ``Bush's financial support comes heavily from the oil
industry. They are the kingmakers that put him in the governor's
mansion and are the kingmakers that will try to put him in the
White House because his policies coincide with their interests.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current campaign, Bush has received $1.54 million from
individuals employed in the oil and gas business and related
industries. According to Federal Election Commission filings
compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, individuals from
670 different oil-related interests contributed to the Bush
campaign, from $250 contributions from Texas gas station owners to
scores of $1,000 donations from executives of the nation's biggest
oil companies, gas pipeline concerns and oil field service
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the largest contributors are Enron ($92,250), El Paso
Energy ($39,834), Koch Industries ($32,200), Exxon Mobil ($30,575),
Coastal Corp. ($22,475) and Bass Brothers Enterprises ($21,000).
</P>
<P>
   Gore has received less than $100,000 in contributions from
individuals associated with the oil business. No single
energy-related organization provided as much as $10,000 to the Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The center also tallied oil industry contributions to individual
candidates and the two major political parties. It found the
industry gave a total of $10.7 million to Republican candidates and
committees and $3.2 million to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   According to another study published earlier this year, four of
Bush's top five career patrons are in the oil and gas business. The
study, conducted by the Center for Public Integrity, looked at
Bush's campaigns for Congress, the governor's office and the
presidency, as well as donations for renovations of the Texas
governor's office and Bush's inaugural celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The four concerns are Enron, the Sanchez family of Laredo,
Texas, the Bass family of Fort Worth and Vinson &AMP; Elkins. Together
they have given more than $1.5 million to advance Bush's political
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew substantial support from oil interest in his
unsuccessful run for Congress from Midland in 1978. According to
federal campaign reports and local newspaper accounts, roughly half
of Bush's campaign treasury came from friends and acquaintances in
the Texas oil business.

 By CAROLYN SAID  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It started simply, &LR;  with a guy who really loved
movies. He scribbled his film recommendations on note cards and
stuffed them into videotape boxes in the small video-rental store
he opened in the mid-80s.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward a decade. From that decidedly low-tech beginning,
Stuart Skorman blazed a trail as an e-commerce pioneer, founding
video seller Reel.com.
</P>
<P>
   The company became a market leader, was sold for a jaw-dropping
sum of money, then proceeded to lose an equally jaw-dropping sum.
And last week, Reel.com had the plug pulled on its e-commerce
operations and laid off most of its staff, amid similar shutdowns
at a score of other dot-com companies.
</P>
<P>
   Reel.com's rapid rise and fall resembles the plot line of
innumerable other e-tailers who went from sizzle to fizzle
practically overnight.
</P>
<P>
   All Skorman wanted to do was share his enthusiasm for movies.
Creative and unconventional, Skorman describes himself as
resembling Doc Brown, the kooky scientist in ``Back to the
Future''; his employees viewed him as Ben and Jerry (of ice cream
fame) rolled into one open-hearted hippie/entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Skorman devised an elaborate, cross-referencing system to help
his video store customers find movies they'd like. Customers loved
the guidance; he was able to add more stores. The seven outlets of
his Empire Video chain in New England became among the
highest-grossing video stores in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster noticed and hired Skorman to create movie kiosks. He
sold Empire to Blockbuster and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint as a high-stakes professional poker player,
Skorman plunged back into the video business using what he
considered the perfect vehicle: the World Wide Web, which was just
starting to take off.
</P>
<P>
   He started a company in Berkeley, Calif., (it later moved to
nearby Emeryville) and launched a Web site,  &LR; reel.com, &LR;  in January
1997 with a giant database of movie reviews and movie-matching
technology to suggest films people would like based on &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; their past preferences. It was a high-tech version of his note
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Skorman realized people wouldn't pay for the movie suggestions,
so he decided to add an online video store. It opened in April 1997
with 35,000 titles for rent _ five times as many as the average
video store _ and 85,000 for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Guiding people to films they'd like was still his passion. The
fledgling company put thousands of hours into its database of film
reviews. ``We hired the best video store kiddos in town'' _ young
clerks who loved movies as much as he did _ ``paid them $25 an
hour, which was a big deal for them. Sometimes you couldn't walk
through our office, there were so many people lying on the floor
debating about movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, Reel opened an 8,000-square-foot walk-in store in
Berkeley to help drive business to the Web site and provide a
stronger income source. It was the first Web site to establish a
physical presence, a strategy that would be called bricks and
clicks two years later. The store used the movie matching
technology in kiosks; had tons of classic, cult and foreign movies;
and carried four times as many titles as most video stores.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Physical Presence a Mistake
</P>
<P>
   The store was a hit, but in retrospect, Skorman says it was a
mistake. ``We only had $4 million (in venture money and private
placement) and we split it between the store and the Web site. We
should have put all our resources into the Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Running Reel was like producing a major motion picture with a
terrific concept and brilliant cast, but broken-down cameras and an
ever-evolving script. The individual reviews were engaging, and the
movie matching concept worked, but the underlying technology was
rickety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand the importance of the technical side,''
Skorman said. As a result, he didn't invest much time or resources
developing it. ``Our first six months the site crashed daily,
sometimes dozens of times. At one point, we lost 5,000 orders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Keystone Kops pace meant Reel let some big breaks pass by.
Marvin Skorman, Stuart's older brother, flew in from his Rochester,
N.Y., psychotherapy practice one week a month to act as unofficial
chief technology officer. ``Big-name people like TV Guide would
call us and say, `We want to partner,''' he recalled. ``We'd say,
`We don't have time.' They'd offer a bigger percentage. We'd say,
`We're drowning here.' They'd say, `OK, complete creative control.'
We'd say no.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of REEL23 (597 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The site didn't have basic e-commerce features like a way to save
repeat customers' data. Every single time customers placed an
order, they had to type in their address and credit card number.
</P>
<P>
   Renting online was cumbersome _ customers had to order two or
three days in advance, then mail back the videos _ and expensive.
Each title cost $4.50 (later $5) plus shipping, versus $3 or less
at the corner video store.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Skorman considered renting online a stop-gap measure:
He saw Reel's future in video on demand, when consumers would
download movies instantly to their TVs and computers.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Unique Site
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the glitches, there was nothing else like it and
the site attracted a growing number of devotees, especially for
video and DVD sales. Sales zoomed from $745,000 for all of 1997 to
about $1 million a month during the first nine months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For movie fans, Reel was a treasure trove. One customer, a guy
named Paul, would frequently call to talk with customer service
reps as he ordered dozens of movies, many so esoteric that even a
film buff like Skorman had never heard of them.
</P>
<P>
   Paul turned out to be Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. He became
an investor in Reel, along with Intel Corp., a private bank and two
existing investors _ a former Blockbuster executive and
CMGAtVentures _ to the tune of $10.5 million in spring 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With continued growth, Skorman brought in more-experienced
management in the person of Julie Wainwright, who had helped turn
Berkeley Systems from a screen-saver company into an entertainment
company. Wainwright became chief executive in March 1998 and
eliminated the unpractical rentals so Reel could focus on sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' had just shattered box office records and won the
1998 Best Picture Oscar. Wainwright came up with the idea of
selling the video at $9.99, half the studio's recommended price.
Reel would lose $6 on each of the 300,000-odd ``Titanic''
videotapes it sold but gained new customers and brand awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Reel's technology problems were still out of control. Skorman
felt like he was driving a runaway stagecoach. He decided to sell
and talked to the top two video store chains, Viacom's Blockbuster
and Hollywood Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood was still run by its founder, Mark Wattles, who had
parlayed a single Portland, Ore., video store into 1,000 Hollywood
Video outlets in a decade, creating the country's second biggest
video chain after Blockbuster. Viacom was a multinational
conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   For Skorman, the choice was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the entrepreneurial spirit Mark Wattles had was
better than a big company like Viacom,'' Skorman said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Selling the Company
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood was eager for an entree to the Internet and Reel
looked like just the ticket. Even though in its brief history Reel
had lost almost $19.8 million on revenues of $9.3 million,
Hollywood paid a princely $96.9 million, a third in cash, the rest
in stock. It was a sevenfold return for Reel's investors, instant
access to millions of customers and great synergy with a leading
brand. The deal made Skorman, who left the company, a
multimillionaire and many of the employees rich.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like the perfect happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Then Godzilla stomped in.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com added videotapes to its product lineup a month after
the Hollywood/Reel deal's October 1998 close. Within 45 days,
Amazon was the No. 1 video retailer on the Web, according to
``Amazon.com,'' Robert Spector's account of the Seattle company's
rise.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Amazon was already the online leader in both books
and CDs. Amazon had bought the Internet Movie Database, an
extensive compendium of movie reviews and trivia, so it had
competitive content. It had a huge customer base and could easily
cross-sell videos to all those book and CD buyers.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of REEL23 (597 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Computer seller Buy.com also added movies to its site in
November, plus books and video games. Its philosophy was
rock-bottom prices, dispensing with niceties like reviews. It had
technology to check rivals' Web sites constantly, to make sure its
prices were the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' take-no-prisoners style and ``Get big
fast'' motto meant he wouldn't be undersold. Suddenly, Reel found
itself in an ugly price war.
</P>
<P>
   Videos never had much margin to begin with. In fact, Amazon,
Reel and Buy.com all bought them from the same distributors. There
wasn't much they could do to differentiate them. Sure, Reel had a
great database, but now so did Amazon. And both Buy and Amazon
could play hardball with pricing because they had other product
lines.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Reel fought back, saying it would match any price.
</P>
<P>
   Wainwright clashed with the new owners and left in February
1999; she soon landed at San Francisco startup Pets.com, partially
funded by Amazon, the company that was crushing Reel.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood started bringing in new management and investing
heavily to fix Reel's shaky technology and market the company.
During the first nine months of 1999, Reel expanded from 115 to 174
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood kept the Reel name, which some saw as a big mistake.
``Had Hollywood Entertainment immediately changed Reel's name to
Hollywood, rerouted all the traffic, educated people that it was
the same Reel but with better backing and selection, they would
have been able to create greater marketing synergies between the
two companies,'' said Ken Cassar, Internet analyst with Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Wattles took over as CEO of Reel after Wainwright left but spent
most of his time in Portland running Hollywood. Some employees said
it was difficult not having an on-site CEO. ``It was like there was
nobody at home,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing Reel's technology underpinnings was a huge task. In
August 1999, Reel introduced a rebuilt site, which finally had
``express ordering'' to let repeat customers store their basic
information so they wouldn't have to type it in with every order.
It was absurdly late.
</P>
<P>
   Reel's losses continued to mount, although that was nothing new
for the world of e-commerce. In 1999, Reel lost $98.5 million on
sales of $40.2 million. The discounting wars had forced it to slash
prices so low that it lost 13 cents on every $1 sale, not including
the costs of marketing, staff, offices and other fixed expenses.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Change of Plans
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Hollywood stopped Reel's deep price cuts; DVDs were no
longer 50 percent off, for example. Reel's gross margins climbed to
7 percent, but it still lost $28.4 million (or $15.9 million
excluding goodwill amortization) on revenues of $14.3 million for
the first quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily leveraged Hollywood couldn't convince its investors to
prop up Reel. Financiers insisted on capping how much Hollywood
spent on the e-commerce operation; it was starting to approach that
limit.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood had hoped to cash in on Wall Street's seemingly
insatiable appetite for e-commerce. But it waited too long.
Hollywood filed registration papers for an IPO in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rumblings about whether e-commerce companies really had
sustainable business models had started to crescendo. By January
2000 pundits were predicting the sector's death and IPOs were being
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's store profits were up 40 percent but its stock had
plunged 75 percent because investors saw Reel dragging it down.
Wattles, who owns about 25 percent of the company, personally lost
more than a quarter of a billion dollars on paper.
</P>
<P>
   He needed to act fast.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of REEL23 (597 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Last week, Hollywood shut down Reel's e-commerce operations and
laid off all of its employees. Reel will continue to exist as a
movie-information site; buyers are referred to former rival
Buy.com. The Berkeley store, one of the country's highest-grossing
video stores, remains open; in fact, Hollywood plans to replicate
its format.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood still hopes that eventually Reel will be its front-end
to video on demand, but expects it will be five to 10 years before
that happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart-breaking thing was we had an incredibly talented,
smart group of people at every level,'' said Rosie Ruley Atkins,
who was a vice president from shortly after Reel's inception until
April. In recent months, with its technology problems resolved,
Reel had started ``to mature as an organization,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Skorman has gone on to start another dot-com, online learning
site HungryMinds.com. In his spare time, he plays in a rock 'n'
roll band with friends. They're recording a new song called ``Easy
Dot Com, Easy Dot Go.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Easy dot com, easy dot go &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The market crashed, no more easy dough &LR;
</P>

Net's Latest Challenge _ Find Cheaper Gas Prices &HT;    By DAVID LAZARUS 
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ From his cluttered apartment in El Cerrito,
Calif., Tom Lu is doing what he can to liberate motorists from the
tyranny of high gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right thing to do,'' he said. ``Gas prices are
just insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu and a handful of comrades are running a Web site called
PriceHive.com, where users can search free of charge for the
cheapest gas in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   PriceHive is just one example of how the Internet is helping
consumers deal with an extraordinary surge in gas prices
nationwide. Another service launched yesterday by e-commerce
heavyweight Priceline.com allows users to name their own price at
the pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense,'' said Derek Leckow, an analyst with
Barrington Research in Chicago, where gas prices are topping $2 a
gallon. ``People are pretty price conscious. It's pretty much the
only differentiating factor when it come to gas.''
</P>
<P>
   At PriceHive, Lu said the idea of allowing users to search for
the cheapest gas in a specific area came to him this spring as pump
prices throughout the Bay Area soared to ``We're drivers, too,'' he
said. ``We felt like victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims, that is, who just so happened to have a proprietary
search engine designed to seek out the cheapest book prices on the
Net _ PriceHive's original focus.
</P>
<P>
   Lu, who had helped develop the software while also working as a
database consultant for clients like Kaiser Permanente health care,
realized the search engine would be equally efficient at
pinpointing low gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   After launching the service in March, Lu said hundreds of
visitors to PriceHive have posted about 1,000 gas prices at more
than 400 gas stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Because the service originally focused only the San Francisco
Bay Area, about three-quarters of the listings are for this region.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a search of San Rafael, Calif., shows that unleaded
regular gas can be had for as little as $1.63 a gallon at Smog Pros
on Second Street or as much as $1.97 at Montecito 76 on Third.
</P>
<P>
   PriceHive also provides a bulletin board for users to trade tips
and rants about gas prices. Recently, one user named Karen alerted
others that the Town Pump station in Roseburg, Ore., was selling
gas for just $1.49 a gallon. ``I suggest you fill up while the
prices are still low,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Doyle in Ohio lamented that pump prices were up another 20
cents in his state and blamed the increase on the Clinton
administration promoting use of cleaner-burning fuel. ``Is there
ever going to be an end to this?'' he wondered.
</P>
<P>
   Lu, privately held PriceHive's president and chief executive,
said he sees the site playing a role in organizing boycotts of
especially high-priced oil companies or service stations.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GAS23 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``It's C2B _ consumer-to-business,'' he said. ``Consumers are
telling businesses that they can't afford these prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices skyrocketed in the Midwest this week as reformulated
gas was introduced in several states. The same thing happened in
California several years ago when a similar blend of fuel made its
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Amid such turmoil, not to mention growing political uproar in
Washington, Priceline fortuitously launched its name-your-own-price
gas service yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The service is set up along the same lines as Priceline's
original offering of discount airline tickets and hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Padgett, a spokesman for Priceline WebHouse Club, the
affiliate handling the gas operation, said about 1 million people
had preregistered for the gas service before its official
unveiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very viable business,'' he said. ``I believe Priceline
has proven that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Priceline has yet to earn a nickel in profit, but
that's beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   The company's registered gas customers name a per-gallon price
they would be willing to pay and select three service stations they
would be willing to visit.
</P>
<P>
   If one of those stations agrees to the price, Priceline
automatically deducts the amount of the sale from the user's credit
card and authorizes the pump purchase.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Padgett said average gas prices on Priceline are as much as
20 cents a gallon less than at the pump. Priceline itself makes up
the difference to participating service stations through a
combination of fees paid by oil companies, advertisers and
affiliated sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   While the profitability of such a venture may not be readily
apparent, the crux is that sponsors and advertisers are helping pay
for each purchase in return for being able to promote their goods
and services to Priceline users, and oil companies are cutting into
sales to attract new customers.
</P>
<P>
   Not San Francisco's Chevron Corp., though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at their model,'' said Fred Gorell, a company
spokesman. ``We think it's interesting. But we have decided against
selling motor gasoline online at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Priceline won't say which oil companies or service stations are
participating in its service. But industry sources said none of the
leading players is involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point?'' Gorell asked. ``The market is competitive
enough as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not competitive enough for PriceHive's Lu. ``Chevron's profit
tripled recently,'' he said. ``Can you attribute that only to
OPEC?''
</P>
<P>
   Although PriceHive makes no money from its gas-search service,
Lu said he would continue offering it until pump prices return to
earth. And he thinks his site will help.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices in the San Francisco Bay Area, Lu pointed out,
remained largely unchanged as Midwest prices went into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no proof,'' he said, ``but I think we have contributed
to gas-price stability in the Bay Area.''

Giants Find New Way to Score at Home Field 
By PETER SINTON &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Giants  &LR; have figured another
way to hit homers out of Pacific Bell Park _ renting the popular
stadium to business and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   The whole park rents for up to $125,000 for four hours. America
Online and Time Warner rented it May 11 for a corporate bash, and
on October 28 the Catholic Archdiocese is taking it over for a Mass
for 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit and religious groups get no price break, not even if
they pray for the Giants, said Patrick Gallagher, president of
Giant Enterprises, a subsidiary of the ball club that handles
non-baseball activities. After all, the stadium was privately
financed for $319 million and has major mortgage payments.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the San Francisco Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureaus held
its annual luncheon  &LR; at the park, serving a picnic basket lunch and
pitching the 40,800-seat stadium to 1,200 members, including
meeting organizers, event planners and hoteliers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the crowd filled only a small section of field-level
seats, it was influential enough to bring out the three Willies _
Brown, Mays and McCovey.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants and the city both know how important tourism is to
their fortunes. Each year, about 17 million visitors leave $6.6
billion in San Francisco. That's even more important than their
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Business conventions and meetings account for about 25 percent
of the total and pose a potential bonanza for Pac Bell Park. The
Giants play fewer than 90 days a year, which leaves about 275 days
for others to rent the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BALLPARK (90711 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Corporate incentive programs and trade shows are looking for
more than ballrooms,'' said Doug Neilson, vice president of the San
Francisco Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. Pac Bell Park with all its
attractions and ferry boat access is quickly joining the ranks of
San Francisco City Hall and local museums as a favorite venue for
corporate parties.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher expects that the park will book about 100 events this
first year and should generate $10 million to $15 million annually
within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to rent the whole stadium for $100,000
weekdays or $125,000 evenings and weekends, you can rent just a
piece of the park. For example:
</P>
<P>
   --Diamond and outfield _ $20,000 each
</P>
<P>
   --90-minute presentation using Astrovision Scoreboard and
seating for 2,500 _ $20,000
</P>
<P>
   --Coca-Cola fan lot _ $12,500
</P>
<P>
   --Luxury suites _ $10,000 each
</P>
<P>
   --Visitors clubhouse _ $2,000
</P>
<P>
   --Giants clubhouse (off-season only) _ $5,000
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said the Giants also are working with Total Adventures
to rent out the field, or portions of it, to organizations for
team-building events. And for $50,000, you can rent the field to
play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Beware: The listed prices do not include food, beverages or
anything above base rental. When AOL and Time Warner rented Pac
Bell Park to celebrate the launch of eCompany Now magazine, it had
to pay an extra $25,000 just for a large tarp to cover center field
where the band Bare Naked Ladies performed.

WINSTON WEST FOCUSES ON L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Racing three times on one track in one
season has not been unusual for the NASCAR Winston West Series, but
running at Irwindale Speedway three times this year is vital,
series spokesman Kevin Green says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important market for us,'' Green said. ``And
aside from the market, we have a number of teams from here. So,
it's important.''
</P>
<P>
   The half-mile oval at Mesa Marin has hosted three events in one
year three times, between 1994 and '96. This year, the Bakersfield
track has two NWWS races and Irwindale has three _ two Home Depot
250s, Saturday and Aug. 19, and the season-ending Home Depot 300 on
Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also important to our sponsors,'' Green said. ``L.A. is a
very important market to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than last year's sell-out opening night and Turkey Night
Grand Prix, the two NWWS events drew the largest attendance numbers
last year at Irwindale. In those races, Steve Portegna and Austin
Cameron both won their first NWWS races.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkey Night Grand Prix is the track's biggest open-wheel
event and the NWWS races are the biggest NASCAR events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, we look at this as our Winston Cup (race),'' track
marketing director Pat Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   __ The particulars: Twenty-six cars will race for a total of
$116,991. Twenty-one cars will qualify through two-lap time trials,
two spots will be awarded based on point standings, two on owner
point standings and one to the NWWS champion.
</P>
<P>
   Gates open at 4 p.m., with time trials starting at 4:30 p.m. An
autograph session will be at 6:30 p.m., with the Super Late Model
trophy dash at 7 p.m. The NWWS race is scheduled for a 7:45 p.m.
start and the 75-lap Super Late Model race will follow the NWWS
show. Speedvision will tape the NWWS race. It will be broadcast
July 15 at 5 p.m. and July 17 at 11 a.m.

Web Site Has All the Stock-Option Answers &HT;    By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Are stock options considered in determining
child support payments? Are there ways around a lockup? Can I be
fired when I am about to vest in company stock options? If I sell
my options today, how much will I get after taxes?
</P>
<P>
   If you've got questions like these, a Web site that premiered
debuted  &LR; yesterday,  &LR; www.mystockoptions.com &LR; , has answers.
</P>
<P>
   More answers, in fact, than any stock-option site I've seen, and
there aren't many of them, although more are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of resources and high-priced consultants for
companies that offer stock options, but very few for the employees
who get them. Until four or five years ago, stock options weren't a
pervasive form of compensation. Now they are, and so is the thirst
for information.
</P>
<P>
   Two books published since last year, ``Consider Your Options:
Get the Most from Your Equity Compensation'' and ``Stock Options,
An Authoritative Guide to Incentive and Nonqualified Stock
Options,'' are best-sellers in Silicon Valley, according to
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   As good as those books are, the site has several advantages:
It's free (you have to register), interactive and dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   The site has three main components:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Content.  &LR; The home page features articles written by
journalists, professors, lawyers and other professionals, including
an interesting one about companies that are trying to grab back
options from employees who defect to a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a glossary and hundreds of ``FAQs,'' or short
answers to well-organized questions ranging from simple to complex.
</P>
<P>
   Under ``Articles'' you'll find links to more than 100 stories
from other online and print publications, including The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   If you still can't find what you want, you can post a question
in the Discussion Forum or go to ``Ask Our Experts'' and e-mail
your query. The company says it will try to answer as many
questions as it can on the site.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; My Records.  &LR; This is where you enter information about your own
option package, including stock symbol, grant date, exercise price
and date and vesting schedule. The company says the data are well
encrypted and it promises not to sell personal information to third
parties, although it will disclose the general demographics of its
users.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tools.  &LR; Once you've filled out ``My Records,'' you can use the
``Calculators'' and ``Modeling Tools'' to play ``what if'' games
with your options, such as what would they be worth, after taxes,
if you cashed them in today, or what they would be worth in the
future depending on various scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   You can enter your own federal tax rate and Social Security
withholding information. One minor drawback is that you can't
change your state tax rate. If you register as a California
resident, it will assume a tax rate of 6 percent, which is the
state's mandated withholding rate on options but not necessarily
your actual tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PENDER23 (70549 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Although the site is intuitive, the tools could use a tutorial.
</P>
<P>
   The brains behind myStockOptions.com are Bruce Brumberg, a
Boston-area lawyer with experience in stock plans and insider
trading rules; Peter Van Ness, a new-media consultant who designed
and built the site; and Jesse Brill, a Berkeley lawyer who
publishes two newsletters, the Corporate Counsel and the Corporate
Executive, and is also chair of the National Association of Stock
Plan Professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The privately financed company expects to make money three ways.
One is selling advertising on the site. There's none yet, but ``the
demographics of people with equity compensation is very, very
attractive,'' Brumberg says. He also intends to customize the site
for employers with stock plans, and license parts of the technology
to other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Rosen, executive director of the National Center for
Employee Ownership in Oakland, Calif., and an authority on
stock-option plans, found the site ``very good. It's quite useful,
easy to get around in, the articles are easy to read, and the
questions are good.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pastore, a San Francisco investment adviser who wrote the
aforementioned book titled ``Stock Options,'' etc. thinks the site
is a ``good place to start. There are a tremendous number of
articles. I think people need to read as much as they can, but
that's really not a substitute for getting good advice.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits, however, that there aren't many places employees can
get advice. Accountants, attorneys and financial planners might
help, ``but a lot of them are not up to speed on options.''
</P>
<P>
   MyStockOptions.com could get some competition from
 &LR; www.optionwealth.com &LR; . This site advertises some of the same
features as myStockOptions.com
</P>
<P>
   One thing the site can't answer, so far, is the biggest question
for most employees _ Did I get a good deal on my options package?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you are a senior executive of a public company ... or
your company is willing to open up its option records to you, you
may never know whether you have been treated fairly,'' the site
says.
</P>
<P>
   I think the folks at myStockOptions.com might have the answer
right under their noses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when I was researching minivans online, I found a
useful discussion forum on  &LR; www.edmunds.com &LR;  called, ``What did you
pay for your Toyota Sienna?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps myStockOptions.com could start an online discussion
titled, ``What did you get in your options package?'' People could
anonymously post their option package and we'd all be the wiser.
</P>
<P>
   If you're just negotiating an options deal, you might enjoy a
new book by David E. Gumpert, ``Better Than Money: Build Your
Fortune Using Stock Options and Other Equity Incentives _ In Up and
Down Markets.'' (Why do all stock option books have brain-deadening
names?)
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of PENDER23 (70549 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  I haven't read it, but Rosen says it's supposed to help employees
bargain for option deals.
</P>
<P>
   LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION: Wells Fargo yesterday yanked a
feature from its Web site that supposedly helped people moving from
one community find a similar community in another city.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer group accused Wells of racial bias because the tool _
which it licensed from startup Homefair.com _ supposedly refers
people who live in predominantly black communities to other black
communities.
</P>
<P>
   You can still find the tool at
 &LR; www.homefair.com/usr/hoodform.html. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The charges of racial stereotyping could be true, but you can
also get some pretty peculiar results.
</P>
<P>
   I plugged in my parent's ZIP code in Kirkwood, Mo., a charming,
middle-class, conservative, racially mixed, close-in suburb of St.
Louis. I asked for a similar community in the San Francisco Bay
Area and got _ no kidding _ Bolinas, a tiny bastion of hippie
culture in Marin County where Martha Stewart was rumored to be
moving.
</P>
<P>
   My mom's a great cook and sets a pretty table, but there's no
way I could picture her living next door to Martha Stewart in
Bolinas. (Yeah, yeah, Martha is not house-hunting there.)
</P>
<P>
   As another test, a colleague from Berkeley, Calif., said he was
moving to New York. The site suggested he check out Secaucus, N.J.,
which he calls ``a famous turnpike exit and reeking industrial
wasteland at the other side of the Lincoln Tunnel from Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are his words. I'm sure Secaucus has some nice parts.

HOFFA PRAISES NADER TRADE STANCE, WARNS GORE TO GET `IN TUNE WITH
US' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader
at his elbow, Teamsters President James Hoffa called Thursday for
Vice President Al Gore to get in step with organized labor or risk
losing his bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa stopped well short of endorsing Nader but said his
opposition to recent U.S. trade agreements and advocacy of American
workers' rights should earn him a place in any of this fall's
presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who really wants to see a debate between Al Gore and George
Bush?'' the Teamster chief asked. ``I mean they're somewhat the
same on trade, the same mindless debate on Social Security goes on
and on. We want to broaden the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a meeting of the Teamsters board of directors and
Nader, Hoffa told reporters the union is not close to making an
endorsement decision and is ``not locked into one party or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to wait,'' he said. ``We are not in a
hurry to endorse. We think there is time. We have options of
endorsing or not endorsing.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the vice president gets ``more in tune with us,'' Hoffa
said, the Democrat faces the prospect of going into the November
election without help from the 1.4 million-member Brotherhood of
Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore can't get elected without organized labor,'' Hoffa
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamster board is scheduled today to interview Bush, the
probable Republican presidential nominee, by telephone. In addition
to meeting earlier this year with Gore, the board has interviewed
Pat Buchanan, who is seeking the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said the Teamsters wants the national Commission on
Presidential Debates, a group appointed by the Republican and
Democratic parties, to open up their forums this fall to Nader and
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's rules allow only candidates with at least 15
percent support in five national polls. An NBC-Wall Street Journal
poll released Thursday had Nader at 7 percent and Buchanan at 4
percent. Bush led the field with 43 percent. Gore was favored by 38
percent of the voters surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's news conference with Hoffa, Nader urged the
union to reject Gore. ``I hope labor unions will rethink their
position when they are taken for granted and told by the Democratic
Party that they have nowhere else to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's support of improved trade relations with China and the
North American Free Trade Agreement has rankled the Teamsters and
the United Automobile Workers union enough that both have refused
to endorse his candidacy. More recently, Hoffa said, the Teamsters
leadership was angered by Gore's naming of Commerce Secretary
William Daley, the administration's chief lobbyist on the China
trade issue, to run his campaign for president,
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems with Gore is (he does) not listen to
labor,'' said Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Gore could do to mend fences, Hoffa said: ``He's got
to articulate a comprehensive policy with regard to organized
labor, with regard to working people in this country, with regard
to how do we keep jobs in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's support for the China and North American trade agreements
and the possible impact on turnout among union voters also bothers
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, whose organization endorsed Gore in
late 1999. ``We have members who are still bitter over NAFTA,
especially in the industrial states,'' said Sweeney, who is among
Gore's more vocal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message is to convince workers and their families that we
don't agree on everything with any candidate,'' Sweeney said. ``But
you have to look at the total record.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
END OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail in Minnesota, Gore said he hadn't read or
heard Hoffa's comments, but said, ``I have great respect for him.
I've worked closely with the Teamsters and other members of
organized labor. I believe in the right to organize. I want to see
a change in the laws that now allow permanent striker replacements
and actually interfere with the legitimate right of people in the
workplace to have a majority-rule vote on whether or not they want
to organize. I think that's just a basic American principle that
ought to be respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``On issue after issue, I have been with them and although there
have been a few issues where we disagree, I will continue to work
for what I think is in the best interests of working families in
this country.''

HE HAS WORLD AT HIS FEET
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thoroughbred-racing world got smaller in the 1980s, when the
Breeders' Cup first drew European stars to America, and smaller
still in the 1990s, when the Dubai World Cup became a destination
for America's best older horses.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the world shrank further, to the point that you might
want to picture the globe as a green rubber ball bouncing on the
nose of a horse named Dubai Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Dubai Millennium's eight-length victory Wednesday at England's
Royal Ascot in a 1-mile turf race called the Prince of Wales's
Stakes had implications on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   __ The brilliant victory over five others enhanced Dubai
Millennium's reputation as the best horse in the world.
</P>
<P>
   __ It marked the first victory in Europe for American Hall of
Fame jockey Jerry Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   __ It kept Dubai Millennium on course for a U.S. debut in the
Nov. 4 Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   More in a moment about that last point, and the problems it
implies for Horse of the Year voters. First, the glowing reviews of
Dubai Millennium's performance Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anything on the other (U.S.) side of the pond
that could touch him,'' Bailey said after subbing for Frankie
Dettori, the champion English jockey who is recovering from
injuries suffered in a small-plane crash three weeks ago at
Newmarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the best horse we have ever had,'' said Dubai's Sheikh
Mohammed, whose powerful Godolphin Racing owns Dubai Millennium.
``You don't come across a horse like this in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most fabulously handsome thoroughbred you have ever
seen in your life,'' said Godolphin racing manager Simon Crisford.
</P>
<P>
   While Crisford works up the courage to propose marriage, let's
move on.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has 4-year-old Dubai Millennium racing in the Sept.
9 Irish Champion Stakes, then in the Breeders' Cup, and then
retiring. Assume he wins both and becomes the first horse to win
the Dubai World Cup and the Breeders' Cup Classic in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Can he be voted the !ital!North American Horse of the Year after
racing on this continent only once?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a similar debate centered on Daylami, the Irish-bred,
Godolphin-owned horse who won three major European races in the
summer and won the Breeders' Cup Turf at Gulfstream Park in Florida
by 2 lengths in November.
</P>
<P>
   I thought Daylami turned in the outstanding performance of
Breeders' Cup day and was the best horse I saw in 1999, so I voted
for him for Horse of the Year. There were precedents for blurring
international boundaries in championship voting: Cigar's victory in
the Dubai World Cup helped him win Horse of the Year in 1996, the
season of his decline; and Miesque's victories in the Breeders' Cup
Mile were the French filly's lone U.S. starts when she was named
champion turf female in 1987 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Other voters refused to go for a horse with only one American
race. As it turned out, Charismatic, the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness winner, was named Horse of the Year, with Daylami second.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guidelines for Horse of the Year voting, and there
is no movement to implement any. The debate over what to do with
brilliant foreign horses was dropped as soon as the Eclipse Award
trophies were handed out. Almost as if the issue was a one-year
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't. From now on it's likely to be an every-year
phenomenon. Horse racing is more and more international. Jockeys
and horses travel the globe as never before. Godolphin's far-flung
power ensures a foreign presence even at a bastion of Americana
like the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   As in every other sport, the international flavor is only making
racing stronger and more intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Horse of the Year voters can either embrace the trend or resist
it. But they'd better decide soon. Dubai Millennium threatens to
force the issue.
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: Riboletta can earn some lofty comparisons by
winning the Vanity Handicap for fillies and mares on Sunday to
become the fourth to sweep Hollywood Park's Hawthorne, Milady and
Vanity.
</P>
<P>
   Cascapedia (1977), Bayakoa (1989) and Brought to Mind (1991)
scored that triple. Riboletta's trainer, Eduardo Inda, was Ron
McAnally's assistant when McAnally had Bayakoa and Brought to Mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brought to Mind was a very nice filly, but Bayakoa was
special,'' Inda said. ``She's the best mare I've ever been
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayakoa won Eclipse Awards as outstanding filly or mare in 1989
and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Riboletta, to be ridden by Chris McCarron, was assigned 123
pounds for the Vanity, three more than Excellent Meeting (Corey
Nakatani).
</P>
<P>
   __ Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies winner Cash Run _ like Dubai
Millennium an offspring of Seeking the Gold _ runs at Hollywood
Park for the first time Saturday in the Princess Stakes for
3-year-old fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by leading jockey Victor Espinoza, Cash Run will carry
122 pounds, four more than anybody else in the field of seven. She
comes off a fourth-place finish in the Black Eyed Susan at Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
   Her trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, already owns the record for
Princess victories with four, most recently with A Wild Ride in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   __ Laffit Pincay, Kent Desormeaux and Alex Solis will be among
12 riders in the NTRA All-Star Jockey Championship at Lone Star
Park in Texas tonight. Pincay won it in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The last two races of the four-race competition will be
simulcast to Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   The event benefits the Jockeys' Guild's Disabled Riders Fund.
</P>
<P>
   __ Looking ahead: The field expected for the $1 million
Hollywood Gold Cup on July 9 grew to eight Thursday with the
addition of K One King. The 4-year-old son of Apalachee won the
Oaklawn Handicap in Arkansas in April but will go into the Gold Cup
off sixth-place finishes in the Pimlico Special and the Stephen
Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made by Madeleine Paulson, who owns K One
King with her husband Allen, who had Gold Cup winners in Blushing
John (1989) and Cigar (1995).
</P>
<P>
   Also expected for the Gold Cup: General Challenge, Cat Thief,
Big Ten, Chester House, David, Early Pioneer and Out of Mind. &QL;

PRO-, ANTI-DEATH PENALTY DEMONSTRATORS RALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ A tense standoff between supporters of Gary
Graham and law enforcement officials played out on the streets
outside the Walls Unit Thursday night as the capital murder
defendant waited to learn whether a last-chance appeal would save
his life.
</P>
<P>
   As Graham supporters chanted, ``George Bush, you can't hide, we
charge you with genocide,'' Department of Public Safety troopers
dressed in riot gear tried to keep the angry throng from breaking
through barricades.
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes before the scheduled 6 p.m. execution time,
several protesters raced past troopers but were quickly arrested as
they ran in front of TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Several U.S. flags were burned in front of troopers. And as the
delay continued, Graham's supporters raced onto the streets to
block traffic and run toward Ku Klux Klan members on the other side
of the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was executed shortly before 9 p.m. Thursday after several
appeals were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere became uneasy Thursday night after a relatively
calm afternoon. Groups such as the New Black Panthers and the Klan
played to the TV cameras but caused few incidents.
</P>
<P>
   With well-known Graham supporters such as the Rev. Jesse
Jackson.MDNM/ and Bianca Jagger on hand to witness the execution,
the streets resembled a politically charged festival.
</P>
<P>
   No violence was reported in the afternoon, although Graham
supporters marched to confront Klan members about an hour before
the scheduled execution, only to be turned back. Other than an
exchange of words, DPS troopers prevented any altercations.
</P>
<P>
   Max Gorkey, 20, of Houston, demonstrated in support of Graham,
who has taken the name Shaka Sankofa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here today to support Shaka,'' Gorkey said. ``The death
penalty is inherently racist. It is inherently classist. He is the
victim here. Let the evidence be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston teacher Gloria Rubak blamed Gov. George W. Bush for
Graham's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blood is on George Bush's hands. What we are seeing here
today is a legal lynching,'' Rubak said, echoing an anti-Bush chant
that was heard throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Huntsville businesses closed early.
</P>
<P>
   As pro-death penalty demonstrators rallied behind barricades,
the scene was initially calm.
</P>
<P>
   Standing among a group of death penalty supporters, Mandy Burks
said she had no qualms about the impending execution.
</P>
<P>
   With some of her friends joking about getting drunk after
Graham's demise, Burks said the hundreds of Graham supporters
weren't considering the crimes Graham committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he shouldn't die for this one, he should for one of the
other crimes he committed,'' Burks said. ``I don't think anybody on
that other side wants to talk about all of the victims he left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burks, a Sam Houston State University student, became a
curious bystander when a dozen Ku Klux Klan members arrived about
two hours before Graham's execution.
</P>
<P>
   Low-key death penalty supporters stood in the background as
grand dragon Charles Lee said Graham should die for his crimes.

GORE COURTING INDEPENDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNETONKA, Minn. _ Vice President Al Gore, hoping to woo
independent voters in his close race for the White House, spent
Thursday touting his education initiatives on the arm of former pro
wrestler turned maverick governor Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that I'm reaching out to independents and to
independently thinking Republicans,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he isn't expecting an endorsement from Ventura,
but would like his vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit with the governor, the third in as many months, was
dampened Thursday afternoon by the announcement in Washington that
another Justice Department official is calling on Attorney General
Janet Reno to appoint a special counsel to investigate alleged fund
raising abuses during the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore appeared to be caught off guard when asked about the
announcement and declined to comment. ``You're privy to news that I
don't have,'' he told reporters. ``I don't know about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and governor got up early Thursday to greet
students as they stepped off the bus at Hopkins North Junior High
School in suburban Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The two spent the day at the school meeting with teachers,
students and parents as Gore promised the largest-ever increase in
federal special education funding, from $720 million to $1.5
billion a year, beginning his first year in office.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case elsewhere in the country, Gore and Bush are
running neck and neck in Minnesota, but Republican leaders here
have said they believe Bush can win the state. No Republican
presidential candidate has done that since Richard Nixon beat
George McGovern in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, an advocate of the third-party movement who was elected
on the Reform Party ticket before he bolted the party, has refused
to endorse either Gore or his Republican opponent, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush. But Ventura said Thursday he is willing to endorse
policies from either camp if he agrees with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota governor said his experience in rearing a daughter
with learning disabilities convinced him to throw his support
behind the vice president's education plan.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which Gore first announced earlier this year in Iowa
and New Hampshire, calls for creating an Education Reform and
Children's Trust Fund to set aside part of the projected federal
budget surplus for education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Thursday that he's committed to special education
advocates' longtime goal of having the federal government foot 40
percent of the bill for educating children with physical and mental
disabilities, who sometimes require extraordinarily expensive
services in order to attend public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's overall education plan also includes universal preschool,
smaller class sizes and better-qualified, better-paid teachers. It
would create an early identification and intervention fund to
target children with reading and behavioral problems in
kindergarten or first grade.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura characterized the meeting and the Gores' stay at the
governor's mansion Wednesday night as more of a social call than a
political one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his visit here is in some ways more of a break for him
to get away from the hectic pace of what it's like campaigning out
there,'' Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his wife could be friends with the Gores without
necessarily endorsing the vice president as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good time in Washington when we were out there and I
invited the vice president and Tipper back here when they got to
Minnesota, and I hope they equally had a good time,'' he said.
``And if he wins the presidency, well then I hope I get invited to
the White House at some point.''

 &HT;    A crowd divided
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ The distance was hardly a hundred yards that
divided the two camps. But it was all the difference in the world.
It was the difference between good and evil, truth and lies,
justice and injustice, black and white. And which was which
depended on who you were and where you stood.
</P>
<P>
   There was G. George, 40, of Houston. He was holding a sign high
that said, ``Send Graham to hell.'' George, who said only that he
worked inside the city of Houston in identifying himself, had not
been to a protest in a long time. The last one he remembered he was
a little boy being ``dragged around by my parents.'' At an anti-war
demonstration in the '60s. Now, when you ask him, he'll say he
couldn't even say which side of the issue his parents were on.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll tell you he wants to go back to ``electric chairs and
hard labor'' for prisoners. ``If they want to eat, let them grow
their own food. If they want clothes, let them make their own.
That's the way it used to be in Texas,'' he said. ``Everything is
out of balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, hardly that hundred yards, under a banner which
said ``Give innocence a chance. Let the evidence be heard.'' Lynn
Furray, 67, of Houston, a gray-haired, retired school teacher,
looked very much out of place among those protesting the execution.
``I'm against the death penalty and in this case I think Graham did
not have a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Furray became an activist in opposing the death penalty in 1989
after moving to Houston from Michigan where there is no death
penalty. ``I really didn't think about it until I moved down here.
I don't think people have the right to take another life. And that
includes the state,'' she said. ``As a taxpayer,'' she said, ``I
feel like I'm in cahoots with Texas executions.'' Furray said she
writes letters, lobbies and is ``very political.'' She added, ``I
don't like being here, but I think it is an obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleb Ortiz, 29, a senior majoring in criminal justice at Sam
Houston State University here, was standing next to a Confederate
flag held by someone in a group of supporters of the death penalty.
Ortiz, however said he had been visiting both sides, acknowledging
that the Klan wouldn't have him _ a Hispanic_ as a member nor would
the Nation of Islam or the New Black Panthers. ``But I can't hate
anyone. God loves everyone here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who sometimes spoke as if he was a preacher and other
times as if he was a lawyer, said he believes in any state system
that was ``man made'' there would be instances of the innocent
being punished and the guilty going free. ``I must say that in this
particular case, I think the state is justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, another young man, 24, who was wearing a mask
fashioned from a dirty mechanic's red rag, declined to give his
name, acknowledging only that he was a member of the Revolutionary
Communist Youth Brigade from Houston. He said, ``I'm very much
aware of what is happening to young black men. They are being shot,
arrested and harassed by racist police. Under communism, there
wouldn't be a death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   And while white himself, he said he had suffered as well. ``I
had run ins with police when I was young mainly because they didn't
like the way I looked. That's when I came to realize you need an
organization to spearhead the struggle for human rights for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Ray, 48, a bookseller, was here to wave the Confederate
Battle Flag and hold a sign that said, ``Die N-word, Die.'' He said
he came because he was ``tired of the media glorifying Graham. If
you will excuse me for saying so, the media has been acting like
dogs in heat.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ray flaunted the Confederate flag, the New Black Panthers
were wiping sweat from their faces onto the Texas flag and then
throwing it down to the asphalt streets and stomping it with their
boots.
</P>
<P>
   Ashanti Chimurengh, a member of the Gary Graham justice
coalition, was making her speech over a loud speaker. She was
flanked by a sign with a picture of Gov. George W. Bush that said,
``The burning Bush burns black men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two black men children and everyday I face the fear of
them being killed by racist cops. Everyday we face it. We're gonna
win this g--d--- war. I don't know what will happen but I'm a
warrior princess. But it is important that whatever happens we must
take this struggle forward.''

BUD SELIG CONFIRMS RANGERS TO PLAY ASTROS NEXT YEAR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball commissioner Bud Selig said yesterday that a
realignment plan that would move the Rangers to the American League
Central remains alive, but the proposal that's adopted for next
season depends on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``That plan is certainly very much under consideration,'' Selig
said. ``We have four or five formats we're looking at, and we're
testing each one with an actual schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the plan that's approved, Selig confirmed what
Rangers owner Tom Hicks said earlier this month: The Rangers and
Astros will be paired in an interleague matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that's pretty definite,'' Selig said. ``We're
definitely trying to accomplish that no matter what the schedule is
because they are natural geographical rivals. We want to pursue
those.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig wants baseball to go back to an unbalanced schedule next
season that would have clubs playing more games against teams in
their divisions than those outside. To accomplish that, he proposed
an alignment that would move Arizona from the National League West
to the AL West, Texas from the AL West into a six-team AL Central
and Tampa Bay to the National League, which would then have four
four-team divisions with no wild card.
</P>
<P>
   A vote was expected at owners meetings that were scheduled for
June 13-14 in Detroit, but the meetings were postponed amid
speculation that the plan didn't have enough support to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The players' union, which has the power to block major changes
in the game, including realignment, complicated the issue by
circulating a memo with an alternate proposal that would have three
divisions of five teams each in the two leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, though, broadly hinted then he had enough votes among the
owners to push the plan through, and said he didn't expect major
problems with the union. The delay was, and remains, a matter of
getting the schedule to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to solve some of the problems we have with the
schedules,'' Selig said yesterday. ``I'll know more when I see the
schedules.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said he hopes to get the schedules within the
next week. He'll determine which works best, then bring it up for a
vote at the next owners meetings, sometime in July.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks has said he's willing to remain in the West because of
rivalries with the Seattle Mariners, Oakland Athletics and Anaheim
Angels, even though an unbalanced schedule would mean more games
starting late on the West Coast. His priority is playing the Astros
in interleague games.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the realignment plan adopted, or even if there's
no realignment, that should happen.

WRESTLER GREG GIBSON ISN'T READY TO QUIT SPORT AT AGE 46
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He has won so many titles, earned so many medals, on so
many mats in so many countries, that surely Greg Gibson, age 46, is
headed for wrestling's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, admittedly, there is a hitch. A wrestler has to be retired
_ for five years _ before he becomes eligible for election.
</P>
<P>
   And Gibson, still wrestling at 213.75 pounds, doesn't sound
ready to retire yet from anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you'll probably see me at nationals next year,'' Gibson
said without hesitation, despite a defeat yesterday in his
opening-round match at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials. ``Maybe I can
sneak up on some people when they're not hyped up over this
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbon-dating indicates that Gibson was born in Redding, Calif.,
in 1953. The start of his wrestling career, 1968, predates
Woodstock. Gibson had won a national title and a World
Championships silver medal by the time (1981) that his weight
class' current No. 1 seed, Jason Gleasman, was in first grade.
</P>
<P>
   But _ sigh _ that was then, and yesterday was now.
</P>
<P>
   Matched against veteran four-time national champion Randy
Couture, Gibson was routed, 10-0, in a Greco-Roman bout stopped
with 1:50 to go in the second period. He fell into the losers
bracket and can finish no better in these trials than third place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I got blown out,'' Gibson conceded. ``I don't match
up real well with his techniques and his style. It's too bad I had
to have him in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them _ the young guys _ I've been around a long time,
and they've figured out that a lot of movement and a lot of
changing levels works real well against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Age, it seems, is seldom kind to a wrestler. The edge in
experience is mitigated by the dulling in reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're young,'' Gibson said, ``you've got that energy and
that spark. A lot of it is reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My old self would trash my current self pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1978 and is still on
active duty, holding the rank of master sergeant. He left the U.S.
Greco-Roman national team in 1990 and served in Saudi Arabia during
Operation Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``For six years, I didn't even step on a mat,'' Gibson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1996 that Gibson, transferred to Quantico, Va., walked
into the base's gym for a workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up beating the heavyweight, and I said, `Hey, I must
still have it,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since then, Gibson has placed in the top five at
the U.S. championships three times.
</P>
<P>
   He has already lived his Olympic dream. It came in 1984 when
Gibson won a silver medal at 220 pounds at the Los Angeles Games.
</P>
<P>
   The medal was the fourth major bauble in Gibson's shining
career. As a freestyle wrestler, he had won silver medals at the
1981 and 1983 World Championships and a bronze in '82. He remains
the only U.S. wrestler to win medals at both the worlds and
Olympics in both the freestyle and Greco-Roman competitions.
</P>
<P>
   His most memorable feat, Gibson said, was winning the World Cup
in Trelleborg, Sweden, in 1980 _ the first American ever to win a
gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That keeps you motivated,'' he said yesterday. ``It keeps you
hanging in, trying to relive that experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's getting harder every day.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing fifth at this year's U.S. championships, Gibson
knew that his bid for the Sydney Olympics would be a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to speak realistically,'' he confessed. ``I've seen
those guys before. I knew where I stood.''
</P>
<P>
   His muscle-rippled body belies his 46 years. His 2000 Olympics
dream may be over, someone asked, but, well, what about 2004 ... at
age 50?
</P>
<P>
   Gibson half-smiled and half-winced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll still be wrestling,'' he said, ``but I don't know
how well I could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have to go into the old man's league or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame, in other words, will just have to wait.

PROMINENT BUSINESSMAN, DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S HUSBAND, IS CONVICTED  
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ A federal jury on Thursday convicted Albert
J. Pirro Jr., the influential Republican businessman and husband of
Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, of
conspiracy and tax evasion, imperiling his business career and
perhaps her political one.
</P>
<P>
   For Pirro, 53, the verdict, if upheld, could derail his career
as Westchester's most powerful real estate development lawyer and
one of New York state's most prodigious Republican fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   For Jeanine Pirro, 49, who could have been a strong contender
for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate this year were it
not for her husband's legal woes, the verdict jeopardizes her
immediate prospects for higher office. And for Anthony G. Pirro,
Albert Pirro's brother and accountant, who was also convicted
Thursday on similar charges, the result transforms an anonymous
middle-class life into part of a messy public scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Given the star quotient of the principals, the trial, at times,
seemed to be more about celebrity than about conspiracy. A woman
who filed a successful paternity suit against Albert Pirro
threatened to confront him in court, only to be thwarted by federal
authorities in Newark, N.J., on an unrelated warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors suggested that Albert Pirro lusted for money in much
the way that Richard Nixon lusted for power. And a parade of
contractors reluctantly offered intimate details about the Pirros'
lavish expenditures on everything from a $13,250 Chinese rug to a
$1,800 wrought-iron fence for their Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, prosecutors had argued that by improperly
deducting $1.2 million of Albert Pirro's personal expenses as
business write-offs, thereby reducing Albert Pirro's taxes by
$413,000, the brothers had brazenly violated a fundamental tenet of
the American tax system: that every taxpayer must pay his or her
fair share, regardless of wealth or influence.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro and his legal team had argued that Pirro was too busy and
aloof a businessman to pay close attention to such mundane tasks as
bookkeeping. Pirro's team also suggested that the government had
overzealously pursued Pirro, since only 5 percent of his company's
business deductions had been deemed improper.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Pirro's lawyers noted that he had repaid about $1
million in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But in withering, meticulous fashion, the government called
about 60 witnesses and referred to thousands of pages of tax
returns, invoices and canceled checks in presenting its portrait of
Albert Pirro as a wealthy man who simply wanted to become wealthier
_ on the taxpayers' dime. Then, the final witness, John Dennehy, a
revenue agent with the IRS, linked the expenses with the fraudulent
tax returns.

SENATE DEFEATS DRUG PLAN IN PARTISAN VOTE
</HEADLINE>
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democrats on Thursday night abruptly forced
the first vote of the year on their prescription drug plan, a
politically potent issue on the campaign trail, but the measure was
swiftly defeated by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would lower drug prices for all Medicare
beneficiaries, was rejected by a vote of 53 to 44. Two Republicans
voted in favor of the measure; one Democrat voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when opinion polls show the rising prices for
prescription drugs as a priority among voters, Senate Democrats
seized on a parliamentary trick to force a vote on their bill. In
so doing, they accomplished two political goals: They got the
chance to talk about their plan for making prescription drugs more
affordable to senior citizens and they forced Republicans to cast a
difficult vote, perhaps the only one of the year, on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Medicare was passed, there was a fundamental commitment
by the government to senior citizens,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., who accused Senate Republicans of stalling on a bipartisan
plan. ``Every day we fail to pass a prescription drug program, we
are violating that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans called the maneuver a political stunt that was
rushed, short-sighted and counterproductive. The prescription drug
bill was brought up as part of a larger appropriations bill to fund
the departments of Labor, and Health and Human Services, and was
allowed on the floor with no notice and with less than one hour of
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a politics-first amendment,'' an outraged Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, said. ``Nobody knows what it costs, how it works,
what it does to the solvency of Medicare. This is politics at its
worst. This body is offended by it. I'm offended by it. I don't
think voters will be impressed by circumventing the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also voted to approve a contentious and heavily
lobbied amendment to delay by one year federal regulations that
would require employers to take steps to prevent repetitive motion
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, which was bitterly contested by labor unions who
want these worker protections as soon as possible, passed by a vote
of 57 to 41, after Democrats spent the day filibustering the
measuring.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said it would recommend a veto of the
spending bill if the measure is not removed. Business groups
vigorously pushed to delay the regulations that would make the work
place ergonomically correct, rules they say are too broad and too
expensive, and could cost employers, by their estimate, $60 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will have the most dramatic effect upon business and the
economy ever promulgated by a federal agency,'' said Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark. ``We are talking about $60 billion a year
imposed upon the business community.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most surprising turn of events involved prescription
drugs, which descended on the Senate seemingly out of the blue.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Democrats have accused Senate Republicans of
stalling on the issue of prescription drugs, and some predicted
today's vote could be the only Senate vote of the year on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee, chaired by Sen. William Roth Jr.,
R-Del., is working on a bipartisan bill that would address concerns
about prescription drug prices. But Democrats say the committee is
inching along and is unlikely to move this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prescription drugs is a matter before the finance committee,''
Roth told Democrats on the floor. ``It is undoubtedly the most
important domestic legislation that will be considered this year.
Nothing will happen if we permit this legislation to become
partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans voted their own drug plan out of committee on
Wednesday, but Democrats called it faulty, saying it should be
better integrated into the Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
   Under Thursday's Democratic bill, written by Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., drug insurance companies' premiums for Medicare
beneficiaries would be $35 to $40 a month, the same as under the
House Republican measure.
</P>
<P>
   The beneficiary would have to pay the first $250 a year in
prescription drug expenses. The government would share costs beyond
that amount, paying a larger proportion as drug expenses increased.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats signed on to the bill once Graham agreed to
drop a provision that would have forced people with high incomes to
pay higher premiums. Now premiums will not be dictated by income.
</P>
<P>
   This is significantly different from the proposal offered by
House Republicans. Under that plan, Medicare would pay half of drug
costs from $250 to $2,100, but the patient would then be solely
responsible for several thousand dollars of drug costs, and the
insurer would not step in again until the beneficiary had incurred
$6,000 of costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clearly a part of modern medicine today,'' said Sen.
Charles Robb, D-Va., referring to the drug plan. ``It is not a
luxury.''

SECOND QUARTER INCOME UP 27 PERCENT FOR MORGAN STANLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Profiting from gains in stock trading and investment
banking, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. reported on Thursday that
net income in its fiscal second quarter rose 27 percent from the
period a year earlier but fell 6 percent from the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley, the biggest securities firm measured by market
value, said it earned $1.46 billion, or $1.26 a diluted share, in
the quarter that ended May 31, compared with $1.15 billion, or 97
cents a share, in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although the results exceeded the analysts' consensus estimate
of $1.13, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, Morgan
Stanley's stock dropped $2.4375, to $83.1875. Its shares are more
than $10 below the high mark they hit in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their trading profitability was much stronger than most people
thought it could be'' in a quarter that was interrupted by a sharp
decline in Nasdaq stocks, said Guy Moszkowski, a Salomon Smith
Barney analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley benefited from a strategy that positioned the
firm to gain whether stocks rose or fell, Moszkowski said. As long
as stock prices were volatile, which they were, the firm would
profit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Scott, the firm's chief financial officer, said it made
more money trading stocks, oil and other commodities last quarter
than in any other quarter. ``Having lots of volume, lots of
uncertainty, lots of price volatility fits our trading style very
well,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from the firm's securities businesses rose 28 percent,
to $5.45 billion and total net revenue _ revenue minus interest
expense _ rose 25 percent, to $7.07 billion. The money it took in
as investment banking fees and commissions, much of it from
customers of its Dean Witter brokerage unit, increased by more than
30 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Return on shareholders' equity was 33 percent, up from 31
percent a year earlier, but down from an unusually high 36 percent
in the first quarter.

PAT DAY HAS UNCANNY KNACK FOR GETTING THE MOST FROM HORSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Donnie Meche knows a jockey can be a
familiar face, a household name in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Meche, the leading jockey at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie,
began to realize stardom was possible when he quietly rode in the
back seat of a car driven by fellow jockey Robby Albarado through
the streets of Lexington, Ky., one day last spring. Meche looked
out his window and saw how people reacted to the guy riding
shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would drive by, our windows would be up, and we'd be
out on the highway, but you could see how people noticed him when
they drove beside us,'' Meche said. ``You could read their lips.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Look! That's Pat Day! It's Pat Day!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Day will join Meche and 10 other jockeys tonight at Lone
Star for the $125,000 National Thoroughbred Racing Association
All-Star Jockey Championship.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first year for the 25-year-old Meche to ride in the
event, and his first chance to ride in front of a national TV
audience (ESPN2, tape delayed at 10:30 p.m.). But Day has
participated each of the three previous years the competition has
been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   He's old hat at the national-network-TV thing, too. He's one of
the older jockeys in the competition; at 46, he's the third-oldest
All-Star and eight years older than the average age of the 12
riders. But that doesn't mean he should be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Proof of that came the most recent time Day was on national TV.
He was riding Commendable, a 16-1 long shot in the Belmont Stakes
two weeks ago, and the colt was dismissed by most prognosticators
because he hadn't won a race since August. But the colt is trained
by D. Wayne Lukas, and Day has teamed with Lukas to win the
Preakness Stakes three times and the Belmont one other time. In
November, they paired to win the Breeders' Cup Classic on long-shot
Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great relationship,'' Lukas said. ``I think he suits
our horses, but I think he suits everyone's horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his own words, he tries not to hinder the horses he rides.
He has a marvelous sense of pace.''
</P>
<P>
   And pace is what got the job done for Day with Commendable in
the Belmont. He was able to run out alongside fellow long-shot Hugh
Hefner and glide through easy fractions of 1 minute, 14 seconds
through the opening half of the 1 1/2-mile race. That's two seconds
slower than horses of that caliber typically run for that distance.
</P>
<P>
   So when Hugh Hefner tired, Day still had plenty of horse left
with Commendable. Race favorites Aptitude and Unshaded _ ridden by
Alex Solis and Shane Sellers (both also in the All-Star
Championship tonight) _ had too much ground left to cover. They
advanced to second and third, and Day cruised home on Commendable
without touching him with the whip once.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the best jobs between a trainer and rider that
I've seen in a big race like that,'' said William Allen, who owned
Wild Again when Day rode him to victory in the first Breeders' Cup
Classic in 1984. ``Those guys knew that everyone else with a chance
in the race was going to take back \Roff the early lead\S and leave
the front wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we needed a rider on Wild Again, we flew to Oaklawn Park
to see if he would be available. Pat called Ray Sibille \Rwho had
ridden Wild Again\S and found out that Wild Again didn't like to be
hit with the whip. That was pretty conscientious of Pat, and if he
had hit Wild Again in the Classic he would have lost the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Day somehow finds the way to communicate with horses. It starts
with communication between himself and the trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne and I spoke briefly in the paddock before the Belmont,''
Day said. ``Our horse had shown some speed in previous races, and
the only thing Wayne really told me was that the colt was better in
the clear and if I could get inside of Hugh Hefner it would be
great. That was about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne brings them over \Rto the races\S prepared. And he has
great confidence in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Day _ who lives outside Louisville, Ky., and is a
regular rider on the Kentucky racing circuit _ has won more than
7,700 races. That places him third in career victories behind
Laffit Pincay Jr. and Bill Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, 53, likely will retire after he gets to career victory
No. 9,000, a milestone he will probably reach this year.
</P>
<P>
   Day has been winning 250 to 275 races per year. So it would take
him at least five years to match Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   Day can't give a guarantee that he'll be around to put a run in
at the record. His religious convictions are deep, and he said if
the Lord calls him to do something else, he'll do it even if it
means leaving the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   He said he almost gave up riding for the ministry when he made a
commitment to Christianity on Jan. 27, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, right now, this is what he wants me doing,'' Day said.
</P>
<P>
   Day credits his beliefs in turning his life around from drug use
and carousing. Followers at the racetrack have an easy time
noticing the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the same every day,'' Lukas said. ``He's at peace with
himself. He's not fighting any demons within himself like a lot of
riders are.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to the major races, you know he's going to
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   And that includes tonight in the All-Star Jockey Championship.

U.S. WRESTLER WANTS ONE MORE SHOT AT RUSSIAN ICON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The clean-shaven head collapsed into his left hand; the
thumb and forefinger clenched the bridge of the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Tears streamed from the giant's eyes while his neck supported
the silver medal suspended by a green ribbon. There in Atlanta at
the 1996 Olympic Games, Matt Ghaffari wept for all the world to see
during the medal ceremony, as Alexander Karelin stood to his left
on the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Karelin, a Russian Army general and a three-time Olympic gold
medalist, remains Greco-Roman wrestling's icon, and Ghaffari longs
for one more crack at his undefeated archrival at 286 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my dream,'' Ghaffari said yesterday after his
quarterfinal victory in the challenger tournament of the U.S.
Olympic Team Trials at Reunion Arena. ``I want him to have one
loss. He always jokes about how I'm a worthy opponent, but I don't
want him to retire undefeated. Nobody is bigger than our sport,
although he thinks he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghaffari, 38, nears the end of an illustrious career as this
country's most decorated medalist from Olympic and World
Championships competition. Yet, unfinished business remains.
</P>
<P>
   Three men and four victories separate him from a berth on the
U.S. Olympic team and perhaps another bout with Karelin during the
2000 Sydney Games. Ghaffari earned a berth in today's challenge
tournament semifinals with his 7-0 victory against Paul Devlin
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ghaffari must defeat Billy Pierce in the semifinals and either
Corey Farkas or Dremiel Byers in the challenger final today to earn
a best-of-three match tomorrow with reigning U.S. national champion
Rulon Gardner for an Olympic berth. Ghaffari's vast international
experience makes him the favorite to meet Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, but I'd have to say Ghaffari is going to be the
odds-on favorite with all of his experience,'' U.S. Greco-Roman
coach Dan Chandler said before the Olympic trials. ``With all the
World medals _ and he's won an Olympic medal and multiple Pan
American championships _ you've got to look at him to be the guy to
beat in the challenge tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Paulson (119 pounds), Dennis Hall (127.75), Kevin
Bracken (138.75), Heath Sims (152), Matt Lindland (167.5), Quincey
Clark (187.25), Jason Gleasman (213.75) and Gardner (286) drew byes
into tomorrow's best-of-three finals as reigning national
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Their top challengers _ Steven Mays (119), Jim Gruenwald
(127.75), Glenn Nieradka (138.75), David Zuniga (152), Keith
Sieracki (167.5), Dan Henderson (187.25) and Garrett Lowney
(213.75) _ also advanced with victories yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Each must remain focused to avoid a premature exit and see years
of dedication go for naught.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's harder to get up for matches, and especially for
guys you've beaten over and over,'' Ghaffari said. ``But if you
don't get up, that's the guy that will upset you. Every one of them
is like Karelin for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian giant must fall, Ghaffari says, and three Americans
remain in his path before another potential shot at Karelin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is myself proving to everybody that I'm the best
representative this country has,'' Ghaffari said. ``I get motivated
representing the United States, and if I'm the best representative
this country has for the Olympics to win a medal, it's my job to
make the team.'' nn

TRIARC WILL SPIN OFF SNAPPLE BEVERAGE UNIT
</HEADLINE>
  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Triarc said on Thursday that it would spin off part
of its beverage division, which includes the Snapple, Mistic and
Royal Crown brands.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the plan will be filed in the next few days with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, a spokeswoman said. Shares in
the new company, to be called the Snapple Beverage Group and
consist of up to 20 percent of Triarc's soft-drink holdings, would
be sold in the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the public offering, which is being underwritten
by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Lehman Brothers, Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette and ING Barings, would be used to pay off debt. Over time,
some analysts believe, Triarc will relinquish more of the
soft-drink division to the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Triarc fell 43.8 cents, to $19.75 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   As a separate company, Snapple could become a takeover target or
an acquirer of other soft-drink brands. Its namesake lineup, which
includes noncarbonated drinks with flavors like peach, lemonade and
iced tea, represents the new age beverages that consumers have been
flocking to in recent years. The trend has diminished growth of
colas, and soft-drink giants like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo say they
intend to widen their array of brands to capture more market share.
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewel of the Triarc beverage division is Snapple,
which the company bought from Quaker Oats in 1997. Snapple's volume
grew 6 percent last year, when the industry overall was essentially
flat. Other company brands did not do as well: Royal Crown fell
13.5 percent and Mistic declined by 22 percent. A fourth brand,
Stewart's, grew by 13 percent on a base far smaller than Snapple's.
</P>
<P>
   The division had revenues last year of $770 million and adjusted
pretax earnings of $101 million. Within the highly competitive
soft-drink industry, Triarc's beverages are the country's sixth
largest in volume, said John D. Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest,
an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Triarc's other holdings include the Arby's restaurant franchise
and two smaller franchises. At various times, the company has owned
petroleum companies and textile makers, and is considered complex
both structurally and financially. In late 1998, Triarc's chairman,
Nelson W. Peltz, announced that he would take the company private
for $18 a share, or $420 million, because Wall Street was
underappreciating its value. Almost as abruptly, he changed his
mind in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this deal does is, it creates a pure play,'' Sicher said.
``They are trying to unlock what they believe is some unrecognized
value in the beverage business, which has been part of this
complicated Triarc picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Weinstein, Triarc's chief executive for beverages, will
become chief executive of the new company. Peltz will become its
chairman and Peter W. May, president and chief operating office of
Triarc, will be vice chairman. All three will become directors of
Snapple, which is based in White Plains, N.Y., along with four
outside directors.
</P>
<P>
   Sicher said Weinstein had done much to rebuild Snapple after the
brand was acquired from Quaker. Quaker purchased Snapple, which was
then publicly traded, for $1.7 billion in 1994. After a disastrous
period in which sales and market share plummeted and Wendy the
Snapple Lady, the brand's distinctive, loud-mouthed spokeswoman,
was fired, Quaker put the brand on the block and sold it to Triarc
for just $310 million. Among Weinstein's moves was bringing Wendy
Kaufman back in mid-1997.

PHOTOS OFFER `COMPELLING' EVIDENCE OF WATER ON MARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists on Thursday presented photographic evidence from
NASA's Mars Global Surveyor of 120 sites where water appears to
have oozed from crevices in the walls of craters, cliffs and
gullies scattered across the Martian south and north poles.
</P>
<P>
   The findings made by geologists Mike Malin and Ken Edgett of San
Diego, Calif., who developed and operate the cameras aboard the
orbiting Global Surveyor, were culled from 65,000 images of the
planet's surface taken since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is some of the most exciting data we have had concerning
this issue,'' said Mike Carr, an expert from the U.S. Geological
Survey who has studied the Martian water mystery for more than 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The images I've seen are really quite compelling.``
</P>
<P>
   Working from images gathered by much less sophisticated cameras
aboard American robotic spacecraft launched to Mars in the late
1960s and throughout the 1970s, scientists had formed a consensus
that water flowed across the planet billions of years ago leaving
traces of river beds, gullies, watersheds and possibly shorelines
where the liquid pooled.
</P>
<P>
   The contemporary Mars is a rugged desert, frigid and with an
atmosphere much too thin for liquid water to flow or pool on the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The latest images from the sharper-eyed Mars Global Surveyor
appear to dash the belief among experts that the once plentiful
liquid water on the surface of the planet has filtered to depths of
at least several miles and frozen, accessible only with excavation.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting a few of the 150 highest quality images from Global
Surveyor to make their point, Malin and Edgett pointed to narrow
elongated openings at the tops of meteor crater rims, gullies and
cliffs where water appears to have emerged in a rush, carving a
narrow V-shaped channel that winds down an incline to a wider
outfall.
</P>
<P>
   The topography suggests the outflows emerged repeatedly from
depths of less than 1,300 feet in the Martian crust in quantities
equivalent to about 90,000 cubic feet, enough water on Earth to
sustain a neighborhood of 100 households for about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Other clues in the features suggest the water has flowed as
recently as the last 1,000 years if not later and certainly within
the past one million years, said Malin and Edgett.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, who unveiled the findings at a news conference
in Washington, base their chronological estimates on the absence of
meteor craters on the features. The oldest Martian terrain bears
the scars of extensive cratering by meteors.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists say the features and hydrology they describe
is common on Earth, accessible to any tourist who travels through
the Colorado plateau in the American West.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike a more hospitable Earth, the water that flows
from the Martian subsoil evaporates in the cold, thin atmosphere
before it can collect into pools.
</P>
<P>
   The finding is the most significant yet for NASA's $273 million
Mars Global Surveyor mission. But the space agency joined Malin and
Edgett in cautioning that their initial conclusions must hold up
under prolonged scrutiny from other scientists, who may offer other
explanations for the phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are no volcanoes in the widely scattered regions to
suggest lava flows, there could be a combination of
little-understood activities under way in the subsoil that would
contribute to a gaseous flow of carbon-rich material, said Carr.
</P>
<P>
   And experts will likely quarrel over the source of the heating
that would convert water frozen in the subsoil to a liquid. The
scientist speculated that the decay of radioactive materials could
furnish the warmth, much as it does deep in the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The debate should begin in earnest next week with the
publication of a formal report in Science, this country's premier
journal of new discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not found lakes and rivers flowing on Mars. They
have not found hot springs sprouting out of Mars. They certainly
have not found a hot tub with Martians swimming in it either,''
said Ed Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space science.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the announcement is sure to stir public and
scientific interest in Mars exploration for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   If water is abundant close to the surface of Mars, it
strengthens the case that the neighboring planet may now be or was
in the past a suitable host for primitive life.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, surface water would furnish an accessible vital
resource for future human explorers, though NASA currently has no
exploration plans for its astronauts beyond the assembly of the
U.S.-led international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Water is easily broken down into its constituent chemicals,
hydrogen and oxygen, which are also rocket fuels. The oxygen and
water could be consumed for life support, easing the need to
transport continuous supplies from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally unexpected,'' said David McKay, a planetary
scientist at NASA's Johnson Space Center, who professed to be among
those most pleased with the finding.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail in Minnesota, Vice President Al Gore said
during a news conference that the Mars finding was ``a very
exciting development.``
</P>
<P>
   Gore serves as the point man for the Clinton White House on
space policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is yet another finding that will make it inevitable that
one day you will see a worldwide expedition to place people on the
surface of Mars,'' said Gore.

DIAGEO PLANS TO SELL 20 PERCENT STAKE IN BURGER KING 
</HEADLINE>
   By GREG WINTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diageo PLC, the expansive British food and spirits company, said
Thursday that it planned to sell a 20 percent stake in Burger King,
the fast-food chain. The sale could be a first step in an eventual
spinoff, a goal of Diageo for years.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo officials said that the offering of Burger King stock on
the New York Stock Exchange could be made by spring 2001, and that
the remainder could be sold as early as December 2002, when the
company's tax liabilities would fall significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as Diageo also announced the surprise
departure of Dennis Malamatinas, Burger King's chief executive.
Malamatinas, who left his family in Britain four years ago to run
Burger King from its Miami headquarters, said he was unwilling to
remain for the extra time needed to take Burger King public.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo said that Malamatinas would take a job in Europe at an
unspecified American company and that Colin Storm, head of Diageo's
Guinness division, would temporarily replace him at Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   Since the food giant Grand Metropolitan and the beer maker
Guinness merged to create Diageo in 1997, company officials have
talked about selling Burger King. But they have been hampered by
the prospect of paying roughly $1.5 billion in taxes if they did so
before 2002. Analysts have estimated the entire value of Burger
King at somewhere between $2.4 billion and $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, company officials say, U.S. tax law was changed to
allow foreign companies to sell up to 20 percent in an American
subsidiary at a lower rate. That change provided Diageo with the
window it was seeking.
</P>
<P>
   With such widely recognized names as Haagen-Dazs, Smirnoff and
Pillsbury, Diageo has come under investor pressure to strengthen
its stock by taking some brands public. Analysts say Burger King, a
retail chain that never quite fit within the company's rubric of
packaged goods, is a logical choice, particularly because conflict
with owners of franchises has made it increasingly difficult to
manage.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by an increase in royalty rates scheduled for July and
an expensive refurbishment plan for Burger King restaurants,
franchise owners, who run more than 90 percent of Burger King's
restaurants, pressed for a separation from Diageo in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The renovations could cost well over $100,000 per store,''
said Mitchell Speiser, senior analyst at Lehman Brothers. ``That's
a lot of money for someone who owns a couple of stores and is
trying to put their kids through college, especially since it's not
proven it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Burger King lost market share to competitors last year, slipping
from 20.4 percent of the American market to 19.6 percent, according
to Technomics, which tracks the industry. Sales were also flat,
compared with increases of 3 percent at McDonald's and 8 percent at
Wendy's.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King made a run on McDonald's dominance in the American
fast-food market in the mid-1990s, but a slowdown in marketing,
promotions and new products last year has kept it in second place.
``It's not fun competing against McDonald's,'' said Emanuel
Goldman, an analyst with ING Barings. ``It's sort of like taking on
the Lakers in the Forum.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a Burger King spinoff raised speculation
Thursday that a spinoff or sale of Pillsbury could follow. Company
officials did not rule out that possibility, but stressed that the
Burger King sale should not be interpreted as a ``dry run'' for its
Pillsbury division, which has also been facing increased
competition recently.

GRAHAM EXECUTED AFTER STRUGGLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SALATHEIA BRYANT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Gary Lee Graham, who transformed from
another convict on death row into a cause celebre for the
anti-death penalty movement, was executed by injection late
Thursday after a day of prison-side protests and frenzied legal
maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say I did not kill Bobby Lambert,'' Graham
said in an angry, rambling, six-minute statement from the gurney.
``I'm an innocent black man being murdered today. What is happening
here is an outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   He was pronounced dead at 8:49 p.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who had vowed to ``fight like hell'' on the trip to the
death chamber, put up a struggle. He was strapped to the gurney
around his wrists and across his head _ more restraints than are
normally used in Texas executions.
</P>
<P>
   He made a long, defiant final statement in which he reasserted
his innocence, said he was being lynched and called the death
penalty a holocaust for black Americans. He asked to be called
Shaka Sankofa to reflect his African heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I die fighting for what I believed in,'' Graham said. ``The
truth will come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who said he could do nothing once the
Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recommended the execution go
forward, said he supported the execution and pointed out that
Graham's case had been reviewed by 33 state and federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``After considering all of the facts I am convinced justice is
being done,'' Bush said after final appeals were denied. ``May God
bless the victim, the family of the victim, and may God bless Mr.
Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert's grandson, Bobby Hanners, witnessed the execution and
expressed his sympathy that Graham's family would now endure the
sorrow his family felt 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out to the Graham family, as they begin the
grieving process,'' he said. ``I also pray that Gary Graham has
made peace with God. But I truly feel that justice has been
served.''
</P>
<P>
   After media and other witnesses, including Hanners, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and Minister Robert Muhammad of the Nation of Islam
in Houston, entered the Huntsville Unit on their way to the
death-chamber area, protesters began chanting, ``Thou shalt not
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses for the victim were the Rev. Al Sharpton, Bianca
Jagger, Justice for All president Dianne Clements and Rick Sanford,
a 1981 Graham robbery victim, and Roe Wilson, an appellate
specialist with the Harris County district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of 19 years of legal battle, where Mr. Graham
was vigorously and legally represented,'' Wilson said afterward.
``He was given every consideration for his claims. It was time for
this to be carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   When the witnesses emerged shortly before 9 p.m., the crowd
turned silent. Uniformed officers from the Texas Department of
Public Safety raised their riot shields and stepped toward them in
a line. Behind them were Texas Department of Criminal Justice
officers with visored helmets, batons and plastic ``flexicuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The suddenly silent crowd turned toward the officers and began
pointing at them and shouting, ``Shaka was innocent'' and ``Long
live Shaka,'' a reference to Graham's adopted name of Shaka
Sankofa. One protester held a U.S. flag upside-down. Another burned
an effigy of Bush, while another man holding a large cardboard
syringe shouted, ``Die, die, die.''
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the crowd then began running away from the
prison.
</P>
<P>
   A solid majority of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles
refused at midday to recommend issuing a reprieve or commuting
Graham's death sentence. The board unanimously rejected a
conditional pardon for the 36-year-old inmate.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court later ruled 5-4 against a last-minute stay,
but the execution was delayed more than two hours as attorneys
filed a civil lawsuit in Austin and, when that was denied, an
appeal with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   When the Texas parole board, made up of 18 Bush appointees,
refused to block the execution, that left the Republican governor
with no options. The single 30-day reprieve a Texas governor may
unilaterally give a condemned inmate was issued to Graham by Bush's
predecessor in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The parole board, which has spared a prisoner only once during
Bush's tenure, could have granted a 120-day reprieve, a commutation
to a lesser sentence, or a conditional pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorneys Richard Burr and Jack Zimmermann have worked
since 1993 to bring what they call new evidence before a jury.
</P>
<P>
   In numerous appeals, they have attacked the testimony of lone
eyewitness Bernardine Skillern and brought forward witnesses to the
crime who were not called to testify in the original trial.
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon news conference in Zimmermann's office, both men
appeared emotional and Zimmermann choked up at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a state, because of human error, human frailty and no
will to acknowledge our own frailty, are about to put to death man
who is innocent,'' said Burr. ``There is no greater miscarriage of
justice, or travesty, or horror that a state can do to one of its
citizens than this.''
</P>
<P>
   For 19 years after the May 13, 1981, killing, Graham steadfastly
maintained his innocence. That ignited a variety of legal
challenges over the years and spurred criticism of the Texas
criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, it also sparked often-intense protest outside the
death chamber at the Huntsville Unit here.
</P>
<P>
   Graham supporters and anti-death penalty protesters began
gathering by 11 a.m. and sweltered in the heat. They beat drums,
chanted slogans and criticized Bush in a series of mostly peaceful
demonstrations throughout the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't do anything that would justify them hurting or harming
any of us,'' Houston activist Quanell X told the crowd, noting the
dozens of uniformed prison and state police personnel assembled.
</P>
<P>
   As the scheduled hour for Graham's execution _ 6 p.m. _ arrived,
several protesters ran into a restricted area directly in front of
the prison waving flags and shouting ``Free Shaka Sankofa.'' Eight
people were arrested; seven on charges of disorderly conduct and
one on a charge of aggravated assault of a public servant.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, Quanell X and seven armed New Black Panthers
marched in the street near the prison. The standoff ended
peacefully, but the tension remained.
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement of the parole board's vote Thursday,
Graham supporters began to shout ``Murderer.'' Some even wept and
hugged each other.
</P>
<P>
   Among the protesters was Deidra Hawkins, Graham's 19-year-old
daughter, who is pregnant with her second child, Graham's third
grandchild. She thanked her father's supporters and urged the
crowd, ``Don't stop protesting because he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad echoed other speakers when he said Graham had succeeded
in making a significant impact on the debate over the death
penalty. He told the crowd to think of the day as a celebration for
Graham and not a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``His life is not in vain. Through his life he has called the
whole world to look at Texas. He represents everything we've
marched for, chanted for, lost our jobs for and got arrested for,''
Muhammad told about 60 Houston protesters as the group prepared to
board a bus for Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of it has come down to this little boy born in Fifth Ward,
Texas. The little high school dropout. Through all of this, our
brother has evolved into a freedom fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Graham's eighth execution date, according to prison
officials. He was the 23rd inmate executed this year in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will prevail,'' Graham said before his death. ``Keep
marching. Black power. Keep marching. Black power. They are killing
me tonight. They are murdering me tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he went silent, having died with one eye closed and one eye
slightly open.
</P>
<P>
   Graham had always said he would not go to the death chamber
easily and he kept his promise.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Graham struggled briefly with five prison
guards at the Terrell Unit in Livingston when his visitation period
ended at 5 p.m. Graham was surprised when officials began shackling
his wrists, ankles and waist to move him to the death house in
Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Graham thought he would be returning to his cell on death row in
Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were attempting to put that apparatus on him yesterday,''
said prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald. ``But as soon as we
unshackled his hands to move them from the back to the front that's
when he started to struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said five officers subdued Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle was very short-lived. It probably was only a
minute or so,'' Fitzgerald said. ``... We were able to put the
restraints on him. He was then carried to the van.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said Graham was checked immediately after the
incident and was not injured. Graham did not say anything during
the struggle or on the drive to Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said Graham's mood had been ``quiet'' since the move.
</P>
<P>
   He refused every meal since breakfast Wednesday, requesting only
coffee. He did not request a last meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not want to eat in fact on the table of those who
would kill him,'' said Jackson, who visited with Graham on Thursday
and witnessed the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Because Graham resisted the move his visitations were limited
Thursday. In the morning he saw family, spiritual advisers and a
lawyer.

INMATE IS EXECUTED IN TEXAS AS 11TH-HOUR APPEALS FAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for complete writethru adding 1,200 words  
By FRANK BRUNI with JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With Gov. George W. Bush's backing and his
somberly stated conviction that ``justice is being done,'' the
state of Texas Thursday night executed Gary Graham, who had been
convicted for the 1981 murder of a man outside a Houston
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The execution was carried out even though five of the 18 members
of the Bush-appointed parole board argued against it, and the U.S.
Supreme Court also divided sharply over the issue, declining to
review the case by a 5--4 vote.
</P>
<P>
   When the moment of Graham's execution finally arrived, Bush did
not merely issue a written statement, but spoke to a crowd of
reporters in a solemn voice that contradicted his often
light-hearted nature. His facial expression and his words matched
his tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a responsibility I take very seriously,'' Bush said,
reading from a statement, ``because the final determination of
innocence or guilt is among the most profound and serious decisions
a person can make. I recognize that there are good people who
oppose the death penalty. I have heard their message and I respect
their heartfelt point of view.'``
</P>
<P>
   Then he recited a series of heinous crimes attributed to Graham
and noted that Graham had even confessed to some of them. He said
that Graham's case, over the 19 years since the murder for which he
was executed, had been reviewed ``more than 20 times by state and
federal courts'' and by 33 judges.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he backed the board's vote Thursday afternoon to
authorize the execution. ``After considering all the facts,'' he
said, ``I'm confident that justice is being done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Graham case attracted a remarkable amount of national and
even international attention, for many reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Questions arose about the testimony of the sole witness in the
case as well as the fact that his court-appointed lawyer provided
only a nominal defense. In addition, several jurors later expressed
doubt that they would have convicted him if they had been aware of
certain facts and testimony during the trial. Many legal experts
cast Graham as a perfect example of all that was wrong with the
judicial system and the death penalty, though many others noted
that his appeals were been lodged in dozens of courts and been
considered by an even larger number of judges as he avoided
execution for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's execution was delayed for nearly two hours as his
lawyers mounted last-minute appeals that took state officials by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 36, died at 8:49 p.m. Central Daylight Time, becoming
the 135th person to be put to death in Texas since Bush became
governor 5 1/2 years ago. That statistic, combined with Bush's
prominence as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,
partly explained why Graham's case received such scrutiny from news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Bush had said repeatedly that if the Texas
Board of Pardons and Paroles authorized Graham's execution, he had
no power in this particular case to grant Graham a reprieve an
interpretation of Texas law with which some legal experts
disagreed. But Bush made no mention of that Thursday night as he
publicly endorsed the board's decision.
</P>
<P>
   His demeanor suggested a sensitivity not only to the passions
that Graham's case had inflamed but also to his own need to project
an impression of approaching such enormously heavy, life-and-death
responsibilities with the utmost thoughtfulness and seriousness.
Advisers to Bush's presidential campaign said that they are
conscious of and have discussed the importance of Bush's tone and
bearing when discussing the death penalty, but they said his
decisions in each case were never subjected to political
considerations and were entirely his own.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, there is little evidence that Bush's fervent
advocacy of the death penalty carries any political risks. Although
recent polls have shown some softening in public support of the
death penalty, the surveys also show that roughly two-thirds of
Americans still favor it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the ground has shifted remarkably,'' said Linda
DiVall, a Republican pollster. ``I don't think he's got any
problem. I think he's showing the proper sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's execution had been scheduled for 7 p.m. after the Texas
Board of Pardons and Parole declined by a vote of 12-5 to grant a
request for clemency and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a
last-minute appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A third appeal was denied by the state's Court of Criminal
Appeals, the highest criminal court in Texas. But minutes before 7
p.m., Graham's lawyers filed still another one, this time a civil
lawsuit against the board of pardons. Though it, too, was
ultimately rejected by U.S. District Judge James Nowlin, the legal
maneuver caused yet another delay.
</P>
<P>
   Nowlin called the civil action ``an extremely tardy effort to
delay the execution.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   As the appeals worked through the courts, he remained in a
holding cell only steps from the death chamber accompanied by the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Bianca Jagger, a
representative of Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the execution, as questions about
Graham's fate dogged Bush along the campaign trail, he said
repeatedly that he was powerless to intervene in Graham's case if
the board of pardons authorized his execution _ an interpretation
of Texas law that some legal experts disputed.
</P>
<P>
   On the separate matter of whether Graham should be given a
conditional pardon, all 17 members voted no. Only a simple majority
of board members is required to allow an execution to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Dow, a professor of law at the University of Houston,
said the last-minute uncertainty that suddenly descended over
Graham's execution reflected how sophisticated his lawyers were and
how sensitive Bush and the state of Texas were to the intensity of
public attention to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Under different circumstances, Dow said, the state might have
gone ahead with the execution, because Graham's lawyers had already
exhausted all the traditional arguments in all the usual venues.
</P>
<P>
   The case also came at a time of deepening debate over capital
punishment, provoked by advances in DNA technology, new studies
that question the fairness with which the death penalty is
administered and the emergence of Bush, who presides over a state
that executes more inmates than any other, as a candidate for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The governor maintained that he was treating this case no
differently than any other and that any action he did or did not
take would be impervious to political considerations, immune to
public protests and unaffected by a campaign that has pivoted on
his portrayal of himself as a sensitive, compassionate
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a lot of hand-wringing,'' said one adviser. ``But
everyone recognizes that the environment has changed now that he's
running for president.'' The adviser added that there was some
minimal concern _ though not too much yet _ that all the attention
to the death penalty in Texas was at times eclipsing the other
issues Bush wanted to discuss on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush had taken any kind of action to stop Graham's death, it
would have been the second time this month that he had intervened
to halt an execution in defiance of the board's recommendation.
Prior to June 1, he had never done so, although he did concur in
1998 with the board's vote to commute the death sentence of Henry
Lee Lucas, a confessed serial killer, to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Several political analysts said that one challenge before Bush,
now that almost everything he did was being evaluated through the
prism of his presidential ambitions, was not to come across as
vulnerable to public pressures or unsteady in his convictions. Bush
has repeatedly assailed Vice President Al Gore as someone who bends
too readily with the political winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for him to do is remain consistent,''
said Don Sipple, a Republican strategist. Sipple said he believed
it was voters' impressions of Bush's constancy that explained the
high marks he received in many recent opinion polls for his
leadership skills.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, there has been some evidence in polls of a softening in
public support for the death penalty, but those same polls showed
that roughly two-thirds of Americans are still in favor of it. And
several political analysts said that that was a large enough
majority, on a subject that was not at the top of most voters'
concerns, for Bush to rest assured that he was on the right side of
the issue. Gore also supports the death penalty and has been
relatively reticent to challenge Bush on the brisk rate of
executions in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, the governor has extremely limited discretion
if the board authorizes an execution. All the governor can do under
those circumstances is grant the inmate a one-time reprieve of 30
days, though that time often grows as the inmate undertakes new
court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said that in this case, he could not do even that. A
64-year old clause in the Texas constitution says that the governor
``shall have the power to grant one reprieve in any capital case,''
and only one reprieve. Both Bush and lawyers for the state have
interpreted that to mean that because Gov. Ann Richards had granted
Graham such a reprieve in 1993, Bush was unable to.
</P>
<P>
   But other legal experts said that the constitution could be
interpreted as permitting one reprieve per governor, not per
inmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's plain old ambiguous,'' said Dow, noting that no court in
Texas had ever considered the language or issued a ruling on its
precise meaning. He went on to say, ``It's easier to say you have
no power than to exercise it.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was convicted for the May 13, 1981, murder of Bobby
Lambert in the parking lot of a Houston grocery store. His
conviction provoked little fanfare at the time, but his case
gradually attracted the attention of death penalty opponents.
</P>
<P>
   His advocates argued that Graham's trial lawyer, Ronald Mock,
put up a lackluster defense and scarcely investigated the case. No
physical evidence linked Graham to the scene, and ballistics tests
found that a .22-caliber revolver confiscated from him did not
match the murder weapon. His conviction rested on the testimony of
a woman sitting in her car, Bernadine Skillern, who saw the killer
as he confronted and shot Lambert about 30 feet away.

YANKEES MAY TENTATIVE DEAL TO ACQUIRE GONZALEZ 
 
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New York Yankees have agreed to a trade in
principle for the Detroit slugger Juan Gonzalez and have until
Sunday to negotiate a contract extension with the two-time most
valuable player, several baseball officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In return for Gonzalez, the Yankees have agreed to swap Drew
Henson, their best prospect, as well as outfielder Ricky Ledee and
the left-handed pitcher Randy Keisler, currently in Class AA.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are still negotiating with the Chicago Cubs for
Sammy Sosa, but have found the asking price of five or more players
to be high. The Yankees will not complete trades for both players.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Gonzalez, who drove in more than 100 runs seven
times with the Texas Rangers, controls his future because a limited
no-trade clause in his contract allows him to veto any proposed
trade to a New York team. He could say no to the Yankees, flatly,
because he does not want to play in New York. Luis Mayoral, a
friend of Gonzalez and the Tigers' Latin American liaison, told The
Detroit Free Press that ``New York is too fast for Juan's persona.
He likes Arlington and Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees contacted Gonzalez's agent, Jim Bronner, on
Thursday, but made no immediate progress toward securing the
player's approval either for the trade or for a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who is in the last year of his contract, could agree
to play for the Yankees, but refuse to sign a contract extension.
This would give the slugger a stage with a contending team in the
months before he can become a free agent. But the Yankees probably
would not be interested because they do not want to give up top
prospects for what would essentially be a three-month rental.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez could agree to a contract extension, although he has
already rejected a huge offer from the Tigers _ something in the
range of eight years for $140 million, or about $17.5 million per
year _ and, reportedly, Bronner asked the Tigers for $148 million
over eight years. The Yankees presumably would have to make a
similar commitment to Gonzalez to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   With the Tigers and Yankees on the cusp of a deal, Detroit
officials went to Toronto, where the team was playing, and are
believed to have met with Gonzalez. Whatever Gonzalez told them did
not discourage the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the 20-year-old Henson could be a huge coup for Detroit.
He attended high school in Michigan and expects to be the starting
quarterback for the University of Michigan this fall. There remains
a question of whether Henson will play baseball or football
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   In return for Sosa, the officials said, the Cubs have asked the
Yankees for at least five players, among a group that includes the
Class AAA shortstop Alfonso Soriano; Henson; Ledee; Keisler; the
recently promoted pitcher Jake Westbrook and the Class AA
right-hander David Walling. The market for Sosa has not been
robust, and the Yankees may be trying to use the Gonzalez
negotiations to push the Cubs. Many of the advisers to George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, have told him that
Gonzalez is a better all-around player, but Sosa possesses more
marquee value.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Gonzalez would propel the Yankees' payroll to
astronomical levels. If an agreement were reached, the Yankees
would most likely have to pay Gonzalez about $17 million per year.
They already have to pay Bernie Williams $12.5 million a year
through the 2006 season. Derek Jeter is making $10 million this
year and will make much more than that; negotiations for a $118.5
million deal have fallen apart and Jeter's long-term deal could
eventually approach $20 million per season. Mariano Rivera, the
closer, is making $7.25 million this year and soon could command in
excess of $20 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are paying second baseman Chuck Knoblauch $6 million
for this year and next, and at the time they traded for him in
1998, they agreed to give him a two-year, $18 million extension
that has never been announced. Similarly, Roger Clemens is expected
to receive a two-year extension for about $14 million to $15
million per year for 2001-2002, an agreement made at the time the
Yankees acquired him. The Yankees' payroll, now at $92 million,
could approach $140 million to $150 million in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees continue to search for pitching help. They had a
scout watch the Rangers righthander Esteban Loaiza on Wednesday. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herbalife International was built on Mark Hughes' story.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager who had spent time in a reform school, Hughes saw
his mother die from an accidental overdose of prescription diet
pills and set out to find a safer, better way to help people lose
weight. At 23, with only a ninth-grade education and after stints
with two direct-sales weight-loss companies that went out of
business, he went out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   He found a formula and started selling. His grandmother was his
first success, and her example brought in friends as new customers.
``Lose Weight Now, Ask Me How,'' became the mantra for Herbalife,
which started in the trunk of Hughes' car in 1980. It found its
footing in a small storefront in Beverly Hills, Calif., and grew
into a weight-loss, nutrition and personal care products company
with worldwide sales of nearly $1.7 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 21, the Hughes story came to a tragic, almost ironic
end when Hughes was found dead in the bedroom of the $25 million
Malibu beachfront house that he shared with his third wife, Darcy
LaPier. The company said he had drunk alcohol at a birthday party
for his 87-year-old grandmother at his home and later took the
antidepressant Doxepin, which had been prescribed to help him
sleep. Officials ruled the death an accident, noting that neither
the drugs nor the alcohol in his system would have been fatal
alone. But the combination was lethal.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the handsome and charismatic Hughes at 44 is a
serious blow for the company _ both because he was Herbalife's head
cheerleader and because of the possibility that his message of a
better life through herbal products might be diminished by the way
he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously an image problem,'' said Scott Hood, portfolio
manager at First Wilshire Securities Management, which has owned
Herbalife shares since late 1989. ``But how bad is it? It's not
like he was taking their own products.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond image, though, a number of other issues face the
executives who now run the company. A new team has taken up the
challenge of motivating and expanding a vast network of
distributors who buy the products from the company and in turn
recruit new distributors. Other worries include a slumping domestic
market for herbal products, a tight job market that could make it
more difficult to draw in distributors, a damaged relationship with
Wall Street after a failed attempt to take the company private, and
stock transactions that left investors crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 58 percent of the stock is now held in a trust. The
trustees are Christopher Pair, formerly the chief operating officer
of Herbalife and now the president and chief executive; Conrad
Klein, the chief business affairs officer and a longtime legal
adviser to the company; and Jack Reynolds, Hughes' father. (As a
young man, Hughes took his mother's maiden name.)
</P>
<P>
   Pair, who was a counselor at the reform school that Hughes
attended and later became a friend, said in an interview at company
headquarters in Los Angeles that he had no intention of trying to
substitute for Hughes, who at his death was chairman, president and
chief executive of the company..
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never fill his shoes,'' he said, adding with a
chuckle, ``I don't have his looks.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say he does not have a story to share with
distributors. When Pair was a young man, overweight and struggling
with back problems, Hughes persuaded him to try his product, a
weight-loss powder that was so new it came in plastic bags rather
than cans.
</P>
<P>
   He said he dropped 50 pounds in four months and became a
distributor for a short period before returning to the University
of Redlands in California to get his business degree. Though he
says his experience as a distributor will help him in managing the
company, he intends to focus more on operations and on mending the
relationship with Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   To motivate distributors, he said, there are plenty of other
stories to be told and thousands of hours of tapes of Mark Hughes
selling his vision.
</P>
<P>
   On Herbalife's Web site (www.herbalife.com), the voice of Hughes
still tells how his mother ``totally destroyed her life just trying
to lose 30 pounds'' as the company promotes its vision of realizing
monetary dreams through selling its vast array of products. Beyond
its core weight-loss and nutritional supplements, they feature a
wide variety of skin-care items, vitamins, shampoos, even a natural
sleep product. Among the company's competitors are Amway, Nature's
Sunshine and Weider Nutrition International.
</P>
<P>
   To keep Hughes' message fresh, Herbalife will rely more on the
stories of its top sellers. Members of the Chairman's Club and the
President's Team, who have networks bringing in hundreds of
thousands of dollars a month, already train new distributors and
conduct seminars, and those elite categories give distributors a
goal to strive for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success is just a reflection of his power,'' said Paco
Perez, who was a bellboy at an airport hotel in Los Angeles before
becoming Hughes' first employee and is now a member of the
President's Team. ``He taught us all by example. We're committed to
his dream.''
</P>
<P>
   To realize that dream, the network must keep growing. Despite
setbacks, it has always done just that.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, the company came under intense scrutiny by
regulators. The company paid $850,000 to settle a lawsuit by the
state of California that accused it of having made false medical
claims and having run an illegal marketing scheme. The Food and
Drug Administration forced it to remove two products from the
market for relabeling.
</P>
<P>
   Business issues have been of more concern in recent years.
Currency turmoil in Asia and Russia resulted in a steep drop in the
stock price, and Wall Street developed concerns about how the
company, which went public in 1986, was handling its stock and how
it was preparing to go private again.
</P>
<P>
   Though officials say the product and marketing issues of the
1980s did not amount to much and are of no concern now, Pair said
he would focus on rebuilding the company's relationship with Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Crawford, an analyst with B. Riley &AMP; Co., a Los Angeles
brokerage house, said, ``There's one significant hurdle standing in
the way of Herbalife regaining the trust of Wall Street, and that's
showing management is there for shareholders and not for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, whose firm stopped covering Herbalife last year, noted
that in 1998 management stock options with original strike prices
of about $14 were reset between $6.63 and $8. Such a move is not
uncommon when a company's stock price drops, as Herbalife's did
then, but this adjustment would have meant large profits for
executives had Hughes' buyback attempt gone through at $17.81 a
share. That effort, which would have repurchased all the company's
stock, was terminated because of bond market turmoil and increased
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Also of concern was a complex transaction in 1998 in which
Hughes ultimately received $18 a share for 5 million shares. Add to
that the buyback attempt, which led to a lawsuit by shareholders
who felt the offer was too low, and Pair has plenty to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we've had some very valid issues internally,'' he said,
referring to the legal fees and other costs of the buyback attempt,
``the company is extraordinarily sound, the distributor base is
absolutely committed to building the business, and we've got a
management team in place that is going to continue to do what Mark
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Pair said he would try to increase the price of the stock, which
he says is greatly undervalued. It closed at $8 Thursday on Nasdaq,
down from a 52-week high of $16.375 on Jan. 14. He declined to
offer specifics before sharing them with shareholders in July, but
he said plans call for continuing overseas expansion and adding new
products and new technology to aid distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's over 130 countries in the world; we're in 49,'' Pair
said. ``We haven't even touched China yet, which is going to be
potentially the biggest market in the world for direct selling.''
</P>
<P>
   He said at least a dozen products were being developed for the
United States, probably six to eight of which will come on the
market next year. Extensive new products are also to be introduced
in Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Some institutional investors agree that the stock is
undervalued. They note that the company, with nearly $100 million
in cash (over $3 a share) and no long-term debt, trades at 4.6
times earnings and pays a 7.8 percent dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said Herbalife's new team could send Wall Street a
strong message by buying back shares and returning the value to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   At such a low price, he said, the company is an attractive
takeover target, particularly to a company looking for a strong
distribution base. Herbalife has about 750,000 distributors
throughout the world and recently began operations in Ireland and
India. Though analysts say Herbalife has been able to maintain its
domestic sales while sales have slid at other companies selling
herbal products, there are concerns that with the job market tight
Herbalife will have a hard time holding distributors and finding
new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Herbalife said that it had not found that to be a problem and
that the strong economy was resulting in more sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Boesenberg, a Los Angeles distributor who was called at
random last week, said she would stop selling Herbalife in August
after 24 years. She said her decision was made before Mark Hughes'
death and was based on lack of sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very fickle about vitamins, and I'm tired of having
people order thousands of dollars of vitamins only to get stuck
with them,'' she said. ``There's too much other stuff out there to
choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   She also cited an increase, to 7 percent, in shipping and
handling charges, which she said she had to pay even if she drove
to a warehouse to pick up supplies. In addition, she said,
distributors who had brought her in, as well as those she had
recruited, were gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've signed up a total of five or six distributors in the time
I've done this, and they've all dropped out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hughes' death, though, she did not expect that to have
any negative effect ``for the people who believe in Herbalife.''
</P>
<P>
   A conference in Philadelphia the weekend after the coroner's
report about Hughes' death supported her speculation.
</P>
<P>
   John Tartol, a Malibu-based distributor who is part of the
Chairman's Club, said 3,500 distributors turned out.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had expected to get phone calls after the release of
the coroner's report. Only one came. He also expected distributors
at the conference in Philadelphia to have questions about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not concerned,'' he said, adding that Hughes had
struggled with pneumonia and asthma this year, perhaps coming back
to work too quickly and weakening himself. ``It's kind of
interesting there's been a new commitment. We're going to go out
there and do it for Mark.''

COURT SAYS ONLINE PRIVACY LAW FLAWED  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal law intended to shield children from
online pornography was dealt a second setback on Thursday, as an
appellate court upheld a lower court order against enforcement and
declared that the statute was probably fatally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the case an agonizing conflict between the cherished
right of free speech and the profound duty to watch over children,
a three-judge panel of the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals let
stand an injunction issued by a federal district judge.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous appeals panel in Philadelphia made it clear that
it saw a struggle not just between the First Amendment and a
society's moral obligation to its young, but a struggle to devise
laws compatible with the Internet's instant access and global
reach.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the panel said, the 1998 Child Online Protection Act
falls well short of meeting First Amendment standards, as the
American Civil Liberties Union and other plaintiffs contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will affirm the district court's grant of a preliminary
injunction because we are confident that the ACLU's attack on
COPA's constitutionality is likely to succeed on the merits,'' the
circuit court said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had appealed the district judge's
injunction and declined to say tonight whether it would appeal
today's ruling. ``We will review the decision and take appropriate
action,'' a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The protection act would require commercial Web sites to collect
a credit card number or some other access code as proof of age
before allowing Internet users to view on-line material deemed
harmful to minors. First-time violators would face criminal
penalties of six months in jail and $50,000 in fines. Repeat
violators would face an additional $50,000 a day in fines. The law
also provides for civil penalties of up to $50,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The law has never been enforced. Soon after it was passed by
Congress and signed by President Clinton it was challenged by a
coalition of 17 groups and businesses represented by the ACLU. The
plaintiffs include a condom dealer, an online art site, a gay and
lesbian online service and the Internet Content Coalition. The
coalition consists of some two dozen publishers with online
ventures, including Time Inc., MSNBC and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Child Online Protection Act was introduced in Congress after
an earlier effort to regulate children's access to Web smut, the
Communications Decency Act of 1996, was ruled unconstitutionally
broad by the Supreme Court in 1997. The high court held, among
other things, that the Communications Decency Act had failed to
sufficiently define its key terms, and noted that it was aimed not
just at commercial speech and entities but at nonprofit
organizations and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the Child Online Protection Act argued that the
latter law was far narrower, zeroing in on commercial Web-porn
traffickers and their ``teaser ads.'' Opponents of the law argued
that it could be applied to high-minded Web ventures that carry
sexually explicit material _ those dealing with gynecological
issues, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Judges Leonard I. Garth, Theodore A. McKee and Richard Lowell
Nygaard praised efforts by Congress to protect children. But
turning to the concept of ``community standards'' of decency in
defining pornography, they noted the virtual impossibility of a Web
site meeting the standards of, say, Chicago, Amsterdam and Teheran
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling upheld District Judge Lowell A. Reed Jr. of
Philadelphia who, as a father and grandfather, had expressed
``personal regret'' at having to issue an injunction against the
child-protection act.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate judges said they shared his sentiments. They said,
too, that ``in light of rapidly developing technological advances,
what may now be impossible to regulate constitutionally may, in the
not-too-distant future, become feasible.''

COURT SAYS AT&AMP;T CAN'T BE FORCED TO SHARE LINES TO THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Reversing a lower court, the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that a local jurisdiction could not
force a cable company that offered Internet access to share its
telecommunication lines with rival cable modem providers.
</P>
<P>
   But in ruling in favor of AT&AMP;T in its case against the city of
Portland, Ore., the appeals court defined the cable broadband
business as a ``telecommunications service,'' a distinction some
industry observers say may ultimately force such businesses,
including AT&AMP;T, to open their lines to competitors on a national
level.
</P>
<P>
   The decision left AT&AMP;T, the city of Portland and a coalition of
Internet companies seeking access to AT&AMP;T's telecommunications
lines each claiming victory in a suit closely watched by the
Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   And it left industry analysts and telecommunications experts
grappling with a decision they say raises as many questions as it
answers about how the cable modem business will be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T won the battle but lost the war,'' said Scott Cleland, a
regulatory analyst with the Legg Mason Precursor Group, a
Washington-based market research firm. ``They lost the broader
fight over whether their service is regulated or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T executives disputed that assessment, arguing that it
was premature to conclude that federal regulators will force them
to open their cable lines to rivals. ``This is a complete
victory,'' said Mark C. Rosenblum, an AT&AMP;T vice president. ``Our
point was that local authorities are not allowed to regulate
telecommunication services and we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Communications Commission officials said the decision is
likely to bring all sides in the dispute to Washington seeking
clarification.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the officials said, neither the cable industry nor
its opponents had sought regulators' guidance on their view of the
cable modem business. A central issue is whether cable modem
operators are more like cable companies, which are not required to
open their lines to rivals, or more like telephone companies, which
must.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are open questions on which the commission has not yet
ruled and presumably will rule soon,'' an FCC official said. ``I
suspect all of this will be brought to our doorstep very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   More generally, the FCC has embraced a policy it calls
``vigilant restraint'' with regard to Internet access, arguing the
marketplace _ not the government _ should determine which
technologies prevail and which fall by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   The case stemmed from a Portland City Council decision in
December 1998 to make the transfer to AT&AMP;T of a cable franchise
owned by Tele-Communications Inc. contingent on AT&AMP;T's opening
access to its high-speed Internet connections. In June of last
year, a federal judge in Portland upheld the move, despite
objections from AT&AMP;T that regulatory authority belonged to the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the case is of growing interest to major
telecommunications providers, Internet access companies and a
growing number of consumers seeking higher-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the Internet over cable lines is one of the nascent
technologies proffered as a high-speed alternative to the
conventional dial-up Internet access, but its distribution has been
held up in part by questions of whether local jurisdictions can
govern who controls the lines.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Thursday's decision, AT&AMP;T said it would start
offering the (AT)Home cable modem service in Portland starting
Friday. The company had refused to offer access previously because
the Portland city council mandated that if AT&AMP;T offered its
(AT)Home service, it would have to offer service to rivals as well.
</P>
<P>
   In December, AT&AMP;T announced plans to give rivals access to its
cable lines to deliver Internet access, asserting in a letter to
the FCC that access would be available by 2002. The company said it
could not open the lines before that time because it has an
exclusive deal to lease those lines to (AT)Home, a high-speed cable
service of which it is partial owner.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in November, AT&AMP;T plans to conduct a trial in Boulder,
Colo., in which rival Internet access providers will share the same
cable lines. AT&AMP;T says the effort will help it address unresolved
technical problems with open access. But several local
jurisdictions across the country, including Portland, have sought
to force AT&AMP;T's hand, arguing that competition will yield faster,
better-quality Internet access. The municipalities have sought to
force AT&AMP;T's hand by making such open access a condition of their
approval of AT&AMP;T's purchase of TCI.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Sten, a Portland city commissioner, said Thursday that the
city had not decided whether to appeal the decision, in part
because city officials view it as a partial victory. ``If the
decision is interpreted as we think it will be,'' he said, AT&AMP;T
will be deemed to be a telecommunications service provider and thus
required to open access on a national level.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the 9th Circuit wrote that under ``the
principle of common carriage governs cable broadband as it does
other means of Internet transmission such as telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland, along with a coalition of Internet service providers,
pointed to the language of the decision as evidence that AT&AMP;T will
ultimately be subject to the same regulatory requirements as local
telephone companies, which must open their lines to rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open access is the law of the highest court that has reviewed
this,'' said Greg Simon, co-director of the openNET Coalition, a
group of Internet companies joining Portland and other
municipalities. ``The law is now open access in the Ninth
Circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T's Rosenblum said that even if the cable modem business
were construed as a telecommunications service, it would not
necessarily be subject to open access requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FCC official said that just because the 9th
Circuit defined AT&AMP;T as a telecommunications service does not mean
that decision is a binding legal conclusion. The official said the
question before the court was about Portland's right to regulate
AT&AMP;T, not about how AT&AMP;T's status should be defined before the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   The official, as well as executives from AT&AMP;T, also noted that
the court decision stated clearly that, even if the cable modem
business were deemed a telecommunications service, federal
regulators have broad powers to exempt the technology from
open-access requirements.
