   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Yes, they hope to bring sinners to the
Lord, but that's not the only reason street preachers take to the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, they said during a gathering of about 200 street
preachers from around the country, it's to tell sinners -- those
''unfruitful works of darkness'' -- that they're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Christ commanded his followers to preach, ''and we're
being obedient to that command,'' said Kenneth Lansing, who helped
organize the preachers' pilgrimage, timed to coincide with Memphis'
biggest annual music festival earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Working in teams of two to a dozen, the preachers took to the
Beale Street entertainment district, which is lined with nightclubs
and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Along with delivering their message to the unsaved, the group,
some ordained and some not, held street-preaching seminars on
topics such as how to deal with hecklers and to protect one's
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Preachers can't just go out and start yelling, not if they
expect to last, said voice instructor Scot Heishman of Lincoln,
Del.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should never be any kind of tension or hurting in the
throat,'' said Heishman, a lay preacher who runs a custom
embroidery shop. ''You're going to do a lot of damage to the vocal
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Preachers must learn to relax their necks and shoulders and draw
air from deep down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Singing on the opera stage is very much like street
preaching,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Bear, a Decorah, Iowa, preacher who began his street
evangelism with a group call the SWAT Team for Jesus, specializes
in controlling hecklers.
</P>
<P>
   Bear told the preachers they should always have at least one
assistant. That way, when a heckler approaches, the assistant can
step forward to absorb the negative vibes while talking softly with
the heckler and handing him a religious tract.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never been hit in 15 years and never would I hit
anybody,'' Bear said. ''I absorb (the heckler's) anger and let him
blow off steam. He may leave angry but he never stops the
preaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who is a true believer can become a street preacher, Bear
said, but it takes some preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to go out there with something to say,'' he said.
''If you can't think of anything to say, quote the basic John 3:16.
Quote that four times very slowly and then give your personal
testimony how Christ saved you.''
</P>
<P>
   John 3:16 says God gave his only son ''that whosoever believeth
in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear said he tries to tell people that even a life of good works
-- the life of a responsible citizen or parent, or a life devoted to
helping the less fortunate -- isn't enough to win a place in heaven.
Only faith in Christ ensures that place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his colleagues, Lansing is known in his hometown
for standing on street corners shouting his message and waving
large banners with religious messages.
</P>
<P>
   For years, he has spent weekends preaching on Beale Street,
warning sinners against the dangers of ''sex music, alcohol and
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   If sinners stop their wicked ways they, too, may take the Lord
into their hearts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether they do or not, they must be told ''they're wrong to
live the way they live.'' If that bothers them, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they're in the lake of fire burning, they'll wish they
had paid attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beale Street patrons appeared to accept Lansing with a mixture
of curiosity and bemusement, but their reactions aren't what he's
worried about.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may be just a little flicker, but we are light,'' said
Lansing, a fundamentalist Baptist who works as an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Beale Street pilgrimage drew twice as many faithful
as last year's, at least partly because of Lansing's legal battles
with organizers of the Memphis In May International Festival.
</P>
<P>
   A nonprofit citizens' group leases a riverside park from the
city to stage the bigger events of the May festival. Complaining of
pedestrian congestion, organizers shooed Lansing away from the
entrance of the park, and he filed suit, arguing his religious
rights were violated.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the festival does
have the authority to control park congestion, though that decision
had no effect on Lansing's freedom to preach anywhere else around
town.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any individual in this nation has the right to stand on a
street corner and speak his mind,'' said Hedy Weinberg, director of
the American Civil Liberties Union in Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> China Spy Case Said Poorly Handled  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An internal Justice Department review
concludes the FBI failed to provide enough resources and
supervision to the Wen Ho Lee spy case and focused so narrowly on
the Los Alamos scientist that it may have missed other national
security breaches, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The highly classified report written by prosecutor Randy Bellows
was presented to Attorney General Janet Reno in the last week and
echoes prior congressional findings about the government's
investigation into possible espionage at its nuclear labs.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Justice Department have battled for months in public
over whether the department's decision to decline an electronic
surveillance warrant for the Lee case hampered agents' work.
</P>
<P>
   After months of suggestions that Lee would be indicted for China
espionage, the scientist was charged last December with lesser
offenses of removing nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos lab with
no suggestion he gave them to China.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who had worked at Los Alamos' top-secret nuclear weapons
programs since the 1970s, has steadfastly claimed his innocence,
insisting he never provided any secrets to China or anyone else.
Fired in March, 1999 and arrested last December, he remains in jail
in Santa Fe awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellows report, according to officials who have seen it,
concludes that the department should have approved the warrant
requested several times by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But it adds that the FBI did not provide all the information it
possessed that might help the department make the decision, the
officials told The Associated Press, speaking only on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman John Collingwood declined comment late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials added that the report concludes FBI agents spent
so much time fighting for the surveillance warrant that they missed
the opportunity to more quickly search Lee's work computer, where
they belatedly found evidence he downloaded prized nuclear secrets
from secure computers.
</P>
<P>
   Bellows concludes the FBI did not need the warrant to conduct
the computer search because Lee had no reasonable expectation of
privacy on a government computer, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy focus on Lee also kept the bureau from considering
other people as possible China espionage suspects and other
possible leaks of national security secrets, the report added.
</P>
<P>
   The AP first reported last December that documents showed the
FBI began to doubt more than a year ago that Lee had given China
one of America's most prized nuclear secrets as originally feared,
but did not begin to refocus its investigation to other possible
suspects until late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellows report, the officials said, blames the FBI for not
providing enough leadership and resources to the espionage
investigation in its early stages.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Govt Resignation Demanded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- More than 40,000 people gathered at an
opposition rally Thursday to demand the Macedonian government
resign and hold early elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Down with the government,'' ''We want elections,'' read the
banners carried by the protesters at the rally held at the main
city square in the capital Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats and eight other opposition parties
announced a series of anti-government protests in a declaration
read at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing this government can do to save Macedonia is to
quit power,'' Branko Crvenkovski, the leader of the Social
Democrats told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Crvenkovski's party, formerly the Communists, blame the
center-right government for the worsening economic situation in
Macedonia, the only former Yugoslav republic to secede peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia is believed to be dangerously close to bankruptcy.
With more than half the workforce unemployed and a foreign debt
amounting to $1.45 billion, the impoverished Balkan nation is
hoping to boost its economy by bringing in foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition also accuses the government of giving in to the
country's ethnic Albanians, who make up one-fourth of the country's
2 million people and have been demanding more rights.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition calls for the government resignation have grown since
an incident earlier this year in which four Macedonian soldiers
were abducted by Kosovo Albanian extremists and reportedly
exchanged for a Kosovo Albanian facing trial in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats led Macedonia to independence from former
Yugoslavia in 1991 and ruled the country for seven years before
losing elections to the ruling center-right coalition, which
includes pro-Western politicians in the country.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Pa. Pier Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A pier supporting a new open-air bar
collapsed and plunged into the Delaware River Thursday night,
killing at least three people and injuring more than three dozen,
hospital and city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went down so quick people were just running,'' said Julie
Morgan of Haddonfield, N.J., who was pulled out of the water and
was sitting with police blankets draped over her on the back of a
police car.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a loud crash, and then all hell broke loose. I went
straight down ... then I was just trying to fight my way up,'' said
bartender Joseph Capaci, 28, of Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   Three people died, and 37 people -- including eight rescue
workers who were hurt while trying to pull victims from the
debris-strewn water -- were taken to hospitals, said Stephanie
Franklin-Suber, the mayor's chief of staff. Identities were not
immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   Divers continued to search the water and pier wreckage through
the night, though Police Commissioner John Timoney said there was
no reason to believe more people were in the water.
</P>
<P>
   The pier dropped into the water about 8:25 p.m. A canvas tent
over the pier also collapsed, covering many people who fell into
the water.
</P>
<P>
   Most were treated for minor injuries, although one person was
listed as critical, and several others were still being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   The pier held the new bar, Heat, which is attached to a ballroom
dancing area at the Moshulu restaurant, a boat docked on the river.
Heat opened earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The pier is about one-quarter the size of a football field,
behind the restaurant. The section that collapsed was along the
back wall of the ballroom facing the deck, Franklin-Suber said.
</P>
<P>
   A hostess at the restaurant, Eve McCarney, said workers had
replaced some floorboards on Wednesday but did not do any major
structural work. Fire and police officials were investigating, as
were officials from the Department of Licenses and Inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a pier collapsed on the New Jersey side of the
Delaware River, submerging at least five vehicles and causing about
$10 million in damage.

<HEADLINE> Mejia Wins Dominican Election  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Left-leaning populist
Hipolito Mejia was declared the winner of the Dominican
presidential race Thursday after his opponents withdrew from a
run-off election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you for this clean and complete victory,'' Mejia,
surrounded by his children and grandchildren, told cheering
supporters at a Santo Domingo hotel. He promised a ''government of
national unity, a shared government that will rise above the
confrontation and partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Mejia was pronounced the winner by Manuel Morel, president of
the Central Electoral Board, after Danilo Medina of the incumbent
Dominican Liberation Party and ex-President Joaquin Balaguer said
they were leaving the race because a costly second round would
cause instability and hurt the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the good of the country, we waive our right to participate
in a second round,'' Medina said as frustrated party members
objected angrily.
</P>
<P>
   President Leonel Fernandez later congratulated Mejia and
applauded Medina for his ''greatness and generosity'' in not
forcing a second round.
</P>
<P>
   Reynaldo Pared, the Liberation Party delegate on the Central
Electoral Board, said Medina made the decision after failing to
strike an alliance with Balaguer. Balaguer, the third-place
candidate, told Medina he was unable to guarantee that his Social
Christian Reformist Party could deliver enough votes to give Medina
a second-round win, Pared said.
</P>
<P>
   With returns from only 18 of 11,422 polling stations in
Tuesday's election still not fully counted, officials said Mejia,
of the center-left Dominican Revolutionary Party, had 49.86 percent
of the vote, a hair shy of the 50 percent-plus margin needed to
avoid a June 30 runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Free-market advocate Medina had 24.95 percent. Despite his
blindness and frailty, the 93-year-old Balaguer, a conservative,
won 24.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under Dominican law, the Central Electoral Board can declare a
winner if one of the two candidates withdraws from the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to be a government for everyone, a government
that won't destroy the country and one that listens to civil
society,'' Mejia's vice presidential running mate, Milagros Ortiz
Bosch, said. The new administration will be inaugurated Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Medina's party reacted with anger. A furious
Miguel Solano, a former assistant chief of staff for President
Leonel Fernandez, called party leaders ''traitors'' and claimed
that the administration had ''negotiated an impunity pact so
nothing happens'' to members of the Medina government involved in
alleged corruption after Mejia takes power.
</P>
<P>
   But many voters reacted with relief to the news that there would
be no runoff, saying they were weary of nearly two years of
sometimes violent campaigning and an election that claimed three
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have voted for (Medina), but what I'd like now is that
they leave it the way it is,'' said Santo Alguilino Abreu, a
39-year-old taxi driver. ''We don't need a second round. It costs
too much and there are too many problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, who had declared a victory with only 5 percent of the
votes counted on Tuesday night, was more cautious on Thursday,
thanking the other candidates, but waiting on the elections board
for a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign elections observers said they were satisfied with the
developments and affirmed that Tuesday's vote was fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they had to have a second round, it would have been OK, but
this will be better for the Dominican people,'' said Richard
Soudriette, president of the International Foundation for Elections
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Carter Center and the Washington-based
National Democratic Institute for International Affairs also called
the elections fair during a joint news conference Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, 59, criticized Fernandez's administration for failing to
relieve endemic poverty and has promised to spend more on social
programs and community-level public works projects. He offers no
overreaching changes in economic policy, although businessmen fear
he'll take money from much-needed infrastructure investments to
make good on his campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
   A former director of the Dominican Tobacco Institute, Mejia runs
an agrochemical business and was agriculture secretary from 1978-82
under President Antonio Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   Married with four children, Mejia has been his party's vice
president for years but never held elected office. In 1990, he was
the vice presidential running mate of the legendary Jose Francisco
Pena Gomez -- who made three unsuccessful runs for the presidency.
Pena Gomez died in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Pier collapses sending dozens into Delaware River  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A pier holding a new open-air bar collapsed
and plunged into the Delaware River Thursday night, killing at
least three people and injuring more than three dozen including
several rescue workers, hospital and city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went down so quick people were just running,'' said Julie
Morgan of Haddonfield, N.J., who was pulled out of the water and
was sitting with police blankets draped over her on the back of a

</P>
<P>
   Three people died and 37 people, including eight rescue workers,
were taken to area hospitals, said Stephanie Franklin-Suber, the
mayor's chief of staff. The identities were not immediately
released.
</P>
<P>
   Divers continued to search the water and pier wreckage through

   At least 30 people were on the pier when it dropped into the

covering many people who fell into the water.
</P>
<P>
   One person was pronounced dead and 11 people were being treated
for minor injuries at Methodist Hospital, said hospital spokesman
Jeff Baxt. One person was pronounced dead at Thomas Jefferson
Hospital, where three others were being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   A third person was pronounced dead by the medical examiner,
according to Fire Commissioner Harold Hairston.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people, including six rescue workers, were taken to
Hahnemann University Hospital, emergency room Dr. Bartholomew
Tortella said. One person was critical, two were in stable and the
six rescue workers suffered cuts and bruises. The other two
people's conditions are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Four people with non-serious injuries were taken to Pennsylvania
Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said. St. Agnes had two victims
and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania had four. Two
other firefighters suffered minor injuries, though it was not known
where they were being treated.

<HEADLINE> Pistons-Irvine Talks Called Cordial  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- George Irvine wants to be the Detroit Pistons'
head coach, and the club wants to clear the ''interim'' from his
title.
</P>
<P>
   But reaching contract terms has been anything but a slam dunk,
Irvine's attorney said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we're at a close stage at all about terms,''
Keith Glass said by telephone from his New Jersey office. ''The
good thing is that we're talking. There's no breakdown in that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd use the word 'cordial' but not 'close,''' Glass said,
adding that talks are hung up on ''differences in terms of value.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't come to an agreement on major terms,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate on whether that meant money, the contract's
length or both.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, he said he isn't pressed about getting a deal done.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that negotiations are never about time; I measure them
by tone,'' he said. ''I'm hoping that we can move this thing along
a little bit and get to the point where we can put this behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   No one appears to want that more than Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides want it to get done,'' he said from his California
home. ''I'm confident something will get done, but I'm not sure of
the timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important part was them wanting me and me wanting to
coach. Those two things have been settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he refused to discuss negotiations in detail,
saying only that he seeks a contract in line with those of other
head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Pistons vice president Joe Dumars told The Detroit News that the
sides were far apart but the gap could be bridged.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would be amazed at how quickly these things can turn
around,'' said Dumars, a former Pistons player. ''Keith knows where
we are coming from on this. We like George and we think he is the
perfect fit for our team.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has made a connection with our guys, and we want him here.
We are going through the negotiating process right now, but I am
confident we can get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass and Irvine discounted a report that Irvine would be signed
to a three-year contract within days.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they say they're days away I don't know what they mean,''
Glass said. ''I'm surprised to see that the Pistons are saying
we're so close. I don't consider us close at all.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine has been the Pistons' interim coach since Alvin Gentry
was fired March 6.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine said then he wasn't interested in the full-time job, only
to change his mind after the Pistons went 14-10 -- 7-5 away from the
Palace -- under his watch before being swept by Miami in the
playoffs' first round.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Irvine said abruptly being elevated as Gentry's
replacement was ''really difficult.'' The timing left him ''not too
enthused'' about guiding the team that he said faced an arduous
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But Irvine's change of mind about the coaching vacancy was
inspired by the way the Pistons responded under him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're on the right track as far as how we need to
play, what we need to do to win, what we need to do to improve,''
he said. ''To be able to start at the beginning of the season is a
lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvine was an assistant with the Golden State Warriors for two
years and worked for 16 years in the Indiana Pacers' front office.
He also played in the ABA.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Expresses Regets  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani expressed regret Thursday
for the way he handled a recent police shooting of an unarmed black
man, speaking at a public forum at which he gave no hint whether
he'll continue his run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The town hall meeting came three weeks after Giuliani revealed
that he has prostate cancer and said he didn't know if he would
continue to seek the Senate seat against first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During the hourlong forum, Giuliani told MSNBC moderator Andrea
Mitchell he has some regrets, including how he handled the police
shooting of Patrick Dorismond, who was killed in a scuffle with
undercover police.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was widely criticized for releasing Dorismond's police
record-- including sealed details of a juvenile arrest. Giuliani
said he did right in releasing the records, but also said he should
have been more understanding about the loss of a person's life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a mistake,'' he said. ''I should have also conveyed
human feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Mitchell whether he has become more compassionate
because of his illness, Giuliani said ''something has to happen to
you.''

<P>
   The mayor insisted Thursday -- both before and during the town
hall meeting 900 people attended -- that he has not yet chosen a
cancer treatment. He has said that step will precede any
announcement of whether he will keep up the Senate run.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had thought the decision would be easier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it would be like a budget or a (court) case, but it
is a much more personal decision,'' said the former prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how people should take recent revelations about the
mayor's private life -- including his acknowledgment of a close
relationship with another woman and plans to separate from his wife
-- the mayor said: ''I guess I would just like people to take a look
at me and say I'm a human being. I'm not a religious leader, I'm a
governmental leader.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he ''has not always put his family first,'' but declined
to answer questions about Judith Nathan, whom he has called a
''very good friend.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Even rainouts can produce winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I think I'll get my shot again,'' Mets outfielder Jay
Payton said after Thursday's game between New York and the Colorado
Rockies was postponed by rain following a 1-hour, 37-minute wait.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, a regular in the Mets outfield with 21 starts in center
since April 7, seems to have lost his spot, thanks to a .218
batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to hope that I can get some more at bats,'' said
Payton, considered one of the most promising of the Mets prospects
before a series of injuries helped derail his career in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   There even is the possibility those at bats could come with
another team. It appears that Payton could be included in a trade
now that he is no longer an untouchable prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Payton entered Wednesday's game as a defensive replacement and
drew a walk in his only plate appearance. He hasn't homered since
April 12 at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Payton has effectively been replaced in the Mets outfield by Joe
McEwing, called up from Norfolk last weekend after New York
released Rickey Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Bobby J. Jones may have gained something from the
rainout; he's scheduled to start Friday's series opener against the
Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 0-1 with a 16.20 ERA in three starts, came off the
disabled list prior to his scheduled start Thursday. He had been
placed on the DL April 17 because of a strained right calf muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Bobby, it's a situation where before the year is over
we're going to need him, and we want him to understand that we need
him now,'' said Mets manager Bobby Valentine, whose team is 5-15
May, dropping from a tie for first on April 24 to fourth place, 7{
games behind Atlanta in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine indicated the Jones would have pitched Thursday, even
if the weather was not good.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea situation is for him to pitch in ideal conditions,''
the manager said. ''He's pitched in rain before. He could have
gotten through.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado manager Buddy Bell, whose club has won four of five,
also thought his team may have gained from the rainout.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to have to play doubleheaders,'' Bell said,
''(but) one good thing, it does give Todd (Helton) another day of
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who had missed two games with a strained right
hamstring, is the NL's leading hitter with a .417 average after 37
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the best hitter in the league right now, and we want to
get him in there as much as we can,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the rain day might cause a reorganization of the
Rockies' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Astacio, who had been scheduled to start Thursday, was
pushed back to Friday's series opener at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Notes: To clear a roster spot for Jones, the Mets optioned LHP
Bill Pulspher (0-2) to their Triple-A affiliate at Norfolk of the
International League. ... Valentine was pleased the game didn't
start and then stop. ... Rockies have already played one makeup
doubleheader and filled an off-day at St. Louis. They have two more
doubleheaders scheduled as the result of rain.

<HEADLINE> Court: Francois cannot plead and avoid death penalty  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The death penalty trial of Kendall Francois
for strangling eight women in the Poughkeepsie area will proceed
following a ruling by the state's highest court, Dutchess County
District Attorney William Grady said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Court of Appeals decided 7-0 Thursday that Francois
was barred from pleading guilty in the case in December 1998
because Grady had not yet decided whether he was going to seek the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Grady said a hearing is scheduled for June 14 before Dutchess
County Court Judge Thomas Dolan. At that time, the timing of
Francois' trial will become clearer, Grady said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 1995 capital punishment statute gives prosecutors
120 days after a suspect's arraignment to decide whether to seek
the death penalty. One day after Francois tried to enter his guilty
plea, Grady filed notice that he would seek Francois' execution.
</P>
<P>
   Francois' lawyers were trying to take advantage of a Court of
Appeals' ruling in December 1998 in another death penalty case
which they interpreted as opening the door to such pleas.
</P>
<P>
   But the Court of Appeals said Thursday it is the prosecutors'
call during the 120-day period and that a defendant ''does not have
an unqualified right to plead guilty to the entire indictment'' in
the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   To decide otherwise, Judge Howard Levine wrote, would lead to an
''unseemly race to the courthouse between defense and prosecution
to see whether a guilty plea or notice of intent to seek the death
penalty will be filed first.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be contrary to the ''thorough, fully deliberative
decision-making'' that prosecutors should engage in when weighing
whether to seek the death penalty, Levine wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan refused to accept Francois plea in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Francois is accused of strangling eight women and stashing their
bodies in the Poughkeepsie home he shared with his family in an
alleged 22-month killing spree. He was arrested in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Grady said the court wrote a broadly worded decision to guide
future instances where defendants might use a plea to avoid the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision in essence closes the door with regard to any
future attempts by defendants to enter pleas in advance of either
the 120-day period running or the district attorney filing his
death notice,'' Grady said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Harris, Francois' lead attorney from the state Capital
Defender Office, said he was disappointed in the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that some issues still remain and we'll just
continue on with the fight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible Francois can appeal in federal court on claims
that his U.S. constitutional rights were violated.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Clayton, Curtis Feuding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas Rangers shortstop Royce Clayton
took his feud with teammate Chad Curtis public on Thursday in
Clayton's diary for the Athletesdirect.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton and Curtis have feuded throughout the season over the
music played in the Rangers clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   A story headlined ''Cancer in the clubhouse'' and attributed to
Clayton said: ''We were a team that had a good atmosphere. A team
that won the West two years ago, a team that had great chemistry in
which everybody got along. That feeling is gone in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may overcome this problem or the problem will be the demise
of the ballclub. This is all due to one person and his self pride,
not respecting the rights of others. I respect the rights of my
teammates and the authority of my manager so I will not take any
active role in playing music in the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said Curtis was unfriendly the first time the players
met in spring training and they have no relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis was acquired by Texas in an offseason trade with the New
York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't stoop so low as to talk about Chad as a person because
it is not my purpose to judge anyone,'' Clayton wrote. ''In fact, I
don't give a damn about Chad. What I have a problem with is the
lack of respect he brings to the clubhouse. But maybe this
situation will teach us all how to get along with each other.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson, Davis Break Meet Records  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Lawrence Johnson, using the Gatorade
Classic as a tuneup for the U.S. Olympic trials, broke his own meet
record in the pole vault Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The former American record-holder and 1996 Olympian had a vault
of 18 feet, 10\ inches, which bettered his old mark of 18-6}, set
in 1994. Tim Mack, competing unattached, took second at 18-4{.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very windy,'' Johnson said. ''We were working on
stabilizing the technical aspects. As far as that is concerned, it
was a solid performance. The wind made it hard, but I'm pretty
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he's confident as he prepares for the Olympic
Trials on July 17 in Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to Atlanta for the Georgia Tech Invitational and
then I will train hard for three weeks,'' he said. ''I'm shooting
for 19-10. It's just a matter of coming out and having nice
conditions. Technically, everything is in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquis Davis of Memphis Elite Track Club broke the meet record
in the 200 meters with a time of 20.27 seconds. The previous record
of 20.30 was held by Harvey McSwain of North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   In women's competition, Tracy Carrington, competing unattached,
broke her own meet record in the pole vault at 13-0\. She set the
old record of 12-6} last year.
</P>
<P>
   The meet was billed as a last-chance NCAA qualifier and several
athletes took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Matt Rush earned an automatic qualifying mark in the
110 hurdles with a time of 13.58. Dwayne Wallace won the event in
13.37. Tennessee's Pat Buckheit earned a provisional mark in the
decathlon with a score of 7,354 points.
</P>
<P>
   Three runners earned provisional spots in the 3,000
steeplechase. Notre Dame's Luke Watson won in 8:46.77, Eastern
Kentucky's James Mutusi was second in 8:47.57 and Virginia
Commonwealth's Alberto Vicente was third in 8:47.60.
</P>
<P>
   Women's provisional qualifiers included Lutricia Purham of
Southeast Missouri State and Andrea Pappas of Tennessee in the shot
put. Purham had a mark of 50-6} and Pappas followed at 49-5.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Barber and Rodena Barr of South Carolina posted
provisional times in the 100. Barber won in 11.46 and Barr was

<HEADLINE> Tigers, Indians Postponed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- After sloshing through four innings then
waiting 2 hours, 37 minutes through a delay Thursday night, the
Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians were rained out.
</P>
<P>
   No makeup date was announced. The Tigers return to Cleveland on
June 23 for a four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit was leading 5-0 when the game was delayed in the middle
of the fourth inning at 8:33 p.m. EDT. The rain barely let up, but
umpire crew chief Jim McKean still waited until 11:10 before
finally calling it.
</P>
<P>
   It's the just the kind of luck the Tigers have been having all
year. Detroit, whose 12-25 record is baseball's worst, was leading
Kansas City 3-0 on May 9 and had another possible win rained out
after three innings.
</P>
<P>
   And Detroit, just 7-32 at Jacobs Field since 1994, was finally
catching the Indians on a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland had to place three pitchers -- starters Jaret Wright
and Charles Nagy and reliever Ricardo Rincon -- on the 15-day
disabled list Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sanders, recalled earlier in the day from Triple-A
Buffalo, started for Cleveland and gave up back-to-back homers in
the first to Luis Polonia and Gregg Jefferies before being pulled
with two outs in the second. Polonia was 3-for-3 through three
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians open a three-game series on Friday against the New
York Yankees while the Tigers go to Boston for three games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cleveland manager Charlie Manuel, back for his first game
since May 5 after undergoing colon surgery, wasn't going to spend
any time feeling sorry for the Indians. ''Whatever we've got, we've
got,'' he said of their injury mess. ''I'm not going to sit here
and cry and moan. You've got to play with what you've got. Do we
like it? No.'' ... Before the game was called, the consecutive
homers by Polonia and Jefferies were the first to open a game by
the Tigers since Aug. 5, 1986, when they did it against Cleveland.
... Detroit's Deivi Cruz hit a foul ball in the third inning that
broke a broadcast booth window behind home plate.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 8, Orioles 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- David Segui hit a go-ahead, three-run
homer that capped a six-run sixth inning Thursday night as the
Texas Rangers rallied to beat the Baltimore Orioles 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lamb had three doubles and Frank Catalanotto had three hits
for the Rangers (21-20), who have won four straight and seven of
nine, putting themselves over .500 for the first time since April
15 (6-5).
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, which has lost 13 of 15, took a 7-2 lead into the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto extended his streak of consecutive at-bats with hits
to a team-record 10 with a third-inning single, then grounded out
in the fourth. He had a two-run single off starter Sidney Ponson in
the sixth, and Rafael Palmeiro had an RBI single off B.J. Ryan
(1-3) that made it 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Segui hit Ryan's first pitch into the left-center field bullpen
for an 8-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling (6-1) won his fourth straight decision despite
allowing seven runs, 10 hits and four walks in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland pitched a perfect ninth for his eighth save in 11
chances and tied Jeff Montgomery for ninth place on the career list
at 304.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson allowed six runs and 10 hits in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle's RBI groundout and Harold Baines' run-scoring
double gave Baltimore a 2-0 lead in the first, and the Orioles made
it 4-0 in the second on Brady Anderson's RBI single and Delino
DeShields' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Texas got a run in the second on Royce Clayton's RBI single and
another in the third on Chad Curtis' run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Myers hit his first homer of the season in the fourth, then
drew a bases-loaded walk in the fifth for a 6-2 lead. Brady
Anderson homered in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With a first-inning single, Catalanotto set a Rangers
record with his ninth consecutive hit. Three Rangers shared the
previous mark of eight, including Ivan Rodriguez in 1993.
Catalanotto reached base 12 consecutive times, breaking the old
club mark of 11 set by Todd Zeile in 1998. ... Lamb tied a team
record with three doubles. The feat has been accomplished 15 times.
... Rodriguez was replaced in the starting lineup by C Bill
Haselman as manager Johnny Oates gave the defending AL MVP the
night off for only the sixth time this season. ... Myers' homer was
only his second hit of the season.

<HEADLINE> Assembly Democrats say legislative process on hold  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albany, N.Y. (AP) -- It is still unclear who would come out on
top of a power struggle between the state Assembly's speaker and
former majority leader, but one thing is already certain.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber's Democrats say the battle between Speaker Sheldon
Silver and Assemblyman Michael Bragman would effectively halt the
legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Robin Schimminger, who supports Silver, said
Bragman's move to oust the speaker would ''result in one piece of
the government being chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This ensures gridlock in the state government,'' the Erie
County Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman John McEneny of Albany, also a Silver backer, said
there is a ''ton of legislation,'' ranging from smaller,
district-specific items to the larger bills with statewide impacts,
that needs to be considered before the current session ends. He
called Bragman's move ''divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The big-ticket items ... those things really require party
leadership so you can hammer out and move it forward. It becomes
more difficult when you have no unity,'' McEneny said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the togetherness that Democrats displayed Tuesday in
nominating Hillary Rodham Clinton for U.S. Senate was ''very rare''
among Assembly members who came from different geographic, ethnic
and philosophical backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We OD'd on unity,'' he said of Bragman going public the day
after the convention with his bid to overthrow Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Steven Sanders of Manhattan said the action ''throws
an enormous monkey wrench into the whole process.'' Sanders is a
Silver partisan.
</P>
<P>
   A shift in power from Silver to Bragman would also mean that for
the first time in more than 80 years, a Democratic speaker would
come from outside New York City. Silver is from Manhattan while
Bragman represents a district near Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said Bragman is an ''upstate conservative'' who has ''an
antagonistic view'' toward issues that downstate constituents
support, like rent regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Another downstate Silver supporter, Thomas DiNapoli of Nassau
County, said the ''geographic back-and-forth'' argument is ''moot
because Shelly will be the speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The real tragedy is that the people's business has to take a
back seat to this internal battle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God the budget's over with,'' said Assemblyman William
Magee, who supports Bragman. ''I don't expect any bills to be
passed the next week. This is an issue that needs to be addressed
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Magee, who represents Oneida, said he will not regret his
decision even if Silver retaliates by removing him as chairman of
the Assembly agriculture committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that's the case, that's the case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders have picked the week of June 12 as the last
of the 2000 regular session, though Silver has never regarded such
dates as hard-and-fast deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's leadership struggle with Bragman, plus Tuesday's
Democratic convention in Albany, effectively caused work this week
in the Assembly to grind to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he plans to formally move against Silver on Monday,
but that could merely trigger a longer battle before Assembly
Democrats decide whom their speaker will be.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Bragman supporters -- Martin Luster of Ithaca and
Ronald Tocci of Westchester County -- were stripped of their
committee chairmanships Thursday by Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Luster said losing the chairmanship and taking sides doesn't
change the dynamics within the party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have friends on both sides, and we have made a point that we
remain friends. There is no acrimony,'' Luster said. ''There will
be changes no matter what the outcome is. Changes take time to
settle in.''

<HEADLINE> Court says Pataki did not violate law with ice storm gifts  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki's thank you gifts to
volunteer relief workers during the North Country ice storm of 1998
did not violate state laws or the constitution, a court has found.
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Division of state Supreme Court decided 5-0
Thursday that a challenge to the giveaways filed by government
spending critic Robert Schulz was unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, from Queensbury north of Albany, contended that Pataki
was illegally rewarding those who removed downed trees, delivered
food and water and otherwise helped residents when a wide swath of
northern New York was paralyzed by the January 1998 storm.
</P>
<P>
   The state organized parties to thank emergency workers in
Watertown and Plattsburgh, and also sent them two complimentary
lift tickets to the state's Whiteface Mountain ski center in the
Adirondacks and two passes to the State Fair in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   About 40,000 tickets were distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz argued that the tickets represented impermissible gifts
at public expense to the recipients. He also contended that the
mailings were thinly veiled promotional materials for Pataki --
again at public expense -- who was facing re-election that year.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court found neither argument persuasive. The judges
said no state taxpayer money was expended by the free tickets at
Whiteface Mountain or the State Fair. While a ''small portion'' of
the cost of mailing out the tickets was picked up by Pataki's
office, the judges said ''that his was a reasonable expenditure
consistent with the goal of disaster preparedness.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges also said the materials under Pataki's name were not
designed to advance his political fortunes, but the governor's
''intention to thank members of the public who came forward and
rendered assistance during an emergency situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We find no interference with the right to a free election,''
the court said in a ruling written by Justice Anthony Cardona.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said it should have been obvious
that the giveaways were appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was done as a gesture to all the volunteers to help their
neighbors,'' McKeon said. ''It shouldn't take a court to make it
clear that was an appropriate thing to do. Unfortunately, that was
what it came down to.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz said he had no comment after reading Thursday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling upholds a decision by a state Supreme Court
justice in Albany in February 1999.

<HEADLINE> Indians Place Three Pitchers on DL  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Just when the Cleveland Indians thought they
were finally healthy -- they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitchers Jaret Wright and Charles Nagy, and reliever
Ricardo Rincon were all placed on the 15-day disabled list
Thursday, just hours before the Indians got back manager Charlie
Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy will undergo surgery Friday to remove bone chips in his
right elbow and will be out 6-8 weeks. Rincon has bone spurs in his
left elbow and surgery could keep him out until July or August,
''at least'' said Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   Wright has a muscle strain in his right shoulder, and won't be
eligible to come off the DL until next week. He is scheduled to
start May 27 at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the welcome back Manuel was hoping for. And it was
another bad break for the Indians, who had just started playing
well after briefly dropping into second place in the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   ''First I heard one pitcher, and then two pitchers and it ended
up being three,'' said Manuel, who was coming back from colon
surgery. ''I said, 'You've got to be kidding me. But that's the way
it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday actually ended on a positive note for Cleveland.
The Indians and Detroit Tigers were rained out, allowing Manuel to
rest his pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   For the woeful Tigers, it was just more bad luck. It was the
second time this season they led a game that was eventually
postponed by rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not a doggone thing you can do about it,'' Tigers
manager Phil Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians raided their Triple-A Buffalo farm team for pitching
help, recalling Scott Sanders, Jim Brower and Mark Watson.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI performed on Wright late Wednesday night revealed a
strained right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a problem. Think about it -- 40 percent of your rotation
gone in 30 minutes,'' Indians owner Larry Dolan said Thursday.
''But how long will they be gone? This is a team of resilience. I
think the depth is there to handle these missteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan's comments came before he learned of the loss of Rincon,
Cleveland's most consistent reliever this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll guess we'll find out how good we are,'' catcher Sandy
Alomar said.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy's surgery will end a remarkable run of consistency for the
33-year-old, who hasn't missed a start since 1993. But when Nagy
started the season 2-4 with a 7.19 ERA, Manuel knew something was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were times when Charlie's velocity would be between 87
and 90 mph, and other times when it was between 82 and 85,'' Manuel
said. ''I wondered why there was such a big gap at times. But I
didn't really know until Charlie started slinging the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy has won at least 15 games in each of the past five seasons,
and has pitched his turn in the starting rotation since starting
the season finale on Oct. 3, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who had been released by the Indians this spring before
signing a minor league contract with the club, was signed to a
contract for the remainder of this season and started Thursday
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up back-to-back homers in the first inning, but ended up
getting a no-decision thanks to the rainout.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have contributed to Cleveland's early-season struggles
this year. The Indians have already had All-Stars Bartolo Colon,
Alomar and Kenny Lofton on the DL, and they lost center fielder
Jacob Cruz to a season-ending knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something we're going to have to play our way
through,'' said Manuel, who said he feels fine and looked better
following his second surgery since February. ''
</P>
<P>
   Wright has pitched well this year, bouncing back from a dreadful
1999 season. He allowed just four hits in 7 2-3 innings of his last
start on May 11 against Kansas City, but left with tightness in his
right shoulder after throwing 100 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he went a little bit too far,'' Alomar said. ''One
pitch can cost you your career.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, 3-2 with a 3.15 ERA in seven starts, was on the DL twice
last year with a strained muscle in his right shoulder. The Indians
insist the current problem is not related to last year's injury.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nagy, Rincon hid his elbow troubles from the Indians. But
despite having soreness in his arm for the past month, Rincon went
2-0 with a 0.96 ERA in 16 games and didn't allow an inherited
runner to score.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pitched with my heart, not my arm,'' said Rincon, who was
going to keep his injury a secret until his arm started feeling
worse in a relief appearance Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who pitched for the Chicago Cubs last season, had a
rough spring camp and was cut by the Indians before they grabbed
him for insurance. At Buffalo, he was 3-1 with a 3.61 ERA in seven
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Brower went 5-2 with a 3.94 ERA in eight starts at Buffalo. He
pitched in nine games for the Indians last year as a late-season
callup. He'll be used in long relief this time but could make a
start.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I'll wait my turn,'' he said looking around the
Indians clubhouse. ''I guess a lot of guys are waiting.''

<HEADLINE> Silver and Bragman countinue battle over Assembly's top job  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and
his deposed majority leader, Michael Bragman, both claim to have
what the other one wants -- enough support among their Democratic
colleagues to be top dog in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan Democrat Silver retaliated Thursday against supporters
of the ongoing coup attempt by Bragman.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, the leader of the Assembly majority's more conservative
upstate wing, called the moves by his fellow Democrat
''intolerable'' and accused Silver of having a leadership style
that was ''secretive and aloof.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver spokeswoman Patricia Lynch said her boss was solidly in
control.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, supporters of the Manhattan Democrat were working
the telephones furiously behind the scenes in an attempt to turn
back the Bragman challenge.
</P>
<P>
   That effort appeared to pay off, at least to some extent, when
Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Democratic cdhairman of the Bronx,
announced Thursday night that he was backing Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am absolutely, unequivocally, 100 percent behind Speaker
Sheldon Silver,'' Ramirez said, adding that the 10-member Bronx
Democratic delegation to the Assembly appeared to be in agreement
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman went public with his coup attempt on Wednesday, saying
he planned to formally make his move Monday when the Assembly
reconvenes. Silver immediately stripped Bragman of the majority
leader's title.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Silver stripped two veteran members of the Assembly
of their committee chairmanships for supporting Bragman. In losing
their chairmanships, Martin Luster of Ithaca and Ronald Tocci of
Westchester County also lost the $12,500 stipends that go with the
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman called it an attempt to intimidate Assembly members that
would backfire and bring him even more support. The Syracuse-area
Democrat said it was also a sign Silver was ''absolutely
panic-stricken.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sitting here this morning with 50 rock-solid (Democratic)
votes,'' he added. That would give the majority leader the
advantage within the 98-member Democratic majority in the
150-member house that will decide on Bragman's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, neither Bragman nor Silver would release lists of
their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman did charge that in the current leadership battle Silver
''has surrounded himself with paid lobbyists and other
non-legislators who are seeking to influence members on how to vote
on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman's charge came as several powerful New York labor union
leaders, including state AFL-CIO President Denis Hughes, issued a
statement saying ''a divisive battle for the speakership at this
time is counterproductive.'' The statement did not specifically
endorse Silver.
</P>
<P>
   But just minutes later, a revised statement was issued by the
same labor leaders in which the claim that a leadership battle
would be counterproductive was removed. A spokesman for Hughes said
the first statement had been issued in error. The second statement
took no position on the wisdom of having a leadership fight.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman indicated he was being supported in his effort by state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I am concerned, Carl and I are partners,'' Bragman
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said he was not helping either Silver or Bragman and that
when Assembly members called asking for advice, ''I'm telling them
that they've got to make a decision about what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George Pataki offered a similarly neutral stance
when current state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno moved
successfully to oust Ralph Marino as the GOP leader of the Senate
over the Thanksgiving Day weekend in 1994. At the time, the Pataki
statement was viewed by many Republicans as the go-ahead for GOP
senators to join the revolt against Marino.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the current situation was different. ''I'm not the
governor. I don't have that kind of influence ... I'm not involved.
It doesn't help me to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall, who is preparing for a run for governor in 2002, is the
only black ever elected to statewide office in New York and has
great sway with the Assembly's black lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the battle between Silver and Bragman stems at least in
part from the former majority leader's backing of McCall's
gubernatorial effort over federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo's
possible run for the job his father, Mario Cuomo, lost to Pataki in
1994. Silver has been widely seen as a Cuomo supporter.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation Thursday that should it be evident by
Monday that Silver doesn't have the votes to remain as speaker,
some other Assembly Democrat from New York City may step forward to
challenge Bragman for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a Democratic speaker of the Assembly from
outside New York City in more than 80 years. Should Bragman get the
job it would mean the city wouldn't have one of its own in the room
when Pataki, Bruno and the Assembly speaker negotiate budget deals
and other major issues.

<HEADLINE> National media blitz unveiled as part of Buffalo economic development plan </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Hoping to shake their city's snowy,
past-its-prime reputation, Buffalo business leaders will launch a
national media campaign as part of a well-financed plan to attract
50,000 new jobs and $1 billion in private investment over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in August, image-building ads on CNN, CNBC, the Wall
Street Journal and sponsorships on National Public Radio will
spotlight a work force that includes 125,000 underemployed workers
and 100,000 college students.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign unveilled Thursday even tries to calm Buffalo
weather fears by pointing out that the city enjoys more sun than
Atlanta, Ga., and less rain than Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are one element of a five-pronged economic development
plan crafted by the Buffalo Niagara Enterprise, a business-led
coalition formed last year with the goal of encouraging businesses
to invest in the eight westernmost counties of New York and
southern Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition members, which include local municipalities and
private businesses like HSBC Bank, the Buffalo Bills and Moog Inc.,
have committed $27 million over the next five years, making the
effort the largest non-state-funded initiative of its kind in North
America, according to Ted Levine, chairman of the consulting group
steering the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's appreciation of well-paying jobs and abundance of
college students should be attractive to employers frustrated by
high turnover and a lack of qualified applicants, said Levine,
whose Development Counsellors International specializes in
recruiting businesses for client regions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Buffalo has a lot to offer and if we say it and promote it
with a single voice, we'll succeed,'' Mayor Anthony Masiello said.
</P>
<P>
   Initial marketing efforts will focus on three growth-oriented
sectors: information technology, medical manufacturing and call
centers/back office operations.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's tag line will be: ''I am Buffalo Niagara.
Available. Productive. People.''
</P>
<P>
   A simultaneous internal marketing effort will be aimed at
building self-esteem among local business owners and employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those of us who live and work in this region are the
stakeholders,'' said BNE president Thomas Kucharski. ''We want to
put some tangible, substantive information in front of the local
community so we can dispel many of the misconceptions about our
region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Niagara Enterprise was launched last year by local
business executives following the lead of counterparts elsewhere
who have found success with similar efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realize that an advertising campaign won't create 50,000
new jobs,'' said Doug Bean, managing partner of Eric Mower and
Associates, the advertising agency that developed the campaign.
''It's all part of a much more comprehensive game plan.''

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Seeks Joint Team With North  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's proposal to form a joint
soccer team with North Korea for international competition will
depend on the success of an upcoming inter-Korea summit.
</P>
<P>
   Chung Mong-joon, head of South Korea's Football Association,
said he would like to visit North Korea to discuss the issue. The
Asian Football Confederation overwhelmingly approved Chung's
proposal that the two Koreas field a unified team at this year's
Asia Cup competition, scheduled for n Lebanon in October.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has earned a berth in that tournament, while North
Korea was eliminated in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   If the two Koreas can field a single team for the Asian Cup,
that would help them form another unified team for the 2002 World
Cup, which will be co-hosted by Japan and South Korea, Chung said.
FIFA, soccer's governing body, has taken a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is willing to share with North Korea some of the 32
World Cup games it is scheduled to stage in 2002. The other 32
games will be in Japan, including the final.

<HEADLINE> Fox Relies on Big Names For Comeback  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Even though he hasn't shot a roll of film for
his new Fox series, ''Boston Public,'' Emmy-winning producer David
E. Kelley asked advertisers to take it on faith that it will be
good.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the best thing I have ever done,'' Kelley said Thursday.
''You can believe that, looking at me -- the man who gave you
'Snoops.'''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisers -- and maybe a few Fox executives -- laughed
nervously at the reference to his failed ABC series from last year.
Fox, in introducing its fall schedule, is banking on big-name
creators to fuel a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Kelley, creator of ''Ally McBeal'' and ''The Practice,''
Fox has signed ''Titanic'' producer James Cameron, ''The X-Files''
creator Chris Carter, ''ER'' creator Michael Crichton and ''The
Blair Witch Project'' producer Gregg Hale to make some of its nine
new series this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, which slumped badly in the ratings this year, announced the
biggest makeover of any broadcast network this week. It is facing
uncertainty with the retirement of its long-running shows,
''Beverly Hills 90210'' and ''Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   One note of stability was a last-minute deal for ''The X-Files''
to return for an eighth season, although actor David Duchovny's
agent Mulder will be a part-timer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UPN announced that it was adding three new series and
picking up ''The Hughleys'' after it was canceled by ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Fox reached separate deals with Carter and Duchovny to continue.
Co-star Gillian Anderson was already contracted for another year.
Duchovny's deal, completed Wednesday, calls for him to film 11
episodes, or half the 22 new episodes that most series film each
year.
</P>
<P>
   That enabled Fox to keep intact its Sunday schedule, its most
successful night of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will also carry ''The Lone Gunmen,'' a spinoff of ''The
X-Files'' created by Carter, on Thursdays next season. It will be
paired with a Crichton-created drama that does not have a title or
cast yet. Appearing before advertisers on Thursday, Crichton
wouldn't offer a hint of what the series is about.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is giving Carter and Crichton extra time, and won't debut
the Thursday schedule until the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Mondays are being turned over entirely to Kelley. ''Boston
Public,'' follows a group of teachers working at a high school in
suburban Boston. It will be followed by ''Ally McBeal,'' his
returning series about a group of lawyers working at a firm in
downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron is producing ''Dark Angel,'' a science-fiction adventure
series set in ''post-apocalyptic America.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox returns two comedies whose midseason successes were among
the network's only bright spots this year, ''Malcolm in the
Middle'' and ''Titus.'' One new comedy is ''Don't Ask,'' which
stars John Goodman as a gay dad.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from Fox's schedule is the game show ''Greed,'' which was
quickly put together to capitalize on the success of ''Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire.'' Fox has also canceled ''Time of Your Life,''
''Get Real'' and ''Family Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN recovered from a near-death experience this year to surge
past its archrival, the WB, in the ratings. It was almost entirely
because of its new Thursday night World Wrestling Federation
franchise, which will return.
</P>
<P>
   The network adds two new series on Friday nights: ''Freedom,''
an action series made by ''Matrix'' producer Joel Silver, and
''Level 9,'' a drama about an FBI unit trained to hunt down
high-tech criminals. Both series are trying to grab the young male
audience that is UPN's target.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are proud to be known as the guy network,'' said UPN chief
executive Dean Valentine. ''Somebody needs to stand up for the
high-testosterone American male.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in February, UPN said it will broadcast games of the
new XFL football league created by the World Wrestling Federation.
NBC is broadcasting XFL games on Saturday nights. UPN also plans to
produce a weekly rap music countdown series with the hip-hop
magazine The Source.
</P>
<P>
   UPN is canceling ''Dilbert,'' ''The Beat,'' ''Malcolm &AMP; Eddie,''
''The Grown-Ups'' and ''I Dare You.''

<HEADLINE> Arsonist Feared in Fla. Neighborhood  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- During the last decade, tens of millions of
dollars have gone into restoring Tampa Heights, a once grand
neighborhood and home to city founders that had fallen into decay.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of celebrating its rebirth, city officials and
residents are trying to ensure the neighborhood doesn't go up in
flames.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, 36 fires have been set in Tampa Heights and
neighboring sections of Ybor City, near downtown. The targets have
been abandoned and occupied homes, a church and an upscale
apartment complex under construction that's intended to be one of
the area's anchor developments.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been injured, but some of the fires have been set at
night in homes where people were sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been sleeping two or three hours a night,'' said Dave
Davis, who has spent the last five years renovating a 1912 home.
''Every time the dog barks I'm looking out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has formed a task force with state and federal arson
investigators. Without even a description of a suspect they have
little to go on.
</P>
<P>
   The arsons have been a blow to city leaders who've pushed to
rebuild neighborhoods where an eclectic mix of homes and brick
streets built from the 1890s to 1920s turned in recent years into
the turf of drug dealers and prostitutes. Young professionals have
been lured to restore the historic homes with the help of
government tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Only one person has been arrested, for the most recent fire in a
vacant home Tuesday. But task force investigators do not believe
the man, Carl Lester Simms, is responsible for the other fires.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Serrales, a real estate agent, said the area still holds
promise of becoming a desirable neighborhood despite the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of negative that there's an arsonist in the area,
it's a little frightening and scary,'' he said. ''But it's also
helped Tampa Heights, it's put it on the map. People see it on
television and see the beautiful houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Noriega, the mayor's top aide on redevelopment issues,
said the fires aren't scaring away those willing to invest in
redevelopment -- yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been an uphill battle,'' he said. ''There are a lot of
urban pioneers who have made a lifetime investment there. There are
appraisers going out there, lenders taking a look. Although they
say they don't worry, I'm sure they do.''
</P>
<P>
   When the fires first began, the neighborhoods buzzed with
theories on who is responsible. Some blamed owners of ramshackle
houses or the city, thinking they did it to save the cost of
tearing down houses. Others speculated it was residents who felt
shoved aside by monied newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Noriega dismisses such theories, saying it costs no more to haul
away a dilapidated house as it does to haul away the burned
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a person who is really sick,'' Noriega said of the
arsonist. ''I hope the neighborhood doesn't get him before the
authorities do. There isn't going to be much left of him.''

<HEADLINE> Leader of Supremacy Church Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Mo. (AP) -- The leader of a white-supremacist
religious sect has been charged with abducting six of his
grandchildren from North Dakota several years ago and hiding them
at his Missouri farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Since the pastor was arrested Wednesday, the children, ages 9
through 16, have refused to leave the farmhouse, engaging in a
standoff with authorities on the property. Negotiations entered a
third day today.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of our officers have been in the house. Our approach is
not to push this,'' Missouri Highway Patrol spokesman Lou Wehmer
said. ''We just want to get them back home in the least destructive
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Steve Bartlett said the children may be armed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no plans to rush in there,'' he said. ''We are taking
our time with this so that everyone makes it out safely.''
</P>
<P>
   John Schneider, the U.S. attorney in North Dakota, said his
office and the FBI have suspected for some time that the children
were being held somewhere in Missouri. But it wasn't until about
three months ago that ''we had the first real indication'' of their
whereabouts, he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The farmhouse is on a 300-acre ranch belonging to the Rev.
Gordon Winrod, 73, pastor of Our Savior's Church in Gainesville, in
southwestern Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have linked the church to the Christian Identity
movement, which considers white Christians superior to nonwhites
and Jews. They said Winrod has sent out thousands of newsletters
around the country each year, often calling for the killing of
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Winrod, his son Steven Winrod, 33, and his daughter Carol
Winrod, 27, were arrested Wednesday, charged with six counts of
child abduction and held in the county jail on $500,000 bail
apiece. Authorities did not know whether the Winrods had an
attorney who could comment.
</P>
<P>
   They are accused of kidnapping the children from the youngsters'
fathers -- Winrod's former sons-in-law -- in North Dakota and hiding
them on the Missouri farm. The children were all allegedly
kidnapped in 1994 and 1995 after the fathers were awarded sole
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Winrod's other grandchildren were also abducted; they
were recently returned to their homes in North Dakota, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ozarks region in southwestern Missouri has become a hotbed
for the Christian Identity movement. Of the 102 Christian Identity
affiliates operating in 35 states nationwide, 14 are based in
Missouri and five in Illinois, officials say.

<HEADLINE> Reports: AG up for federal bench nomination  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- President Clinton is awaiting only the
results of a background check before announcing the nomination of
Richard Blumenthal for a seat on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals,
The Associated Press has learned.
</P>
<P>
   ''An announcement is expected in the very near future, within a
matter of days,'' said one source, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what we're being told by the White House,'' said a

</P>
<P>
   The normally media-friendly Blumenthal declined any comment
regarding the nomination at a news conference Thursday in which he
announced a settlement with a sweepstakes promoter.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in recent years that Blumenthal's name
has come up in connection with a seat on the federal bench. In
1997, the White House was close to sending his name up to Capitol
Hill for consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but
Blumenthal opted to run for a third term as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Pagani, spokesman for Republican Gov. John Rowland, said
the governor has not given any thought to a possible successor to
Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the attorney general is placed in nomination, I'm sure
people who are interested in taking over that job will be coming
out of the woodwork,'' Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
   Once nominated, Blumenthal would have to win the approval of the
Republican-controlled Senate in a presidential election year. The
high-profile Connecticut Democrat has been in the forefront of
actions against the tobacco industry and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Senate has confirmed seven judges, and six of
those were nominations made last year. There are 43 nominations
pending and 78 vacancies on federal courts across the country.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School, Blumenthal
was first elected attorney general in 1990. Before that he was a
member of the state Senate from 1987-1990, and the state House from
1984-1987. He was U.S. attorney for Connecticut from 1977-1981.

<HEADLINE> Schaghticokes file injunction over Paugussett application  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Schaghticoke Tribal Nation has asked a
federal court to force the government to consider its petition for
federal recognition at the same time as that of another tribe it
claims appropriated its ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogy is the critical factor the BIA must consider when
deciding tribal recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe contends another Connecticut tribe, the Golden Hill
Paugussetts, are listing Schaghticoke ancestors on their
application for recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are trying to steal Schaghticoke's genealogy. That's
exactly what it is, theft,'' said Schaghticoke Chief Richard Velky.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs is poised to rule on the Paugussett
petition, according to a request for a temporary restraining order
filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Schaghticoke recently learned that in GHP's petition
papers, to support its claim for recognition, GHP relies upon
certain genealogy, community and history that in fact belongs to
the Schaghticoke,'' the court documents state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Schaghticoke have asked the BIA to consider the two
petitions at the same time to resolve the conflicting claims,'' the
documents continue.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet Hawk, council chief of the Golden Hill Paugussetts, said
he believed the Schaghticoke's are ''trying to jump on the Golden
Hill bandwagon'' and are claiming common ancestry in order to avoid
what could be an eight-year wait before their own petition for
recognition is heard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it disheartening to find that another Indian tribe
would engage in Indian bashing because of their own problems with
the federal government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Velky said the Golden Hill Paugussetts are claiming they can
trace their heritage back to Gideon Mauwee. Born in 1687, Mauwee is
the first recorded leader or sachem of the Schaghticoke, Velky
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the overlap ''if for some reason or another the BIA
should find them to be a tribe and they took away Schaghticoke's
ancestry, then what happens when it's our turn?'' asked Velky,
whose state-recognized tribe lives on a 400-acre reservation in
Kent and has claims to nearly 4,000 acres of land nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The Schaghticokes applied for federal recognition more than six
years ago. The tribe said it has been three years since the BIA
formally accepted the application.
</P>
<P>
   BIA officials could not be reached for comment. Phone calls were
left with a bureau spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the request for a temporary restraining order is
expected early next week.
</P>
<P>
   If recognized ''we have no intentions of putting a casino on the
reservation in Kent,'' Velky said.
</P>
<P>
   In March the BIA recommended federal recognition of the Eastern
Pequot and Paucatuck Eastern Pequot tribes, which share 224-acre
reservation in North Stonington.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has two other federally recognized tribes, the
Mashantucket Pequots and Mohegans. Both tribes operates highly
successful casinos in southern Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Sentencing postponed in Yale child porn case  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A Yale University professor convicted on
child pornography charges has been given more time to prepare for
his sentencing hearing while a federal judge considers a defense
motion to dismiss one of the counts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Alvin Thompson on Thursday dismissed
the prosecution's motion to revoke the bond for Antonio Lasaga, 50,
saying the defendant was entitled to the freedom needed to prepare
his presentation for the sentencing hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be candid...he has a lot of persuading to do,'' Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomspon postponed sentencing and did not set a date.
</P>
<P>
   Lasaga will remain under house arrest in his Cheshire home until
the sentencing. He wears an electronic monitoring bracelet when he
leaves his home to get religious and psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Lasaga in February accepted a plea bargain where he admitted to
federal charges of downloading tens of thousands of child
pornography images from the Internet and making two pornographic
videos of a preteen boy on the Yale campus.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, William Dow, is seeking to dismiss a charge of
possessing pornography stemming from possession of two videotapes
based on a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling. He has until Tuesday
to submit a brief and federal prosecutors have until Friday to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   To prove the charges, prosecutors had to show the images were
child pornography and had been transported across state lines, from
foreign countries or had not been manufactured in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   A sentencing date has not been set. Lasaga could get up to 20
years in prison, three years of probation and $500,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Lasaga still faces a civil lawsuit and state charges, including
sexual assault, risk of injury to a minor and promoting a minor in
an obscene performance.
</P>
<P>
   Lasaga, a geology professor, has been on leave from Yale since
the charges surfaced in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, two counselors from the Yale Child Studies
Center testified that Lasaga's victim suffers from severe trauma,
is angry, has trouble communicating, does poorly in school and
lives in fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''He and his family have great difficulty in developing trust as
a direct result of this case,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Kari
Dooley.
</P>
<P>
   Two professors, one from Harvard, the other from Penn State,
testified for the defense. They praised Lasaga as a great
contributor to scholarship and to society.
</P>
<P>
   Lasaga taught chemistry at Harvard in the 1970s and became a
lecturer in 1976. The following year, he joined Penn State as an
assistant professor, becoming a full professor in 1983. He came to
Yale in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal announces $216,000 sweepstakes settlement  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut residents will be receiving
fewer pieces of mail declaring the may have won millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The state on Thursday announced a settlement with American
Family Publishers that will prohibit a sweepstakes promoter from
using deceptive language, or so-called ''winner statements,'' in
its mailings to Connecticut consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement includes the first court order in the nation to
enforce specific restrictions and provides $216,000 for refunds,
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Thursday. The state has
more than 500 complaints on file and officials suspect more than
20,000 Connecticut residents are eligible for refunds.
</P>
<P>
   ''No longer will AFP be able to tell unsuspecting consumers that
they are winners,'' said Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   American Family Enterprises, a joint venture that does business
as American Family Publishers, said the settlement was reached to
avoid extensive litigation. They did not admit wrongdoing . AFE
said it has awarded more than 300,000 prizes since 1977, including
$102 million in cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said the company has filed for bankruptcy but
mailings have continued.
</P>
<P>
   Many senior citizens lost thousands of dollars buying magazines
and other merchandise they didn't want in the belief the purchases
were needed to win the offered prize money, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also will be eligible for refunds from a $30 million
national, class action settlement reached earlier. Blumenthal said
anyone who feels they may have been duped is urged to call his
office for information on obtaining a refund.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was reached after the state filed a lawsuit
against the sweepstakes promoter that named TV personalities Ed
McMahon and Dick Clark, who acted as spokesmen for the sweepstakes.
The settlement bars AFP from using spokespersons to make
representations about the sweepstakes that do not comply with the
terms of the agreement, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the court order, AFP will stop using solicitations
containing large bold headlines implying the recipient has won a
grand prize, only to be followed by smaller print of conditions. In
the future, ''winner statements'' may be used only if they do not
contradict and are in the same font and typeface as statements that
follow, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also requires AFP to stop using the word
''finalist'' unless in fact the recipient is a finalist. The
sweepstakes promoter also must display the odds of winning,
information about possible refunds and other relevant information
in prominent print, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal vowed to continue pursuing similar lawsuits against
other sweepstakes promoters.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa announced a similar agreement Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Study: Antidepressant Affects Libido  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Preliminary results from an industry-funded study
found that an antidepressant increased sex drive in some women
whose libido was distressingly low.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of eight weeks, 15 of the 51 participants had
responded to the drug, with their condition rated as much improved.
</P>
<P>
   The women had not been depressed, but were diagnosed with
''hypoactive sexual desire disorder.'' More common in women than
men, it is marked by deficient or absent sexual fantasies and
desire for sex, causing the person distress.
</P>
<P>
   There are no exact figures on how common it is, but surveys find
at least 20 percent of women complain of a persisting lack of
sexual desire.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. R. Taylor Segraves of the Case Western University School of
Medicine in Cleveland led the preliminary study and presented
results Thursday at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric
Association. The work was financed by Glaxo Wellcome Inc., which
markets the drug as Wellbutrin SR.
</P>
<P>
   Segraves said the results show bupropion should get further
study for treating the sexual disorder, which comes from a variety
of causes, including early sex abuse, a troubled marriage and
hormonal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors use a variety of therapies, including psychotherapy and
testosterone injections. But they need more options, said Raymond
Rosen, director of the sexual pharmacology research unit at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The new study is ''a significant advance,'' said Rosen, who was
not involved in the work.
</P>
<P>
   Bupropion boosts the brain's production of dopamine, a chemical
messenger linked to sexual desire, Segraves said.
</P>
<P>
   Study participants, whose average age was 41, started to get the
drug after four weeks on a placebo. During that placebo phase, none
improved. But the women began responding as early as two weeks
after going on the antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   Women's interest in having sex increased from an average of
about one episode per two weeks at the end of the placebo phase to
2.3 episodes per two weeks by the end of their eight weeks on
bupropion. The average number of episodes of sexual arousal per two
weeks rose from 1.3 to 2.4, and of sexual fantasy from 0.7 to 1.8.
</P>
<P>
   Five women stopped taking the drug because they developed a rash
or hives.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Goalie Makes a Classic Save  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Patrik Elias had a tie game on his
stick until Brian Boucher's glove changed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Elias didn't get the short-handed goal and the New Jersey Devils
never caught the Philadelphia Flyers on Thursday night in a 4-2
loss in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils left wing roared in on a breakaway, with teammate
Claude Lemieux off for high-sticking. He worked around Boucher's
attempted poke check and was incredibly denied on a short wrist
shot that stayed on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got lucky there,'' Boucher said of his save, while lying
flat on his back, that protected a 2-1 lead 1:30 into the second
period. ''He made a pretty good move. If it gave our team a boost,
then great.''
</P>
<P>
   As Boucher tried to knock the puck away from Elias, the forward
cut left and tried to slip the puck past the rookie goalie. Boucher
flipped onto his back, and his outstretched arm blindly kept
Philadelphia's 2-1 lead in tact.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just desperation,'' Boucher said. ''You feel like
you're beat when you miss him with the poke check. There's nothing
left, you can't get it with your legs. ''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers would go up by two goals minutes later and now lead
the best-of-seven series 2-1 -- with Game 4 on Saturday night again
at Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think at the time what impact it will have on a game
or a series,'' Boucher said. ''I just try and do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck was not on New Jersey's side. The Devils were playing
without rookie John Madden, the NHL's leader this season with six
short-handed goals. Madden injured his knee in the Devils' 4-3 loss
in Game 2 and will miss the remainder of this series.
</P>
<P>
   Elias did everything right on the play, except put the puck into
the net.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a breakaway. I didn't score, that's it,'' said Elias,
still frustrated following the game. ''That was his only chance to
save that -- with that hand. It was good sense on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did it keep the Flyers in front, it led to an
all-important Game 3 victory for the team that has been rallying
all season long.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want to be making saves like that all the time,''
Boucher said. ''You need to be more controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher was content to let others marvel at his work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen a lot of hockey games in the NHL, that was top five
I have ever seen,'' said Flyers forward Rick Tocchet, who scored at
7:15 of the second to give Philadelphia a 3-1 lead. ''You have to
put everything, the pressure, the big game. Put that all together
and it's one of the top five saves I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Primeau, who had two assists, including setting up
Tocchet's goal, was also impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got such great composure for such a young goaltender,''
Primeau said. ''Nothing seems to rattle him.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Clayton, Curtis Make Peace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas Rangers shortstop Royce Clayton
took his feud with teammate Chad Curtis public on Thursday in
Clayton's diary for a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the urging of manager Johnny Oates, Clayton apologized
to Curtis a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton and Curtis have feuded throughout the season over the
music played in the Rangers clubhouse. The players argued over that
and other matters six weeks ago, and have avoided each other since
then.
</P>
<P>
   A story headlined ''Cancer in the clubhouse'' and attributed to
Clayton was posted on Athletesdirect.com and said: ''We were a team
that had a good atmosphere. A team that won the West two years ago,
a team that had great chemistry in which everybody got along. That
feeling is gone in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may overcome this problem or the problem will be the demise
of the ballclub. This is all due to one person and his self pride,
not respecting the rights of others. I respect the rights of my
teammates and the authority of my manager so I will not take any
active role in playing music in the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Rangers' 8-7 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on
Thursday night, Oates got the two players together.
</P>
<P>
   ''They went face to face after the game and settled it,'' Oates
said. ''You don't have to go to dinner with your teammates but you
have to be in the same clubhouse. They didn't hug and shake hands,
but it won't linger. It's over. These guys don't have to see eye to
eye. They don't have to be buddy-buddy, but they'll pull for each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said he discussed the clubhouse atmosphere with a ghost
writer for the Web site two weeks ago. Clayton said the writer was
supposed to send a version of the diary for him to edit and
approve, but Clayton said he never received the file.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely something that shouldn't have been out,''
Clayton said. ''It's old news. We'll handle it internally. That's
how we settled it ... put it behind us and go on. We're playing too
good right now. It's something you deal with and go on. All I can
do is apologize to the team. It's bad timing and not necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said he was willing to move on and forget the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't know what it said because I haven't read it,''
Curtis said. ''It's not that big a deal. We're fine with each
other. He said he apologized for the stuff that went on the
Internet. There's not a story there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the diary, Clayton said Curtis was unfriendly the first time
the players met in spring training and they have no relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis was acquired by Texas in an offseason trade with the New
York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't stoop so low as to talk about Chad as a person because
it is not my purpose to judge anyone,'' the Web posting said. ''In
fact, I don't give a damn about Chad. What I have a problem with is
the lack of respect he brings to the clubhouse. But maybe this
situation will teach us all how to get along with each other.''

<HEADLINE> Twins 10, Athletics 5  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Denny Hocking had five hits, including
two doubles and a two-run homer, and the Minnesota Twins snapped a
five-game losing streak with a 10-5 win Thursday night over the
error-ridden Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Hocking was 5-for-6 with three RBIs for the Twins, who
squandered an early five-run lead but then broke open the game with
four runs in the seventh. Minnesota had 18 hits after getting just
16 while losing three games at Seattle this week.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Jones added four singles and two RBIs for Minnesota, and
Corey Koskie also had an RBI single. Matt Lawton and Butch Huskey
had run-scoring groundouts and the Twins scored two runs on errors
by the A's, who made four errors while losing their third straight
game.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Redman (3-0), making his third start of the season after
eight relief appearances, allowed only five runners -- and all five
scored. He pitched six innings, giving up five runs and five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde and Miguel Tejada hit two-run homers for the A's
and Terrence Long had an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Vizcaino (0-1), the second of four A's pitchers, was the
loser. He allowed one run and three hits in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota scored three in the first and led 5-0 in the third
inning. The A's tied the game with three in the third and Tejada's
sixth homer of the season in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey broke the tie in the sixth, and Hocking hit his second
homer of the season as the Twins made it 10-5 in the seventh. It
was just the seventh win in 20 road games for Minnesota this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a triple to hit for the cycle, Hocking drove a ball just
foul down the left-field line in the ninth, then struck out.
</P>
<P>
   A's starter Kevin Appier, making his second start since missing
three weeks with a strained right forearm, lasted just three
innings. Appier, who made his 300th career appearance, allowed five
runs on nine hits. Only two of the runs were earned.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hocking tied his career high for hits. He also had five
last June 27 at Detroit. ... The attendance of 8,746 was the
second-lowest of the week in Oakland. The A's drew 6,836 Monday
against the Kansas City Royals. ... Sal Fasano went 0-for-2 for the
A's, making him 1-for-18 in his last seven games. ... Eric Chavez
was hitless in three at-bats for Oakland, making him 2-for-21 on
this homestand. ... The Twins led off five of the first six innings
with hits. ... A's reliever Mike Magnante left the game in the
seventh with a slightly sprained left ankle.

<HEADLINE> Many Getting More Exercise at Work  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Future studies on exercise and fitness will take
into account how much physical activity Americans get while on the
job or working around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may be getting a lot more exercise than previously
believed when such physical activity is taken into account,
according to a study released Thursday by the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The study found -- like others before it -- that almost two-thirds
of working Americans do not get enough exercise during their
leisure time. However, the study also showed that nearly 44 percent
of working Americans got at least one hour of hard occupational
activity a day on the job or doing housework.
</P>
<P>
   The survey questioned 20,766 adults in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''Typically we've been measuring leisure time activities,'' said
the study's author, Deborah Jones, a scientist at the National
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. ''But
now we see the importance of accounting for other activities that
people are participating in, and we'll start doing that in 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has developed a new questionnaire that takes into
account physical activity at work, during child care and in
maintaining a home, with activities such as vacuuming and

<P>
   The government recommends adults participate in 30 minutes or
more of moderate physical activity every day to maintain fitness.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 survey indicated that of employed adults, 20 percent
reported one to four hours a day of physical labor during the work
day and 24 percent reported five hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   The same survey asked working adults about their leisure-time
activity. It found that 36 percent got the recommended amount of
exercise through leisure activities alone.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Spending Up in Moscow  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH SEWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Newly confident Moscow consumers are opening their
wallets again and filling up shopping baskets -- defying perceptions
Russia remains mired in its 1998 financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The spending pickup is fueled by a recovery in Russian incomes
from the ruble meltdown, and by gleaming new stores hawking a
dazzling variety of products.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's hard to keep Moscow shoppers away. Typical is Irina
Nikolayeva, a ceramic artist who on a sloppy spring day trudged
through the mud to a new shopping center in western Moscow -- just
for pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   She filled her shiny cart with tea and apples she didn't really
need. And she could easily have found carrots and cookies for less
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really nice to come to shop here. It's not that I lose my
head or anything,'' Nikolayeva said.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Nikolayeva's shopping choices consisted mainly
of expensive items aimed at rich Russians, or cheap goods brought
back from trips to China, India and Turkey to be sold on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   But in the nearly two years following the nation's economic
emergency, consumer-oriented shops stocked with quality products
have started to appear in Moscow and other major Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of Russia by the Paris-based Organization for
Economic Co-Operation and Development shows incomes are recovering
following the August 1998 crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies from Finland, Turkey, China and elsewhere have
opened or expanded supermarkets and shopping complexes, mainly in
the city's center or prosperous neighborhoods. But Russian
entrepreneurs also have invested, taking over and remaking former
Soviet food and clothing stores.
</P>
<P>
   Leaflets, special offers and sales are all part of the
increasingly competitive Moscow shopping scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I can compare prices,'' Nikolayeva said as she picked up
her bags at Ramstor, a shopping complex built with Turkish capital.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has always been the benchmark of economic reform in
Russia, a city that in Soviet times daily drew some 2 million
outsiders who scoured the metropolis for scarce consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Many, if not the majority of goods in most stores are still
imports, with the high end of the market occupied by Western
companies, especially from Germany and Scandinavia, and the low end
held by firms from China and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40,000 shoppers stormed the Swedish furniture and household
goods store Ikea on opening day in March, and thousands more have
visited the vast complex on the northern edge of Moscow since then.
</P>
<P>
   After former President Boris Yeltsin lifted price controls in
January 1992, Russian foods -- already scarce -- virtually
disappeared from the shelves overnight as people faced with soaring
prices stocked up. Other Russia-made products -- often packaged in
brown paper, plain boxes or bottles with rusty tops -- were shunned
for brighter imports.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1998 ruble crisis pushed import prices sharply higher,
spurring demand for less expensive domestic products. As consumer
confidence and spending power improved, Russian producers slowly
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Prices gradually have come down across the board, unleashing
pent-up consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   These days, products made in Russia proudly are stocked along
with imports. Usually cheaper, their familiar tastes are selling
points among Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow-made ''Good Morning'' sour cream boasts on the package
that it's a ''Russian national product.'' A leading brand of
Russian cigarettes is called ''Otchizna,'' or Fatherland.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of well-stocked, well-lit, clean stores is
putting real pressure on kiosks and street traders who hawk their
wares from small stands and tables.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's much harder now because there are many stores,'' said
Irina Smirnova, a retired school teacher who sells Russian-made
cigarettes from a street-side table.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stores get their cigarettes directly from the factory while I
have to buy mine wholesale. I don't know how long I can keep this
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Business is so bad Smirnova is hawking her library, asking three
rubles (10 cents) for a volume of lyrics by Fyodor Tyutchev, one of
Russia's great poets.
</P>
<P>
   While kiosks and street traders are having a hard time, some old
shopping habits flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Lines quickly form on the days when a rusty truck from the
Rzheva collective farm drives up on Yartseva Street in western
Moscow. Farm workers unload cartons of non-pasteurized milk, sour
cream and package of cottage cheese.
</P>
<P>
   It's cheaper, fresher and tastier, the customers say as they
load up their bags.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's markets have had to spruce themselves up to keep
customers from defecting to supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I prefer shopping in the market,'' said Alla Mitayeva, an
engineer. ''The vegetables are fresher. They get them directly from
the farm.''

<HEADLINE> China, Taiwan In New Political Era  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The worst-case scenario was that Chinese
missiles would rain down on Taiwan because the island's newly
elected president would rashly declare independence in the months
after his stunning victory.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened so far, and most experts say the
80-mile-wide Taiwan Strait that divides the longtime rivals should
remain calm for the near future. Although long-standing
disagreements are keeping them far from the bargaining table, both
are remaining cool-headed -- despite occasional flare-ups in
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, Taiwanese President-elect Chen Shui-bian takes
office, officially beginning a political era that could raise
tensions with China to new heights. Beijing will no doubt listen
closely to Chen's inauguration speech.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of war can't be ruled out, analysts say, and the
United States could quickly get dragged into a conflict. Just four
years ago, U.S. warships cruised to Taiwan when China tested
nuclear-capable missiles near the island's two main ports.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two sides split amid civil war 51 years ago, Beijing's
mission has been to reunify this democratic island of 22 million
people with the communist mainland. Independence for Taiwan has
been out of the question, and China has warned that it would wage
war if Taipei sought a permanent split or indefinitely delayed
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on its threats could be extremely reckless for China at
the moment. A war could torpedo Beijing's long campaign to join the
World Trade Organization, and would likely ruin China's chances of
getting permanent trade status with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''China has a lot of economic issues in the United States'
hands,'' said Lee Si-kuen, a political science professor at the
National Taiwan University.
</P>
<P>
   Many defense experts doubt that China has enough warships or
planes to successfully invade Taiwan. The massive Chinese army has
its roots in land-based guerrilla warfare and has never fought a
war that involves a complex naval landing.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, the U.S. Pacific Fleet
commander in chief, said in Hong Kong that invading Taiwan would be
an ''almost impossible military task'' for China.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pollack, a senior Asia specialist at the Rand Corp.
think tank, agreed. But he noted that history is full of conflicts
caused by miscalculations.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts point out that Beijing's goal would probably be
to simply frighten Taiwanese away from seeking independence. This
could be accomplished by firing a ballistic missile at an
unpopulated area, blocking a port or seizing one of Taiwan's
numerous outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
   Since Chen was elected March 18, Beijing has said peace talks
could begin if Taiwan would do one thing: Agree that the island is
an inseparable part of one China.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has long been wary of Beijing's ''one-China'' principle
because it fears accepting that would mean admitting the repressive
Beijing government is the island's legitimate ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has refused to accept the principle as a precondition for
talks, but has said he would be willing to discuss it during a
summit, which he has said he would attend anywhere and at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Before Chen was elected, Beijing tried to warn voters away from
the former Taipei mayor, once a vocal supporter of Taiwan
independence. His Democratic Progressive Party still favors letting
Taiwanese voters decide whether the island should break away for
good. Chen has softened his stance, saying he would only hold such
a vote if China attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Since Chen's victory, Beijing has given him time to prove
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will listen to his words and watch his actions,'' Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said Tuesday, repeating a
phrase Beijing has been using the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who is succeeding retiring President Lee Teng-hui, has
been avoiding provocative language and has ignored threatening
rhetoric printed in China's state-run media.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring independence would be difficult for him, partly
because his small DPP party lacks a majority in the legislature.
Also, most polls say the public opposes such a declaration, fearing
it would spark a war.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Kuo, associate professor of political science at Taipei's
Soochow University, said Chen has done a fair job handling Beijing
so far.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuo said the president-elect has yet to present a solution
that will ease tensions, and the professor is not expecting one
Saturday when Chen gives his inauguration speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the speech will give Beijing an excuse to
attack,'' Kuo said, ''but it also won't make Beijing feel
satisfied.''

<HEADLINE> Jimenez Leads Deutsche Bank  </HEADLINE>
By ROY KAMMERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALVESLOHE, Germany (AP) -- Tiger Woods was not too happy with the
crowd at the Deutsche Bank Open.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators popped camera flashbulbs during his swing. They
wandered on to the fairways. It was just too close for comfort, as
far as Woods was concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem can be solved very easily. In the States, we have
a one-arm-length rule -- one away from the ropes,'' Woods said
Thursday after shooting a 2-under-par 70 in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here, it's a little bit different. They walk in the middle of
the fairways and stand right in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryder Cup player Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain shot a 67 to hold
a 1-stroke lead over a trio of players.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had four bogeys, including on each of the first two holes.
He recovered from that slow start with four birdies and by chipping
in from 25 yards at the eighth hole for an eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a solid round of golf,'' said Woods, the defending
champion. ''I got off to a poor start and played well after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez sank a birdie putt on the 18th hole to pull ahead of
British Open champion Paul Lawrie, France's Jean Van de Velde and
South Africa's Retief Goosen, all of whom were at 4-under 68.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, reportedly being paid $1 million in appearance money,
played with a Nike ball for the first time in an event. Woods is
under contract to Titleist.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been testing it for a few months,'' Woods said of the new
ball. ''Basically, I wanted a test round on the tour. If I think
it's viable to switch, I'll switch. If not, I'll go back to my
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the world's top 20 players are entered in the
tournament, but there was little doubt about who was at the center
of the spectators' attention. More than 2,000 followed Woods and
his playing partners, Spain's Sergio Garcia (who shot a 72) and
England's Lee Westwood (71).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 9,000 spectators for the day showed up shortly after
Woods' 8:10 a.m. starting time. That's double the normal opening
day attendance for a German tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The threesome was slapped with a warning for slow play on the
16th hole, where the crowd was particularly unruly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to play fast when there are so many people inside
the ropes and photographers walking down the middle of the
fairway,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had some problems with the cameras a few times. They got me
on my downswing at hole No. 8 eight with a flash.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's Jesper Parnevik, coming off his title Sunday at the
Byron Nelson Classic, shot a 70, while Scotland's Colin Montgomerie
carded a 73.

<HEADLINE> Woods Experiments With Nike Ball  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Colin Montgomerie finally used the controversial Callaway ERC
driver in a tournament, and hardly anyone noticed. The bigger buzz
came from what Tiger Woods didn't use: a Titleist.
</P>
<P>
   Switching to a swoosh instead of the Titleist golf ball he used
in his previous 97 tournaments as a professional, Woods fired the
latest -- and perhaps the loudest -- shot in the golf ball wars
Thursday in the Deutsche Bank Open.
</P>
<P>
   That Woods played a Nike Golf ball left the company hopeful it
could use his powerful appeal to grab a greater share of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he decides to switch, it's an earthquake,'' said Bob Wood,
president of Nike Golf.
</P>
<P>
   Whether either happens remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   After a 2-under 70 left him three strokes out of the first-round
lead, Woods said he has been experimenting with a version of Nike's
Tour Accuracy ball the past few months while practicing at his home
course outside Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, I wanted a test round on the tour,'' Woods said.
''If I think it's viable to switch, I'll switch. If not, I'll go
back to my ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is under contract with Titleist, but industry sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, have said he has an escape
clause that would allow him to terminate the deal on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's in my contract that I can try any ball,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Titleist spokesman Joe Gomes said the company would have no
comment.
</P>
<P>
   For Woods to change could be just what Nike needs to move into
the highly competitive -- and highly profitable -- golf ball
industry. The National Golf Foundation says Americans spent $820
million on golf balls in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who enjoy golf talk equipment -- what irons you just
bought, what balls you play,'' Wood said. ''You never talk about
shoes you wear or apparel. The emotional core is equipment. For us
to become a great golf brand, which is our desire, we feel it's
really important to have a foothold in the equipment business.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his Nike contract, Woods wears clothes, shoes and a hat.
The clothing line was redesigned to be more appealing to the
masses, while the shoes were not an immediate hit because of their
high cost.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone needs golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   Titleist has the largest slice of the pie, with industry sources
putting its share in the premium-ball market at 50 percent. Nike
entered the ball market last year with limited success, and this
year signed up 14 touring pros to use its ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite increased marketing spending, Nike really hasn't moved
the dial in retail sales,'' said Tim Conder, a senior leisure
analyst for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis who follows the golf
equipment industry. ''If Tiger is starting to come on board, that
won't hurt. But we'll see. The main issue is whether serious
golfers view Nike as having a serious ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Titleist makes its own ball, as does Maxfli and Callaway, which
recently invested $170 million on a golf ball plant. Nike's ball is
made by Bridgestone, which has a 13 percent share of the premium-
ball market.
</P>
<P>
   Conder questions why Bridgestone would make a superior product
for a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   But if Woods switches, Nike can claim its ball is used by the
No. 1 player in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tiger is Tiger. He gives credibility to a lot of products,''
said Jim Baugh, president of Wilson Sporting Goods, which makes the
Smart-Core golf ball. ''Consumers will always try products based on
stories like this. Whether they switch in the long term depends on
the performance of the product.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody can try golf balls. It's whether they stay with the
product. For an average player using the ball Tiger Woods uses,
what's the score at the end of the day?''
</P>
<P>
   The ball Woods used Thursday is not available on the market,
although it is similar to the Tour Accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say the feel is much like I'm accustomed to,'' Woods
said in Germany. ''It doesn't go lower, just holds its line a
little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for more details on the ball, Woods replied, ''I don't
know the specs. Ask a rocket scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has a five-year contract with Titleist that pays him $2
million a year to play its clubs and balls. The contract was
reworked last year when Titleist complained that Nike was using
Woods in commercials to promote its ball.
</P>
<P>
   One of those spots showed Woods bouncing a ball off a wedge --
between his legs, behind his back. Another was a chorus of hackers
hitting 300-yard drives when Woods showed up on the practice range.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' contract with Nike is also being renegotiated and is
expected to be worth at least $80 million for five years. Part of
that depends on whether he switches balls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it would have gone this far if he wasn't
interested in pursuing this, if he wasn't at least partially
convinced this wouldn't be an advantage for him,'' the Nike Golf
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, meanwhile, finally used the ERC driver. One model
has been ruled nonconforming by the USGA, although it was legal
everywhere else but North America. He shot a 1-over 73.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Reports Minicrisis Handled  </HEADLINE>
By PEDRO SERVIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguay's president said his
administration had subdued a ''mini-crisis'' amid reports late
Thursday that rebellious soldiers and police had risen up against
his government.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear whether the crisis had ended, since armored
carriers remained posted outside the legislature in downtown
Asuncion. There were no reports of injuries or deaths.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press photographer saw three armored personnel
carriers take up posts outside the building and heard some shots
fired. A strong explosion could be heard after the uprising, which
Interior Minister Walter Bower said began around 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear was how many soldiers were involved and what kind
of action might have been undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   Some Air force planes were seen flying overhead. No soldiers
were spotted on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Macchi appealed to Paraguayans to remain calm, telling
local radio: ''The crisis is under control.'' Other army divisions
expressed support for the president, as Paraguayan television
broadcast developments into the early hours Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bower charged that the rebellious soldiers were sympathetic to
former army strongman Lino Cesar Oviedo. But he did not elaborate
on the details or say how many soldiers were involved.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the latest crisis for this landlocked South American
nation, which was last thrown into upheaval in March 1999 when
former president Raul Cubas was ousted and replaced by Gonzalez
Macchi.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo, a former army general, is wanted by Paraguayan
authorities in connection with the assassination of Paraguay's vice
president. Authorities also said he has yet to complete a 10-year
sentence for a brief mutiny in April 1996 against former President
Juan Carlos Wasmosy.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo sought political asylum in Argentina, but went into
hiding days before new Argentine President Fernando de la Rua took
office Dec. 10. At last report, he was claiming to be in a remote
area of Paraguay, making sporadic telephone contact with news media
and denouncing the government.

<HEADLINE> Fusaichi Pegasus Tours Pimlico  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A few days before the Wood Memorial, trainer
Neil Drysdale stood by his barn at Aqueduct looking over the
pedigree of Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now this is interesting,'' Drysdale said, smiling and pointing
to the name of a distant relative of Fusaichi Pegasus.
''Rambunctious. That makes sense. That's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambunctious turns out to be the sire of Fusaichi Pegasus' third
dam, Ramhyde, and rambunctious -- along with playful -- is a word
often used by Drysdale to describe his colt's behavior before and
after races.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus was up to his usual tricks Thursday morning --
two days before the Kentucky Derby winner faces seven challengers
in the $1 million Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   On his first trip to Pimlico's track after arriving on
Wednesday, the frisky $4 million bay colt stopped eight times to
check out his new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a typical day,'' Drysdale said. ''He wants to see
what's going on. He stopped a couple of times. ... There's no
rushing him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just stopping and looking around.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough to figure whether Fusaichi Pegasus liked what he saw, but
Drysdale said the son of Mr. Prospector ''half-cantered'' around
the track twice and was comfortable in Barn 7 on the backstretch,
far removed from the Stakes Barn where the other Preakness horses
are stabled.
</P>
<P>
   While displaying powerful finishing kicks to win the Wood by 4\
lengths over Red Bullet and the Derby by 1{ lengths over Aptitude,
Fusaichi Pegasus has become the talk of the racing world. He is the
3-5 favorite for the 1 3-16-mile Preakness, with Red Bullet the
second choice at 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   He's also become quite the character when he isn't racing. He
delayed the start of the Wood on April 15 by three minutes when he
stopped to look around the track before handlers finally led him to
the starting gate. After the win, Fusaichi Pegasus spent the next
five minutes on the first turn staring out at the parking lot and
into the stands before jockey Kent Desormeaux was able to get him
to the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days before the Derby, Fusaichi Pegasus reared up, unseated
his exercise rider and fell on his side without injury while
leaving the track after a workout. ''He's playful,'' Drysdale says.
</P>
<P>
   But when the colt moves into the gate, he's all business.
Fusaichi Pegasus has won five in a row after finishing second in
his first -- and only -- start as a 2-year-old. With each win, his
popularity has grown, and Japanese owner Fusao Sekiguchi's
investment already is paying off in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus has earned $1,704,400 -- plus a $250,000 bonus
for winning the Wood and Derby -- and could be worth as much as $50
million through syndication if he continues to win.
</P>
<P>
   The name adds a bit of mystique, too. It is a combination of the
owner's first name -- Fusao -- and the Japanese word ''itchi,'' which
means No. 1. Pegasus is the winged horse of Greek mythology.
</P>
<P>
   The first name is pronounced Fu sah EE chee.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the Preakness, most of the trainers
said it will take the race of a lifetime to upset Fusaichi Pegasus.
Asked how Fusaichi Pegasus might lose, trainer D. Wayne Lukas said,
''He might not. I thought he had less chance of winning the Derby
than he does of winning the Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said his colt should be closer to the pace then he was
in the 1\-mile Derby, when Desormeaux settled him into 13th place
along the rail before moving into the lead in the stretch. The
Preakness is a sixteenth of a mile shorter and the field is much
smaller than the 19-horse Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But Drysdale is still concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never know what's going to happen,'' he said. ''I've seen
fields of four or five, and sometimes a horse can get in terrible
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The last three odds-on Preakness favorites have failed to win --
Easy Goer was second to Sunday Silence in 1989 at odds of 3-5;
Swale was seventh in 1984 at 4-5; and Linkage was second to Aloma's
Ruler in 1982 at 1-2. However, 16 of 23 odds-on favorites have won,
the last being Spectacular Bid in 1979 at 1-10.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale is optimistic, but will be more comfortable when the
Belmont Stakes rolls around on June 10. He says Fusaichi Pegasus is
more suited for the 1{-mile distance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here, we are backing up in distance and it's just two weeks
between races,'' Drysdale said. ''It's three weeks before the
Belmont. I think he has a very good style for the Belmont. He
settles very well, is tactical and relaxes very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Preakness field, from the rail out is: Hugh Hefner (Victor
Espinoza, 20-1); Snuck In (Cash Asmussen, 12-1); Impeachment (Craig
Perret, 8-1); Red Bullet (Jerry Bailey, 9-2); High Yield (Pat Day,
10-1); Captain Steve (Robby Albarado, 8-1); Fusaichi Pegasus
(Desormeaux, 3-5); and Hal's Hope (Roger Velez, 20-1).
</P>
<P>
   The winner earns $650,000, the runner-up $200,000, third place
$100,000 and fourth place $50,000.

<HEADLINE> Kimeses convicted of murder in death of elderly widow  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors didn't have the body of the murdered
82-year-old millionaire widow, but they did show the blueprints to
the crime that led jurors to convict a mother-and-son team of
murder, robbery and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, Robert Hernandez, 32, said 14 spiral-bound notebooks
in which the 65-year-old mother, Sante Kimes, scribbled
compulsively were key to the verdicts delivered Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The jury forewoman said ''guilty'' 118 times -- 58 times for
Sante Kimes and 60 times for her son, Kenneth Kimes -- to charges
related to a plot to kill Irene Silverman, a former Radio City
Music Hall dancer, and steal her $10 million home. Her body has
never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had advised jurors during closing arguments that the
notebooks and other papers were virtual diagrams of Mrs. Kimes'
thinking as she planned what was perhaps her biggest scam.
</P>
<P>
   ''The notebooks helped me put the pieces together,'' Hernandez
said. ''Everything that was said about the case was in the
notebooks.''
</P>
<P>
   One page listed New York properties Mrs. Kimes had researched.
Next to Silverman's name she wrote, ''Yes! Older ... Go!'' Another
entry read: ''Easy marks ... elderly with money.''
</P>
<P>
   Other notes were lists of weapons to buy -- stun gun, knives,
Mace. There were lists of videos to watch, including ''Whispering
Death,'' and pamphlets to read -- ''Document Fraud and Other
Crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers told the jurors that much of the information in
the notebooks was forged or altered by police. They also said
prosecutors read too much into the notes and jumped to false
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses, who evoke memories of the mother and son in the
film ''The Grifters,'' were stoic as the verdicts were read. After
Mrs. Kimes was pronounced guilty about 20 times, her son began
chatting with his lawyer, Mel Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   The mother and son, natives of Oklahoma and longtime residents
of Las Vegas, face life in prison when State Supreme Court Justice
Rena Uviller sentences them on June 27. Meanwhile, they are charged
with murder in Los Angeles in the fatal shooting of a businessman
there.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of eight women and four men began deliberating shortly
after 2 p.m. Monday following a 13-week trial. They sent out a note
saying they had reached verdicts on all the charges shortly before
2:30 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Juror Michael Alvarez, 34, and Hernandez said jurors had no
problems convicting the Kimeses of murder without a corpse. They
said they considered the murder counts Wednesday, and the first
votes on them were unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Uviller had instructed the jurors that the absence of a body did
not mean there had not been a murder.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said the verdict ''sends a
clear message that you cannot escape a murder conviction by
disposing of the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverman vanished July 5, 1998, the day the Kimeses were
arrested here in New York on a stolen car warrant from Cedar City,
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But for the bad $14,900 check they wrote to pay for the green
1997 Lincoln Town Car, the Kimeses might have remained at large
much longer, and might never have been charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they believe the Kimeses strangled Silverman,
bound her with duct tape and put her into large garbage bags,
stuffed her into a duffel bag, and then disposed of the body.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said the Kimeses killed Silverman as part of
their plan to steal the elegant six-story, beaux-arts mansion her
late husband Sam, a real estate millionaire, had left her on
Manhattan's tony Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   When police arrested them, the Kimeses still had Silverman's
personal documents and a plethora of other suspicious items.
</P>
<P>
   In the car, police found loaded 9 mm and .22-caliber pistols, a
red wig and two fright masks, plastic handcuffs, $30,000 in cash, a
stun gun box, syringes, and a pink liquid similar to a known ''date
rape'' drug.
</P>
<P>
   They also found cassettes of Silverman's telephone conversations
-- secretly taped by the Kimeses -- and a deed with Silverman's
forged signature that transferred her town house to the Kimeses for
a fraction of its value.

<HEADLINE> Violence Follows English Fans  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Fears are growing that soccer hooliganism and
fighting on an even greater scale could ruin next month's European
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''Soccer: The Gutter Again,'' declared The Sun, Britain's
biggest-selling tabloid, on Friday after two days of violent
clashes scarred the UEFA Cup final between Turkey's Galatasaray and
Britain's Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   While England apologized Thursday for the mayhem, authorities
were predicting that the Euro 2000 tournament, which runs from June
10-July 2 in Belgium and the Netherlands, could be a battleground
for even worse rioting if it draws hooligans from across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mindless few must not spoil it for the rest,'' Arsenal
Chairman Peter Hill-Wood was quoted as telling The Sun. ''Football
must never be beaten by hooliganism.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of fans were injured, including four who were stabbed,
and 64 were arrested in vicious fighting between rampaging mobs of
English and Turkish supporters in Copenhagen before Wednesday
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Danish authorities Thursday fined and expelled the 19 Britons
and 15 Turks who were arrested. They were also banned from entering
Denmark for one year.
</P>
<P>
   Galatasaray won the game 4-1 in a penalty shootout, becoming the
first Turkish team to win a European soccer title and provoking
huge celebrations in Turkey. But the game was virtually an
afterthought in England following the running street battles that
left a trail of devastation in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''We apologize to the Danes for what happened in the last 48
hours,'' said David Davies, executive director of the English
Football Association. ''The people of that hospitable city deserve
better, much better. They deserve the apologies of ourselves and of
the Turks. There are absolutely no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair also weighed in, declaring, ''I
condemn absolutely, without any reservations at all, these
appalling acts of violence by so-called fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence also flared Wednesday night in London, where hundreds
of Arsenal fans rampaged through the Finsbury Park area near the
team's home stadium at Highbury, attacking Turkish businesses,
throwing bottles and smashing windows. Six people were arrested and
three policemen were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The British media condemned the violence in both countries and
warned authorities to start acting now to prevent a repeat next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Mirror, a British tabloid, urged the British government to
take stronger action to prevent known troublemakers from traveling
abroad to soccer games. Legislation giving authorities the power to
take passports away from suspected hooligans was watered down last
year following complaints that civil liberties would be violated.
</P>
<P>
   Under an editorial titled, ''Keep our hooligans at home,'' the
Mirror called on Home Secretary Jack Straw, the British official
responsible for law and order, to crack down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's see how hard he can be on the soccer thugs who shame
this country,'' the tabloid said. ''Violent soccer hooligans
deserve no breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   An official of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, which
monitors hooligan activity in England, said he feared that some
English fans would try to cause trouble at Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can guarantee you that if there is any trouble, English fans
will be part of it,'' he said, speaking under the unit's customary
policy of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes of English thugs running amok in Copenhagen and
London did no favors to England's bid for the 2006 World Cup. But
Davies and Blair sought to limit the damage, citing the relatively
peaceful 1996 European Championship staged in England.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this country we have the strongest possible safeguards on
football violence,'' Blair said. ''The Euro 96 competition is
probably the competition freest of football violence of any
competition in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, Germany, Morocco and South Africa are the other
2006 bidders. FIFA will select the host country on July 6.
</P>
<P>
   England has a long reputation for soccer hooliganism dating back
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of violence across Europe, English soccer sank to
a low in Brussels on May 29, 1985, when Liverpool fans rioted at
the Champions Cup final against Juventus at the Heysel stadium.
Thirty-nine people died when a wall collapsed under the weight of
fleeing fans.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer's European governing body, UEFA, banned English clubs
from its competitions indefinitely. The ban was later reduced to
five years.
</P>
<P>
   There was little sign of English hooligans when the clubs
returned to European competition in 1991. But the violence has been
steadily creeping back.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between English and Turkish fans have been high since
the stabbing deaths of two Leeds United fans in Istanbul last month
on the eve of a UEFA Cup semifinal game against Galatasaray.
</P>
<P>
   England and Turkey will play in different groups in the Euro
2000 championships, but the two teams have games in nearby cities,
providing ample opportunity for clashes between rival fans.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Toledo Won't Enter May Runoff  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's government says a presidential runoff
election will go forward on May 28, despite candidate Alejandro
Toledo's decision not to participate and a warning from the
Organization of American States that it will not endorse the vote.
</P>
<P>
   After the National Election Board rejected Toledo's demand to
push back the second-round vote until June 18, he called on
supporters to stage massive street protests this evening in Peru's
major cities to force a postponement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dictatorship has taken the cruel decision to remain in
power,'' Toledo shouted to a crowd of thousands of banner-waving
supporters at a street rally in Lima's working-class neighborhood
of La Victoria on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   His followers roared their agreement.
</P>
<P>
   President Alberto Fujimori scorned Toledo's demand, accusing him
of quitting because he knew he was going to lose the election.
Polls show the two tied in voter preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't change the rules at this stage of the process,''
Fujimori told reporters hours earlier in the southern city of
Ayacucho.
</P>
<P>
   His statement was broadcast on television, after dozens of
protesters yelling ''Get out, tyrant!'' stoned his vehicle as it
pulled away from a campaign rally filled with thousands of his
supporters and curious onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's bodyguards fired automatic rifles into the air to
drive back the demonstrators near the main plaza in Ayacucho, high
in the Andes 230 miles southeast of Lima.
</P>
<P>
   ''Toledo has realized that to beat this guy he has to force a
political crisis,'' said political scientist Julio Carrion.
''Fujimori is not somebody who sticks to constitutional rules or
any sort of rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's rivals maintain the vote should have been scheduled
within 30 days after all results from the April 9 general election
were in, including congressional seats, which were determined only
last week. Those results are under scrutiny for alleged
vote-rigging by election workers and several candidates from
Fujimori's slate. One congressional candidate from Toledo's party
has also been implicated.
</P>
<P>
   The May 28 date was set on the night of April 29, after the
national election board received final results for the presidential
race. Fujimori's government maintains that it is interpreting the
constitution correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Peru narrowly averted political turmoil in the first election --
a process riddled with irregularities and allegations of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The vote ended with Fujimori falling some 20,000 votes short of
outright victory after three days of protests by Toledo's
supporters and the threat of economic and diplomatic sanctions from
the United States if vote counting conditions were not improved.
</P>
<P>
   But in the weeks following, the OAS said the government was
still dragging its feet on fixing a chronically faulty system. This
week, the OAS mission said it was ''technically impossible'' to
correct the vote-counting system and ensure a fair vote in the time
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round, independent monitors were denied access to
tabulation centers during the tallying of votes. Ballot totals
mysteriously decreased as the tally progressed and when the final
results were delivered, the figures showed about 1 million more
ballots were cast than there were voters.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Stein, the OAS mission's chief of election observers, on
Wednesday complained that Peruvian officials handed his mission an
incomplete copy of vote-counting software for the upcoming
election. And he said he was still waiting for a promised report
detailing how election officials planned to train vote counters.
</P>
<P>
   In its strongest statement yet, the OAS said Thursday it was
giving Fujimori's government until Monday -- after a nationwide test
of the election authority's new vote-counting software -- to make
necessary improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But Stein said there was ''an overwhelming need'' to ''postpone
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot endorse the results if what happened in the first
round continues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-week postponement demanded by Toledo represents the
minimum amount of time the OAS has said is necessary to adequately
test the computer system and retrain vote counters.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said Thursday that the upcoming vote would be a simpler
matter than the April 9 election because it did not include
congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who knows the slightest bit about mathematics would
know that it is a much simpler operation to count the votes of two
candidates,'' Fujimori said. ''It requires vigilance but it is no
reason to infringe on the functioning of the constitution.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Eases Kosovo Withdrawal Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate narrowly decided against setting a
deadline for the removal of U.S. troops in Kosovo, a move the
Clinton administration said would have been a blow to U.S.-NATO
relations and the hopes for peace in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   In a 53-47 vote Thursday, the Senate deleted language from a
military construction spending bill that would have ended U.S.
participation in the peacekeeping force on July 1 next year unless
the president requested and Congress approved an extension.
</P>
<P>
   The White House threatened to veto the $8.6 billion bill unless
the language was removed. Vice President Al Gore, who hopes to be
president next year, made a rare appearance in his capacity as
president of the Senate to cast a tie-breaking vote if necessary.
Gore's move came a day after his presidential rival, Republican
George W. Bush, asked Congress to back away from the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   To force an artificial withdrawal, Gore said, would have
''demoralized our allies ... and handed (Yugoslav) President
Milosevic a victory that he could not win through military force.''
</P>
<P>
   With the removal of the provision, the military construction
bill, which also contains $4.7 billion for emergency funds in
Kosovo and anti-drug efforts in Colombia, passed 96-4.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the withdrawal language, Armed Forces Committee
Chairman John Warner, R-Va., and Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said
their aim was not to force an end to U.S. involvement in the Kosovo
mission but to ensure that European allies were carrying their fair
share of the financial burden and that Congress played its proper
role in sanctioning the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Their provision also linked funds for Kosovo this year to Europe
meeting contribution targets for reconstruction and humanitarian
aid. Warner said he would try again to reintroduce this provision
when the Senate takes up the 2001 defense authorization bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the defense bill, which passed late
Thursday, contains an amendment offered by Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio
that requires the president to certify by April 1 next year that
European allies are adequately contributing to the rebuilding and
policing of the province. Without that, he must present Congress
with a plan to end U.S. troop participation.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said it strongly opposed the Kasich
amendment, saying it could encourage extremist elements in Kosovo
and ''damage the strength and durability of the NATO alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   About 5,900 U.S. troops are part of a 37,000-member NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo. The peacekeepers moved in after the
78-day air war to drive Yugoslav troops out of the province ended
last June.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Senate debate centered on whether Congress has ceded
its constitutional authority in letting the president dispatch and
station troops abroad without congressional consent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration would much prefer that Congress not
interfere at this late date with the continued usurpation of
Congress' constitutional prerogative and authority,'' said Byrd, a
fierce defender of the legislative branch's constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and his Republican predecessors have insisted that
as commander-in-chief they have the authority to deploy troops in
peacekeeping missions. Republican presidential hopeful Texas Gov.
George W. Bush agreed with Clinton that the Warner-Byrd language
was ''legislative overreach.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokesman, Scott McClellan, added that Bush opposed the
provision ''because he did not believe it was a way to address
Clinton-Gore's lack of leadership and mishandling of Kosovo.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sixers Focused on Winning One Game  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson put his game face on a day
early.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson didn't speak to reporters Thursday. Instead, with all
the talk about the 76ers making a historic comeback, the star guard
was focused on making sure Philadelphia gets to Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't concentrate on the game, there's no way we're
going to make history,'' Iverson said Wednesday. ''We got to win
the first game. We have to win the next one. That's the most
important thing. Then we'll deal with the (seventh) game in Indiana
when the time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, nearly swept out of the Eastern Conference
semifinals for the second straight season by the Pacers, can even
the series with a victory in Game 6 tonight at the First Union
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana will have Reggie Miller, who served a one-game
suspension during Game 5 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Game 7, if necessary, is Sunday at Conseco Fieldhouse. No NBA
team has ever rallied to win a best-of-seven series after falling
behind 3-0. Only six of the 59 teams in that position even forced a
sixth game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be great to make history here, but we got to do it
one game at a time,'' said Aaron McKie, who again will start at
point guard in place of the injured Eric Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, out since Game 3 with a chip fracture in his right ankle,
could see limited action.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I play, it'll be in the same role that I came into the
league,'' Snow said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers survived a fourth-quarter rally and a missed
3-pointer at the buzzer by Travis Best to win Game 4 92-90. Miller
was ejected late in the third quarter of that game after a fight
with Matt Geiger.
</P>
<P>
   Both players were suspended for Philadelphia's 107-86 victory in
Game 5 Monday. Miller returns tonight, but Geiger must sit out
another game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's do-or-die for us,'' Sixers forward Theo Ratliff said.
''We have to approach it with the same intensity. Reggie changes
things for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc, who has contributed more after struggling in the
three losses, said Miller's return doesn't guarantee an Indiana
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reggie is going to bring firepower, and we just have to guard
him as best we can,'' Kukoc said. ''But we had an 18-point lead (in
Game 4) with Reggie out there. You never know how it's going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc faced few elimination games as a member of the Chicago
Bulls, where he won three championships. He said the Sixers can't
assume a win-or-go-home mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't approach this game like desperation or it'll put
chains on you,'' he said. ''From our standpoint, it's been a
seventh game two games in row. You have to approach every game the
same way. You can't approach this game like elimination or that
will put extra pressure on the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, once concerned about a long layoff between series, now
wants to just get to the next round. The Pacers are worried about
Iverson, who scored 37 points in Game 5, including seven of the
first nine as the Sixers built a 15-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't let one guy change everything we try to do on the
defensive end, but there are some things to do,'' Indiana coach
Larry Bird said. ''We won't double-team him out on the court. We
can put Reggie on him a little bit earlier, bring Travis in a
little bit earlier. Once he gets it going, he's just tough to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, the NBA's second-leading scorer during the regular
season, at 28.4 points, is averaging 28.2 in this series.

<HEADLINE> Harper, Pippen To Renew Friendship  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Ron Harper had a little chat with an
old buddy the other day, a guy named Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Harper wouldn't say much about the conversation, but when asked
if Jordan imparted any advice, he replied, ''Keep going out and
just play basketball is all he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper and the Los Angeles Lakers will do just that starting
Saturday at Staples Center against the Portland Trail Blazers and
another longtime pal, Scottie Pippen, in the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love Pip, this is the time he raises up what he does best,''
Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   Harper should know. Jordan and Pippen were the main cogs on six
championship teams in Chicago during the 1990s, and Harper was one
of several role players on the final three.
</P>
<P>
   Like those Bulls, the Lakers have Phil Jackson as their coach
and two superstars -- Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant -- to lead
them. Whether that will be enough against the Blazers will shake
out over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This series may go seven games,'' Harper said. ''We've got our
hands full, I think. They've got a team full of superstars, we've
got two stars. What our role guys have to do is play our roles, do
what we have to do to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Blazers a team of superstars is an exaggeration
since they had only one All-Star, Rasheed Wallace, who was chosen
as a reserve. O'Neal and Bryant, meanwhile, both started for the
West.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pippen, Wallace, Arvydas Sabonis and Steve Smith are
all averaging in double figures in the playoffs, and Damon
Stoudamire, Brian Grant, Detlef Schrempf, Greg Anthony and Bonzi
Wells have all produced big games for the Blazers this season.
</P>
<P>
   Harper predicted the Lakers would beat Sacramento in the fifth
and deciding game of their first-round series two weeks ago, and
made the same forecast before Los Angeles eliminated Phoenix on
Tuesday night in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   He was right on both counts as the Lakers played their best in
rolling to onesided wins.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the Blazers?
</P>
<P>
   ''I ain't predicting nothing,'' Harper said with a smile. ''I
ain't putting no wood on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs by
virtue of their 67-15 regular-season record -- best in the NBA. The
Blazers had the league's second-best record -- 59-23.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bryant said the Blazers have better players than
the Lakers, and others have annointed Portland the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody's falling for that,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy
said. ''They won 67 games, they're going to have two first-team
All-NBA players on there in Shaq and Kobe. So they're supposed to
be doing what they're doing and what they've done. Everybody knows
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Lakers reached the NBA Finals, nine years ago,
Dunleavy was their coach. And the opponent? Jackson and the Bulls,
who won their first championship that year.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Bryant combined to average more than 52 points during
the season and have increased that rate an additional two points in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing about Kobe and Shaq is that they're always going to
get their numbers,'' Stoudamire said. ''But it's just how effective
they are in getting them. If a guy has 30, but he's getting 30 in
the paint and has eight or nine assists to go with it, he's hurting
you in more ways than one. But if Shaq gets 30 points on 27 shots
and 15 free throws, we know we did our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, a proven scorer throughout his career, averaged 15.9
points during the regular season -- his lowest since his rookie
season 10 years earlier -- but is down to 13.9 in the playoffs.
Usually a deadly outside shooter, he has made only 38.7 percent of
his shots in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen anyone give Glen breathing room in the
playoffs,'' Jackson said. ''I look for him to have a big series.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice figures to see a lot of Pippen, known for being tough on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all right, I'm a handful, too,'' Rice said. ''Me and
Scottie have had our battles throughout our careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the best-of-seven series will be played Monday night
at Staples Center before the series shifts to Portland for the
third and fourth games.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have a 23-1 record at home since losing to Portland
95-91 nearly four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''You win some, you lose some, some are rained out,'' O'Neal
said with a smile when asked about that game. ''We match up with
them pretty well. They have talented players, but we just have to
worry about us. We'll be ready.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Seek To Eliminate Knicks  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nothing would make the Miami Heat happier than
ending the New York Knicks' season tonight at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would really feel good about ourselves if we did finish it
on their home court for the simple fact they finished us off the
past two years on our home court,'' Alonzo Mourning said as the
Heat prepared to take a 3-2 lead into Game 6 of the best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Knicks nor the Heat have been able to string
together consecutive postseason victories in this rivalry since the
final two games of the 1998 series.
</P>
<P>
   If the Heat can do it tonight, it would mark the first time
these teams have met in the playoffs without going the distance.
This is the fourth consecutive year they've met.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to go to Game 7,'' Mourning said. ''We know the
importance of trying to finish the series off. The past couple of
games we lost, we went in with a very nonchalant attitude. If we go
in with the attitude of a must-win situation, I think we'll be able
to finish it off.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Knicks practiced Thursday, coach Jeff Van Gundy was
disgusted with his team. To the coach, it comes down to one simple
word: rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Get the ball,'' Van Gundy said. ''Very simple. Hit somebody
and go get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the blame that could be ferreted out among the individual
Knicks for the loss, the sore spots that stuck out were Marcus
Camby shooting 1-for-6 and fouling out in 23 minutes, Allan Houston
taking only two shots in the second half and Chris Childs, when he
wasn't arguing on the court with teammate Patrick Ewing, not having
a single assist in 17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, I have no choice but to make something happen,''
Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single problem for the Knicks is that they've been
outrebounded in all five games.
</P>
<P>
   Miami grabbed 11 offensive rebounds to New York's five in Game
5, repeatedly getting second chances to score.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said before this series that whoever fights for the ball
hardest will win, and they have fought harder, and that's why
they're up 3-2,'' Van Gundy said. ''If you can't get a rebound,
you've got to keep someone from getting a rebound. If you're not
doing either, then you've got problems. And that's why we've got
big problems right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby, who eluded reporters Thursday even when they chased him
down a stairwell, has been nowhere near the factor he was in last
year's playoffs, when the Knicks reached the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Camby is shooting just 11-for-31 in the series, while starting
power forward Larry Johnson has been outrebounded 8-5 on the
offensive glass by Anthony Carter, the Heat's backup point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding ''was our No. 1 priority going into the series,''
Heat coach Pat Riley said. ''I thought that's what got us beat last
year. It's the willful force of the big men that we're not going to
let their big men hurt us. It's a key stat, but it's a hustle
stat.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 previous best-of-seven series that have been tied
2-2, the team that won Game 5 has gone on to win the series 84
times.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very aware of that,'' Sprewell said. ''It makes it that
much more interesting to go out and overcome those odds. It's
something that hasn't been done that often, but we've been able to
do it before -- being the No. 8 seed and beating the No. 1 seed and
getting to the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was last year, back when the Knicks were running and
rebounding with equal vigor.
</P>
<P>
   In this series, they're doing neither.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just have to remember how we've won and why we've won,''
Sprewell said, ''and make that happen on the court.''

<HEADLINE> Temperature Rising on China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters and opponents alike of a landmark
China trade bill are increasing the pressure on a dwindling number
of undecided House members in advance of next week's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides predicted a close vote, although supporters were
increasingly confident they would prevail. President Clinton
planned a five-minute Oval Office address to promote the measure on
Sunday, although not all TV networks planned to carry it live.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be tight. We're not there but we'll get there,'' House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the chief Republican nose counter
and a strong supporter of the bill, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a week to go to the vote, sponsors appeared to be
within striking distance of the 218 votes they would need to
prevail if all 435 members vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., a top Democratic supporter, said
he expected that 70-75 of the House's 211 Democrats would vote for
the bill. Republicans were looking at about 140-145 GOP votes.
</P>
<P>
   The administration pledged to work hard through the weekend to
try to win more converts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not where we need to be. We have more votes to get,''
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   A final vote was expected in the House on Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the measure in the more free-trade-minded Senate
appears assured. However, a heavy campaign against the bill in the
House by organized labor has seriously undercut Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the bill grew this week after Republican leaders
agreed to support side legislation to protect American industries
from a surge in imports from China and for a permanent commission
to monitor human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would extend permanent normal trade relations to China
and ease the way for its entry into the 135-nation World Trade
Organization. It would end two decades of annual congressional
votes on China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the trade bill condemn China's human rights abuses
and suggest that increasing trade with China could cost American
jobs by flooding U.S. markets with low-cost goods. Supporters say
it will open China's vast markets to American companies and help
promote American values there.
</P>
<P>
   The vote ''will have profound implications for the free world's
trading system and the long-term growth potential of the American
economy,'' Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Thursday
during a rare appearance with Clinton in the White House Rose
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan had said the same thing the week before in a letter to
House Banking Committee Chairman James Leach, R-Iowa, but the White
House wanted him to do it again before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know when Chairman Greenspan talks, the world
listens,'' Clinton said. ''I just hope the Congress is listening
today.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., an opponent, suggested that
normalizing trade with China could give China greater access to
sensitive U.S. technology and pose a serious national security
risk.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton on Thursday, Wolf asked the president to
direct the CIA to declassify information that bears on ''the
national security risk China poses to the United States.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Defense Bill Pushes Retirees Health  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Military retirees would get better health care
coverage, improved access to prescription drugs and treatment in
all military hospitals under a major defense bill the House has
passed.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, approved 353-63 on Thursday, authorizes nearly
$310 billion, $4.5 billion above the president's request, for
weapons procurement, military readiness and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   It moves to improve the quality of life of military personnel
with a 3.7 percent pay raise, a subsistence payment of up to $500 a
month for poorer military families, including those on food stamps,
and funds to reduce out-of-pocket housing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Health care for service members and retirees is a focus of the
bill. In particular, the 1.4 million Medicare-eligible retirees and
family members who are entitled to prescription drug benefits but
can't get them because they live far from military bases would be
able to subscribe to a mail order service with an $8 co-payment.
</P>
<P>
   They also could use network retail pharmacies with a 20 percent
co-payment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in a statement, applauded the extension of
prescription drug benefits and said it ''urges Congress to show
similar support for providing coverage to all Medicare
beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which now goes to the Senate, moves to improve
TRICARE, the HMO-like military health care plan for 20-year
retirees and dependents, by reducing limits on catastrophic
expenses, reimbursing travel expenses for those who must go more
than 100 miles to see a specialist and eliminating cost inequities
for family members living apart from military health facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 406-10 for an amendment by Rep. Gene Taylor,
D-Miss., that would put on a permanent and nationwide status a
demonstration project under which six military facilities have been
treating Medicare-eligible retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The base bill had provided only for an extension of the
experiment until more data could be collected, but Taylor argued
that people who made the service a career with the assumption they
would get a lifetime of free health care at military facilities
''don't need any more demonstration promises. ... They need the
promise that was made to them on the day that they enlisted to be
fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., argued that military hospitals don't
have the space or the training to treat a large population of
elderly veterans and that the demonstration project, meant to be
cost-neutral, has cost the Pentagon more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   By making what is called Medicare subvention permanent ''we're
taking a crippled program that has not been fixed and putting it on
the road to financial disaster,'' he said. His proposal to add
sites to the current demonstration program was defeated 323-95.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers approved by 218-201 an amendment offered by Rep. Ike
Skelton, D-Mo., to remove language in the bill at odds with an
agreement reached in January between President Clinton and the
governor of Puerto Rico on the future of Navy training on the
Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, growing out of protests against live ordnance
training on Vieques, permitted the Navy to resume training with
dummy bombs and promised a referendum on whether the Navy should
leave Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, however, would have barred the secretary of the
Navy from transferring the eastern end of the island from Navy
jurisdiction and allowed $40 million in economic aid to the people
of Vieques only when live-fire training was resumed on the range.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers voted 264-153 to end funds for U.S. ground troops in
Kosovo if the president by next April 1 doesn't certify that
European allies are paying their fair share in the peacekeeping
mission.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Polls Not Crucial For Presidency  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Never mind those national polls that show
George W. Bush slightly ahead of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral system designed by the founding fathers makes it
almost impossible to predict November's outcome by national polls
alone since the battle is fought by separate elections in the 50
states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   And few average Americans have the time or inclination to sort
through the state polls to figure out which states are key for each
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people are worrying about having to mow their lawn or
pick up the kids at ballet or Little League, rather than who's
going to win Michigan,'' said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, national polls often serve as the public's main
source of information about a presidential race, especially this
early.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates, their strategists and political analysts
watch a chess match involving the states, their voting histories
and local campaign issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't watch state by state, I look at the overall
view,'' said Robert Haydu, a 61-year-old businessman from St.
Augustine, Fla., who follows politics closely. For a more detailed
picture of the political landscape, ''I trust the good newspapers
and magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidency is decided by who can put together 270 electoral
votes. Each state has a share of votes based on population and
whoever wins a state claims all of its votes.
</P>
<P>
   National polls serve an important purpose, analysts say, by
providing insight on how candidates are doing with certain groups
like women or independents and on people's feelings about their
personal qualities and positions on issues, and by measuring broad
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a candidate is doing well or poorly, it usually shows up
across the board,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns acknowledge that the Republican Bush has had a
good two months with public opinion since the March primaries
settled the nominations. At that time, Democrat Gore had about
pulled even with the Texas governor after the bruising GOP contest
between Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain. Bush moved quickly to
the middle after his primary battle, while Vice President Gore has
kept up a steady mantra of criticism against his rival.
</P>
<P>
   A marked shift in the national polls, like the recent wave
showing Bush leading Gore, often signals that there is movement in
up to two dozen swing states, those that have been the most
competitive in recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a certain sense that a rising tide lifts all boats,''
said Charles Cook, editor of the Cook Political Report.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has led Gore in the vast majority of polls, Cook noted,
with most of Gore's leads or ties coming between the South Carolina
and Michigan primaries in late February, when McCain was strongest
and Elian Gonzalez dominated the news. Gore tried to capitalize on
the custody fight over the 6-year-old Cuban boy by arguing that the
case should be decided in family court as the Clinton
administration forcibly returned Elian to his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Americans felt the boy belonged with his father,
and many people viewed Gore's handling of the crisis unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
   In state polls, Gore leads in New York and California -- the two
largest states -- in several Northeastern states and his home state
of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leads in Texas and Florida -- the next two biggest states --
many Southern states, scattered Western states and in several
historically competitive states like Ohio, Kentucky and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Both are locked in close races in battleground states like
Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey and New Mexico, as well as some
where Gore should be strong like Wisconsin, West Virginia, Oregon
and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leads in 17 states that account for more than two-thirds of
the electoral votes needed to win. Gore leads in eight states with
fewer than half the needed votes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bush currently has the advantage in national polls,
Michigan State University political scientist David Rohde forecasts
a close election because of the lack of an incumbent and the strong
economy, which could help Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The national polls and state polls are not dependable yet,''
said Rohde. ''The public really hasn't turned its attention to the
presidential race. We won't have the public really focused on the
race until after the (August) conventions.''

<HEADLINE> Barge Traffic Threatens Marine Life  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of nature's oldest and most
primitive-looking fish and a tiny, golden-brown freshwater clam
could be driven to extinction by the federal government's
transformation of the upper Mississippi River into a commercially
navigable waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service said Thursday that the agency in
charge of maintaining the nation's water transportation systems is
placing the future of the already endangered pallid sturgeon and
Higgins' eye pearlymussel in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   At fault, the service says, is the Army Corps of Engineers'
60-year-old system of 37 locks and dams on the Mississippi and
Illinois rivers, plus its dredging operations and navigation
channel training stations that make the once-rocky and meandering
river system passable for large, commodity-laden barges.
</P>
<P>
   The decision could have enormous implications for the fierce
battle over whether the corps should move ahead with a $1 billion
project to double the length of seven locks.
</P>
<P>
   Agribusiness companies say massive lock expansions are crucial
to keeping transportation costs low as grain exports -- and barge
traffic -- rise. Otherwise, they say, Midwestern products will not
be able to compete on the global market.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say that river's fragile ecosystem would be
further endangered by more large-scale changes. They applauded the
service's decision as bolstering that argument.
</P>
<P>
   The corps is expected to complete this year a $54 million study
into what should be done, but its initial conclusions appear to
favor the expansion. That study became even more controversial in
February with allegations that top corps officials rigged the data
to justify the costly construction.
</P>
<P>
   Several investigations into those charges are pending, including
by the Army inspector general, the National Academy of Sciences,
the General Accounting Office and at least four congressional
committees.
</P>
<P>
   In its ''biological opinion,'' the Fish and Wildlife Service
does not order any changes to the current operation of the
navigation system.
</P>
<P>
   But it was conducted primarily to provide a baseline for another
round of negotiations if new construction is proposed. That process
could call for more drastic remedies such as changing dredging
procedures or alterations to dams, and that could make the proposed
project too expensive to undertake.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the corps must protect the pallid sturgeon, a large
fish with a shovel-shaped snout and long feelers, by creating new
backwater habitats. The pallid sturgeon has been on the endangered
species list for 10 years, mostly because of the loss of a
free-flowing, diverse river.
</P>
<P>
   The corps already spends $19 million a year to improve the
health of the Mississippi. Service officials could not estimate how
much it may cost to help the pallid sturgeon recover.
</P>
<P>
   For the 3-inch pearlymussel, listed since 1976 and now being
virtually smothered by invasive zebra mussels, the corps must
relocate significant numbers of them out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Galford, a spokeswoman with the corps' Mississippi Valley
Division, said the agency had no comment, as it has not had enough
time to review the opinion.

<HEADLINE> Stress May Help Women Live Healthier  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Women react to stress differently than men,
turning to their children and seeking out friends instead of using
the ''fight-or-flight'' reflex, according to a study out today.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California, Los Angeles study suggests that
the ''tend-and-befriend'' pattern keeps stressed women calmer.
Researchers say the response also may help explain why women are
less vulnerable to drug and alcohol abuse and stress-related
disorders such as hypertension than men.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers cited several hundred previous studies on rodents,
primates and humans to suggest a broad model of how women deal with
stress, although they admitted the hypothesis needs more testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Men and women do have some reliably different responses to
stress'' said lead researcher Shelley E. Taylor, a UCLA psychology
professor. ''I think we've really been missing the boat on one of
the most important responses.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that females facing a predator, disaster or a
particularly bad day at the office tend to respond by caring for
their offspring and seeking contact and support from others,
especially other females, the UCLA researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Such tendencies may explain why, for example, women are more
likely to telephone friends in a crisis, or why ''women ask for
directions and men don't,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The ''tend-and-befriend'' pattern may be linked to the hormone
oxytocin, which is released during stress and has been shown to
make rats and humans calmer, less afraid and more social,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Men secrete oxytocin, but male hormones seem to reduce its
effect, while the female hormone estrogen amplifies it, Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is intriguing, said Dr. Jean Chen Shih, a professor
of molecular pharmacology and toxicology at the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said her own studies have found that male mice will fight
an intruder placed in their cage but females will not.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just thinking when I'm stressed, what do I do?'' she
added. ''I think that I talk to my friends. When I have a problem,
I talk. In general, men don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Many human and animal studies have shown that females are more
social and less physically aggressive than males. However, the
''tend-and-befriend'' pattern hasn't shown up sharply in scientific
literature because until government grant policies changed in 1995,
women were underrepresented in stress studies, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The study is to be published late this year or early next year
in the Psychological Review of the American Psychological
Association.

<HEADLINE> NRA Opens Annual Convention  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The National Rifle Association opens its
129th annual convention in the crossfire of a superheated national
debate about guns, constitutional rights and public safety.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA says the issues have helped boost membership to a record
3.6 million, with a gain of 200,000 new members and $10 million in
donations within the last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And with the White House and both houses of Congress up for
grabs, leaders say the stakes have never been higher.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is the most important election in the history of
firearms ownership in the country,'' NRA Executive Vice President
Wayne LaPierre said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're either going to go down the road of registering every
firearm owner with the federal government, licensing every firearm
owner, federal tests,'' he said in today's Charlotte Observer. ''Or
we're going to be much better off with someone who will respect the
freedom, but also be much tougher on people who abuse the freedom''
to have a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting opens today, on the heels of last weekend's Million
Mom March in Washington, D.C., where tens of thousands of
protesters called for stricter gun controls and targeted the NRA as
a leading barrier to their objectives.
</P>
<P>
   NRA members will discuss gun politics, attend educational
seminars and view displays by more than 300 exhibitors, including
gun-makers, hunter associations and collectors. Workshop topics
include the arms of George Washington's army and tips on carrying
concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 40,000 people are expected at the four-day
convention. NRA leaders are far more upbeat than a year ago, when
the group met in Denver less than a month after the Columbine High
School massacre in nearby Littleton, Colo. The meeting was scaled
back to just a day, and gun exhibitions were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   One big question this year is how attendees will receive Smith &AMP;
Wesson. The nation's largest gun maker announced in March that it
would install locks on all the firearms it sells to safeguard them
from children, introduce ''smart gun'' technology within three
years and prohibit the sale of its weapons at gun shows without a
background check.
</P>
<P>
   While NRA leaders called Smith &AMP; Wesson's move an affront to the
Second Amendment, they said the company was still welcome, and the
Springfield, Mass., gun maker said it planned to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good for manufacturers like Smith &AMP; Wesson to hear from
their consumer base,'' said NRA spokesman Bill Powers. ''And it's
good for them to have the opportunity to respond to their
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of protesters were expected to converge on the
Charlotte Convention Center, but the NRA considers the Carolinas
friendly turf. Both North Carolina and South Carolina allow
residents to carry concealed weapons with a permit, and neither
state is expected anytime soon to pass gun-control measures such as
mandatory trigger locks and curbs on gun show sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be our biggest (convention) ever,'' Powers said.
''There's no question we enjoy a lot of support in the Carolinas
region, over to Kentucky and Georgia and southern Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlton Heston, 75, the NRA's president since 1998, is expected
to be elected to a third term Monday by the board of directors.
Presidents normally are limited to two one-year terms, but the
bylaws were amended last year to make an exception for Heston.
</P>
<P>
   Among the protesters will be Kristen Rand, director of federal
policy for the Violence Policy Center, a gun-control group based in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''We show up for two reasons. One, to give the other side of the
story,'' she said. ''Also, we want to watch the activities of the
convention, and we'll have people inside.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Hawks To Name Suhonen Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Maple Leafs assistant Alpo Suhonen will
be named the new head coach of the Chicago Blackhawks on Monday,
the Toronto Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to both the Maple Leafs and Blackhawks said
Suhonen has already agreed to terms with Chicago, the Star said.
</P>
<P>
   Suhonen, from Finland, would become the first European-born and
trained head coach in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   ''All that's left is the announcement,'' a source close to the
situation told the Star.
</P>
<P>
   Suhonen interviewed for the job on Sunday in Martha's Vineyard,
Mass., at the home of Blackhawks director of hockey operations Mike
Smith. He also spent Monday and Tuesday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   That Smith would be the first to hire a European head coach and
employ Suhonen is not a surprise. The former associate GM of the
Leafs has long been an admirer of European players and was
instrumental in Suhonen's career as a head coach in the minor
leagues and an assistant in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Suhonen might not be the only European head coach in the NHL
next season. Ivan Hlinka of the Czech Republic is expected to be
named to the same position with the Pittsburgh Penguins.

<HEADLINE> Avs, Stars Resume Sequel to 1999  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The rust on the chain-link fence outside
Colorado's practice rink seemed appropriate as the Avalanche
prepared for Game 3 of the Western Conference finals against the
Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it has been four days since the two teams faced off
in Texas, breeding impatience and anxiety in an evenly matched
best-of-seven series that resumes tonight at the Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd really like to get playing again,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ''It seems like a long time away. It feels like
you're starting over again. I've got a feeling you're going to see
a lot of fired up emotion on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and Avalanche, who played an entertaining series last
year, are dispelling the notion that reruns are boring. Tied 1-1
after two games, they are traveling an identical path that led to a
seven-game showdown won by Dallas in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look at the Eastern Conference finals, you look at our
finals. It's two wars,'' Colorado coach Bob Hartley said Thursday.
''I don't think the intensity will be going down. I think it's
going to keep picking up. It's two physical teams, two teams with
lots of speed and lots of great assets. It's going to be a long
test of endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche, 6-0 at home in the postseason, are proving to be
resilient, if not durable. They will be without defenseman Adam
Foote tonight as he recovers from an eye injury in Game 2, but his
partner, Ray Bourque, is set to return after missing four games
with a sprained left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be excited, probably a little nervous, but I feel happy
about being able to go and getting back into the lineup,'' Bourque
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the offense stymied in part by the Stars' trapping style,
Colorado's defense and goalie Patrick Roy helped the Avalanche gain
a split in the first two games despite Dallas' 58-40 shot
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Offense is your best defense,'' said Peter Forsberg, who leads
Colorado with six goals in the playoffs. ''If we spend more time in
their zone, of course it's going to be easier for our defense, but
it's easier said than done. They have a good team and they're
standing at the blue line real well.''
</P>
<P>
   After being shut out in Game 1, the Stars got an offensive boost
from its top line of Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen as
the three combined for three goals and three assists. It will be up
to Bourque and Aaron Miller to chase the trio tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have three different players,'' Hitchcock said. ''You have
one player tilted on the offensive side (Modano), one guy on both
sides (Hull) and the other one who is a defensive specialist. They
blend, but they all sacrifice for the good of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see all three guys able to do the dirty work. They all can
make a play and score, but each guy has a different personality in
his game and for whatever reason, when they go together, it
clicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado is seeking more production from its line of Joe Sakic,
Milan Hejduk and Dave Andreychuk. Hejduk scored in Game 1, but the
three were unable to keep up with Modano's line in Monday's 3-2
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't do a very good job last game,'' Sakic said. ''Game
1, we got the lead and in the third period, we sat back a bit, but
we've got to generate more shots. They do a good job of blocking
shots. We've got to do a better job of just getting through.''
</P>
<P>
   As they did last year, the Stars will be seeking to win at least
one game in Colorado before the series returns to Dallas for Game
5. The outcome could depend on Dallas goalie Eddie Belfour, who has
allowed 14 goals in four road games compared to just eight in eight
home games.
</P>
<P>
   ''First period is huge,'' Stars center Kirk Muller said.
''There's no sense of playing really good in the second and third
if you are down a couple of goals. You've got to try to take the
crowd out of the game and come in with a good, solid first period
and slow things down and go from there.''

   Dallas at Colorado (8 p.m. EDT). The Avalanche return home with
the Western Conference finals tied 1-1.
STAR:
Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   -- Rick Tocchet, Flyers, had a goal and an assist, helping
Philadelphia defeat New Jersey 4-2 to take a 2-1 series lead in the
Eastern Conference finals.
SEEING STRAIGHT:
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Avalanche defenseman Adam Foote said Thursday that his
vision ''is absolute normal'' after being hit in his right eye by
the errant stick of Dallas forward Jere Lehtinen in Game 2 of the
Western Conference finals Monday. Despite the injury, Foote will
sit out Game 3 against the Stars tonight and does not know when he
will be cleared to return to the ice. If Foote returns, doctors
will require him to wear a visor for the remainder of the playoffs.
SITTING OUT:
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia center Daymond Langkow missed Game 3 of the Eastern
Conference finals against New Jersey on Thursday night because of a
concussion. Langkow, who hadn't missed a game since joining the
Flyers in December 1998, was hurt in a collision with Devils
defenseman Scott Stevens about a minute after scoring the winning
goal in the Flyers' 4-3 victory in Game 2 Tuesday night. ... New
Jersey center John Madden also missed the game and will be out 2-3
weeks after hurting his right knee late in the third period in a
collision with Philadelphia center Keith Primeau.
SCOUTING:
</P>
<P>
   The International Hockey League announced Thursday its first and
second All-Star teams, as selected by the league's coaches. Topping
the first team were defenseman Brett Hauer of Manitoba and left
wing Steve Maltais of Chicago, who were both chosen for a second
consecutive year. The Chicago Wolves had the most All-Star
selections with five.
SPEAKING:
</P>
<P>
   ''More than anything we just felt we had to show people that we
could play in this building. I just sensed that our guys the last
couple of days were focused for the challenge and we came up with a
huge effort.'' -- Philadelphia center Keith Primeau on the Flyers'
Meadowlands jinx after a 4-2 road victory over New Jersey in Game 3
of the Eastern Conference finals. Philadelphia had a 4-22-2 record
at Continental Airlines Arena over the last five years, and was
0-7-1 in its eight previous games there.

<HEADLINE> Flyers 4, Devils 2  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers are leading
New Jersey in the Eastern Conference finals because Brian Boucher
has elevated his game to the level of Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher made 27 saves as the Flyers took a 2-1 lead over the
Devils in the best-of-seven series with a 4-2 victory Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But just one of them turned the game around.
</P>
<P>
   With the Flyers leading 2-1 early in the second period, Patrik
Elias got a short-handed breakaway, and seemingly made all the
right moves to tie the game. He avoided Boucher's poke check and
seemed to get the goalie out of position with a move across the
net.
</P>
<P>
   All he had to do was slide the puck into the net.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't count on was Boucher making like Hasek, a
two-time NHL MVP. Boucher flipped over from his stomach to his
back, threw back his glove hand and somehow stopped the puck from
sliding toward the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was his only chance to save that puck,'' said Elias, who
led the Devils with 35 goals this season. ''It was good sense on
his part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers stayed ahead and, a couple of minutes later, Rick
Tocchet scored his third goal in two games. Philadelphia, the team
everyone wrote off after losing Game 1, had its second straight
win.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Devils behind for the first time in the playoffs
heading into Game 4 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They have lost the momentum they gained in winning the opening
two rounds of the playoffs and Game 1 in Philadelphia on Sunday,
and they still have to figure out a way to beat Boucher, who had 35
games of NHL experience coming into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''That save he made was huge,'' Devils forward Randy McKay said.
''That would have tied the game up. It was a great save. He has
shown he is a quality goaltender.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet knew that before the playoffs started.
</P>
<P>
   ''In practice, when you beat 'Bouche' he always throws his arm
back, he never gives us,'' Tocchet said. ''Dominik Hasek does that.
You think you have him beat and he'll throw a limb out. He figures
eight of 10 times he won't get it, but the other two times he will.
Bouche got it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Devils goalie Martin Brodeur wasn't as good on a night he only
faced 21 shots. He had trouble handling two long shots to start the
game, and he never seemed to get comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Recchi beat him between the legs on a back-hander early in
the first period on a 2-on-1. Keith Jones scored on a rebound later
in the period -- one of two goals set up by Keith Primeau -- to give
the Flyers a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet's goal in the second period gave Philly a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the Devils narrowed the margin to 3-2 on Scott
Niedermayer's goal with 4:01 to play, Simon Gagne closed out the
scoring with back-hander after avoiding a poke check by Brodeur,
who didn't seem to move well on the play.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the worst game I've played in the playoffs,'' said
Brodeur, who has now given up eight goals in the last two games
after giving up 16 in the first 11 playoff contests. ''I let the
guys down. I just didn't come through.''
</P>
<P>
   Devils coach Larry Robinson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this will go down as one of his better ones, but
he's been keeping us in most games,'' Robinson said. ''It's about
time we returned the favor. We had some opportunities and the other
kid played pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   While Brodeur will have to play better, the difference between
winning and losing in this series has been small.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did we make mistakes? Yes,'' said Claude Lemieux, who scored
the Devils' other goal. ''Did we make more mistakes than them? No.
Did we have as many or more chances than they did? Yes. The bottom
line is the kid had a great performance and we didn't bury our
chances.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils usually do that against the Flyers. The loss was only
the fifth in 29 games (22-5-2) against Philadelphia in the past
five years. It also snapped an eight-game winless streak (0-7-1)
here.
</P>
<P>
   The loss gives home-ice advantage back to Philadelphia, and the
Devils will have to win three of the final four games in the series
to advance to the Stanley Cup finals for the first time since 1995.
Philadelphia last went in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a desperate hockey game, no doubt about it,'' Devils
center Jason Arnott said of Game 4 on Saturday night. ''It's
do-or-die game. We have to go into it thinking we have to win the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers also have some concerns heading into the game.
</P>
<P>
   John LeClair was cut in the face by Brodeur's stick in the third
period and needed 36 stitches on the right side of his nose and
three under his eyelid.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair, who leads the Flyers with six playoff goals, plans to
play on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Devils, so does Boucher.

   Arizona at N.Y. Mets (7:10 p.m. EDT). The first-place
Diamondbacks visit New York in a rematch of last year's NL Division
Series.
STARS:
Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   -- Mark McGwire, Cardinals, homered three times and had a
career-high seven RBIs, leading St. Louis over Philadelphia 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   -- Denny Hocking, Twins, was 5-for-6, including two doubles and a
two-run homer, as Minnesota beat Oakland 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   -- Alex Ochoa, Reds, had an RBI single with one out in the bottom
of the 10th inning, lifting Cincinnati over Pittsburgh 4-3.
SWAT HISTORY:
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Mark McGwire homered three times to pass Mickey
Mantle for eighth place on the career list in the Cardinals' 7-2
win over Philadelphia on Thursday night. McGwire has 539 homers,
Mantle had 536. Next up is Mike Schmidt at 548. It was the 64th
multihomer game of McGwire's career, breaking a tie with Willie
Mays for the second-most ever. Babe Ruth had 72.
SNAPPED:
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Stan Spencer won for the first time in 14 starts as
the Padres beat Florida 6-2 Thursday night. Spencer had not earned
a victory since his major league debut on Aug. 27, 1998, against
Philadelphia, going 0-8 with a 7.20 ERA in that span. ... Minnesota
ended a five-game skid with a 10-5 victory over Oakland.
SIDELINED STAFF:
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland pitchers Jaret Wright, Charles Nagy and Ricardo Rincon
were placed on the 15-day disabled list Thursday.
SWIPED:
</P>
<P>
   Florida stole 10 bases -- one short of the modern NL record -- yet
still lost to San Diego 6-2 Thursday night. The post-1900 NL record
of 11 was set by the New York Giants in 1912 and tied by St. Louis
in 1916. The modern major league mark of 15 was set by the New York
Highlanders, later the Yankees, in 1911. The last time an NL club
had 10 steals in a game was June 30, 1996, when Colorado did it
against Los Angeles.
STREAKING:
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati is 5-0 in extra-inning games and won for the ninth
time in 11 games after a 4-3, 10-inning win over San Francisco on
Thursday. ... Frank Catalanotto set a Texas record by reaching base
12 straight times, and extended his streak of consecutive at-bats
with hits to a team-record 10 in an 8-7 win over Baltimore.
STRUGGLING:
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore has dropped 13 of 15, including an 8-7 loss to Texas
on Thursday night.
SLOPPY WEATHER:
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, rain washed away the Houston-Milwaukee
doubleheader, Colorado at New York, and Los Angeles at Chicago.
Detroit and Cleveland were in the top of the fourth when their game
was called as well.
SWINGS:
</P>
<P>
   Before striking out twice in Thursday night's 8-6 loss to
Arizona, Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero struck out just 12 times in
38 games.
STROLLING:
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Ken Griffey Jr. walked four times in a 4-3,
10-inning win over Pittsburgh on Thursday.
STRONG START:
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Greg Maddux allowed two runs and six hits over seven
innings as the Braves defeated San Francisco 3-2 Thursday.
SIX IN A ROW:
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won their sixth straight and handed the Giants their
sixth consecutive loss, 3-2 Thursday.
SETTING AN EXAMPLE:
</P>
<P>
   While the Atlanta Braves have the best record in the majors,
28-12, their top farm team, the Triple-A Richmond Braves of the
International League, have the worst record in professional
baseball, 9-32.
STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Greg Maddux improved to 10-0 against the Giants in 10
starts with the Braves. ... Montreal second baseman Jose Vidro
hasn't committed an error through the first 38 games of the season
and has gone 43 straight games without an error, dating to last
season. ... St. Louis has homered in 36 of 40 games and is on pace
to hit 344, shattering the record of 264 set by the 1997 Seattle
Mariners.
SCOUTING:
</P>
<P>
   James Madison left fielder Greg Miller went 7-for-7 with three
home runs and nine RBIs -- all records -- as the Dukes outlasted
Richmond 24-21 in an elimination game Thursday in the Colonial

Thursday's 3-2 win over San Francisco, after surrendering nine
hits, six earned run and five walks in his previous 3 1-3 innings.
SEASONS:
May 19:
</P>
<P>
   1910 -- Cy Young won his 500th game as the Cleveland Indians
defeated Washington 5-4 in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   1933 -- The Ferrell brothers -- Rick and Wes -- homered in the same
game for the only time in their careers. Rick hit his homer against
his brother.
</P>
<P>
   1960 -- Juan Marichal, in his first game with the San Francisco
Giants, pitched a one-hitter to beat the Philadelphia Phillies 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   1968 -- After hitting 10 home runs in six games, Frank Howard of

Wilson, who won the game 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   1981 -- Pittsburgh's Jim Bibby gave up a leadoff single to Terry
Harper of the Atlanta Braves, then retired the next 27 batters for
a 5-0 one-hitter. Bibby also hit two doubles.
</P>

   1998 -- Mark McGwire hit three two-run homers against
Philadelphia. It was the second time this season and fourth time in
his career McGwire hit three homers in a game. McGwire became the
12th player to have two three-homer games in a season.

   Miami at New York (9 p.m. EDT). Another installment in one of
the NBA's fiercest rivalries, as the Knicks try to send this
Eastern Conference semifinal series to a seventh game.
SOARING:
</P>
<P>
   As the New York Knicks returned from Miami early Thursday
morning, a jet blast from the charter plane lifted coach Jeff Van
Gundy's car airborne and sent it hurdling over three other
vehicles. Also extensively damaged were Knicks guard Allan
Houston's 1997 Mercedes, assistant coach Brendan Malone's 1999
Lincoln, and the car belonging to the team's media relations
director. The four cars were driven onto the tarmac at Westchester
County Airport, near the team's suburban New York headquarters, as
the charter arrived at 3 a.m. EDT.
SINGLE NO MORE:
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant confirmed he is engaged on
Thursday, but refused to identify his future bride. He did say,
however, she's not an athlete or actress. A member of the Lakers'
organization, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Bryant,
21, is engaged to an 18-year-old woman from Orange County.
STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 previous best-of-seven playoff series that have been
tied 2-2, the team that won Game 5 has gone on to win the series 84
times.
SEEKING A COACH:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's courtship of St. John's coach Mike Jarvis for
the Washington Wizards coaching job, now official with all the
appropriate people notified, became a long-distance affair Thursday
with the Red Storm coach back in New York and Jordan still in
Washington. As talks continued, it became clear Jordan will not
meet his self-imposed Sunday deadline for naming a new coach. A
team source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were no
plans to announce a new coach until early next week.
STATUS:
</P>
<P>
   George Irvine wants to be the Detroit Pistons' head coach, and
the club wants to clear the ''interim'' from his title. However,
reaching contract terms has been anything but a slam dunk, Irvine's
attorney said Thursday. He did not elaborate on whether the
differences were over money, the contract's length or both. Pistons
vice president Joe Dumars told The Detroit News that the sides were
far apart, but the gap could be bridged.
SPEAKING:
</P>
<P>
   ''The difference with a guy like (Shaquille O'Neal) and maybe
Karl Malone is they have so much brute strength that it kind of
almost makes it unfair that they're going to also get the benefit
of the majority of the calls. But that's the way this league has
always been and always will be, and all you can really hope for is
some semblance of fairness.'' -- Portland guard Greg Anthony on
playing against O'Neal and the Lakers.

<HEADLINE> Professor Tests for Juiced Baseball  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWELL, Mass. (AP) -- Baseball officials, trying to make sure the
ball isn't juiced, hired an engineering professor to poke and prod
it and even planned a trip to the factory in Costa Rica to see how
it is made.
</P>
<P>
   All they had to do was ask Ted Sizemore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know what they're going to find out: The ball hasn't
changed,'' said Sizemore, who played with Los Angeles, St. Louis,
Philadelphia and Boston before becoming a senior vice president at
Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing's changed in the 16 years I've been here, and people
that have been here before me tell me major league baseball has
never asked them to change the ball. I'm not down at the factory
every day, but I can tell you that everything is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Batters hit a record 931 homers in April -- 105 more than in the
first month of the 1996 season. There was an average of 2.56 homers
per game this April, up 15 percent from the 2.22 hit in the first
month of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the smaller ballparks, bigger hitters and expansion-era
pitching explain much of the surge, there are also those who
suspect that something more sinister is afoot, like a conspiracy to
doctor the ball.
</P>
<P>
   It's not sluggers such as Mark McGwire hitting 70 homers as much
as it is Reds reliever Danny Graves hitting one -- he got his first
career hit last week with a 349-foot shot over the wall of one of
baseball's new bandboxes, Enron Field in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While denying the ball has changed, baseball officials will be
in Costa Rica on Monday to tour the Rawlings plant where it is
made. The commissioner has also commissioned an engineering
professor at the University of Massachusetts to see what he can
find out.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a fan, it's exciting to see the home runs. But I guess you
want to see the integrity of the game maintained as it had been in
the past,'' said Jim Sherwood, who runs the Baseball Research
Center at the UMass-Lowell campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to answer whether the ball is part of the problem
or not, whether it's hotter than it's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings has been the major leagues' exclusive supplier of
baseballs since 1977, making each one with a cork center surrounded
by four different windings of yarn: four-ply gray wool, three-ply
white wool, three-ply gray wool and finally a thinner cotton yarn
that gives the ball a smoother surface. It is weighed and measured
at each step.
</P>
<P>
   The leather cover -- the switch from horsehide to cowhide came in
1974 -- is inspected for 17 potential imperfections, from stretch
marks to scars, and then it is stitched on by hand. The ball is
checked to make sure it fits the major league specifications of
five ounces, and nine inches around.
</P>
<P>
   The ball is also required to have a specific hardness, or
''coefficient of restitution,'' which is measured by firing it at a
piece of northern white ash, 2{ inches thick. The ball's speed is
measured as it comes out of the gun, and it must rebound at 54.6
percent its original speed, plus or minus 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The ball also must hold its shape within 0.08 of an inch after
being subjected to 65 pounds of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sherwood did say that he will make sure the balls being
used meet the specifications in the rule book, his deal with
baseball requires him to keep his methods secret. Another thing he
cannot do is compare the balls to those used in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''The materials of the baseballs change -- temperature and
humidity, these affect the ball. You can't really go backwards
unless we find some preserved baseballs,'' he said. ''We're
starting to track a history of the baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood, who already certifies aluminum bats for the NCAA, said
he expects to have a report by mid-June. Sizemore said he's less
concerned about the test results than the perception that baseball
is fiddling with the ball to please homer-happy fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being a former player, and a traditionalist, I would never do
anything to change the ball,'' said Sizemore, who hit only 23 home
runs in his 12-year career -- one fewer than the Astros and their
opponents hit in a six-game homestand to open Enron Field this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can sit back and laugh to myself and say, 'I know this ball
hasn't changed.' But I have to defend that. So we test and retest.
That's all we can do. And we're the best at it in the world.''

<HEADLINE> 767 Engine Inspections Ordered  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is
ordering U.S. airlines to conduct emergency inspections of 120
Boeing 767 aircraft after mechanics found damaged bolts in one
plane's engine pylons.
</P>
<P>
   Under the emergency airworthiness directive issued Thursday,
airlines must inspect their planes in five or 10 days depending on
when the specific jetliner was manufactured, said FAA spokeswoman
Alison Duquette. Seven U.S. airlines, including two cargo carriers,
are affected by the order.
</P>
<P>
   The planes were considered safe to fly and are not being
grounded, although it was unclear whether the five-hour long
inspections would disrupt any flights.
</P>
<P>
   The directive applies to the first 230 Boeing 767s manufactured
after production began in 1982, said company spokeswoman Liz
Verdier. The type of bolt causing concern was phased out in the
late 1980s and replaced with an improved version.
</P>
<P>
   However, many airlines have continued using the original bolts
without problems, Verdier said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the affected planes, 120 are operated by U.S. carriers
including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Trans World Airlines,
United Airlines, US Airways, UPS and Airborne Express. The
directive doesn't apply to newer 767s used by these and other
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   While the planes operate worldwide, the FAA can only require the
inspection on U.S. carriers. Other countries normally follow the
U.S. lead in such inspection orders.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 767 operators have already begun inspections based
on early advisories from Boeing and the FAA, Verdier said. So far,
inspections of 20 additional aircraft have found no problems, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Boeing 767s two engines hangs beneath a wing on a
large pylon. Two smaller struts provide additional support to the
engine and each connects to the wing with two bolts, Verdier said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA issued the order after mechanics inspecting a 767 found
damage in three of the four bolts in the secondary supports for one
engine, Duquette said. One bolt had cracked and two had fractured.
She did not name the airline involved.
</P>
<P>
   The damaged bolts were made of a material, H-11 steel, and
appeared to have been unusually corroded.
</P>
<P>
   Under the directive inspectors must look for these types of
bolts and replace them if found, or perform an ultrasound
inspection to ensure they are not damaged, Duquette said. The
inspections will cost the U.S. fleet about $36,000, or about $300
per plane.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first 767 was delivered in 1982, about 900 have been
produced. The wide-bodied twinjet is the dominant plane on routes
between Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Three have been involved in fatal crashes -- a Lauda Air flight
in Thailand following mid-flight deployment of an engine thrust
reverser in 1991, a hijacking that ended when the plane ran out of
fuel and was ditched in the ocean and EgyptAir Flight 990, which
crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in October.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation investigators have not yet determined the cause of the
EgyptAir crash.

<HEADLINE> Feds Blame Selves for N.M. Fires  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Sitting in a dimly lit bar, watching
federal officials explain the mistakes that led to a devastating
wildfire, Danne DeBacker had one response: Mistakes? No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're just saying, 'Here's what happened.' We already know
what happened -- the damned forest burned down,'' said DeBacker,
whose home in the northwest part of Los Alamos was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sad, not just for my house, but for the forest,'' he said.
''Before these little black sticks were standing around here, we
had a really pristine forest.''
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report released Thursday by Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt concluded that National Park Service officials who
started the fire May 4 to clear brush did not follow proper
procedures and did not have enough fire crews on hand to keep it
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear there were large mistakes of agency oversight,''
Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The causal chain of this fire is quite complex. I would liken
it to what happens on a mountainside when a rock is dislodged,'' he
said. That one rock can create a ''cascading series of events.''
</P>
<P>
   Set at the nearby Bandelier National Monument, the blaze was
driven out of control by wind gusting to more than 50 mph. It
forced 25,000 people to flee, scorched more than 47,000 acres, left
405 families homeless and damaged the storied Los Alamos nuclear
weapons laboratory. The fire was 70 percent contained Thursday, and
officials said they hoped to have it completely corralled by late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt and federal lawmakers pledged to work on legislation to
pay all fire victims for losses not covered by insurance or
emergency assistance. The White House also said the government will
accept responsibility and take care of those who lost homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The report found a ''number of critical deviations from both the
prescribed fire plan and standard fire practices'' -- including not
putting firefighters on standby before starting the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Bandelier employee Mike Powell, who directly oversaw the
prescribed burn, notified firefighting dispatchers in Santa Fe the
morning of May 4 that the burn was to take place that evening. A
dispatcher expressed concern because the Forest Service had
suspended prescribed burns as a result of high winds and dry
weather, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation found that the plan was not ''substantively
reviewed'' before it was approved by Bandelier Superintendent Roy
Weaver, who has taken responsibility for the blaze and been placed
on leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a tendency to rubber-stamp decisions made by people at
the field level,'' Babbitt said. ''That is an unacceptable
paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver has declined interviews and there was no answer Thursday
at his home. There was no listing for Powell in northern New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for the fire's escape on May 7. Fire crew
members started a backburn in a flat area full of dead wood in an
attempt to rob the fire of fuel and halt its southward advance off
the peak of Cerro Grande, where it was started.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the ''burnout'' should have been set further
north, in an area with less fuel and steeper slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the problem was the fact that Park Service
officials had requested a spot weather report for the wrong day and
were unaware that winds were predicted to increase, said John
Snook, a Forest Service official who was one of the investigators.
Those steady winds blew to the northeast and pushed the flames over
a ridge, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the fire topped the ridge, winds carried embers outside the
prescribed burn area and the fire established itself on the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   From there it moved steadily toward Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the fire swept out of control, the National
Weather Service said it had sent Bandelier officials a special
forecast on May 4 indicating maximum potential for fire growth,
with increasing wind and temperatures and lower-than-usual
nighttime humidity.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators made no mention of the weather report
specifically but questioned the value of a measurement it quoted --
the Haines Index, which describes the potential for fire growth.
The report on May 4 said the Haines Index was at 6, its highest
rating.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department said Thursday it could cost as much as
$150 million to clean up Los Alamos National Laboratory and reopen
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Los Alamos has been hit by an 18-wheeler, and the government
was driving that 18-wheeler,'' Gov. Gary Johnson said at Babbitt's
news conference. He asked the people of New Mexico to ''give the
government a chance to make good on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal and Judy DeHaven, who lost their home of 23 years, were at
the bar with DeBacker.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of irresponsibility here,'' DeHaven said.
''They weren't prepared for what happened. This confirms our
suspicion that they burned our houses down and they owe us
something.''

<HEADLINE> N.H. Votes To Repeal Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
By GENE JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire's governor promised to veto a
bill that would repeal the death penalty, something no state has
done since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to
resume 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeanne Shaheen was expected to veto the bill as soon as she
received it -- as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some murders so heinous that the death penalty is an
appropriate punishment, and, accordingly, I will veto this
legislation,'' said Shaheen, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate passed the measure 14-10 Thursday, endorsing a
House vote taken in March.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's Legislature is just the second to vote to repeal
the death penalty since the Supreme Court's decision in 1976. A
repeal passed in 1979 by Nebraska lawmakers was vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's vote was largely symbolic. No one is on death
row in New Hampshire, and the state had the lowest murder rate in
the nation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the vote also reflects a growing nationwide movement to
reconsider executions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vote today is indicative of what many persons are
beginning to realize about the death penalty -- that it is
unnecessary, there are other ways to ensure safety,'' said Steven
Hawkins, director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Republican Gov. George Ryan of Illinois suspended
all executions pending a task force study. The decision followed
the release of 13 death row inmates deemed wrongly or unfairly
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton since has asked governors to examine their use
of the death penalty. Even conservatives such as religious
broadcaster Pat Robertson have encouraged states to review
procedures to ensure they don't discriminate against minorities or
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, state Sen. Burt Cohen, who sponsored the bill,
said the death penalty is applied disproportionately to both
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are facing execution because of who they are, not what
they did,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 87 people have been released from death rows since
1973, according to the Washington-based Death Penalty Information
Center. But executions are on the rise, with 3,600 people on death
row. Thirty-eight states, the federal government and the military
have the death penalty, though some have not yet used it.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire Senate vote fell short of the 16 votes needed
to override a veto. The 400-member House approved the repeal in
March 191-163, also well short of the two-thirds necessary for an
override.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of the death penalty, Republican state Sen. Richard
Russman said it promotes justice, and New Hampshire has taken a
cautious approach by rarely imposing it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot turn our backs on a lot of the victims, the victims'
families,'' he said. ''It may sound harsh, but I think it does
serve a legitimate purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's death penalty applies only to a short list of
crimes, including murder of a law enforcement officer, murder for
hire, and murder during a rape or attempted rape. The state has
averaged 21 homicides a year in the past decade, most of which are
not punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty supporter Paul Cassell, a professor at the
University of Utah College of Law, said capital punishment
procedures will withstand closer national scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly a number of states are reassessing their death penalty
procedures to make sure they are fair and accurate,'' he said. ''I
think when that reassessment is completed everyone will agree that
the death penalty procedures we have really are the most fair
procedures we have in the criminal justice system today.''

<HEADLINE> 8 Bow Out of Clinton Disbarment Case  </HEADLINE>
By KELLY P. KISSEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Only six members of a state panel that
could strip President Clinton of his law license will hear the case
after a majority said they didn't want to handle the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Eight members of the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on
Professional Conduct bowed out prior to today's scheduled meeting.
The panel may consider two requests that Clinton be disciplined for
lying under oath in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   The committee did not say Thursday why any of the eight
committee members recused themselves. Five had contributed to
Clinton's presidential campaigns or to other Democratic Party
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While the panel has 14 members, it meets in seven-member
sessions. Alternates are taken from another pool of seven members
as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Four votes are needed to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is heartening to know that Arkansas Committee members who
have recused themselves for apparent or perceived political reasons
are helping to maintain the integrity of this process,'' said
Matthew Glavin, president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation of
Atlanta, which filed one of the two complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation and U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright
referred Clinton to the conduct committee, saying the president
lied under oath in the Jones case by denying he had a sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Wright also cited Clinton for civil contempt last year and fined
him $90,000 for giving ''intentionally false'' testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin has said he wants Clinton disbarred for the lies and for
obstructing justice. Wright has not publicly suggested a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seeks something no harsher than a letter of reprimand,
Glavin said last week, citing Clinton's still-unreleased response.
</P>
<P>
   The committee would not announce any sanctions for at least 30
days to give Clinton time to request a hearing, Reeves said. A vote
of ''no action'' or a letter of warning would be kept under seal,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani: No decision announced at town hall meeting  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani expressed regret at
his handling of the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man,
but offered no hint on whether he would continue his run for the
U.S. Senate in the face of treatment for prostate cancer and a
crumbling marriage
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't reached any conclusions. I'm going to try to reach
conclusions as soon as I can,'' he told MSNBC moderator Andrea
Mitchell at an hour-long town hall meeting broadcast nationally on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republican officials were invited to join Giuliani at
the 92nd Street Y on Manhattan's Upper East Side, where the town
hall was held. Meanwhile, a campaign aide was sent to Buffalo to
prepare for the state GOP convention, which will nominate a Senate
candidate in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Both developments fueled speculation that the mayor, who
announced his illness three weeks ago, might make a political
announcement Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Though the mayor offered no hints on his Senate plans, he did
answer a variety of other questions on topics ranging from crime to
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked frequently by Mitchell whether he regretted some of his
most controversial actions of the past year, the mayor said he had
made a mistake in his handling of the police shooting of Patrick
Dorismond, an unarmed black man killed in a recent scuffle with
undercover police.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was widely criticized for defending the police by
releasing Dorismond's police record to the public -- including
sealed details of a juvenile arrest. During the forum, Giuliani
said he was right to release the records, but also said he should
have been more understanding of the loss of a life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a mistake,'' he said. ''I should have also conveyed the
human feeling that I had, the compassion, the loss of the mother. I
think if I could do it over again, I would have tried to balance it
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Mitchell whether he has become more compassionate
because of his illness, Giuliani said ''something has to happen to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   In making a decision on treatment, Giuliani said he had
anticipated a different process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of approached it as if this was a big case, or a budget
decision,'' the former prosecutor said. But this decision he said,
''involves thinking about your life, mortality, the quality of your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   One audience member asked Giuliani how he could expect others to
look up to him as a moral leader, in light of his recent
acknowledgment of a close relationship with another woman and his
plans to separate from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I would just ask people to take a look at me as a
human being,'' he responded. ''I'm not a religious leader ... I'm a
governmental leader, and its my public records and my public
actions and the things that I do as the mayor that you should
mostly be concerned about, and your moral concerns ... should be
with your own private life.''
</P>
<P>
   He was interrupted by applause several times from the 900-person
crowd. Tickets were $20 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the mayor was insisting that he had not made a decision,
his campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, stood nearby smiling -- a
marked contrast to his gloomy outlook last week when it appeared
the mayor would pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has repeatedly said his decision on treatment would
precede any announcement on whether he would stay in the Senate
run.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's three options for treatment are surgery, external
beam radiation and radioactive seed implantation. The 15-year
survival rate is 95 percent for surgery and 60 to 70 percent for
the two less invasive options.
</P>
<P>
   The past three weeks have been particularly rocky for the mayor,
both because of his cancer diagnosis and his announcement that he
would seek a legal separation from wife Donna Hanover. He went
public with the latter decision only after questions arose about
time he is spending with Manhattan divorcee Judith Nathan, a woman
whom he has called a ''very good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover retaliated with a news conference in which she accused
her husband of previously having had a relationship with one of his
aides, a charge Giuliani has denied.
</P>
<P>
   At the forum Thursday evening, he said he ''has not always put
his family first,'' but declined to answer questions about Nathan.

<HEADLINE> FBI Memo Cites Fund Probe Pressure  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hinting at political pressure in the earliest
days of the Democratic fund-raising scandal, FBI Director Louis
Freeh wrote a memo suggesting a top prosecutor was being urged not
to proceed with the investigation in order to protect Attorney
General Janet Reno's job.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, turned over belatedly to Senate investigators this
week, also discloses that Freeh wanted Reno and Justice Department
public integrity chief Lee Radek to step aside from the
investigation as early as December 1996 because of purported
comments made by Radek.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was described to The Associated Press on Thursday by
several government officials who have seen it since the FBI turned
it over to be produced to the Senate and House Judiciary committees
investigating the fund-raising matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dec. 9, 1996, memo to Deputy FBI Director William J.
Esposito, Freeh recounted, thirdhand, comments Radek allegedly made
to Esposito suggesting he was being pressured in connection with
the investigation into Democratic fund-raising improprieties during
President Clinton's 1996 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I also advised the attorney general of Lee Radek's comment to
you that there was a lot of 'pressure' on him'' and the
department's public integrity section ''regarding this case because
the attorney general's job might hang in the balance (or words to
that effect),'' Freeh wrote Esposito three days after meeting with
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, portions of which were read to the AP by the sources,
does not state where the pressure was coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Radek, whose public integrity section investigates allegations
against government officials and handled the early stages of the
fund-raising probe, said late Thursday the memo's description of
the conversation has ''no basis in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo was written just weeks after the first allegations of
Democratic fund-raising improprieties from the Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were reports in Washington speculating
whether Reno would serve a second term as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Though she steadfastly resisted an independent prosecutor for
fund-raising, Reno named a total of seven independent counsels to
investigate the president and his administration -- at times
angering Clinton's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh wrote Esposito that he met with Reno and told her about
Radek's purported comments and suggested ''on that basis'' both
Radek and Reno should step aside from the investigation, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached late Thursday, Radek said he never was under pressure to
scrap the investigation to help Reno and did not recall ever making
such comments to Esposito.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no recollection of ever saying I was under pressure
because the attorney general's job hung in the balance. Nor is it
something I would have said because it has no basis in fact,''
Radek said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman John Collinwood declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said: ''This attorney
general has never let her own self-interest color her own decision
making. She bases her decisions on the law and the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also turned over a second memo from Freeh that discloses
that early in the fund-raising probe the Justice Department tried
to bypass FBI agents for investigative work, relying instead on
inspector general investigators from the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh wrote his general counsel that he was concerned the bureau
was being cut out of the fund-raising probe, the officials said,
describing the memos.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the Freeh memo comes at a sensitive time for
the FBI and Justice Department, whose relations have been strained
by public disputes over the investigations into China espionage and
fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials told the AP that Reno has received an
internal report on the government's handling of the case of nuclear
lab scientist Wen Ho Lee that criticizes the FBI.	   The Freeh memo involving
the fund-raising issue emerges more
than two years after Congress first began reviewing the conduct and
quality of the criminal fund-raising investigation, in which
several Democratic donors and fund-raisers have been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the FBI did not disclose the existence of the
memo to Justice officials until late last month and that it wasn't
turned over to Senate investigators until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers mostly have focused on debates within Justice and the
FBI in 1997, 1998 and 1999 to name an independent prosecutor to
take over the probe of Clinton and Vice President Al Gore's
fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh and the former head of the Justice task force that ran the
investigation both have acknowledged they fervently argued for
appointment of a special prosecutor, but Reno turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   But Freeh's memo provides the first evidence that such arguments
dated to the very beginning of the investigation in late 1996 and
were based in part on concerns about possible political pressure.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- One day made all the difference for the
Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   A day after getting shut out on four hits at Seattle, the Twins
had 18 hits -- five by Denny Hocking and four by Jacque Jones -- in a
10-5 win over the Oakland Athletics on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eighteen hits, that's a lot of hits,'' said Jones, who had
four singles and two RBIs. ''Only in baseball can you get four hits
one day and 18 the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Hocking went 5-for-6, including two doubles and a two-run homer,
and the Twins snapped a five-game losing streak with their win over
the error-plagued A's.
</P>
<P>
   In the only other AL game Thursday night, the Texas Rangers
rallied to defeat the Baltimore Orioles 8-7. Detroit's game at
Cleveland was rained out.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a triple to hit for the cycle, Hocking drove a ball just
foul down the left-field line in the ninth, then struck out.
Hocking said he came to bat knowing he needed a triple.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the stuff going on, I wasn't watching the ball, but I
was watching the umpire to see if his hand was going to go up (to
signal a foul ball),'' said Hocking, who raised his average from
.235 to .276. ''I was pretty nervous. That was exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hocking had three RBIs for the Twins, who squandered a 5-0 lead,
then broke open the game with four runs in the seventh. Minnesota
had 18 hits after getting just 16 while losing three games at
Seattle this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''One game is not going to say we're out of the woods, but we
did play pretty well,'' Twins manager Tom Kelly said. ''We'll see
what happens tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey Koskie also had an RBI single for Minnesota. Matt Lawton
and Butch Huskey had run-scoring groundouts, and the Twins scored
three unearned runs as the A's made four errors while losing their
third straight game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to shore up the defense. We just have to catch the
ball better,'' A's manager Art Howe said. ''Generally speaking,
when you make errors, you're going to lose. You give teams extra
outs, and it's going to hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Redman (3-0), making his third start of the season after
eight relief appearances, allowed only five runners -- and all five
scored. He pitched six innings, giving up five runs and five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde and Miguel Tejada hit two-run homers for the A's,
and Terrence Long had an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Vizcaino (0-1), the second of four A's pitchers, was the
loser. He allowed one run and three hits in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota scored three in the first and led 5-0 in the third
inning. The A's tied the game with three in the third and Tejada's
sixth homer of the season in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey broke the tie in the sixth, and Hocking hit his second
homer of the season as the Twins made it 10-5 in the seventh. It
was just the seventh win in 20 road games for Minnesota this
season.
</P>
<P>
   A's starter Kevin Appier, making his second start since missing
three weeks with a strained right forearm, lasted just three
innings. Appier, who made his 300th career appearance, allowed five
runs on nine hits. Only two of the runs were earned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't good, but you have to credit the Twins. I messed up a
little, but they hit a bunch of good pitches for hits. Before I
knew it I was done,'' Appier said. ''They stockpiled a number of
hits. It was a bummer night for us.''
</P>
<P>
Rangers 8, Orioles 7
</P>
<P>
   David Segui hit a three-run homer to cap a six-run sixth as
Texas defeated visiting Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lamb had three doubles and Frank Catalanotto had three hits
for the Rangers, who have won four straight. Rick Helling (6-1) won
his fourth straight decision despite allowing seven runs, 10 hits
and four walks in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto had 10 consecutive hits in a span of three games, a
team record.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, who have lost 13 of 15, wasted a 7-2 lead. B.J.
Ryan (1-3) was the loser.

By The Associated Press	   The Florida Marlins stole their way to a loss.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They swiped everything but the game Thursday night, stealing 10
bases against San Diego -- one short of the modern NL record.
</P>
<P>
   But Stan Spencer won for the first time in 1{ seasons, leading
the Padres to a 6-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out they were
going to run on him,'' San Diego manager Bruce Bochy said.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo and Cliff Floyd stole three bases each and Mark
Kotsay and Preston Wilson swiped two apiece for the Marlins, who
were 10-for-10 on steal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The post-1900 NL record of 11 was set by the New York Giants in
1912 and tied by St. Louis in 1916. The modern major league mark of
15 was set by the New York Highlanders, later the Yankees, in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating to lose like this,'' Marlins manager John
Boles said. ''Ten stolen bases and only two runs. It makes you feel
like your skin is crawling. 'You think you've seen it all, but I
haven't seen this.''
</P>
<P>
   In other NL games, it was St. Louis 7, Philadelphia 2; Atlanta
3, San Francisco 2; Arizona 8, Montreal 6; and Cincinnati 4,
Pittsburgh 3 in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's doubleheader at Milwaukee was rained out, along with
Los Angeles' game at Chicago and Colorado's game at New York.
</P>
<P>
   At Miami, Spencer (1-1) won for the first time in 14 starts
since a victory in his major league debut, against Philadelphia on
Aug. 27, 1998. Spencer, 0-8 with a 7.20 ERA in that span, allowed
two runs and five hits in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''With me, it's no mystery. I think a lot of teams know they can
run on me,'' he said. ''We're going to have to work on some things,
I know it's something I need to get better at. I need to make sure
that if they take second, not to let them take third -- that's
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Fernandez (4-4) gave up three runs and nine hits in five
innings.
Cardinals 7, Phillies 2:
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire homered three times to pass Mickey Mantle for
eighth place on the career list, and he also had a career-high
seven RBIs. With his 64th multihomer game, he broke a tie with
Willie Mays for the second-most ever, behind only Babe Ruth (72).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely unbelievable, phenomenal to hear my name
mentioned with those guys,'' McGwire said. ''It means a lot to me,
but I have to worry about playing a game tomorrow. It's not like my
career is over. I think about those guys a lot, but until I retire,
it's not going to hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who took over the major league home-run lead with 17,
broke a tie with Mantle in the first inning when he hit No. 537, a
three-run drive off Curt Schilling (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit a two-run homer in the second inning -- only the 54th
to reach the left-field upper deck at Veterans Stadium -- to make it
5-0. He added a two-run shot in the eighth off Wayne Gomes for No.
539.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Stephenson (6-0) allowed two runs and nine hits in 5 2-3
innings.
Braves 3, Giants 2:
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux (5-1) improved his career record against San
Francisco to 10-0 in Atlanta, allowing two runs and six hits in
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker pitched a perfect ninth inning for his 10th save in
11 chances, finishing the Braves' sixth straight win and the
Giants' sixth loss in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta scored two runs on Maddux's bases-loaded grounder in the
sixth off Shawn Estes (2-2). The Giants turned a double play,
throwing out Maddux at first and getting Javy Lopez in a rundown,
but Trenidad Hubbard scored from third and the speedy Rafael Furcal
raced home from second.
Diamondbacks 8, Expos 6:
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the ninth inning
and Travis Lee added an RBI single as Arizona, which wasted a 6-2
lead in the fourth, stopped its second three-game losing streak of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun Kim (2-1) allowed one hit in two shutout innings at
Olympic Stadium, striking out four. Anthony Telford (4-3) allowed
Tony Womack's leadoff double in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks starter Brian Anderson allowed four homers,
including Lee Stevens' tying solo shot in the sixth.
Reds 4, Pirates 3:
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ochoa had an RBI single off Mike Garcia (0-2) with one out
in the 10th at Cincinnati. With their ninth win in the last 11
games, the Reds improved to 5-0 in extra innings this season.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Graves (6-0) pitched a perfect 10th for the win.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits 539th Home Run  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark McGwire made a few changes that paid
off in record-breaking fashion.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire broke ties with Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays, homering
three times and setting a career high with seven RBIs Thursday
night in the St. Louis Cardinals' 7-2 win over the Philadelphia
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a couple adjustments in the cage, but it's nothing
new,'' he said. ''I make adjustments all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is eighth on the career list with 539 homers, three
ahead of Mantle. McGwire's 64th multihomer game broke a tie with
Mays for the second-most ever. Babe Ruth had 72.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely unbelievable, phenomenal to hear my name
mentioned with those guys,'' McGwire said. ''It means a lot to me,
but I have to worry about playing a game tomorrow. It's not like my
career is over. I think about those guys a lot, but until I retire,
it's not going to hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who took over the major league home run lead with 17,
broke a tie with Mantle in the first inning when he hit No. 537, a
three-run drive off Curt Schilling (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit a two-run homer in the second inning -- only the 54th
player to reach the left-field upper deck at Veterans Stadium -- to
make it 5-0. He added a two-run shot in the eighth off Wayne Gomes
for No. 539.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you see greatness, whether it's athletics or
entertainment, it never gets old,'' St. Louis manager Tony La Russa
said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire struck out three times Wednesday night, forcing him to
work on his swing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's made big improvements since his first few years,'' said
La Russa, who coached McGwire when he came up in Oakland. ''He
adjusts, He knows his swing. He'll figure out what he did wrong and
learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 17,137 -- the smallest crowd to watch McGwire this season --
paid to see the game at Veterans Stadium, and the actual attendance
looked even smaller.
</P>
<P>
   With the fifth three-homer game of his career, McGwire became
the only NL player with a pair of three-homer games in
Philadelphia; he also did it on May 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is 4-for-18 in his career against Schilling, with all
four hits being homers, including one on April 30. He was 0-for-6
with four strikeouts in the three-game series against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you face a guy like Schilling, who has owned me my whole
career, I see the best of the best,'' McGwire said. ''If he throws
93-94 to someone else, he throws 97-98 to me, with movement. I was
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't look at things as locked in, hitting the ball real
well. I look at it like constant adjustments. Last night I couldn't
hit a ball with a wet newspaper. Tonight, I centered some balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for McGwire on the career home run list is former
Phillies star Mike Schmidt at 548. McGwire received a standing
ovation after his second homer and fans booed loudly when he was
intentionally walked in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has homered in 36 of 40 games and are on pace to hit
344, shattering the record of 264 set by the 1997 Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, making his fourth start since offseason shoulder
surgery, allowed five runs and nine hits in six innings, walked
five and struck out five. With his second subpar outing in less
than a week. His ERA rose from 3.15 to 4.15.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pitched poorly; no excuses,'' Schilling said. ''I threw
balls in spots I didn't want and he did what he does with those
pitches. He's done it over 500 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Stephenson (6-0) allowed two runs and nine hits in 5 2-3
innings. The Cardinals are averaging 9.3 runs in his seven starts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Philadelphia made it 5-1 on a two-out double by Mickey
Morandini in the second, and Desi Relaford singled in a run the
sixth. ... The loudest cheers of the night came when the
Philadelphia Flyers scored in their 4-2 playoff win over the New
Jersey Devils. Twice after the fans erupted following a Flyers
goal, St. Louis catcher Mike Matheny called time and walked to the
mound. ... Stephenson is 3-0 against the Phillies, his former team.
... McGwire is averaging one homer per 5.5 at-bats this season.

<HEADLINE> Kiwi Skipper, Tactician Quit Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Russell Coutts, who skippered Black
Magic to a historic America's Cup victory in March, is quitting the
winning syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   As Team New Zealand announced Friday it contracted designer and
tactician Tom Schnackenberg and young helmsman Dean Barker for the
next defense, tactician Brad Butterworth announced that he and
Coutts were resigning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is with regret and sadness I must announce we have taken
the most difficult decision to leave the Team New Zealand
organization,'' Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can assure you that our decision was made only after the
most intensive consideration and personal soul-searching. It is
certainly the hardest decision either of us has ever had to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth said the pair failed to come to terms with a new
management structure for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reached the conclusion that we do not want to manage a
defense within the proposed structure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Peter Blake, Team New Zealand chief in two winning
campaigns, announced earlier this year that he was relinquishing
control of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Schnackenberg, Coutts and Butterworth had been expected to head
the new team.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in New Zealand suggested Coutts and Butterworth could
link with a yet-to-be named Swiss syndicate for the 2003 regatta.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were members of the team that wrenched the America's
Cup from Dennis Conner in San Diego in 1995 and returned for the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts skippered Black Magic to a 4-0 lead against Italian
challenger Prada in the best-of-nine final series off Auckland
before handing over the helm to Cup rookie Barker for the
series-clinching race.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Subdues Minicrisis  </HEADLINE>
By PEDRO SERVIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Rebellious soldiers who rose up
against the government surrendered to authorities early Friday to
end a four-hour standoff, a Paraguayan army colonel said.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Felix Dario Collante said that soldiers of the army's First
Division surrendered at 2:45 a.m. He refused to say how many turned
themselves in, but described them ''as a few active officers and a
retired general.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is totally under control,'' Collante said. He
said he ordered government tanks that had been called out to keep
the peace to return to an army base.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman Jaime Bestirred said Paraguayan President
Luis Gonzalez Macchi had imposed a 30-day state of emergency giving
him special powers to deal with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguayan media reports said 12 police officers had also been
detained. The officers were arrested in police headquarters,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   Collante said three congressmen also had been detained, although
it was unclear what role, if any, they had played in the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The uprising began when army vehicles barreled through downtown
Asuncion and parked in front of the legislative building late
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press photographer saw three armored personnel
carriers take up posts outside the building and heard some shots
fired. A strong explosion could be heard after the start of the
rebellion, which Interior Minister Walter Bower said began around
10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of injuries or deaths, and power was cut
in Asuncion shortly after the tanks took up position. Some air
force planes were seen flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Macchi appealed to Paraguayans to remain calm, telling
local radio: ''The crisis is under control.'' The heads of the air
force and navy, along with several army divisions, also publicly
expressed support for the president as Paraguayan television
broadcast developments into the early hours Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bower charged the rebellious soldiers were sympathetic to former
army strongman Lino Cesar Oviedo. But he did not elaborate on
details or say how many soldiers were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Marcelo Duarte, who was inside Congress at the time
that shots were heard, told local radio that at least two shots had
been fired at the building by the tanks outside.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the latest crisis for this landlocked South American
nation, which was last thrown into upheaval in March 1999 when
former president Raul Cubas was ousted and replaced by Gonzalez
Macchi after the shooting death of Vice President Luis Argana.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo, a former army general, is wanted by Paraguayan
authorities in connection with the assassination of Argana.
Authorities also said he has yet to complete a 10-year sentence for
a brief mutiny in April 1996 against former President Juan Carlos
Wasmosy.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo fled Paraguay after Cubas resigned and was granted
political asylum in Argentina, where he stayed before going into
hiding days before new Argentine President Fernando de la Rua took
office Dec. 10. At last report, he was claiming to be in a remote
area of Paraguay, making sporadic telephone contact with news media
and denouncing the government.

<HEADLINE> Dominicans Look Forward To Mejia  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- With a tumultuous
election finally decided, Dominicans are hoping Hipolito Mejia can
make good on promises to extend the economic boom of recent years
to the Caribbean nation's poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Elections Board declared the left-leaning
Revolutionary Party candidate president-elect after his opponents,
Danilo Medina and Joaquin Balaguer, withdrew Thursday from an
expected run-off on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Thursday night, Mejia promised ''a government of
national unity, a shared government that will rise above the
confrontation and partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   His victory in the race to succeed President Leonel Fernandez
came after two days of tension as officials recounted nullified
votes to see if they could decipher enough to put Mejia and running
mate Milagros Ortiz Bosch over the required 50 percent mark.
</P>
<P>
   With the count virtually complete, Mejia had 49.87 percent of
the vote, a hair shy of the 50 percent-plus margin needed to avoid
a runoff. Free-market advocate Medina of the governing Liberation
Party had 24.94 percent and the conservative Balaguer 24.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, a 59-year-old agronomist who cultivates the image of a
down-home farmer, charmed voters with his plain talk and folksy
sayings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hipolito will worry about Dominicans, the poor,'' said Rafael
Anduval, 63, who sells candy and cigarettes at a bus station on a
central Santo Domingo avenue. ''Leonel worried about international
business. The government should help Dominicans first.''
</P>
<P>
   Mejia tried to balance such populist appeal with assurances to
the country's elite, who largely supported the pro-business,
pro-trade policies of the outgoing Liberation Party government. He
pledged to continue streamlining the bureaucracy -- and to avoid
authoritarian-style tinkering with the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect to be an absolutely institution-oriented man and not
to depart from that juridical and legal frame,'' he said. ''My
strength is finance, management, the reordering of public things,
the making of institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, opponents warned of a repeat of the scandal-ridden
administration of the last Revolutionary Party president, Salvador
Jorge Blanco, who governed from 1982 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Dominicans who voted for Mejia ''are going to regret it,'' said
Reynaldo Pared, the Liberation Party delegate to the Central
Elections Board.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia will raise sales taxes gradually from 8 to 10 percent,
instead of the 12 percent proposed by the Liberation Party, said
Eduardo Tejera, one of his economic advisers. Mejia wants to lower
other tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Allies like to contrast Mejia's earnestness to the technocratic
style of Fernandez, a lawyer who is well-respected abroad but who
is often criticized at home as too aloof. Fernandez is retiring
because the Dominican Republic forbids successive terms.
</P>
<P>
   But there are striking similarities, too. Both represent a new
generation of Dominican leaders succeeding the trio who dominated
politics for 30 years -- Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, Juan Bosch and
Balaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Pena Gomez, Mejia's mentor, died in 1998. Bosch, Fernandez's
mentor, is ill and retired from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Balaguer, still a candidate at 93, retains astonishing influence
on Dominican politics. Despite being blind and practically unable
to walk, he virtually matched the much younger Medina's vote count.
</P>
<P>
   Pared said Medina made the decision to withdraw after Balaguer
said he was unable to guarantee that his Social Christian Reformist
Party could deliver enough votes to give Medina a second-round win.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the good of the country, we waive our right to participate
in a second round,'' Medina said as some frustrated party members
objected angrily.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez congratulated Mejia and applauded Medina for his
''greatness and generosity'' in not forcing a second round.
</P>
<P>
   International observers pronounced the election fair.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Teachers To Grade Parents  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Teachers in Chicago will send home a new type of
progress report next year -- one that evaluates Mom and Dad on their
parenting skills.
</P>
<P>
   The ''parent checklists'' won't contain letter grades but will
tell parents whether they're helping enough with homework or
getting their children to school on time, school officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Parents with low marks could be referred to a parent training
academy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The objective here is to help parents by continually
communicating with them and sending home a checklist that can serve
not only as an instructive instrument, but also as a reminder ...
of what they should be doing,'' said Paul Vallas, chief executive
officer of Chicago Public Schools.
</P>
<P>
   The checklists would be issued every five weeks for all
students, Vallas said. Items will include whether children are
dressed properly for school, fall asleep in class, wear their
glasses or attend class regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents criticized the idea as way to shift blame for poor
student performance onto parents instead of teachers and school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny O-Neal Holmes, father of a 15-year-old boy in Chicago
public schools, said parents who would heed the advice already pay
attention to their children at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can't even get people to come to school for a parent
conference, how can you get them to take a parenting class?''
Holmes asked.
</P>
<P>
   He called the parent report cards a ''smokescreen'' to divert
attention from the large number of students poised to fail the
eighth grade. On Wednesday, a dozen students at one elementary
school were arrested for starting a food fight after a counselor
announced half of the eighth graders would not graduate on time.
</P>
<P>
   Vallas dismissed those charges. He said the checklists are
simply a way to help parents guide their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all complain about the lack of parental involvement,''
Vallas said. ''Well, what about the parents? Let's do something
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patty Yoxall, a spokeswoman for the National Parent Teacher
Association, said she has not heard of other school districts
distributing parent checklists.
</P>
<P>
   She said the intention seems good, and may help open the lines
of communication between parents and teachers, but added it's too
early to tell how effective it might be.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reaction could be everything from grateful to sort of
irritated,'' Yoxall said.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Woestehoff, executive director of the Chicago reform group
Parents United for Responsible Education, said teachers who are
doing their jobs already call parents if a child is failing to wear
glasses or skipping class.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible items on the checklist -- such as whether a child
is going to bed at a proper time -- invade a family's privacy, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to have a relationship with the teacher,'' Woestehoff
said. ''It has to be face to face and personal. It can't be a
checklist, which I think is very cold.''

<HEADLINE> Armed Protesters Hold Fiji Premier  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- After months of simmering ethnic tensions in
Fiji, seven masked, armed men stormed parliament today and took the
prime minister and his entire Cabinet hostage, saying they had
seized power in the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen fired at least two shots from AK-47 rifles inside
parliament before locking up Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, his
Cabinet ministers and lawmakers of the ruling coalition in the
legislature's upper chamber. No injuries were reported among the
estimated 50 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry is Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister and his
year-old administration the first to be dominated by Indo-Fijians,
a fact that has angered some indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   George Speight, who described himself as the coup leader, said
he had seized power on behalf of all ethnic Fijians. He appointed
an opposition lawmaker as interim prime minister in Chaudhry's
place and suspended the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Mobs of youths rampaged through the streets of Suva after the
coup, burning and looting shops, while up to 5,000 people gathered
outside parliament chanting and cheering in support of the attack.
Happy truck drivers played reggae music.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke hung over the downtown area as dozens of stores -- which
are predominantly owned by ethnic Indians -- went up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Police imposed a curfew late today and troops fanned out across
the city to protect private property. There was no indication the
soldiers were moving to end the hostage standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said the ethnic Fijian-dominated armed forces ''are
passive but remain at the beck and call and the control of the
civilian government that is in place at this time that is headed by
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Chaudhry and his supporters were safe.
</P>
<P>
   President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara declared a state of emergency
and appealed to the hostage-takers to release the lawmakers. He
also urged the army and police to restore the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret to say what is happening today is not in accordance
with the constitution and is therefore unlawful,'' Ratu Mara said.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Fiji's police and army to try to put down the
revolt led to fears that the rebels may have widespread backing
from native Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   But one analyst said Speight had little support.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a person who is, I think, politically naive, personally
ambitious and eager for some limelight,'' said Pacific analyst
Professor Brij Lal of the Australian National University.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he represents any constituency except a group of
disgruntled Fijians.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight, the son of an opposition lawmaker, released a statement
saying he had taken control of Fiji, a local news Web site
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through these actions I am asserting ownership, am asserting
control and I am asserting executive power over Fiji. We have
revoked the constitution and have set that aside,'' Speight said,
adding that the coup leaders had also revoked the powers of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Tension has been building for months in Fiji between ethnic
Indians, who make up about 44 percent of the nation's 813,000
people, and the Fijians, who account for 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil came on the first anniversary of the election of
Chaudhry, who Fijian nationalists have accused of promoting
pro-Indian policies.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism centers mainly on attempts by Chaudhry to persuade
Fijian landowners to renew expiring leases on farmland held by
thousands of ethnic Indian tenants who are the core of his
political support.
</P>
<P>
   Both Australia and New Zealand called for the immediate release
of the hostages and a return to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm horrified that such an act should be carried out against a
democratically elected leader,'' said Australian Prime Minister
John Howard, who was on a visit to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff urged Fijians not to
support the power grab.	   ''The use of armed force to attempt to overthrow a
democratically elected government is utterly unacceptable to New
Zealand and other members of the international community,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Suva echoed that, saying: ''The consequences
of any unconstitutional seizure of power would be very
substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Fiji, Australian David Pitt, finance manager with
the Air Fiji airline, said some foreigners were preparing to leave
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sitiveni Rabuka, a former army colonel who led two coups in
1987, visited parliament and pleaded with the gunmen to surrender,
but they refused. Rabuka, who held power for 12 years after the
coups, was accompanied by senior army and police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji is a Pacific Ocean island group about 2,250 miles northeast
of Sydney, Australia.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Pa. Pier Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rescue crews picked through tangled planks
and floating debris early today, trying to determine why a pier
supporting a new outdoor nightclub collapsed into the Delaware
River.
</P>
<P>
   Three people died and 37 others were injured, including eight
rescue workers hurt trying to pull victims out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a loud crash, and then all hell broke loose. I went
straight down ... then I was just trying to fight my way up,'' said
bartender Joseph Capaci, 28.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 people were on the pier when it plunged into the
30-foot-deep water shortly after 8 p.m. Thursday. A canvas tent
over the pier also collapsed, blanketing many people who fell about
eight feet into the dark, murky water and bringing down the back
walls of an adjacent dance hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''One (patient) told me that they were standing there and
suddenly the floor gave out, the lights went out, and they were in
an ice bath,'' said Dr. Bartholomew Tortella of MCP Hahnemann
University Hospital, who treated victims and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The debris and darkness hampered rescue efforts, but authorities
said they did not believe anyone was still missing. Firefighter Joe
Whoriskey said rescue workers wore wetsuits but had to feel for
victims with their feet since they couldn't see.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all pancaked in there, the walls fell down on the
floor, then the ceiling, you had all kinds of deck furniture and
kitchen equipment,'' said Whoriskey, who was among the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Ten people remained hospitalized early this morning. At least
two were in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   The pier held a new bar, Heat, which opened last month and is
attached to a ballroom dancing area behind the upscale Moshulu
restaurant, a 394-foot boat docked on the river. The section that
collapsed was along the back wall of the ballroom facing the deck,
said Stephanie Franklin-Suber, the mayor's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   A hostess at the restaurant, Eve McCarney, said workers had
replaced some floorboards Wednesday but did not do any major
structural work. Fire and police officials were investigating, as
were officials from the Department of Licenses and Inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a pier collapsed on the New Jersey side of the
Delaware River, submerging at least five vehicles and causing about
$10 million in damage.

Allies Leave U.S. in Iran Deal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of America's best friends split away to approve $232
million in World Bank loans to Iran, despite intensive lobbying by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright. She made three arguments against the loans: That Iran
sponsors terrorism, has not adopted sound economic principles and should not be
rewarded while it conducts a ''show trial'' of 13 Jews on charges of spying for
Israel. The allies, including best-friend Britain and Germany, were not swayed,
and joined the majority of the 24-member bank executive board yesterday in
approving the loans.

N.H. Votes To Repeal Death Penalty
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire's governor promised to veto a bill that
would repeal the death penalty, something no state has done since the U.S.
Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume 24 years ago. Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen was expected to veto the bill as soon as she received it -- as early as
today. The state Senate passed the measure 14-10 Thursday, endorsing a House
vote taken in March. New Hampshire's Legislature is just the second to vote to
repeal the death penalty since the Supreme Court's decision in 1976.

Peru's Toledo Won't Enter May Runoff

<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's government says a presidential runoff election will
go forward on May 28, despite candidate Alejandro Toledo's decision not to
participate and a warning from the Organization of American States that it will
not endorse the vote. After the National Election Board rejected Toledo's demand
to push back the second-round vote until June 18, he called on supporters to
stage massive street protests this evening in Peru's major cities to force a
postponement.

Stress May Help Women Live Healthier
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Women react to stress differently than men, turning to
their children and seeking out friends instead of using the ''fight-or-flight''
reflex, according to a study out today. The University of California, Los
Angeles study suggests that the ''tend-and-befriend'' pattern keeps stressed
women calmer. Researchers say the response also may help explain why women are
less vulnerable to drug and alcohol abuse and stress-related disorders such as
hypertension than men.

   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguay's president said his administration had
subdued a ''mini-crisis'' amid reports late yesterday that rebellious soldiers
and police had risen up against his government. But it was unclear whether the
crisis had ended, since armored carriers remained posted outside the legislature
in downtown Asuncion. There were no reports of injuries or deaths. An Associated
Press photographer saw three armored personnel carriers take up posts outside
the building and heard some shots fired.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Prime Minister Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's prime minister quit
today over a tax scandal that has further sullied the country's
political establishment, already reeling from a series of scandals.
</P>
<P>
   The downfall of Prime Minister Park Tae-joon came after a court
ruled this week that he had concealed ownership of properties to
avoid large tax payments. Though such concealment wasn't illegal at
the time, Park's action was considered unethical and he will be
required to pay back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sorry to the government and nation that my personal moral
issue has caused controversy,'' said Park, a 72-year-old retired
army general who became prime minister in February.
</P>
<P>
   Park's resignation from his largely ceremonial post was unlikely
to affect President Kim Dae-jung's chief policies: economic reform
and engagement with communist North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Kim accepted Park's resignation and appointed Finance Minister
Lee Hun-jai to serve as acting prime minister, the president's
office said.
</P>
<P>
   Park's successor will be named next week. The prime minister is
second in line to the president, but has a limited role in making
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties and civic groups had called on Park to quit
and issue a public apology after a court said this week that he put
property valued at $5.3 million under the name of his private
treasurer to avoid paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The incident displays the moral hazards of this regime,'' said
Chang Kwang-keun, spokesman for the opposition Grand National
Party. ''The ruling camp must take special measures to restore its
morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Concealing ownership of property has since been criminalized.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prime Minister Park's bid to conceal his properties for tax
evasion cannot be tolerated on moral grounds, although he has no
legal responsibilities,'' The Korea Times quoted Citizens Action
Network, an advocacy group, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Two other scandals involving allegations of corruption in past
governments have surfaced recently, raising demands for higher
ethical standards for public office holders.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a Korean-American lobbyist is suspected of having
bribed government officials and politicians to help win French firm
GEC-Alsthom a $2.1 billion contract for South Korea's first
high-speed rail line in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In another scandal, a Korean-American lobbyist allegedly used
payments and personal contacts to help American firm Raytheon Co.
win a $230 million spy plane project in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyists in both cases are under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Sought For Rail Killer  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- To win a death sentence for the so-called
railroad killer, prosecutors are putting on mini-trials for eight
other slayings to which he has admitted.
</P>
<P>
   They are trying to stack up evidence that Angel Maturino
Resendiz, convicted Thursday in the slaying of a Houston-area
researcher, left a trail of death across three states over two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have here is a career burglar who developed a taste
for murder and rape,'' prosecutor Devon Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Thursday's verdict, the 41-year-old Mexican national
told the court outside the jury's presence he wanted to die by
injection. When pressed for a reason, he said he didn't want to
spend life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got some plans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Allen Tanner later said he did not know what
his client meant.
</P>
<P>
   In the death penalty phase, which was to resume today, jurors
must decide whether Maturino Resendiz is a threat to society and
whether there are mitigating factors against his execution. If they
reject the death penalty, he would face life in prison with no
possibility of parole for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz was convicted despite defense arguments that
he was insane when he raped and killed Claudia Benton in December
1998. He also has admitted to eight other slayings from 1997 to
1999, but prosecutors must offer proof of each crime to support a
death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson opened the prosecution's penalty phase with details
from the June 15, 1999, slayings of George Morber, 80, and his
daughter, Carolyn Frederick, 51. They were killed in Morber's rural
Jackson County, Ill., trailer, about 100 feet from railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's husband, Donald Frederick, made the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw her feet (protruding from blankets),'' he testified
Thursday. ''I took my right hand and hit the wall to try to get
some arousal. Then I ran back and call the Jackson County
sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   Fingerprint and hair samples connect Maturino Resendiz to the
crime, investigators testified.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were expected to present evidence and testimony
about five more killings in Texas, then close with testimony from
the only known survivor of the two-year rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whom authorities have not identified, was left for
dead after being raped near some Lexington, Ky., railroad tracks.
She was the girlfriend of Christopher Maier, a 21-year-old
University of Kentucky student bludgeoned to death with a log,
allegedly by Maturino Resendiz.

<HEADLINE> More Charges in Wash. Murder Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A 47-year-old married veteran who police
say preyed on prostitutes has now been charged with eight counts of
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Yates Jr. was scheduled to make a preliminary court
appearance today after being charged Thursday with aggravated
first-degree murder in the serial killings of eight women in the
Spokane area in 1997 and 1998. He had been charged with
first-degree murder in one of those deaths; that charge was
upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   He is also charged with attempted murder and robbery in the case
of a woman who survived an attack in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not said whether they will seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   All the women were prostitutes and drug users, police say.
Prosecutor Steve Tucker and Sheriff Mark Sterk said Yates left a
''signature'' on victims: plastic bags over their heads. Most of
the bodies were found dumped in secluded areas.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker and Sterk have said DNA and other physical evidence link
Yates to the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only motive that's apparent from it is robbery,'' Tucker
said, because no money or valuables were found on the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, a U.S. Army veteran who was working at a Kaiser Aluminum
Corp. smelter near Spokane when he was arrested April 18, is being
held at the Spokane County Jail in lieu of $1.5 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Richard Fasy, would not comment on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Christine L. Smith, 32, survived an attack
despite being shot in the head as she performed oral sex on Yates
during a ''date.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the man demanded his money back, but she managed to
climb out of his van and escape, according to court documents. More
than a year later, after Smith was in an automobile accident, an
X-ray revealed bullet fragments in her head.
</P>
<P>
   She went to police with her story last week.
</P>
<P>
   Yates has four daughters and a son. They and his wife have been
in seclusion since his arrest and have made no comments.

<HEADLINE> 1955 Murder Conviction Reversed  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- An appeals court has ordered a new trial for a
stable owner convicted in 1995 of the deaths of three boys whose
bodies were found in a forest preserve four decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In its 2-1 ruling, the Illinois Appellate Court on Thursday
reversed the murder conviction of Kenneth Hansen, who is serving a
200-year prison sentence for the 1955 slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Thomas Hoffman wrote that the trial court erred in
allowing testimony ''regarding the defendant's practice of picking
up young male hitchhikers and sexually assaulting them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Improper evidence of a defendant's sexual conduct with
children is so prejudicial as to normally require reversal,'' the
appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Benjamin, a spokesman for Cook County State's Attorney
Richard Devine, said prosecutors would ask the appeals court to
reconsider or take the case to the Illinois Supreme Court. He said
prosecutors would fight any attempt by Hansen to be released on
bond.
</P>
<P>
   ''We disagree with this decision,'' Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Petersen, 14; John Schuessler, 13, and his brother, Anton
Schuessler, 11, are believed to have met their killer while
hitchhiking after leaving a bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   The case baffled police until Hansen was charged and tried in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, witnesses testified that Hansen had spoken on
several occasions over the years of killing the three boys. Hansen
was quoted by one witness as saying that one of the older boys came
into the barn while he was having sex with the youngest, and
threatened to tell. He strangled that boy and then killed the two
others to silence them, according to the account.

<HEADLINE> Nursing Home Defedants Plea Innocent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A former deputy state health commissioner
and a nursing home operator have pleaded innocent to federal
bribery charges that allege corruption in the Oklahoma nursing home
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Brent VanMeter and James R. Smart were arraigned Thursday, one
day after they were accused in a federal grand jury indictment of
bribery in connection with a state program that receives funds from
federal health care programs.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Valerie Couch scheduled trial for July 10. Both
were released on their own recognizance. If convicted, they face up
to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're ready to defend this case,'' VanMeter's attorney, Mack
Martin, said. ''We are ready to get this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart and his attorney, Warren Bickford, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that on April 17, VanMeter, 46, agreed to
accept money from Smart to alter state Health Department records to
allow Smart's nursing homes to be compensated by federal programs
at a higher rate than he would otherwise receive.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Arlene Joplin said Smart, 43, is charged
''with offering and agreeing to give a bribe to Mr. VanMeter.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Dan Webber has said he expects additional
indictments to be returned in the investigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LORAIN, Ohio (AP) -- A cartwheel couldn't impress patrolman
Joseph F. Kopronica, who had already seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Lorain police officer pulled over a driver at early
Wednesday because the van she was driving appeared to be out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   According to his police report, Nancy M. Lang, the 42-year-old
driver not only seemed to be intoxicated, but said: ''Please give
me a break. I'm drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman failed sobriety tests, the officer wrote in his
report. She could not stand on one leg or walk heel-to-toe. The
officer told her that she was under arrest, but she replied:
''Wait, I can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   She then did five jumping jacks, one push-up and started to do a
cartwheel, the officer's report said.
</P>
<P>
   Kopronica stopped her at that point ''for her safety and mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang has pleaded innocent to charges of speeding, driving under
the influence of alcohol, driving with a suspended license, weaving
and having expired license plates.

<HEADLINE> Premier Intervenes in China Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- After intervention by China's premier, European
and Chinese negotiators appeared to be nearing a deal today that
would clear Beijing's largest remaining barrier to joining the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Zhu Rongji, whose crucial intercession clinched a
similar market-opening deal with the United States in November, met
with European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy for about an
hour today. It was their first meeting in five days of talks this
week between the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to expectations that a deal was imminent, China's Foreign
Ministry called foreign news organizations to alert them that an
important announcement on the WTO talks would be made later at the
foreign trade ministry.
</P>
<P>
   But Lamy and Chinese foreign trade minister Shi Guangsheng
resumed negotiations inside the trade ministry, and an EU spokesman
sought to dampen speculation that the deal was done.
</P>
<P>
   ''The negotiations are ongoing and until negotiations are
completed there is no agreement,'' the spokesman, Anthony Gooch,
said. ''Any rumors about imminent signatures are premature.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a very delicate process and it's a delicate
moment,'' Gooch said. He added that Lamy would stay in Beijing as
long as it's ''constructive and necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's intervention came on the heels of two unusual meetings --
one Thursday night, the other today -- between Lamy and Shi, each
with their lead WTO negotiators. Their technical teams, which hash
out the details of proposals, were not included.
</P>
<P>
   Asked earlier about the hastily arranged Thursday night session,
the first in this round of talks, Gooch said: ''We are reaching an
important moment.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave no details but added: ''It's very hard to gauge as to
when and whether you are going to have a deal, let alone the
timing. It's extremely difficult to predict anything.''
</P>
<P>
   China and the EU have provided scant details of their
negotiations. The EU is seeking greater access to China's
telecommunications, financial services and automobile sectors -- on
better terms than the United States wrested from Beijing in
November.
</P>
<P>
   A deal would smooth China's way toward its goal of joining the
WTO this year. The 15-member EU is the largest of six remaining WTO
members yet to reach the separate market-opening agreements with
China that are necessary for Beijing's membership.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are taking place in the shadow of a debate in the U.S.
Congress over whether to grant China permanent low-tariff access to
the American market. Both Chinese and EU negotiators are trying to
leverage the timing of next week's congressional debate to their
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   A deal could sway undecided members of the U.S. House of
Representatives to support the permanent trade status and end the
annual reviews that China's critics favor.

<HEADLINE> Evidence of Settlement Found in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Two fragments that easily fit in an adult's
palm are the first physical evidence that an English settlement
existed in south Florida prior to the Revolutionary War, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists digging during the Jupiter Lighthouse's recent
renovation found a fragment of tobacco pipe made only in England
between 1745 and 1790 and a piece of tabby, a plaster used as
building material in the American Colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The only other English artifacts found in south Florida were
discovered in Miami about five years ago and were dated to between
1790 and 1810.
</P>
<P>
   The archaeologists also found oyster shells and other debris
that indicate the area could have been inhabited by American
Indians as early as 925, but it has not been determined which tribe
they belonged to or how long they stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists Bob Carr, the project's principal investigator,
and Jim Pepe, its field director, said the English fragments could
date to 1763 and indicate the site may be where the lost Grenville
Plantation was located.
</P>
<P>
   Grenville is mentioned sparingly in historical documents kept by
the English, who gained possession of Florida in 1763 from the
Spanish but gave it back in 1783. The Revolutionary War lasted from
1775 to 1783.
</P>
<P>
   Pepe and Carr want to do a more comprehensive dig but they first
need Coast Guard approval and about $20,000 in funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the challenge now is to sort through the rest of the
evidence,'' Carr said. ''Who lived here? How big was the
settlement? What happened to terminate it? It's a puzzle.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Michel Kazan, who introduced women to new
hairstyles including the bouffant, pageboy and the French twist,
and created the coiffures for the models of several fashion
designers, died Saturday. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, Kazan came up with the popular idea of
attaching little curls to hairpins, allowing the simulation of
widow's peaks, bangs and curl clusters at the crown of the head.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1950s through the 1970s Kazan created original
hairstyles for well-known couturiers like Lanvin-Castillo, Chanel
and Jean Desses in Paris and James Galanos in the United States.
One of his trademarks was the crisp, slicked-back, almost boyish
styles used in several Galanos shows.
</P>
<P>
   Among those he coifed were Greta Garbo, Lee Radziwill, Natalie
Wood, Raquel Welch and Doris Duke.
</P>
<P>
   A former chief stylist of the hairdressing salon of Helena
Rubenstein, Kazan founded his own New York salon, which served as a
training ground for young stylists who later went on to their own
international recognition.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Relatives Seek Visitation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives have complained to
federal officials about their inability to contact the 6-year-old
Cuban boy while he has been in his father's custody at a Maryland
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to the Immigration and Naturalization Service
on Thursday, attorney Manuel A. Diaz, who represents Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, complained that the relatives, a
priest, a psychologist and attorneys have all been denied
visitations.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz also noted that numerous Cuban government officials have
been allowed to visit Elian. The boy has been with his father in
Maryland since shortly after he was seized by federal agents last
month from Lazaro Gonzalez's Little Havana home.

   The Miami relatives haven't even been allowed to call Elian,
Diaz complained, but when Elian lived with them federal officials
made sure the boy was available daily to take phone calls from his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fail to see how the INS and (Justice Department) could
honestly state that they could require Lazaro Gonzalez to provide
Juan Miguel telephone access while in Lazaro's care and how,
inversely, that power is not available to them now that Elian is in
Juan Miguel's care,'' Diaz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives also have complained about photographs showing him
wearing a scarf typically worn by a communist youth group's
members.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said early Friday that it is up to
the boy's father to decide who visits him, speaks to him and what
he wears.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been in the United States since November, when he was
found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of South Florida. His
mother and 10 other people fleeing Cuba died when their boat
capsized en route to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Beetles Mar California Church  </HEADLINE>
By JESSIE SEYFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It has survived catastrophic earthquakes
and made it through devastating fires, but California's oldest
intact church hasn't been able to escape its latest threat --
powderpost beetles.
</P>
<P>
   The insects have eaten through 200-year-old statues of saints,
left priceless wooden carvings crumbling and munched on treasures
dating back to when San Francisco was little more than fishing
villages and sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   The 209-year-old Mission Dolores chapel, now in the heart of San
Francisco's bustling Mission District, first showed signs of damage
about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been quite a shock,'' said Guire Cleary, the church's
curator. ''Hopefully the beetles will be gassed, but that still
doesn't conserve the statues. We can't undo the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the ornate wall of wooden carvings and statues
behind the altar, Cleary says they have been ''eaten alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleary said over the past year the working-class parish scraped
together the $60,000 needed to fumigate the church, but he doesn't
know where it will get the money to restore the wooden statues and
facades. He estimated the cost between $750,000 and $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each one of the beetle holes -- and there are millions of them
-- needs to be injected with epoxy resin,'' he said. ''Financially,
it's currently completely out of the range of this parish.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Granett, a University of California entomology
professor, said it's likely the powderpost beetles -- named for
their ability to turn wooden posts to powder -- have been there for
generations with little exterior damage.
</P>
<P>
   He said the beetles crawl inside wood and eat their way out, and
it's possible they've been steadily gnawing away until now -- when
the damage is finally becoming apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections of the beetle destruction have revealed another
artifact that Cleary says is in dire need of repair. Behind the
elaborate facade of the sanctuary is an 18th century mural that was
painted with vegetable dyes by the Ohlone Indians, San Francisco's
original inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's crumbling,'' Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   The church's main concern is preserving its wooden treasures,
from its California redwood roof to its statues, all of which bear
damage from the beetles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our last renovation was just a few years ago,'' Cleary says.
''And it looks like we're going to have to do it again.''

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Denies Starr Inquiry  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge has rejected a request
for an investigation of former independent counsel Kenneth Star,
saying claims that he or his staff tried to suborn perjury or
engaged in misconduct in the Whitewater investigation are baseless.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut attorney Frank Mandanici and two former Starr
targets, Stephen A. Smith and Julie Hiatt Steele, challenged
Starr's prosecution of Whitewater figure Susan McDougal and Starr's
testimony before a House committee on President Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Their complaints fell to U.S. District Judge John F. Nangle
after all federal judges in the Eastern District of Arkansas
recused themselves from hearing the case.
</P>
<P>
   In an order Thursday, Nangle said Steele presented ''absolutely
no evidence that the OIC ever directly or impliedly asked her to
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he found no evidence that Starr or his office
attempted to suborn perjury from Smith and noted that Smith
acknowledged that Starr investigators never asked him to lie.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said Mandanici might merit discipline and sanctions
himself for violating his order against leaking matters related to
the case to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Mandanici said the judge had sealed his files but there was no
gag order in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm obviously disappointed and I disagree with his decision,
but until I actually read the order I can't comment further,''
Mandanici said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandanici filed his complaint in June 1999. By the end of the
year, he had been joined by Steele and Smith, a communications
professor at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. The three
asked for the appointment of an outside counsel to investigate
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   A former aide to Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas, Smith
pleaded guilty in 1995 to a misdemeanor stemming from Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury deadlocked in favor of convicting Steele on
charges that she obstructed Starr's investigation of allegations by
Kathleen Willey that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   Starr decided not to retry Steele, who denied Mrs. Willey's
assertion that she confided the alleged advance to her friend hours
after it happened.

Atlantis Lifts Off on Fourth Try
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Atlantis and seven astronauts
blasted off today on a mission to fix the international space station,
succeeding finally on their fourth launch try. Atlantis rose from its seaside
pad at daybreak as the space station sped over Eastern Europe. The shuttle is
expected to catch up with the station early Sunday. The space station needs
Atlantis and its crew more than ever as more parts break and it slips lower and
lower in orbit. NASA's efforts to send the shuttle to the rescue in late April
were foiled three days in a row by gusty wind. This time, the weather was
perfect for flying; a nearly full moon glowed in the sky at the appointed 6:11
a.m. liftoff time.

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- After months of simmering ethnic tensions in Fiji, seven

gunmen fired at least two shots from AK-47 rifles inside parliament before
locking up Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, his Cabinet ministers and lawmakers
of the ruling coalition in the legislature's upper chamber. No injuries were
reported among the estimated 50 hostages. Chaudhry is Fiji's first ethnic Indian

convicted Thursday in the slaying of a Houston-area researcher, left a trail of
death across three states over two years. Following Thursday's verdict, the

The ''parent checklists'' won't contain letter grades but will tell parents
whether they're helping enough with homework or getting their children to school
on time, school officials said Thursday. Parents with low marks could be
referred to a parent training academy. The checklists would be issued every five
weeks for all students, Vallas said. Items will include whether children are

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of America's best friends split away to approve $232
million in World Bank loans to Iran, despite intensive lobbying by Secretary of

sponsors terrorism, has not adopted sound economic principles and should not be
rewarded while it conducts a ''show trial'' of 13 Jews on charges of spying for
Israel. The allies, including best-friend Britain and Germany, were not swayed,
and joined the majority of the 24-member bank executive board yesterday in

<HEADLINE> Soldiers Protest in Paraguay  </HEADLINE>
By PEDRO SERVIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Soldiers believed to be loyal to a
former coup plotter barreled through Paraguay's capital in armored
personnel carriers and parked in front of the legislative building
for several hours before ending their brief uprising early today.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers of the army's First Division surrendered at 2:45 a.m.,
bringing an end to the roughly four-hour standoff, Col. Felix Dario
Collante said. He refused to say how many turned themselves in but
described them as ''a few active officers and a retired general.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is totally under control,'' Collante said. He
said he ordered government tanks that had been called out to keep
the peace to return to an army base.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Walter Bower said the rebellious soldiers were
sympathetic to former army Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo, a fugitive
wanted in connection with a political assasination last year and a
brief mutiny in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Three congressmen were detained, Collante said, although it was
unclear what role, if any, they had played in the uprising.
Paraguayan news media reported that 12 police officers had been
detained as well, arrested at police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Three civilians were reported injured, military spokesmen said,
but it was not clear under what circumstances they were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   After the rebellion was quelled, President Luis Gonzalez Macchi
said in a national radio address he was particularly grateful to
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military are the winners here because they aligned
themselves with the state and with democracy,'' he said, adding
that ''it's time that we take a look ... at why this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   During the standoff, Macchi imposed a 30-day state of emergency
giving him special powers to deal with the situation, government
spokesman Jaime Bestard said.
</P>
<P>
   The uprising began when army vehicles stationed themselves in
front of the legislative palace in downtown Asuncion late Thursday.
An Associated Press photographer saw three armored personnel
carriers set up posts outside the building and heard shots fired.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Marcelo Duarte, who was inside Congress at the time,
told local radio the tanks fired at least two shots at the
building.
</P>
<P>
   A strong explosion could be heard. Power was cut in Asuncion
shortly after the tanks took up their positions and air force
planes flew overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Macchi appealed to Paraguayans to remain calm, telling
local radio: ''The crisis is under control.'' The heads of the air
force and navy, along with several army divisions, also publicly
expressed support for the president as Paraguayan television
broadcast developments into the early hours today.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis was the latest to confront this landlocked South
American nation, which was last thrown into upheaval in March 1999
when former president Raul Cubas was ousted and replaced by
Gonzalez Macchi after the shooting death of Vice President Luis
Argana.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo is wanted in connection with Argana's assassination.
Authorities also said he has yet to complete a 10-year sentence for
a brief rebellion in April 1996 against former President Juan
Carlos Wasmosy.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo fled Paraguay after Cubas resigned and was granted
political asylum in Argentina, where he stayed before going into
hiding days before Argentine President Fernando de la Rua took
office Dec. 10. At last report, he claimed to be in a remote area
of Paraguay, making sporadic telephone contact with news media and
denouncing the government.

<HEADLINE> Clerics Strike Shuts Down Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
By S.M. QUERESHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- A strike called by Islamic clerics shut
down all major cities in Pakistan today as hundreds of
rock-throwing students in Karachi rioted for a second day over the
killings of two religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   After a night of demonstrations that gutted several banks and a
newspaper office, protesters returned to the streets of Pakistan's
commercial capital.
</P>
<P>
   Giant plumes of black smoke from burning tires wafted skyward as
students wailed and beat their chests. Police, paramilitary Rangers
and the army were out to try to curb the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Pakistan most cities were shut down, shops were
closed and traffic was light.
</P>
<P>
   In a daytime ambush Thursday, men on motorcycles shot Maulana
Mohammed Yusuf Ludhyanvi, principal of Banuri Town religious
school, and Abdur Rehman, a teacher at the school. Two others were
injured, police said.
</P>
<P>
   No one took responsibility for the killings, which are the
latest in a series of attacks on religious leaders in Pakistan. The
religiously motivated violence has involved rival Sunni and Shiite
Muslim militants. The two men who died were Sunni Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Pakistan's 140 million people are Sunni Muslims who live
in peace with their Shiite Muslim brethren. However well-armed
militant groups routinely clash.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest Shiite Muslim groups, Tehrik-e-Jafria
Pakistan, condemned the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been asking the administration to make adequate
security arrangements because it is our leaders who are being
targeted,'' said Allama Hasan Turabi, president of the Shiite
Muslim group.
</P>
<P>
   Today's shutdown was in response to a strike call by religious
leaders to press the army-led government to guarantee Islamic laws
in the constitution, make Fridays a holiday in Pakistan and end
interest charges at banks -- considered to violate Islamic
principles.
</P>
<P>
   Initially the clerics had called the strike to protest attempts
by Pakistan's military government to make it more difficult to file
charges under the country's controversial blasphemy law, which
carries the death penalty. Under pressure, the nation's leader,
army chief Gen. Pervez Musharraf, scrapped the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani merchants also joined in on the strike call. They are
protesting attempts by the government to curb smuggling, impose
taxes and document sales.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of religiously motivated attacks have occurred in
Pakistan in recent weeks. Until Thursday, most of the victims had
been Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   In Karachi, Shiites say they have asked the government for
additional protection out of fear of retaliatory attacks.

immediate impact would likely be on a contentious debate next week in the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan President Takes Office Sat.  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The worst-case scenario was that Chinese
missiles would rain down on Taiwan because the island's newly
elected president would rashly declare independence in the months
after his stunning victory.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened so far, and most experts say the
80-mile-wide Taiwan Strait that divides the longtime rivals should
remain calm for the near future. Although long-standing
disagreements are keeping them far from the bargaining table, both
are remaining cool-headed -- despite occasional flare-ups in
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, Taiwanese President-elect Chen Shui-bian takes
office, officially beginning a political era that could raise
tensions with China to new heights. Beijing will no doubt listen
closely to Chen's inauguration speech.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of war can't be ruled out, analysts say, and the
United States could quickly get dragged into a conflict. Just four
years ago, U.S. warships cruised to Taiwan when China tested
nuclear-capable missiles near the island's two main ports.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two sides split amid civil war 51 years ago, Beijing's
mission has been to reunify this democratic island of 22 million
people with the communist mainland. Independence for Taiwan has
been out of the question, and China has warned that it would wage
war if Taipei sought a permanent split or indefinitely delayed
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on its threats could be extremely reckless for China at
the moment. A war could torpedo Beijing's long campaign to join the
World Trade Organization, and would likely ruin China's chances of
getting permanent trade status with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''China has a lot of economic issues in the United States'
hands,'' said Lee Si-kuen, a political science professor at the
National Taiwan University.
</P>
<P>
   Many defense experts doubt that China has enough warships or
planes to successfully invade Taiwan. The massive Chinese army has
its roots in land-based guerrilla warfare and has never fought a
war that involves a complex naval landing.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, the U.S. Pacific Fleet
commander in chief, said in Hong Kong that invading Taiwan would be
an ''almost impossible military task'' for China.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pollack, a senior Asia specialist at the Rand Corp.
think tank, agreed. But he noted that history is full of conflicts
caused by miscalculations.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts point out that Beijing's goal would probably be
to simply frighten Taiwanese away from seeking independence. This
could be accomplished by firing a ballistic missile at an
unpopulated area, blocking a port or seizing one of Taiwan's
numerous outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
   Since Chen was elected March 18, Beijing has said peace talks
could begin if Taiwan would do one thing: Agree that the island is
an inseparable part of one China.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page editorial in today's Communist Party's People's
Daily newspaper repeated that demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taiwan is a part of China and Taiwan has only one future --
reunification with the mainland,'' the editorial said. ''This is a
very clear and non-negotiable issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has long been wary of Beijing's ''one-China'' principle
because it fears accepting that would mean admitting the repressive
Beijing government is the island's legitimate ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has refused to accept the principle as a precondition for
talks, but has said he would be willing to discuss it during a
summit, which he has said he would attend anywhere and at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Before Chen was elected, Beijing tried to warn voters away from
the former Taipei mayor, once a vocal supporter of Taiwan
independence. His Democratic Progressive Party still favors letting
Taiwanese voters decide whether the island should break away for
good. Chen has softened his stance, saying he would only hold such
a vote if China attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Since Chen's victory, Beijing has given him time to prove
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will listen to his words and watch his actions,'' Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said Tuesday, repeating a
phrase Beijing has been using the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who is succeeding retiring President Lee Teng-hui, has
been avoiding provocative language and has ignored threatening
rhetoric printed in China's state-run media.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the U.S. delegation attending Chen's inauguration,
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, today praised the president-elect's handling
of China relations in recent months. Tyson, an economist, served in
President Clinton's administration in 1993-96.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are really impressed at your approach of thinking through
this issue and talking to many people and treating it as a major
issue of establishing trust and dialogue,'' said Tyson, a business
professor at the University of California at Berkeley.

By The Associated Press	   A deadly storm system that punished the Midwest with
heavy rain
and high winds pushed east today, spawning thunderstorms from Texas
to New England. It was clear and mostly dry in the westerain half of
the nation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fast-moving storms ripped through Illinois late Thursday,
knocking out power to 100,000 customers and forcing the
cancellation of more than 100 flights at Chicago's two airports.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kemper, 69, of suburban Wilmette was killed when a tree
limb landed on his car, police said. Hundreds of trees were
reportedly down in Arlington Heights and Palatine, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3 inches of rain fell in Michigan. Wind gusts of more
than 80 mph were reported in Indiana and Illinois, and torainadoes
were reported in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got rain. We got hail. We had wind,'' said Rhonda Daniels
at the Casey's General Store in Carlisle, south of Des Moines. ''We

</P>
<P>
   The severe weather arrived in the Northeast shortly before
sundown Thursday, with driving rain in New York City and powerful
thunderstorms in upstate New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and
Massachusetts. About 100 homes were damaged in the Poughkeepsie
area and more than 65,000 customers lost power across the region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Opponents Hoild Protests  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Undeterred by what they say is a
brutal intimidation campaign, Slobodan Milosevic's opponents held
more demonstrations today despite police beatings of pro-democracy
protesters and new arrests of the Yugoslav president's critics.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred activists of the popular student group Otpor, or
Resistance, which has been specifically targeted by the government,
handed out leaflets in downtown Belgrade, protesting Milosevic's
latest crackdown against independent media and opponents.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 uniformed and plainclothes police checked their
identity documents, taking away at least one Otpor flag with a
clenched fist emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Six Otpor members were detained overnight, adding to hundreds
arrested in the past several days. Otpor -- accused by the
government of ''terrorism'' -- has gained rapid popularity because
many Serbs have been disappointed by bickering among traditional
opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes between police and demonstrators over the past two days
have left more than 150 people injured -- at least 30 seriously.
Tens of thousands have turned out in Belgrade and other cities to
protest police raids on the major nongovernment television station
and other media critical of Milosevic that have left them either
shut down or with their operations seriously impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police intervention was extremely brutal, they are trying
to frighten the citizens into stopping the protests,'' Goran
Svilanovic, one of the opposition leaders, told The Associated
Press today.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, hundreds of riot police fired tear gas and charged
at more than 10,000 protesters who massed in front of the
opposition-run city hall in Belgrade to protest the closure of the
nongovernment Studio B television.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters shouting ''Kill yourself Slobodan and save Serbia!''
threw stones and firebombs at the police, who dispersed the crowd
into smaller groups, then chased individual demonstrators through
nearby streets, hurling several to the ground and pummeling them
with rubber truncheons.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 terrified protesters sought refuge in the city
hall building. Those who could not push their way inside were
severely beaten. At least nine people were seen dazed with blood
streaming down their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The official Tanjug news agency said today that ''unrestrained
crowds'' and ''militants'' had attacked the police, who had to
intervene with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes marked the biggest escalation of tensions in years.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern city of Nis, which is also controlled by the
opposition, several hundred protesters gathered outside the city
hall attacked 14 deputies of Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party as
they were left the meeting, pelting them with sticks. Two of the
deputies were hospitalized, while the others were bruised.
</P>
<P>
   The incident added to the tension ahead of a rally planned in
Nis for this evening, along with similar gatherings in Belgrade and
other major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing clashes, the influential Serbian Orthodox Church
appealed for an easing of tensions and called on the government to
halt the media crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's allies accused the nongovernment media and
opposition of working for American and NATO interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state has waited too long to face the evil, and there is
no more waiting,'' said Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Vojislav
Seselj. ''We won't allow American agents to come to power.''
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown began after the slaying of a prominent official
last Saturday, which authorities blamed on opposition parties and
Otpor.
</P>
<P>
   Dissent in Serbia has grown recently due to rising poverty and
state repression.

<HEADLINE> Modified Seed Planted Accidentally  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Genetically modified seed that was accidentally
mixed with normal seed has been planted in Britain and Sweden,
countries where the use of such strains is still under study, their
governments say.
</P>
<P>
   The findings have created a dilemma over whether such crops must
be destroyed in keeping with stringent regulations over the
planting of genetically altered plants.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed seed, produced in Canada in 1998, contained about 1
percent genetically modified material, the British Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   About 22,000 acres were sown in Britain with affected stocks of
oilseed rape seed in 1999, and about 11,600 acres were sown this
spring, the ministry said. About 1.2 million acres are devoted to
oilseed rape across Britain each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish Board of Agriculture said it was alerted about
genetically modified seed by retailer Svaloef Weibull AB on Monday,
after tests in Germany revealed it.
</P>
<P>
   Board spokeswoman Anna-Clara Sjoestroem said today that nine
tons of oilseed rape seed containing some amount of genetically
altered material were imported last year and 3,000 acres were
planted. The resulting crop was sold.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 1,200-1,500 acres were planted using the seed. The
board expects to reach a decision next week on whether to destroy
the crop, Sjoestroem said.
</P>
<P>
   Baroness Hayman, a British junior agriculture minister, said the
government had consulted the Advisory Committee on Releases to the
Environment and the Food Standards Agency, ''and both confirmed the
view that there is no risk to public health or the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''However, the issue of seed purity is a serious one,'' she
added. ''The farmer and his customer do not expect to find that a
crop of conventional seed contains an unexpected or unacceptable
level of GM material.''
</P>
<P>
   Genetically altered crops are plants whose genes are manipulated
to produce characteristics such as resistance to pests. The British
government has sponsored trials designed to indicate whether such
crops pose a threat to the environment, but has not yet approved
any for commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   David Heath, a British Liberal Democrat lawmaker, said a strong
case existed for destroying the crops grown from the Canadian seed
''in exactly the same way that the experimental protocols for the
farm scale trials insist upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Gibson of the governing Labor Party said the agriculture
ministry must ''get a grip'' on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''They should have known that the public are very suspicious of
what's going on and they should have suspected that there would be
a mix-up of seeds -- it's almost inevitable,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no commercial use of genetically modified crops in
Sweden and cultivation of such plants requires special permission.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report from Swedish retailer Svaloef Weibull to
the government agriculture board on Thursday, Canadian supplier
Advanta Seeds believes the ''contamination'' took place through
crossing in the field during seed production, possibly spread by
bees or the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The genetically modified plants resulting from the seed do not
produce pollen, said Svaloef Weibull, so other plants will not be
affected.

<HEADLINE> 4 Arrested in Death of 10-Year-Old  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Four people were arrested after a
10-year-old girl suffocated while undergoing therapy intended to
simulate birth, the sheriff's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Newmaker was rolled up in a flannel sheet during the
treatment at Connell Watkins and Associates in Evergreen and died
of asphyxiation, the coroner said.
</P>
<P>
   Both ends of the sheet were twisted above the girl's head and
large pillows were placed around her head. It was supposed to
represent the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Connell Watkins, the center's owner, told authorities she and
three others pressed on the pillows to simulate labor contractions
and encouraged Candace to push her way out.
</P>
<P>
   Candace and her mother, Jeane Newmaker, came from Durham, N.C.,
to the counseling center for the April 18 session. The therapy is
intended to enable troubled children to heal from past trauma by
struggling out of the covering and being ''reborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Newmaker said she adopted Candace in 1996 and had sought several
different treatments for her, including help for depression and
attention deficit disorder. She said she contracted with Watkins
for a two-week intensive program for $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Ponder, 39, a therapist who was leading the session, and
the others called paramedics after they unrolled the blanket and
found that Candace wasn't breathing. She died at a hospital the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   Ponder along with Brita St. Clair, 41, the center's business
manager; and Jack McDaniel 47, an intern, were charged Thursday
with child abuse resulting in death. Each was jailed on $250,000
bond.
</P>
<P>
   An arrest warrant was also issued for Watkins, 53, who was not
immediately taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Ponder said she didn't know Candace was having problems during
the session. McDaniel and St. Clair were helping her while the
girl's mother talked to her daughter and Watkins videotaped the
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said the videotape shows
that Candace complained several times that she couldn't breathe and
told them she had to vomit, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Babies Used To Smuggle Drugs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A woman has admitted to smuggling heroin and
cocaine in infant formula cans and said she twice used babies as
props to ease the suspicions of customs inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Washington, 50, of Chicago pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S.
District Court to one count of smuggling heroin from Panama and a
second count of smuggling liquid cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In a written plea agreement, she said she had gotten one of the
babies from her daughter, Kim, and another had been ''rented'' from
the child's aunt by unnamed individuals who paid her.
</P>
<P>
   The ploy failed when customs officials in Atlanta became
suspicions in May 1999 and opened the cans of infant formula. The
woman had arrived in Atlanta from Panama and had planned to fly on
to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people have been charged so far in what federal
prosecutors describe as a ring that includes other women who used
babies as props at customs stops. Seven have pleaded guilty and
others may be charged, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington faces up to nine years in prison, but prosecutors are
offering a reduced sentence if she cooperates in the investigation.
Another hearing is set for Aug. 15.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Big Game Winner To Claim Prize  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A suburban Chicago family has stepped forward to
claim the other half of last week's record-setting $363 million Big
Game jackpot, lottery officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That winning ticket was sold at a Lake Zurich, Ill., convenience
store. No other information about the family was released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Daily Herald of Arlington Heights today identified
them as Joe and Sue Kainz of Tower Lakes, owners of the Wild Onion
Brewing Co. in Lake Barrington.
</P>
<P>
   ''It couldn't have happened to a nicer family. The whole village
is excited,'' neighbor Tony Cantieri said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's three children -- Michael, 34; Patrick, 29; and
John, 26 -- all work for the family microbrewery, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
   The winners were expected to be announced today at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the Big Game jackpot would be $181.5 million. In
Illinois, the winner or winners could choose either to take about
$90 million in a lump sum before state and federal taxes, or take
about $7 million per year before taxes in 26 annual payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the family is still mulling over their options and
deciding whether to take the lump sum or the annual payment,''
lottery spokeswoman Lisa Donnelly said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The other winning ticket was sold in Michigan to swimming pool
installer Larry Ross, who claimed his prize last week.
</P>
<P>
   Though the $363 million prize was the biggest lottery jackpot in
U.S. history, the largest individual payout is the $197 million
awarded last year to a Massachusetts woman.
</P>
<P>
   The winning numbers from the May 9 drawing were 1, 2, 12, 33, 37
and Big Money Ball 4. The odds of matching all six numbers were one
in more than 76 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Game is played in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia.

China, EU Reach Trade Deal

<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China and the European Union reached a market-opening trade
deal today after the Chinese premier intervened, clearing Beijing's largest
remaining hurdle to joining the World Trade Organization. European Union Trade
Commissioner Pascal Lamy and Chinese foreign trade minister Shi Guangsheng
signed the agreement after five days of arduous negotiations. ''This agreement
is in the fundamental interests of both parties,'' a smiling Shi said. The
deal's most immediate impact will likely be on a contentious debate next week in
the U.S. Congress on granting China much-sought permanent low-tariff access to
the American market.

About 40 people were on the pier when it plunged into the 30-foot-deep water

Variant of Love Bug Virus Spreading
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A new virus is eating its way through computers, and this

inspired it, experts say. While the ''Love Bug'' was given away by the
''ILOVEYOU'' subject line of the e-mails that carried it, the new virus changes
subject lines every time it is sent. It also destroys most of the files on the
computers it infects. The virus was detected at several large companies late
yesterday. The subject line of an infected e-mail starts with ''FW: '' and
includes the name of a randomly chosen attachment from a previous e-mail on an
infected computer.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Philly Pier Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rescue crews picked through tangled planks
and floating debris today as authorities tried to determine why a
pier supporting a new outdoor nightclub collapsed into the Delaware
River.
</P>
<P>
   Three people died and 37 others were injured, including eight
rescue workers hurt trying to pull victims out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a loud crash, and then all hell broke loose. I went
straight down ... then I was just trying to fight my way up,'' said
bartender Joseph Capaci, 28.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 people were on the pier when it plunged into the
30-foot-deep water shortly after 8 p.m. Thursday. A canvas tent
over the pier also collapsed, blanketing many people who fell eight
feet into the dark, murky water.
</P>
<P>
   ''One (patient) told me that they were standing there and
suddenly the floor gave out, the lights went out, and they were in
an ice bath,'' said Dr. Bartholomew Tortella of MCP Hahnemann
University Hospital, who treated victims and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The debris and darkness hampered rescue efforts. Firefighter Joe
Whoriskey said rescue workers wore wetsuits but had to feel for
victims with their feet since they couldn't see.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all pancaked in there, the walls fell down on the
floor, then the ceiling, you had all kinds of deck furniture and
kitchen equipment,'' said Whoriskey, who received a tetanus shot
and antibiotics for slashes and cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Though authorities didn't believe anyone was still missing,
Coast Guard boats continued to search the water overnight and
closed down the river to all traffic between the Schuylkill River
and the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not found any additional people,'' U.S. Coast Guard
Capt. Gregory Adams said at a morning briefing.
</P>
<P>
   City police and fire crews were also at the scene, and building
inspectors and the Army Corps of Engineers were also on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people remained hospitalized this morning. At least two
were in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   The pier held a new bar, Heat, which opened last month and is
attached to a ballroom dancing area behind the upscale Moshulu
restaurant, in a 394-foot boat docked on the river. The section
that collapsed was along the back wall of the ballroom facing the
deck, said Stephanie Franklin-Suber, the mayor's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   A hostess at the restaurant, Eve McCarney, said workers had
replaced some floorboards Wednesday but did not do any major
structural work. Fire and police officials were investigating, as
were officials from the Department of Licenses and Inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a pier collapsed on the New Jersey side of the
Delaware River, submerging at least five vehicles and causing about
$10 million in damage.

<HEADLINE> Federal Officials Blamed for Fires  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Sitting in a dimly lit bar, watching
federal officials explain the mistakes that led to a devastating
wildfire, Danne DeBacker had one response: Mistakes? No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're just saying, 'Here's what happened.' We already know
what happened -- the damned forest burned down,'' said DeBacker,
whose home in the northwest part of Los Alamos was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sad, not just for my house, but for the forest,'' he said.
''Before these little black sticks were standing around here, we
had a really pristine forest.''
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report released Thursday by Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt concluded that National Park Service officials who
started the fire May 4 to clear brush did not follow proper
procedures and did not have enough fire crews on hand to keep it
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear there were large mistakes of agency oversight,''
Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The causal chain of this fire is quite complex. I would liken
it to what happens on a mountainside when a rock is dislodged,'' he
said. That one rock can create a ''cascading series of events.''
</P>
<P>
   Set at the nearby Bandelier National Monument, the blaze was
driven out of control by wind gusting to more than 50 mph. It
forced 25,000 people to flee, scorched more than 47,000 acres, left
405 families homeless and damaged the storied Los Alamos nuclear
weapons laboratory. The fire was 70 percent contained Thursday, and
officials said they hoped to have it completely corralled by late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt and federal lawmakers pledged to work on legislation to
pay all fire victims for losses not covered by insurance or
emergency assistance. The White House also said the government will
accept responsibility and take care of those who lost homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The report found a ''number of critical deviations from both the
prescribed fire plan and standard fire practices'' -- including not
putting firefighters on standby before starting the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt was asked on NBC's ''Today'' show this morning whether
there was criminal negligence in setting the fires. ''You don't
prosecute people for making mistakes,'' he said. ''The answer is an
emphatic no.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a systemic failure in the Park Service. I think we are
going to have to go back as a result of this investigation and
revamp the fire program from A to Z,'' he said. ''We owe that to
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said Bandelier employee Mike Powell, who directly
oversaw the prescribed burn, notified firefighting dispatchers in
Santa Fe the morning of May 4 that the burn was to take place that
evening. A dispatcher expressed concern because the Forest Service
had suspended prescribed burns as a result of high winds and dry
weather.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation found that the plan was not ''substantively
reviewed'' before it was approved by Bandelier Superintendent Roy
Weaver, who has taken responsibility for the blaze and been placed
on leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a tendency to rubber-stamp decisions made by people at
the field level,'' Babbitt said. ''That is an unacceptable
paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver has declined interviews and there was no answer Thursday
at his home. There was no listing for Powell in northern New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for the fire's escape on May 7. Fire crew
members started a backburn in a flat area full of dead wood in an
attempt to rob the fire of fuel and halt its southward advance off
the peak of Cerro Grande, where it was started.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the ''burnout'' should have been set farther
north, in an area with less fuel and steeper slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the problem was the fact that Park Service
officials had requested a spot weather report for the wrong day and
were unaware that winds were predicted to increase, said John
Snook, a Forest Service official who was one of the investigators.
Those steady winds blew to the northeast and pushed the flames over
a ridge, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the fire topped the ridge, winds carried embers outside the
prescribed burn area and the fire established itself on the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   From there it moved steadily toward Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the fire swept out of control, the National
Weather Service said it had sent Bandelier officials a special
forecast on May 4 indicating maximum potential for fire growth,
with increasing wind and temperatures and lower-than-usual
nighttime humidity.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators made no mention of the weather report
specifically but questioned the value of a measurement it quoted --
the Haines Index, which describes the potential for fire growth.
The report on May 4 said the Haines Index was at 6, its highest
rating.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department said Thursday it could cost as much as
$150 million to clean up Los Alamos National Laboratory and reopen
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Los Alamos has been hit by an 18-wheeler, and the government
was driving that 18-wheeler,'' Gov. Gary Johnson said at Babbitt's
news conference. He asked the people of New Mexico to ''give the
government a chance to make good on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal and Judy DeHaven, who lost their home of 23 years, were at
the bar with DeBacker.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of irresponsibility here,'' DeHaven said.
''They weren't prepared for what happened. This confirms our
suspicion that they burned our houses down and they owe us
something.''

<HEADLINE> Madonna's British Boyfriend Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Madonna's boyfriend was arrested and charged with
allegedly attacking a man outside the pregnant star's London home,
a British news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Film director Guy Ritchie, 31, was charged with assault causing
actual bodily harm and was released on bail, said Press
Association, the British news agency. An initial court hearing was
scheduled for June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Press Association said that Ritchie allegedly attacked a
20-year-old man after returning with Madonna from a night out at 1
a.m. Wednesday. The news agency said the man had been waiting
outside the couple's home in Kensington, an upscale west London
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard confirmed that a man was arrested but refused to
release his name. A police spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the victim -- also not identified -- suffered minor
injuries and did not require hospital treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna, 41, and Ritchie, who directed the British hit ''Lock,
Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' announced in March that they were
expecting a child. The couple said the baby was due at the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The pair met two years ago at a luncheon given by Sting's wife,
Trudie Styler. Their romance was rekindled when the singer returned
to London last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna, who divorced actor Sean Penn in 1989, has a 3-year-old
daughter, Lourdes, from her relationship with Carlos Leon.

Variant of Love Bug Virus Spreading
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An anti-virus software company says thousands of computers
at several large companies have been infected by a virus that uses the same
mechanism as the ''Love Bug'' virus, but is much more destructive and has a
different source code. While the ''Love Bug'' was given away by the ''ILOVEYOU''
subject line, the new virus changes subject lines every time it is sent. The
subject line of an infected e-mail starts with ''FW: '' and includes the name of
a randomly chosen attachment from a previous e-mail on an infected computer.
''Each time the virus spreads, it mutates itself to evade detection,'' Symantec
Corp., an anti-virus software maker in Cupertino, Calif., said yesterday.

Trade Deficit Sets Record in March

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit widened to an all-time high of
$30.2 billion in March as a record foreign oil bill overwhelmed a rebound in
American exports of farm products and autos. The deficit with China narrowed
slightly but the trade gap with Japan rose to its highest level this year. The
Commerce Department reported that the overall deficit increased by 5.1 percent
from a revised February figure of $28.7 billion. The trade deficit continues to
be the one glaring exception to the nation's current economic prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Two Bombs Explode in Estonia Store  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) -- Two bombs exploded about six hours apart
today in a department store in the city center, injuring four
people, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The first bomb went off at 4:45 a.m., a few hours after a man
speaking Russian phoned security officials at the Stockmann store,
threatening to set off a bomb in the building if he did not receive
$114,000, the Baltic News Service reported, citing emergency
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was injured in that blast, but a second bomb went off
about six hours later, also in the store's delicatessen on the
first floor, security police spokesman Hannes Kont said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers were in the building when the second bomb went off,
but the injuries were not serious, said Hannu Penttila, deputy
managing director of the Stockmann group.
</P>
<P>
   The man reportedly first called the department store's security
at 3 a.m., telling them there was a bomb in the building. The
Rescue Department's bomb squad searched the store but failed to
find anything suspicious, BNS said. The same man called back,
threatening to set off an explosive device if he did not get the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Penttila declined comment on the phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no idea who is behind these bombs. We have had no
arguments, no problems, since we started our operations in
Estonia,'' Penttila said.
</P>
<P>
   Stockmann is the leading department store in Finland. The store
in the Estonian capital, which opened in 1993, is its
second-largest after the flagship store in Helsinki.

<HEADLINE> Mother, Son Convicted of Murder  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A mother and son were convicted of murdering an
82-year-old millionaire widow in a plot to steal her elegant
townhouse mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The jury forewoman on Thursday pronounced ''guilty'' 118 times --
58 times for Sante Kimes and 60 for Kenneth Kimes -- in the slaying
of Irene Silverman, a former Radio City Music Hall dancer whose
body has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Sante Kimes, 65, and her 25-year-old son could get up to life in
prison at sentencing June 27. Prosecutors said they plotted to
steal the six-story Beaux-Arts mansion Silverman's husband had left
her.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman vanished in 1998, the day the Kimeses were arrested
for allegedly writing a bad $14,900 check for a car.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses had not disposed of Silverman's personal documents
or other suspicious items. In the car, police found loaded pistols,
a red wig and two fright masks, plastic handcuffs, $30,000 in cash,
a stun gun box, syringes and a pink liquid similar to a known
''date rape'' drug.
</P>
<P>
   They also found cassettes of Silverman's telephone conversations
-- secretly taped by the Kimeses -- and a forged deed that
transferred her townhouse to the Kimeses for a fraction of its
nearly $10 million value.
</P>
<P>
   Neither defendant testified.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers told the jurors that much of the information in
the notebooks was forged or altered by police. They also said
prosecutors read too much into the notes and jumped to false
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses also have been indicted in Los Angeles on charges
they murdered a businessman, David Kazdin. His body was found in a
trash bin in early 1998, shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   The pair also are suspected in the 1996 disappearance of a
banker in the Bahamas and the disappearance of a drifter who was
working with the Kimeses and vanished around the time the Kazdin
was killed.

<HEADLINE> Babies Used as Smuggling Cover  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A woman has admitted to smuggling heroin and
cocaine in infant formula cans and said she twice used babies as
props to ease the suspicions of customs inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Washington, 50, of Chicago pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S.
District Court to one count of smuggling heroin from Panama and a
second count of smuggling liquid cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In a written plea agreement, she said she had gotten one of the
babies from her daughter, Kim, and another had been ''rented'' from
the child's aunt by unnamed individuals who paid her.
</P>
<P>
   The ploy failed when customs officials in Atlanta became
suspicious in May 1999 and opened the cans of infant formula. The
woman had arrived in Atlanta from Panama and had planned to fly on
to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people have been charged so far in what federal
prosecutors describe as a ring that includes other women who used
babies as props at customs stops. Seven have pleaded guilty and
others may be charged, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington faces up to nine years in prison, but prosecutors are
offering a reduced sentence if she cooperates in the investigation.
Another hearing is set for Aug. 15.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Turn Down Israel Offer  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel has offered the Palestinians 90 percent
of the West Bank, up from an 80 percent offer last month, a senior
Palestinian official said as peace talks resumed today. The
Palestinians turned down the latest deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians hurled
stones at Israeli troops, who fired tear gas and rubber-coated
steel pellets. In one march, demonstrators burned an effigy of
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Several demonstrators were hurt
by rubber bullets, including one hit in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police pushed back the demonstrators in most areas
to keep down the friction, an apparent response to Barak's warning
today that he would not hand over three West Bank villages next to
Jerusalem, as promised, if there was a flare-up. Newspaper reports
said the villages could be handed to the Palestinians as early as
Sunday if there were no major disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian activists have said today and Saturday would be
''days of rage'' over Israel's refusal to release more Palestinian
security prisoners at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, marches pressing for freedom for the 1,650
Palestinian security prisoners escalated into Israeli-Palestinian
gun battles that killed three Palestinians in the worst violence in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden, meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
resumed talks today on the outlines of a peace treaty. A U.S.
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some progress
has been made in previous talks in Sweden, led by Israeli Public
Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian Parliament Speaker
Ahmed Qureia.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's round, Israel offered to give up 90 percent of
the West Bank but did not present a map or say whether the land
would be handed over in one or several stages, said the Palestinian
official, who spoke Thursday night on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Israel offered to withdraw from 80 percent
of the West Bank, with 66 percent to be handed over with the
signing of a peace agreement and 14 percent after a test period of
several years. Under the Israeli proposal, the Palestinian entity
would consist of several blocs linked by roads, tunnels and
bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian official said the most recent Israeli offer
provided for greater contiguity of Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office refused comment today.
</P>
<P>
   After Muslim noon prayers today, groups of several hundred
marchers each walked from West Bank towns toward nearby Israeli
army positions, hurling stones at the troops. In most locations,
Palestinian police tried to push back the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank town of Qalqiliya, Palestinian security men
wielding clubs prevented marchers from reaching the nearest Israeli
position. In the town of Ramallah, demonstrators burned a Barak
effigy and a U.S. flag, then headed to a traffic circle on the
outskirts of town that was the scene of a four-hour gun battle on
Monday. About 200 protesters threw stones at soldiers who fired
rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Israel would link its handover of three villages near
Jerusalem -- Abu Dis, Izzarieh and Sawahra a-Sharkieh -- to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's ability to quell violent
protests this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (the handover) will be implemented only when we will see
that the needed steps were taken by the Palestinians to correct
what happened this Monday,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's parliament narrowly approved the transfer of the
villages earlier this week, despite objections by the hawkish
opposition and several members of Barak's coalition. Hard-liners
said the withdrawal will weaken Israel's hold over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said in an interview published today in the Israeli daily
Haaretz that he made a mistake in refusing to hand over the three
villages earlier. ''I could have handled it better if I'd
transferred them earlier,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N.: Thousands of Eritreans Flee  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Thousands of people are fleeing Eritrea for
neighboring Sudan, while Eritrean officials report more than half a
million people inside the country have fled invading Ethiopian
troops, the U.N. refugee agency said today.
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese and U.N. officials estimate that between 6,000 and
20,000 Eritreans arrived in Sudan on Thursday, said Ron Redmond,
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Among them
are Eritrean soldiers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's official Al-Anbaa newspaper reported that some 50,000
Eritrean refugees crossed the border Thursday and thousands more
are expected to cross in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of fighting, which began May 12, has evolved
from an initial Ethiopian occupation of Eritrean positions on the
western front along the disputed 620-mile frontier to a full-scale
invasion of uncontested Eritrean territory.
</P>
<P>
   The government in the Sudanese border town of Kassala, which
borders Eritrea, has formed several emergency committees to deal
with the situation, Al-Anbaa added, quoting a security source.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program appealed for $12 million to help some
330,000 people displaced inside Eritrea by renewed fighting with
Ethiopia. They expect to ask for more money as the number of
displaced people rises, WFP spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea says Ethiopia's military campaign has driven more than
500,000 Eritreans from their homes or the makeshift camps where
they were sheltered -- a figure Berthiaume said was ''quite
plausible.''
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR staff were already positioned along the border before the
war reignited because the agency was preparing to repatriate
160,000 Eritrean refugees, some who have been in Sudan for 30
years. The new Eritrean refugees are being taken to the camps that
house those refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The latest crisis overshadowed efforts to help people suffering
from the prolonged drought on the Horn of Africa region, where WFP
estimates that some 16 million people are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the urgency right now are those people that have
displaced by the renewal of the fighting,'' Berthiaume said. ''The
emergency is there now. We have to put our priority there. That
doesn't mean that meanwhile we're not thinking of the drought
victims.''

<HEADLINE> Flooding Kills 125 in West Timor  </HEADLINE>
By HEATHER PATERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Massive floods sweeping through the
lowlands of Indonesian-ruled West Timor have so far claimed at
least 125 lives and are spreading to East Timor, U.N. officials
said today.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dead are East Timorese women and children who fled
the violence last September in their territory, said Jake Morland,
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Kupang,
the capital of West Timor. The refugee camps are on the western
side of the heavily guarded border.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not have reports in casualties in East Timor, but it
doesn't mean there are no casualties, as areas are virtually cut
off,'' said Bernard Kerblat, chief of operations of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was impossible to travel farther than 30 miles
by road out of the East Timor's capital of Dili. Several bridges
have collapsed. Mudslides washed away many of the roads.
</P>
<P>
   ''These roads are not designed, not built well enough, to handle
the sheer amount of traffic they are being used for,'' said Matt
Everitt of Timor Aid, in Dili.
</P>
<P>
   Severe flooding in the southern Betun region has affected
100,000 people in West Timor, with the areas of east and west
Malacca among the worst hit, Kerblat told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is rapidly worsening, he said. People have been
left without reliable water supplies and are running out of food.
There are also fears of an outbreak of cholera.
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon rains had been drenching the region for weeks, but
flooding first began earlier this week, said Jake Morland,
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Kupang,
the capital of West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 East Timorese fled to West Timor at the height of
violence that engulfed their country last September. At the time,
pro-Indonesian militias went on a rampage following a
U.N.-sponsored vote in which the overwhelming majority of East
Timorese supported breaking away from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the refugees have long since returned, 90,000
people -- mostly with family ties to the militias -- remain in the
squalid camps near the border.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has allowed U.N. aircraft to operate freely for at
least one week in its airspace, and the United Nations intends to
send humanitarian aid to stranded refugees on the western side of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.N. helicopters from East Timor had departed to help
evacuate people to higher ground, Morland said. The helicopters
will have a member of the Indonesian military and an interpreter on
board.
</P>
<P>
   ''Authorities here have welcomed the assistance, they are going
to be working alongside the Indonesian authorities and all the
international organizations here,'' said Morland.
</P>
<P>
   Ten trucks filled with plastic sheeting and other emergency
supplies have left Dili for West Timor, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far, 1,435 people have been evacuated from the southern
Belu region, and it's still raining,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government in West Timor is recovering bodies and
working to repair roads to allow emergency assistance to reach
isolated communities, Morland said.

<HEADLINE> Rubble From Philippine Blast Probed  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- A grenade blast in the violence-wracked
southern Philippines injured two people today, as negotiators hoped
to start formal talks with Muslim guerrillas holding 21 Western and
Asian hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The grenade exploded near a police station in Isabela, the
capital of southern Basilan province, vice Gov. Abdulaziz Balamo
said. Those injured had been inside the police station, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Balamo said he suspected the Abu Sayyaf rebels holding the
hostages were responsible. ''They are having a hard time now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, meanwhile, searched for clues in earlier blasts
in a busy market on the island of Jolo, where the hostages are
held, and in a bakery on the main southern island of Mindanao,
which killed at least eight people Thursday and injured at least
55.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the near-simultaneous timing of Thursday's
explosions led them to suspect they were the work of rebels
fighting for a separate Islamic state in the predominantly
Christian Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is possible that this is a diversionary tactic of the Abu
Sayyaf guerrillas,'' Jolo police chief Muhammad Alamia said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses saw three men throw grenades from the second floor of
the public market, Alamia said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the grenades exploded in a rice stall and the third in a
crowded alley, he said. Seven people were killed and at least 36
others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Another blast at almost the same time in the city of Zamboanga
on Mindanao island killed one woman and wounded at least 19 other
people, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the Zamboanga City police bomb squad, Bayani
Gucela, said the explosive was a ''very powerful homemade bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf snatched their hostages -- including three
Germans, two French, two Finns, two South Africans, a Lebanese,
nine Malaysians and two Filipinos -- on April 23 from Malaysia's
Sipadan Island and took them to Jolo, about an hour away by boat.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan envoy Abdul Rajab Azzarouq said today that formal talks
would start Saturday or Sunday and could take days. All three
negotiating sites on Jolo island proposed by the rebels are fine
with the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Formal talks have been delayed by clashes between the rebels and
troops and by frequent changes in the government negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine President Joseph Estrada, meanwhile, was due back in
Manila tonight after cutting short a state visit to China to deal
with the bombings and flooding elsewhere in the Philippines, Press
Secretary Ricardo Puno said.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf also are holding about eight Filipino hostages on
nearby Basilan island, the site of today's grenade attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels are the smaller and more radical of two
separatist groups battling the government in the impoverished
region.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people have been displaced by rising violence
in Mindanao since last month, when the army attacked a 10-mile
stretch of highway held for five years by the larger rebel group,
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. The MILF pulled out of peace
talks, but indicated Wednesday they are willing to return to the
negotiating table on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   A medical team that visited the hostages at the Abu Sayyaf
hide-out treated ailing German Renate Wallert, 57, whose freedom is
to be the first topic of negotiations. She continues to have high
blood pressure and has severe back pain that makes it difficult for
her to walk, said Nelsa Amin, Jolo's chief government doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said they also treated several rebels with bullet
wounds.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Cuban Teacher Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Should a 6-year-old boy be taught communist
ideals on U.S. soil?
</P>
<P>
   No, says Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who thinks it's a travesty
that Elian Gonzalez and four school companions from Cuba are
receiving classes each day from a teacher imported from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at a rural retreat on the Eastern Shore of
Maryland since a few days after he was seized by federal agents
from his Miami relatives on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   His teacher and classmates, all from his hometown of Cardenas,
joined him in Maryland a few days later. Also at the retreat are
Elian's father, stepmother and half brother.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez family is awaiting a court decision on whether
Elian can return to Cuba, as his father wishes.
</P>
<P>
   While no details have emerged about the content of the
instruction, Cuba has long relied on teachers to instill
revolutionary values.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez says that process begins when young children start
leaning their ABCs.
</P>
<P>
   ''A is for armas (arms), B is for batallon (battalion),'' says
Menendez, widely known on Capitol Hill as an unyielding opponent of
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington,
Luis Fernandez, calls Menendez's thesis ''totally ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   He says Elian's schooling is equivalent to home education
programs not uncommon in the United States. He adds that the
program is designed to enable Elian to make up for the five months
of schooling he lost when he was staying with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But Menendez says this is more than a catch-up program. ''I
can't believe the U.S. government has made it possible for Elian to
be indoctrinated on U.S. soil,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He also notes that pictures appeared in the Communist Party
newspaper in Cuba of Elian wearing a blue scarf, part of the
standard uniform of the Pioneers, a communist youth group.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the scarf ''a symbol of indoctrination.'' The message
is that Elian ''is a part of the communist youth of Cuba,''
Menendez says.
</P>
<P>
   He asks: ''Will we import anything that Elian's father might
want when it contravenes our beliefs?''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez says the blue scarf is simply part of the school
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children (in Cuba) go to school in uniform, just the way they
do at private schools in the United States. I don't see what the
problem is,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, says there is nothing improper about the
education arrangements for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   There might be a legitimate question if American children were
being taught by a Cuban teacher. But, in this case, the students
are Cuban nationals who are in the United States on temporary
visas, Cardona says.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures of Elian wearing the blue scarf touched a raw nerve
among some Cuban-Americans in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems communism has penetrated the United States,'' says
Ramon Chong, a Miami area security guard who came to the United
States from Cuba four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Elian's Miami relatives have complained to the INS
about their inability to visit or contact him since he has been in
his father's custody.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawyer said a priest, a psychologist and attorneys have
all been denied visitation although numerous Cuban government
officials have been allowed to visit Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Cardona said it is up to the boy's father to decide who visits
him, who speaks to him and what he wears.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt: No Charges in N.M. Fires  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A ''systematic failure'' in the Park
Service led to a wildfire that left 405 families homeless, but
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt say today there was no criminal
negligence and there will be no criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are mistakes,'' Babbitt said on NBC's ''Today'' show
this morning, the day after releasing a report blaming the fire on
a series of errors. ''There's nobody out there conspiring to burn
down the forests.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he expects some personnel actions once a review
board finishes its investigation next week, ''you don't prosecute
people for making mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   He does expects policy changes, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a systematic failure in the Park Service. I think we
are going to have to go back as a result of this investigation and
revamp the fire program from A to Z. ... We owe that to the
American people,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These forests are too thick,'' he said. ''They're explosive,
they're dangerous, and the reason is because fire has been excluded
for 100 years and there's too much fuel in the forests, too many
trees.''
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report released Thursday by Babbitt concluded that
National Park Service officials who started the fire May 4 to clear
brush did not follow proper procedures and did not have enough fire
crews on hand to keep it under control. The fire forced 25,000
people in and around Los Alamos to evacuate for up to five days and
scorched more than 47,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear there were large mistakes of agency oversight,''
Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The causal chain of this fire is quite complex. I would liken
it to what happens on a mountainside when a rock is dislodged,'' he
said. That one rock can create a ''cascading series of events.''
</P>
<P>
   Set at the nearby Bandelier National Monument, the blaze was
driven out of control by wind gusting to more than 50 mph. The fire
damaged some portable buildings at the storied Los Alamos nuclear
weapons laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was 70 percent contained Thursday, and officials said
they hoped to have it completely corralled next week. The areas
burning now, though, are a distance away from Los Alamos and most
residents are back in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt and federal lawmakers pledged to work on legislation to
pay all fire victims for losses not covered by insurance or
emergency assistance. The White House also said the government will
accept responsibility and take care of those who lost homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Los Alamos has been hit by an 18-wheeler, and the government
was driving that 18-wheeler,'' Gov. Gary Johnson said at Babbitt's
news conference Thursday. He asked the people of New Mexico to
''give the government a chance to make good on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found a ''number of critical deviations from both the
prescribed fire plan and standard fire practices'' -- including not
putting firefighters on standby before starting the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Bandelier employee Mike Powell, who directly
oversaw the prescribed burn, notified firefighting dispatchers in
Santa Fe the morning of May 4 that the burn was to take place that
evening. A dispatcher expressed concern because the Forest Service
had suspended prescribed burns as a result of high winds and dry
weather.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation found that the plan was not ''substantively
reviewed'' before it was approved by Bandelier Superintendent Roy
Weaver, who has taken responsibility for the blaze and been placed
on leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a tendency to rubber-stamp decisions made by people at
the field level,'' Babbitt said. ''That is an unacceptable
paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver has declined interviews and there was no answer Thursday
at his home. There was no listing for Powell in northern New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for the fire's escape on May 7, three days
after it was set. Fire crew members started a backburn in a flat
area full of dead wood in an attempt to rob the original fire of
fuel and halt its southward advance.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the ''burnout'' should have been set farther
north, in an area with less fuel and steeper slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the problem was the fact that Park Service
officials had requested a spot weather report for the wrong day and
were unaware that winds were predicted to increase, said John
Snook, a Forest Service official who was one of the investigators.
Those steady winds blew to the northeast and pushed the flames over
a ridge, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the fire topped the ridge, winds carried embers outside the
prescribed burn area and the fire established itself on the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   From there it moved steadily toward Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department said Thursday it could cost as much as
$150 million to clean up Los Alamos National Laboratory and reopen
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a dimly lit bar Thursday in Los Alamos, Danne
DeBacker watched Babbitt and other federal officials on television
explain the mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're just saying, 'Here's what happened.' We already know
what happened -- the damned forest burned down,'' said DeBacker,
whose home in the northwest part of Los Alamos was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sad, not just for my house, but for the forest,'' he said.
''Before these little black sticks were standing around here, we
had a really pristine forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal and Judy DeHaven, who lost their home of 23 years, were at
the bar with DeBacker.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of irresponsibility here,'' DeHaven said.
''They weren't prepared for what happened. This confirms our
suspicion that they burned our houses down and they owe us
something.''

Variant of Love Bug Virus Spreading
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An anti-virus software company says thousands of computers
at several large companies have been infected by a virus that uses the same
mechanism as the ''Love Bug'' virus, but is much more destructive and has a
different source code. While the ''Love Bug'' was given away by the ''ILOVEYOU''
subject line, the new virus changes subject lines every time it is sent. The
subject line of an infected e-mail starts with ''FW: '' and includes the name of
a randomly chosen attachment from a previous e-mail on an infected computer.
''Each time the virus spreads, it mutates itself to evade detection,'' Symantec
Corp., an anti-virus software maker in Cupertino, Calif., said yesterday.

as peace talks resumed today. The Palestinians turned down the latest deal. In
the West Bank, meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians hurled stones at Israeli
troops, an apparent response to Barak's warning today that he would not hand
over three West Bank villages next to Jerusalem, as promised, if there was a
flare-up. Newspaper reports said the villages could be handed to the
Palestinians as early as Sunday if there were no major disturbances.

Trade Deficit Sets Record in March
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit widened to an all-time high of
$30.2 billion in March as a record foreign oil bill overwhelmed a rebound in
American exports of farm products and autos. The deficit with China narrowed
slightly but the trade gap with Japan rose to its highest level this year. The
Commerce Department reported that the overall deficit increased by 5.1 percent
from a revised February figure of $28.7 billion. The trade deficit continues to
be the one glaring exception to the nation's current economic prosperity.

China, EU Reach Trade Deal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China and the European Union reached a market-opening trade
deal today, clearing Beijing's largest remaining hurdle to joining the World
Trade Organization. The deal's most immediate impact will likely be on a
contentious debate next week in the U.S. Congress on granting China much-sought
permanent low-tariff access to the American market. EU negotiators believe an
agreement with Beijing would sway wavering members of Congress into supporting
China's trading rights.

Three Die in Philly Pier Collapse
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rescue crews today are trying to determine why a pier
supporting a new outdoor nightclub collapsed into the Delaware River, killing
three people. Thirty-seven more were injured, including eight rescue workers
hurt trying to pull victims out of the water. Authorities say they don't believe
anyone is still missing. About 40 people were on the pier when it plunged into
the 30-foot-deep water yesterday evening. A canvas tent over the pier also
collapsed, blanketing many people who fell about eight feet into the water.
Eleven people remain hospitalized this morning.

<HEADLINE> Wen Ho Lee Case Said Poorly Handled  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A highly classified Justice Department report
concludes that the FBI failed to provide enough resources and
supervision to the Wen Ho Lee spy case and focused so narrowly on
the Los Alamos scientist that it may have missed other national
security breaches, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of the internal review conducted by federal
prosecutor Randy Bellows were presented to Attorney General Janet
Reno in the past week and echo prior congressional findings about
the government's investigation into possible espionage at its
nuclear labs.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Justice Department have battled for months in public
over whether the department's decision to decline an electronic
surveillance warrant for the Lee case hampered agents' work.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellows report, according to officials who have seen it,
concludes that the department should have approved the warrant
requested several times by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But it adds that the FBI did not provide all the information it
possessed that might help the department make the decision, the
officials told The Associated Press, speaking only on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman John Collingwood declined comment late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials added that the report concludes FBI agents spent
so much time fighting for the surveillance warrant that they missed
the opportunity to more quickly search Lee's work computer, where
they say they belatedly found evidence he downloaded prized nuclear
secrets from secure lab computers.
</P>
<P>
   Bellows concludes the FBI did not need the warrant to conduct
the search because Lee had no reasonable expectation of privacy on
a government computer, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy focus on Lee also kept the bureau from considering
other possible China espionage suspects and other possible leaks of
national security secrets, the report added.
</P>
<P>
   After months of suggestions that Lee would be indicted for China
espionage, the scientist was charged in December with lesser
offenses of removing nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos lab with
no suggestion he gave them to China.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is awaiting trial, has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press first reported in December that documents
showed the FBI began to doubt more than a year ago that Lee had
given China one of America's most prized nuclear secrets as
originally feared, but did not begin to refocus its investigation
to other possible suspects until late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellows report, the officials said, blames the FBI for not
providing enough leadership and resources to the espionage
investigation in its early stages.

<HEADLINE> Crews searching Delaware River after fatal nightclub-pier collapse  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rescue crews sifted through tangled dock
planks, deck furniture and floating debris today to determine why a
pier holding a new open-air nightclub collapsed into the Delaware
River, plunging dozens of people into the murky water.
</P>
<P>
   Three people died and 37 people were injured in Thursday night's
accident at the nightclub Heat, a waterside bar which opened this
month adjacent to the historic Moshulu ship-turned-restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ''One (patient) told me that they were standing there and
suddenly the floor gave out, the lights went out, and they were in
an ice bath,'' said Dr. Bartholomew Tortella of MCP Hahnemann
University Hospital, who treated victims and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard boats continued to search the water overnight and
closed down the river to all traffic between the Schuylkill River
and the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not found any additional people,'' U.S. Coast Guard
Capt. Gregory Adams said today.
</P>
<P>
   City police and fire crews called off their part of the search
until today because of the threat of a thunderstorm. They returned
to the scene this morning along with city building inspectors. The
Army Corps of Engineers was also on its way.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not believe any people were missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concern at this point is really to make sure that when
people come out here tonight to visit some of these other piers
that people are safe,'' Fire Commissioner Harold Hairston said
today.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Street was in South Carolina attending the medical
school graduation of his nephew, spokeswoman Barbara Grant said
today. Street issued a statement this morning calling for the city
to inspect all the piers along the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said city officials were assessing the situation to
determine if Street should immediately return to the city.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 people were on the pier when it dropped into the
30-foot-deep water at about 8:25 p.m. A canvas tent over the pier
also collapsed, blanketing many people who fell into the water and
bringing down the back walls of a dance hall connected to the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Debris from the tent, collapsed building and pier -- which was
still unstable overnight -- hampered rescue efforts along the rest
of the dock area, which is about eight feet above the water level.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all pancaked in there, the walls fell down on the
floor, then the ceiling, you had all kinds of deck furniture, and
kitchen equipment,'' injured Philadelphia firefighter Joe Whoriskey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whoriskey, who received a tetanus shot and antibiotics for
slashes and cuts, said rescue workers wore wetsuits in the water
but had to feel for victims with their feet since they couldn't see
through the dark, murky water. Seven other rescue workers also
suffered scrapes and bruises from pulling people out of the
debris-strewn shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 37 people injured, all but 9 were treated and released
with minor injures by early today. Identities of the victims were
not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were in fair condition at Hahnemann University
Hospital, a spokeswoman said. A woman was in serious condition at
the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania; a woman was in fair
condition and a man in good condition at St. Agnes Hospital. Two
women were in stable condition and a man was in guarded condition
at Thomas Jefferson Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   One man said his sister-in-law, DeAnn White of the city's
Germantown section, was among the dead. He said White was at the
club for an office party for employees of the aquarium in Camden,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was too young,'' Earl Gill said about his sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   A hostess at the restaurant, Eve McCarney, said workers had been
replacing some floorboards on Wednesday but did not do any major
structural repairs. She arrived for work Thursday night after the
accident and was standing with police and fire crews.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a loud crash, and then all hell broke loose. I went
straight down ... then I was just trying to fight my way up,'' said
bartender Joseph Capaci, 28, of Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went down so quick, people were just running,'' said Julie
Morgan of Haddonfield, N.J., who was pulled out of the water and
was sitting on the back of a police car with police blankets draped
over her after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The pier is about one-quarter the size of a football field,
behind the restaurant. The section that collapsed was along the
back wall of the ballroom facing the deck, said Stephanie
Franklin-Suber, the mayor's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The pier is owned by Portside Investments Inc. and Heat and the
restaurant are owned by HMS Ventures Inc., said Joe Martz, the
city's managing director. Martz said the owners, not the city, are
responsible for inspections of the pier.
</P>
<P>
   The adjacent restaurant is built into the 394-foot-long Moshulu
tall ship, a turn-of-the-century German cargo ship that has been
converted into an upscale restaurant. The Moshulu, which won a 1939
race among grain carriers for the fastest time from Australia
around Cape Horn to Europe, opened along the Philadelphia
waterfront in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a pier collapsed on the New Jersey side of the
Delaware River, submerging at least five vehicles and causing about
$10 million in damage.

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks May Name Suhonen Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Blackhawks will make Toronto
assistant Alpo Suhonen the NHL's first European-born head coach,
several newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Smith, the Blackhawks' manager of hockey operations,
declined to confirm the reports. But the newspapers, including the
Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times, said sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity told them Suhonen has reached contract terms
with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Suhonen, to be introduced Monday as the new coach, replaces
Lorne Molleken, fired earlier this month. Suhonen, of Finland, will
be the Blackhawks' 33rd coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''All that's left is the announcement,'' one source familiar
with the negotiations told the Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Suhonen interviewed with Smith last weekend near
Boston, then met with Hawks president Bill Wirtz and other
management figures in Chicago, both papers reported.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement will be delayed until next week because Suhonen
has personal commitments in Toronto, and Smith will be at his home
in Martha's Vineyard until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This won't be the first time Suhonen has coached in Chicago. He
coached the International Hockey League's Chicago Wolves in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said it makes no difference that Suhonen has never been an
NHL head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even these big-name coaches were head coaches in the NHL for
the first time at some point,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Suhonen has a difficult task. The Blackhawks haven't made the
Stanley Cup playoffs since 1997.

<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Police seized heroin and cocaine valued
at $175,000 and arrested 17 people in a multi-agency raid on a
suspected drug ring that operated out of a smoke shop.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs, targeted for sale in Rochester and Buffalo, were
transported here from New York City and southern Florida, U.S.
Attorney Denise O'Donnell said. In all, 18 people were sought on
distribution conspiracy charges but one was still being hunted.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said heroin use has been on the rise in upstate New
York. ''This really is a substantial narcotics roundup,
particularly one involving heroin,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-month investigation that culminated in Thursday's raids
was carried out by an array of federal, state and local police
agencies, notably the federal Drug Enforcement Agency and the New
York National Guard's counter drug unit.
</P>
<P>
   A stolen handgun was seized, along with $100,000 in cash. Police
said the drug ring operated out of Perla Blanca Smoke Shop and an
adjoining barber shop and auto repair business.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell identified the ring leader as Julio Perez, also known
as ''Pito.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the suspects could get up to 10 years to life in
prison and fines totaling more than $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, police infiltrated three cocaine rings in the
Rochester region in a yearlong operation that netted 22 suspected
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The gangs were all based in Rochester, shipping in drugs from
New York City, the Midwest and other sources and distributing them
throughout the city and outlying regions, including Genesee and
Orleans counties in rural western New York, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Charity Gives $6M To Fire Relatives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- The families of the six firefighters
killed in a warehouse blaze will each receive $1 million from a
charity fund despite the risk the foundation may be violating tax
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Worcester Telegram and Gazette Charitable Foundation has
received more than $6.4 million from 43,000 donors since the Dec. 3
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of the money came from companies and charitable
groups, which benefited from the fund's tax-deductible status. As a
nonprofit corporation, however, the foundation is bound by Internal
Revenue Service rules in disbursing the money to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The law is designed to ensure that such organizations, in
exchange for favorable tax treatment, help a large segment of the
community and not just a small, specific group.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were in a Catch-22,'' said Harry Whitin, a foundation
trustee and editor of the Telegram and Gazette newspaper. ''We
needed the tax deductibility in order to attract the donations, yet
the tax deductibility became a restriction on the eventual
disbursement of the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitin said the IRS could sanction the newspaper if it has
violated any rules.
</P>
<P>
   A committee that includes members of the firefighter's families
will decide how to spend the remaining money, which continues to
flow into the fund, Whitin said.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters died after two became lost in a burning
warehouse while searching for homeless people. Four more
firefighters went in to find them, and they all perished.

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The Rev. Franklin Graham, a son of
U.S. evangelist Billy Graham, met Friday with North Korean
officials, the North's media said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham had a warm talk with Kim Yong Dae, a vice parliamentary
speaker, said the North's foreign news outlet, KCNA.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Kye Gwan, a vice foreign minister who is North Korea's chief
negotiator with the United States on nuclear and other issues, sat
in at the meeting at Mansudae Assembly Hall in the capital of
Pyongyang, KCNA said.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, Graham recalled the ''intimate ties'' that
existed between his father and the late North Korean President Kim
Il Sung and pledged efforts to promote ties between the United
States and North Korea, KCNA said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham arrived Monday. The North's media gave no further
details, including the length and purpose of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's father visited North Korea several times in the late
1980s and early 1990s. The senior Graham met the late North Korean
leader during his 1994 visit.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 107; Nasdaq Off 78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in early trading today, with
investors still nervous about the impact that higher interest rates
will have on corporate earnings and stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 107.26 at 10,670.02.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 19.06 at 1,418.15, and the Nasdaq composite
index was off 77.95 at 3,460.76.
</P>
<P>
   As they've done for most of this week, investors spent today
trying to figure out what direction to take in a market facing
higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since June
on Tuesday, pushing the federal funds rate -- the interest that
banks charge each other for overnight loans -- to 6.5 percent, the
highest level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed indicated that inflation remains a risk, which raised
expectations among investors that the central bank was not yet
done.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they
cut into corporate profits by increasing the cost of borrowing
money.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of fear out there,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis. ''People are concerned and worried about how high interest
rates will go ... and this market will be volatile until there is
evidence on the table that the Fed will not derail the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be scouring new economic data in the coming weeks
to see if the Fed's actions are slowing the economy. The first
piece comes next Thursday, when the Commerce Department issues its
preliminary report on first-quarter gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are vulnerable to interest rate
fluctuations, fell today. Merrill Lynch dropped 3 1/16 to 106,
Morgan Stanley fell 3 1/16 to 71| and Lehman Brothers lost 2 15/16
to 82}.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also came under some selling pressure today.
Cisco fell 1 11/16 tot 53 11/16 and Apple Computer dropped 4 11/16
to 96 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 130.28 million
shares, up from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The stronger-than-normal volume was tied to today's
double-witching expiration of stock and index options.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 5.82 at 485.13.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.01 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 2.39 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 2.27 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 3.04 percent.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Turn Down Israel Offer  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- In its largest offer so far, Israel has
proposed that the Palestinians take control of 90 percent of the
West Bank, a senior Palestinian official said before peace talks
resumed today. He said the offer was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke late Thursday on condition of anonymity,
said the offer was made -- and turned down -- during last week's
round of talks in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank today, hundreds of Palestinians hurled stones
at Israeli troops who fired tear gas and rubber-coated steel
pellets in several clashes. In one march, demonstrators burned an
effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   At least 19 demonstrators were hurt by rubber bullets, including
one who was in serious condition with a head injury.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police pushed back the demonstrators in most areas
to keep down the friction, an apparent response to Barak's warning
today that he would not hand over three West Bank villages next to
Jerusalem, as promised, if there was a flare-up. Newspaper reports
said the villages could be handed to the Palestinians as early as
Sunday if there were no major disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian activists have said today and Saturday would be
''days of rage'' over Israel's refusal to release more Palestinian
security prisoners at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, marches pressing for freedom for the 1,650
Palestinian security prisoners escalated into Israeli-Palestinian
gun battles that killed three Palestinians in the worst violence in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden, meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
resumed talks today on the outlines of a peace treaty. A U.S.
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some progress
has been made in previous talks in Sweden, led by Israeli Public
Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian Parliament Speaker
Ahmed Qureia.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's round, Israel offered to give up 90 percent of
the West Bank but did not present a map or say whether the land
would be handed over in one or several stages, the Palestinian
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Israel offered to withdraw from 80 percent
of the West Bank, with 66 percent to be handed over with the
signing of a peace agreement and 14 percent after a test period of
several years. Under the Israeli proposal, the Palestinian entity
would consist of several blocs linked by roads, tunnels and
bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian official said the most recent Israeli offer
provided for greater contiguity of Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office refused comment today.
</P>
<P>
   After Muslim noon prayers today, groups of several hundred
marchers each walked from West Bank towns toward nearby Israeli
army positions, hurling stones at the troops. In most locations,
Palestinian police tried to push back the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank town of Qalqiliya, Palestinian security men
wielding clubs prevented marchers from reaching the nearest Israeli
position. In the town of Ramallah, demonstrators burned a Barak
effigy and a U.S. flag, then headed to a traffic circle on the
outskirts of town that was the scene of a four-hour gun battle on
Monday. About 200 protesters threw stones at soldiers who fired
rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Israel would link its handover of three villages near
Jerusalem -- Abu Dis, Izzarieh and Sawahra a-Sharkieh -- to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's ability to quell violent
protests this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (the handover) will be implemented only when we will see
that the needed steps were taken by the Palestinians to correct
what happened this Monday,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's parliament narrowly approved the transfer of the
villages earlier this week, despite objections by the hawkish
opposition and several members of Barak's coalition. Hard-liners
said the withdrawal will weaken Israel's hold over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said in an interview published today in the Israeli daily
Haaretz that he made a mistake in refusing to hand over the three
villages earlier. ''I could have handled it better if I'd
transferred them earlier,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Va. Gov. Attacks Museum Exhibit  </HEADLINE>
By BOB LEWIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Virginia's governor says a photographer's
sexually graphic slide show had no place in a state-owned art
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Gilmore objected to the presentation by Sally Mann in a
letter this week to officials at the Virginia Museum of Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of her 90-minute lecture May 10, Mann showed
pictures that included depictions of oral sex, genitalia and young
girls urinating, according to witness accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Richard Woodward, the museum's interim
director, Gilmore said he was ''shocked and dismayed that this type
of exhibit occurred on state owned property.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration learned of the presentation after verifying
the claims of someone who had attended it and anonymously wrote to
Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by e-mail Thursday if any museum patrons complained, Mann,
who lives in Lexington, responded: ''Never has anyone objected. To
the contrary, the images have been lauded.'' She declined to speak
by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to Gilmore, Woodward said he had given
copies of the governor's letter to the museum's board of trustees
and promised new guidelines for reviewing exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's 1992 book, ''Immediate Family,'' depicted her children --
nude in some pictures -- and prompted protests at bookstores that
carried it.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani condemned an
exhibition that included a painting of a black Virgin Mary adorned
with elephant dung at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. He threatened to
freeze $7 million in public funding for the museum. The issue went
to court and the two sides reached a settlement.

<HEADLINE> UK, US Slash Breast Cancer Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Improved treatments in the last 10 years have
pushed breast cancer death rates down by about 25 percent in the
United States and Britain among young and middle-aged women,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Already 60,000 deaths have been avoided in the two countries
because of the treatments, chemotherapy and tamoxifen, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the credit goes to the drug tamoxifen, taken by about 1
million women worldwide, said Sir Richard Peto, a professor of
epidemiology at Oxford University who headed the study, published
this week in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time that improvements in the treatment of
any type of cancer have ever produced such a rapid fall in national
death rates,'' according to Peto, who said he examined the largest
collection of existing evidence on cancer therapy so far assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ''They really are remarkable trends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While ''a lot of things contribute, I think the key one is
tamoxifen,'' Peto said, adding that it's much too sudden a drop to
be due to changes in the causes of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and the United States were studied mostly because they
had the most current, detailed statistical information and because
they were among the first to use tamoxifen, Peto said.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of other Western countries would show they already
are starting to see a similar trend, said Dr. Kent Osborne,
director of the breast center at Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston, who was not connected with the study.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne agreed with Peto that breast cancer screening, which
only started to become widespread in the 1980s, has not been around
long enough to cause the death rates to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Peto said death rates will continue to decline once the benefits
of screening emerge and other countries begin to more widely use
tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   His analysis showed that breast cancer deaths will be down 24
percent in Britain overall, compared with the late 1980s, before
chemotherapy and tamoxifen became widely available. It indicated
that the disease would result in 13,000 deaths this year instead of
17,000.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that among British middle-aged women, who have
benefited from tamoxifen, deaths will be down by a slightly greater
figure, but details of actual numbers were not available.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will experience a 20 percent drop in the
breast cancer death rate overall, with about 40,000 women dying of
the disease this year, Peto said. If treatment methods were at
their pre-1989 stage, 50,000 would die this year, he said. But
among young and middle-aged women, deaths will be down 25 percent
this year -- 21,000 will die instead of 28,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is slightly ahead, probably because tamoxifen was
invented there and used there first, Peto said.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer is particularly problematic because remnants may
remain after a tumor has been cut out and can cause a recurrence of
cancer years later.
</P>
<P>
   There are three main treatments after surgery. Radiotherapy
targets the remnants of cancer lurking in or near the breast.
Chemotherapy is a cocktail of cell-killing drugs, and tamoxifen and
other hormonal drugs block hormones from nurturing the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen alone has been found to head off one in six
recurrences and cut the risk of relapse by more than one-third. It
also halves the risk of a new cancer occurring in the other breast,
according to Peto's analysis, which examined the largest-ever
collection of existing evidence on cancer therapy.
</P>
<P>
   While tamoxifen fights cancer, it also can cause womb cancer and
blood clots in the lungs. But using the drug for five years does 30
times more good than harm, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   For every 1,000 women who take it, tamoxifen leads to 80 fewer
deaths from breast cancer, two more deaths from womb cancer and one
more death from blood clots in the lungs, it found.
</P>
<P>
   Chemotherapy seems to work as well as tamoxifen in young women,
but only about a third as well as tamoxifen in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   When the two are used together, the chances of survival are even
better.
</P>
<P>
   Radiotherapy, the oldest treatment, prevents about two-thirds of
recurrences, but has yielded only a 1 percent decrease in the
overall death rates. While it works well in clearing up rogue bits
of cancer in the breast, it also increases the risk of heart
attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, radiotherapy has reduced the death rate from breast
cancer by 5 percent since the late 1980s, but has increased the
rate of death from other causes by 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This radiotherapy effect is certainly not going to explain the
trend,'' said Jack Cuzick, a professor of mathematics, statistics
and epidemiology at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London,
which funded the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Death rates from lung cancer have plummeted, but that has mainly
been due to people quitting smoking. Cervical cancer rates have
also fallen, but mostly because of early detection.
</P>
<P>
   While improved treatment has led to better survival in rare
cancers such as Hodgkins disease and childhood leukemia, none of
the other major cancers have benefited as much as breast cancer,
Peto said.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the breast cancer deaths prevented will be
among women aged between 20 and 69, the research found.

<HEADLINE> Silver ally on coup attempt: I believe this is over  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A powerful ally of state Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver said today that he believed the attempted coup
against the speaker by former Assembly Majority Leader Michael
Bragman had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ''From my end, I believe this is over,'' Assemblyman Roberto
Ramirez, who is also the Bronx Democratic chairman, told Albany's
WROW-AM radio this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a top aide to Silver said one of Bragman's biggest
supporters, Queens Democratic Chairman Thomas Manton, a former
congressman, had reached out this morning to Silver in an attempt
to make peace with the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Manton nor Silver could be reached immediately for
comment on that.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman did not immediately return telephone messages left for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan Democrat Silver retaliated Thursday against supporters
of the ongoing coup attempt by Bragman.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, the leader of the Assembly majority's more conservative
upstate wing, called the moves by his fellow Democrat
''intolerable'' and accused Silver of having a leadership style
that was ''secretive and aloof.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver spokeswoman Patricia Lynch said her boss was solidly in
control.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, supporters of the Manhattan Democrat were working
the telephones furiously behind the scenes in an attempt to turn
back the Bragman challenge.
</P>
<P>
   That effort appeared to pay off, at least to some extent, when
Ramirez announced Thursday night that he was backing Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am absolutely, unequivocally, 100 percent behind Speaker
Sheldon Silver,'' Ramirez said, adding that the 10-member Bronx
Democratic delegation to the Assembly appeared to be in agreement
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman went public with his coup attempt on Wednesday, saying
he planned to formally make his move Monday when the Assembly
reconvenes. Silver immediately stripped Bragman of the majority
leader's title.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Silver stripped two veteran members of the Assembly
of their committee chairmanships for supporting Bragman. In losing
their chairmanships, Martin Luster of Ithaca and Ronald Tocci of
Westchester County also lost the $12,500 stipends that go with the
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman called it an attempt to intimidate Assembly members that
would backfire and bring him even more support. The Syracuse-area
Democrat said it was also a sign Silver was ''absolutely
panic-stricken.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sitting here this morning with 50 rock-solid (Democratic)
votes,'' he added. That would give the majority leader the
advantage within the 98-member Democratic majority in the
150-member house that will decide on Bragman's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, neither Bragman nor Silver would release lists of
their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman did charge that in the current leadership battle Silver
''has surrounded himself with paid lobbyists and other
non-legislators who are seeking to influence members on how to vote
on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman's charge came as several powerful New York labor union
leaders, including state AFL-CIO President Denis Hughes, issued a
statement saying ''a divisive battle for the speakership at this
time is counterproductive.'' The statement did not specifically
endorse Silver.
</P>
<P>
   But just minutes later, a revised statement was issued by the
same labor leaders in which the claim that a leadership battle
would be counterproductive was removed. A spokesman for Hughes said
the first statement had been issued in error. The second statement
took no position on the wisdom of having a leadership fight.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman indicated he was being supported in his effort by state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I am concerned, Carl and I are partners,'' Bragman
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said he was not helping either Silver or Bragman and that
when Assembly members called asking for advice, ''I'm telling them
that they've got to make a decision about what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George Pataki offered a similarly neutral stance
when current state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno moved
successfully to oust Ralph Marino as the GOP leader of the Senate
over the Thanksgiving Day weekend in 1994. At the time, the Pataki
statement was viewed by many Republicans as the go-ahead for GOP
senators to join the revolt against Marino.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the current situation was different. ''I'm not the
governor. I don't have that kind of influence ... I'm not involved.
It doesn't help me to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall, who is preparing for a run for governor in 2002, is the
only black ever elected to statewide office in New York and has
great sway with the Assembly's black lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the battle between Silver and Bragman stems at least in
part from the former majority leader's backing of McCall's
gubernatorial effort over federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo's
possible run for the job his father, Mario Cuomo, lost to Pataki in
1994. Silver has been widely seen as a Cuomo supporter.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation Thursday that should it be evident by
Monday that Silver doesn't have the votes to remain as speaker,
some other Assembly Democrat from New York City may step forward to
challenge Bragman for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a Democratic speaker of the Assembly from
outside New York City in more than 80 years. Should Bragman get the
job it would mean the city wouldn't have one of its own in the room
when Pataki, Bruno and the Assembly speaker negotiate budget deals
and other major issues.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Philly Pier Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rescue crews picked through tangled planks
and floating debris today as authorities tried to determine why a
pier supporting a new outdoor nightclub collapsed into the Delaware
River.
</P>
<P>
   Three people died and 37 others were injured, including eight
rescue workers hurt trying to pull victims out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a loud crash, and then all hell broke loose. I went
straight down ... then I was just trying to fight my way up,'' said
bartender Joseph Capaci, 28.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 people were on the pier when it plunged into the
30-foot-deep water shortly after 8 p.m. Thursday. A canvas tent
over the pier also collapsed, blanketing many people who fell eight
feet into the dark, murky water.
</P>
<P>
   ''One (patient) told me that they were standing there and
suddenly the floor gave out, the lights went out, and they were in
an ice bath,'' said Dr. Bartholomew Tortella of MCP Hahnemann
University Hospital, who treated victims and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the pier, which is about one-quarter the size of a
football field, are 100 years old, officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The debris and darkness hampered rescue efforts. Firefighter Joe
Whoriskey said rescue workers wore wet suits but had to feel for
victims with their feet since they couldn't see.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all pancaked in there, the walls fell down on the
floor, then the ceiling, you had all kinds of deck furniture and
kitchen equipment,'' said Whoriskey, who received a tetanus shot
and antibiotics for slashes and cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Though authorities didn't believe anyone was still missing,
Coast Guard boats continued to search the water overnight, and the
river was closed down to all traffic between the Schuylkill River
and the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not found any additional people,'' U.S. Coast Guard
Capt. Gregory Adams said at a morning briefing.
</P>
<P>
   City police and fire crews and building inspectors were also at
the scene, and the Army Corps of Engineers was on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people remained hospitalized this morning. At least one was
in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   The pier held a bar, Heat, which opened last month and is
attached to a ballroom dancing area behind the upscale Moshulu
restaurant, in a 394-foot boat docked on the river. The section
that collapsed was along the back wall of the ballroom facing the
deck, said Stephanie Franklin-Suber, the mayor's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   A hostess at the restaurant, Eve McCarney, said workers had
replaced some floorboards Wednesday but did not do any major
structural work. Fire and police officials were investigating, as
were officials from the Department of Licenses and Inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a pier collapsed on the New Jersey side of the
Delaware River, submerging at least five vehicles and causing about
$10 million in damage.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Prime Minister Taken Hostage  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- After months of simmering ethnic tensions,
seven masked gunmen stormed parliament today and took the prime
minister and his Cabinet hostage, saying they were seizing power
from the democratically elected government on behalf of indigenous
Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   The country's president declared a state of emergency and
appealed to the attackers to release the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen fired at least two shots from AK-47 rifles inside
parliament before locking up Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, his
Cabinet ministers and lawmakers of the ruling coalition in the
legislature's upper chamber. No injuries were reported among the
estimated 50 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry is Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister. His
year-old administration is the first to be dominated by
Indo-Fijians, a fact that has angered some indigenous people in
this group of Pacific Ocean islands about 2,250 miles northeast of
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   George Speight, who described himself as the coup leader, said
he seized power on behalf of all ethnic Fijians. He appointed an
opposition lawmaker as interim prime minister in Chaudhry's place
and suspended the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Late today, he claimed all ethnic Fijian parties supported his
move and said he had the backing of the Fijian military, local
media reported.
</P>
<P>
   His claim could not immediately be verified and the military
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mobs of youths rampaged through the streets of the capital,
Suva, after the coup, burning and looting shops, while up to 5,000
people gathered outside parliament chanting and cheering in support
of the attack. Truck drivers played reggae music.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke hung over the downtown area as dozens of stores -- which
are predominantly owned by ethnic Indians -- went up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Police imposed a curfew late today and troops fanned out across
the city to protect private property.
</P>
<P>
   Tension has been building for months in Fiji between ethnic
Indians, who make up about 44 percent of the nation's 813,000
people, and the Fijians, who account for 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, thousands of indigenous Fijians marched through Suva
demanding Chaudhry's resignation and claiming his government
favored ethnic Indians. Chaudhry responded earlier this month by
banning future protests, saying police advised him they may not be
able to cope.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said the ethnic Fijian-dominated armed forces ''are
passive but remain at the beck and call and the control of the
civilian government that is in place at this time that is headed by
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara appealed to the hostage-takers
to release the lawmakers. He also urged the army and police to
restore the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret to say what is happening today is not in accordance
with the constitution and is therefore unlawful,'' Ratu Mara said,
declaring the state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Fiji's police and army to try to put down the
revolt led to fears that the rebels may have widespread backing
from native Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   But one analyst said Speight had little support.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a person who is, I think, politically naive, personally
ambitious and eager for some limelight,'' said Pacific analyst
Professor Brij Lal of the Australian National University. ''I don't
think he represents any constituency except a group of disgruntled
Fijians.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight, the son of an opposition lawmaker, released a statement
saying he had taken control of Fiji, a local news Web site
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through these actions I am asserting ownership, am asserting
control and I am asserting executive power over Fiji. We have
revoked the constitution and have set that aside,'' Speight said.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil came on the first anniversary of Chaudhry's
election. Fijian nationalists have accused him of promoting
pro-Indian policies.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of Chaudhry centers on his attempts to persuade Fijian
landowners to renew expiring leases on farmland held by thousands
of ethnic Indian tenants, who are the core of his political
support.
</P>
<P>
   Both Australia and New Zealand called for the immediate release
of the hostages and a return to the rule of law. The U.S. Embassy
in Suva added this: ''The consequences of any unconstitutional
seizure of power would be very substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Fiji, Australian David Pitt, finance manager with
the Air Fiji airline, said some foreigners were preparing to leave
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sitiveni Rabuka, a former army colonel who led two coups in
1987, visited parliament and pleaded with the gunmen to surrender,
but they refused. Rabuka, who held power for 12 years after the
coups, was accompanied by senior army and police officials.
</P>
<P>
   He did manage to secure the release of speaker Apenisa
Kurisiqila, the local news Web site Fijilive.com reported. Rabuka
left parliament without commenting on conditions inside.

<HEADLINE> Arson Feared in Tampa, Fla.  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A roaring fire broke out today at an
apartment complex under construction in Tampa's arson-plagued Ybor
City section, sending up a column of smoke visible from at least 15
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge ball of flame,'' Fire Department Capt. Bill Wade
said. There was no immediate information on what may have caused
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of Interstate 4 was shut down in both directions and
the nearby Hilton Hotel and the sheriff's office were being
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The fire is in a section of town that has been plagued by serial
arsonists responsible for 36 fires in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those fires have been set in the Tampa Heights
neighborhood, but some have been in historic Ybor City, located
just north of downtown. The arson targets have been abandoned and
occupied homes, a church and at least one apartment complex under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been injured, but some of the fires have been set at
night in homes where people were sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been sleeping two or three hours a night,'' said Dave
Davis, who has spent the last five years renovating a 1912 home.
''Every time the dog barks I'm looking out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has formed a task force with state and federal arson
investigators. Without even a description of a suspect they have
little to go on.
</P>
<P>
   The arsons have been a blow to city leaders who've pushed to
rebuild neighborhoods where an eclectic mix of homes and brick
streets built from the 1890s to 1920s turned in recent years into
the turf of drug dealers and prostitutes. Young professionals have
been lured to restore the historic homes with the help of
government tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Only one person has been arrested, for the most recent fire
before today, in a vacant home Tuesday. But task force
investigators do not believe the man, Carl Lester Simms, is
responsible for the other fires.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Serrales, a real estate agent, said the area still holds
promise of becoming a desirable neighborhood despite the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of negative that there's an arsonist in the area,
it's a little frightening and scary,'' he said. ''But it's also
helped Tampa Heights, it's put it on the map. People see it on
television and see the beautiful houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Noriega, the mayor's top aide on redevelopment issues,
said the fires aren't scaring away those willing to invest in
redevelopment -- yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been an uphill battle,'' he said. ''There are a lot of
urban pioneers who have made a lifetime investment there. There are
appraisers going out there, lenders taking a look. Although they
say they don't worry, I'm sure they do.''
</P>
<P>
   When the fires first began, the neighborhoods buzzed with
theories on who is responsible. Some blamed owners of ramshackle
houses or the city, thinking they did it to save the cost of
tearing down houses. Others speculated it was residents who felt
shoved aside by monied newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Noriega dismisses such theories, saying it costs no more to haul
away a dilapidated house as it does to haul away the burned
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a person who is really sick,'' Noriega said of the
arsonist. ''I hope the neighborhood doesn't get him before the
authorities do. There isn't going to be much left of him.''

<HEADLINE> Two Auburn Football Players Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn football players Deandre Green and
Brandon Reed were charged after a handgun was fired to break up a
fight at a fraternity concert.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow, Nasdaq Both Down More Than 100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today, with investors still nervous
about the impact that higher interest rates will have on corporate
earnings and stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 132.61 at 10,644.67.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 26.95 at 1,410.26, and the Nasdaq composite
index was off 119.21 at 3,419.50.
</P>
<P>
   As they've done for most of this week, investors spent today
trying to figure out what direction to take in a market facing
higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since June
on Tuesday, pushing the federal funds rate -- the interest that
banks charge each other for overnight loans -- to 6.5 percent, the
highest level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed indicated that inflation remains a risk, which raised
expectations among investors that the central bank was not yet
done.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they
cut into corporate profits by increasing the cost of borrowing
money.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of fear out there,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis. ''People are concerned and worried about how high interest
rates will go ... and this market will be volatile until there is
evidence on the table that the Fed will not derail the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be scouring new economic data in the coming weeks
to see if the Fed's actions are slowing the economy. The first
piece comes next Thursday, when the Commerce Department issues its
preliminary report on first-quarter gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are vulnerable to interest rate
fluctuations, fell today. Merrill Lynch dropped 3~ to 105 3/16,
Morgan Stanley fell 4 9/16 to 70[ and Lehman Brothers lost 3 3/16
to 82{.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also came under some selling pressure today.
Cisco fell 2} to 52|, Intel lost 3 1/16 to 120~ and Apple Computer
dropped 6 to 94}.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 285.65 million
shares, up from 266.48 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The stronger-than-normal volume was tied to today's
double-witching expiration of stock and index options.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 10.65 at 480.30.

<HEADLINE> Spy Probe Said Poorly Handled  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A highly classified Justice Department report
concludes that the FBI failed to provide enough resources and
supervision to the Wen Ho Lee spy case and focused so narrowly on
the Los Alamos scientist that it may have missed other national
security breaches, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of the internal review conducted by federal
prosecutor Randy Bellows were presented to Attorney General Janet
Reno in the past week and echo prior congressional findings about
the government's investigation into possible espionage at its
nuclear labs.
</P>
<P>
   At her weekly news conference today, Reno said she had been
briefed on the report but was still reading the nearly 800-page
document and its three appendices.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is detailed, it is comprehensive, it is thoughtful,'' Reno
said. ''The Federal Bureau of Investigation, has been very
forthcoming and cooperated. And I think we're all interested in
using the contents of this report to shape the future efforts in
this regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she ''very much would like to share it with Congress''
and was examining how to do that ''consistent with pending
matters'' like the prosecution of Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Justice Department have battled for months in public
over whether the department's decision to decline an electronic
surveillance warrant for the Lee case hampered agents' work.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellows report, according to officials who have seen it,
concludes that the department should have approved the warrant
requested several times by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But it adds that the FBI did not provide all the information it
possessed that might help the department make the decision, the
officials told The Associated Press, speaking only on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman John Collingwood declined comment late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials added that the report concludes FBI agents spent
so much time fighting for the surveillance warrant that they missed
the opportunity to more quickly search Lee's work computer, where
they say they belatedly found evidence he downloaded prized nuclear
secrets from secure lab computers.
</P>
<P>
   Bellows concludes the FBI did not need the warrant to conduct
the search because Lee had no reasonable expectation of privacy on
a government computer, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy focus on Lee also kept the bureau from considering
other possible China espionage suspects and other possible leaks of
national security secrets, the report added.
</P>
<P>
   After months of suggestions that Lee would be indicted for China
espionage, the scientist was charged in December with lesser
offenses of removing nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos lab with
no suggestion he gave them to China.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is awaiting trial, has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press first reported in December that documents
showed the FBI began to doubt more than a year ago that Lee had
given China one of America's most prized nuclear secrets as
originally feared, but did not begin to refocus its investigation
to other possible suspects until late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellows report, the officials said, blames the FBI for not
providing enough leadership and resources to the espionage
investigation in its early stages.

<HEADLINE> Crews searching Delaware River after fatal nightclub-pier collapse  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rescue crews picked through tangled planks
and floating debris today as authorities tried to determine why a
pier supporting a new outdoor nightclub collapsed into the Delaware
River.
</P>
<P>
   Three people died and 37 people were injured in Thursday night's
accident at Heat, a waterside bar which opened this month adjacent
to the historic Moshulu ship-turned-restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ''One (patient) told me that they were standing there and
suddenly the floor gave out, the lights went out, and they were in
an ice bath,'' said Dr. Bartholomew Tortella of MCP Hahnemann
University Hospital, who treated victims and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard boats searched the water overnight and closed down
the river to all traffic between the Schuylkill River and the
Benjamin Franklin Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not found any additional people,'' U.S. Coast Guard
Capt. Gregory Adams said today.
</P>
<P>
   City police and fire crews returned to the scene this morning
along with city building inspectors. The Army Corps of Engineers
was also on its way.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not believe any people were missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concern at this point is really to make sure that when
people come out here tonight to visit some of these other piers
that people are safe,'' Fire Commissioner Harold Hairston said
today.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Street was in South Carolina attending the medical
school graduation of his nephew, spokeswoman Barbara Grant said
today. Street issued a statement this morning calling for the city
to inspect all the piers along the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said city officials were assessing the situation to
determine if Street should immediately return to the city.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 people were on the pier when it dropped into the
30-foot-deep water at about 8:25 p.m. A canvas tent over the pier
also collapsed, blanketing many people who fell into the water and
bringing down the back walls of a dance hall connected to the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Debris from the tent, collapsed building and pier hampered
rescue efforts along the rest of the dock area, which is about
eight feet above the water level.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all pancaked in there, the walls fell down on the
floor, then the ceiling, you had all kinds of deck furniture, and
kitchen equipment,'' injured Philadelphia firefighter Joe Whoriskey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whoriskey, who received a tetanus shot and antibiotics for
slashes and cuts, said rescue workers wore wetsuits in the water
but had to feel for victims with their feet since they couldn't see
through the murky water. Seven other rescue workers also suffered
scrapes and bruises from pulling people out of the debris-strewn
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 37 people injured, all but 9 were treated and released
with minor injures by early today. Identities of the victims were
not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were in fair condition at Hahnemann University
Hospital, a spokeswoman said. A woman was in serious condition at
the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania; a woman was in fair
condition and a man in good condition at St. Agnes Hospital. Two
women were in stable condition and a man was in guarded condition
at Thomas Jefferson Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   One man said his sister-in-law, DeAnn White of the city's
Germantown section, was among the dead. He said White was at the
club for an office party for employees of the aquarium in Camden,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was too young,'' Earl Gill said about his sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   A hostess at the restaurant, Eve McCarney, said workers had been
replacing some floorboards Wednesday but did not do any major
structural repairs. She arrived for work Thursday night after the
accident and was standing with police and fire crews.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a loud crash, and then all hell broke loose. I went
straight down ... then I was just trying to fight my way up,'' said
bartender Joseph Capaci, 28, of Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went down so quick, people were just running,'' said Julie
Morgan of Haddonfield, N.J., who was pulled out of the water and
was sitting on the back of a police car with police blankets draped
over her after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   A former industrial area of warehouses, the waterfront near the
pier consists mainly of nightclubs that cater to the college-aged
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The pier, parts of which are believed to be 100 years old, is
about one-quarter the size of a football field, behind the
restaurant. The section that collapsed was along the back wall of
the ballroom facing the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the pier, known as Pier 34, collapsed in 1994 and was
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The pier is owned by Portside Investments Inc. and Heat and the
restaurant are owned by HMS Ventures Inc., said Joe Martz, the
city's managing director. Martz said the owners, not the city, are
responsible for inspections of the pier.
</P>
<P>
   The adjacent restaurant is built into the 394-foot-long Moshulu
tall ship, a turn-of-the-century German cargo ship that has been
converted into an upscale restaurant. The Moshulu, which won a 1939
race among grain carriers for the fastest time from Australia
around Cape Horn to Europe, opened along the Philadelphia
waterfront in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a pier collapsed on the New Jersey side of the
Delaware River, submerging at least five vehicles and causing about
$10 million in damage.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Marks Armed Forces Day  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) -- America's military servicemen
and -women are serving in a world where communication and the
threat of destruction are instantaneous, President Clinton said
Friday in observing the 50th anniversary of Armed Forces Day.
</P>
<P>
   The first president to serve his entire term in the post-Cold
War era, Clinton noted he has asked the armed forces to handle a
patchwork of assignments: flying missions over Kosovo, containing
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, keeping the peace in Bosnia and
slogging through the mud to rebuild communities in Central America
after Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Often when I see our young men and women in uniform I don't
know whether to thank them or apologize, because I know what
burdens I have imposed on many of you and your families,'' Clinton
told several hundred members of the military and their families at
a ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon fire opened the program at the air base. Tents created
the atmosphere of a fair and visitors could get a close-up view of
military aircraft parked on the tarmac. A few paper airplanes
soared over the audience as dignitaries spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ''You stand as freedom's guardians in a world where
communication is instant, but so is destruction,'' Clinton said.
It's a world ''where the threats of the last century have largely
been vanquished, but the timeless demons of hate and fear and new
destructive possibilities rooted in new technologies and new
networks are with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also thanked the Senate for voting Thursday against
setting a deadline for withdrawing 5,600 U.S. troops from Kosovo.
''The Senate said, 'No, we won't walk out on our allies. ... It may
be a difficult job, but we started it and we intend to finish
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, President Truman authorized the holiday on the third
Saturday in May as a time to reflect on the contributions that the
forces have made to freedom. The single-day celebration, begun in
1950, replaced separate Army, Navy and Air Force days and stemmed
from the unification of the armed forces under one agency -- the
Department of Defense.

<HEADLINE> FBI Memo Cites Reno Probe Pressure  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hinting at political pressure in the earliest
days of the Democratic fund-raising scandal, FBI Director Louis
Freeh wrote a memo suggesting a top prosecutor was being urged not
to proceed with the investigation in order to protect Attorney
General Janet Reno's job.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, turned over belatedly to Senate investigators this
week, also discloses that Freeh wanted Reno and Justice Department
public integrity chief Lee Radek to step aside from the
investigation as early as December 1996 because of purported
comments made by Radek.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was described to The Associated Press on Thursday by
several government officials who have seen it since the FBI turned
it over to be produced to the Senate and House Judiciary committees
investigating the fund-raising matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dec. 9, 1996, memo to Deputy FBI Director William J.
Esposito, Freeh recounted, thirdhand, comments Radek allegedly made
to Esposito suggesting he was being pressured in connection with
the investigation into Democratic fund-raising improprieties during
President Clinton's 1996 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I also advised the attorney general of Lee Radek's comment to
you that there was a lot of 'pressure' on him'' and the
department's public integrity section ''regarding this case because
the attorney general's job might hang in the balance (or words to
that effect),'' Freeh wrote Esposito three days after meeting with
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, portions of which were read to the AP by the sources,
does not state where the pressure was coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Radek, whose public integrity section investigates allegations
against government officials and handled the early stages of the
fund-raising probe, said late Thursday the memo's description of
the conversation has ''no basis in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo was written just weeks after the first allegations of
Democratic fund-raising improprieties from the Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were reports in Washington speculating
whether Reno would serve a second term as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Though she steadfastly resisted an independent prosecutor for
fund-raising, Reno named a total of seven independent counsels to
investigate the president and his administration -- at times
angering Clinton's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh wrote Esposito that he met with Reno and told her about
Radek's purported comments and suggested ''on that basis'' both
Radek and Reno should step aside from the investigation, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached late Thursday, Radek said he never was under pressure to
scrap the investigation to help Reno and did not recall ever making
such comments to Esposito.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no recollection of ever saying I was under pressure
because the attorney general's job hung in the balance. Nor is it
something I would have said because it has no basis in fact,''
Radek said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Reno herself said today: ''As for me, I call it like I see it,
regardless of the consequences. I've got a month-to-month lease on
my apartment, and I've been prepared to go home from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at her weekly news conference, Reno added she did not
recall Freeh briefing her on Radek's purported remarks or ''talking
about pressure because of the job. I do have a recollection of him
(Freeh) saying that we should get a junkyard dog to prosecute the
case, but I think that was said on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had some discussions about (the) Public Integrity (section)
on a continuing basis and he talked about getting a what he
referred to as a junkyard dog,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman John Collinwood declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said: ''This attorney
general has never let her own self-interest color her own decision
making. She bases her decisions on the law and the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also turned over a second memo from Freeh that discloses
that early in the fund-raising probe the Justice Department tried
to bypass FBI agents for investigative work, relying instead on
inspector general investigators from the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh wrote his general counsel that he was concerned the bureau
was being cut out of the fund-raising probe, the officials said,
describing the memos.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the Freeh memo comes at a sensitive time for
the FBI and Justice Department, whose relations have been strained
by public disputes over the investigations into China espionage and
fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials told the AP that Reno has received an
internal report on the government's handling of the case of nuclear
lab scientist Wen Ho Lee that criticizes the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Freeh memo involving the fund-raising issue emerges more
than two years after Congress first began reviewing the conduct and
quality of the criminal fund-raising investigation, in which
several Democratic donors and fund-raisers have been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the FBI did not disclose the existence of the
memo to Justice officials until late last month and that it wasn't
turned over to Senate investigators until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers mostly have focused on debates within Justice and the
FBI in 1997, 1998 and 1999 to name an independent prosecutor to
take over the probe of Clinton and Vice President Al Gore's
fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh and the former head of the Justice task force that ran the
investigation both have acknowledged they fervently argued for
appointment of a special prosecutor, but Reno turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   But Freeh's memo provides the first evidence that such arguments
dated to the very beginning of the investigation in late 1996 and
were based in part on concerns about possible political pressure.

</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since June

</P>
<P>
   The Fed indicated that inflation remains a risk, which raised
expectations among investors that the central bank was not yet

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Bar Gunmaker Preferences  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gun-control opponents in Congress have amended
a major defense bill to bar the Pentagon from giving preferential
treatment to Smith &AMP; Wesson, the manufacturer that reached a gun
safety agreement with the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The two-paragraph article in the 474-page bill states that no
Pentagon funds may be used to give a preference to a marketer or
vendor of firearms or ammunition based on an agreement with the
government. The House approved the $310 billion defense
authorization bill Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest pistol-maker, is not
mentioned, lawmakers on both sides of the gun issue said it was the
clear target.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Hostettler, R-Ind., a pro-gun lawmaker who authored
the language, ''does not want to compromise the lives and safety of
our men and women in uniform simply for the sake of a political
agreement,'' said his spokesman, Michael Jahr.
</P>
<P>
   He said Hostettler had heard ''rumblings'' that the
administration was pressuring the Pentagon to reward Smith &AMP; Wesson
for entering into the gun safety agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clearly aimed at gutting the Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement,''
Marie Carbone, director of congressional relations for Handgun
Control, said of Hostettler's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Hostettler offered the provision as an amendment to the defense
bill during a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee last
week. It was approved 39-20, with eight Democrats supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., a leading gun-control advocate
whose husband was shot to death, said in a floor speech Thursday
that the Republican leadership had barred her from offering an
amendment to strike the Hostettler provision from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is precedent-setting language that would prevent the
armed services from getting the best equipment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Springfield, Mass., manufacturer on March 17 entered into an
agreement with the government under which it promised to install
safety locks, demand background checks on gun-show buyers and work
on making guns that can be fired only by their owners.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the Clinton administration and some states and
municipalities have agreed to drop Smith &AMP; Wesson from gun
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Municipalities participating in a Housing and Urban Development
Department gun safety program are being encouraged to purchase
Smith &AMP; Wesson weapons for their law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Hostettler has also written a letter signed by 63 House members
urging the chairmen of several Appropriations subcommittees to deny
funds in next year's budget for a commission to be created to
oversee the Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, Hostettler wrote, ''has the power to implement
national gun-control policies that this legislative body has not
agreed to and in some cases rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun lobbyists are also working to see that similar wording
denying special treatment for Smith &AMP; Wesson be attached to other
fiscal 2001 spending bills. ''We want to prevent the government
from using taxpayer money to reward a company kowtowing to the
Clinton gun control agenda,'' said John Velleco of Gun Owners of
America.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee is urging foreign countries
to comply with international rules on abducted children.
</P>
<P>
   The House International Relations Committee, by a voice vote,
adopted a resolution calling on all countries to comply with 1980
rules requiring the return of abducted or wrongfully detained
children.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said the United States has about a 90 percent
compliance rate on such cases while only about 24 percent of
American children are returned. Officials had particular criticism
for Germany, Austria, Sweden, Honduras and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to see some concern and some concrete actions by the
highest levels of our government to redress what is, evidently, a
growing international problem,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.,
who chairs the committee. ''We need to get the attention of the
governments of Germany, Sweden, Austria, Mexico and Honduras that
they cannot expect the Hague Convention to be a one-way street.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was sponsored by Reps. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, and
Nick Lampson, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Trade Backers Win Converts  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of a landmark China trade bill won
a handful of converts in the House today and predicted a new
Chinese-European trade pact would strengthen their hand.
</P>
<P>
   Both supporters and opponents of the measure stepped up their
campaigns in advance of next week's vote.
</P>
<P>
   But backers expressed increasing confidence that they would
obtain the 218 votes needed to pass the legislation extending
permanent normal trade relations to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ''We have an awful lot of work to be done,'' said Rep.
David Dreier, R-Calif., the House Rules Committee chairman. He
predicted an intense weekend of lobbying directed at the dwindling
number of undecideds.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Dreier announced his panel, which sets
procedures for House debate, will take up the legislation Tuesday,
followed by House debate Wednesday. Dreier said he hopes the
debate, despite the intense controversy, will take no more than a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Dreier and other China-trade supporters released details of
accompanying legislation they intend to incorporate in the bill.
One measure would set up a commission to monitor human rights in
China. Another would help protect U.S. companies from surges in
Chinese imports.
</P>
<P>
   The side agreements were designed to make the bill more
palatable to those concerns about China's labor practices and human
rights policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proposal is a hard-fought compromise that should help us
in the House pass permanent trade relations with China,'' said
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, four members -- Democrats John LaFalce of
New York, Thomas Sawyer of Ohio and Diana DeGette of Colorado and
Republican Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas -- said they were switching
from ''undecided'' to supporting the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Closing the door on China will not improve human rights in
China. It would be a step back,'' DeGette said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., told reporters that, while he was still
officially undecided, he was ''leaning to yes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, opponents announced three new converts to the
''no'' column: Reps. Robert Andrews, D-N.J.; Rod R. Blagojevich,
D-Ill.; and Karen McCarthy, D-Mo. Approving the bill ''will
expedite the flow of American capital and jobs in the manufacturing
sector to China,'' Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., who predicts that as
many as two-thirds of House Democrats will oppose the measure, told
reporters, ''As bad as our trade deficit with China is today, it
will grow even worse if we approve a permanent trade deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides have gained this week from the ranks of
previously undecided, proponents have been picking up more.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., the top Democratic head counter on
the legislation, said that with the new support, ''we are well on
our way to reaching the numbers we talked about,'' or 70 to 80
Democrats in support of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also praised the announcement that the European Union
today had reached agreement with China on a market-opening trade
agreement, removing the last obstacle to China's long-sought entry
in the 135-member World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The pact ''is further reason why we need to pass this
agreement,'' said Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said the 15-nation European Union and China ''have made some
positive additions to the landmark agreement we negotiated last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of the World Trade Organization, trade
concessions China gives to any one country to gain entry to the WTO
must be extended to all other WTO members. But to gain those
benefits for American exporters, Congress must grant China
permanent normal trade relations, scrapping the annual review.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Congress fails to grant PNTR, it will be our workers,
businesses and farmers who are left behind while our competitors
take full advantage of the benefits the agreement provides,''
Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides still predicted a close vote, although supporters
were increasingly confident they would prevail. President Clinton
planned a five-minute Oval Office address to promote the measure
Sunday, although not all TV networks planned to carry it live.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the measure in the more free-trade-minded Senate
appears assured. However, a heavy campaign against the bill in the
House by organized labor has seriously undercut Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would extend permanent normal trade relations to China
and ease the way for its entry into the WTO. It would end two
decades of annual congressional votes on China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the trade bill condemn China's human rights abuses
and suggest that increasing trade with China could cost American
jobs by flooding U.S. markets with low-cost goods. Supporters say
it will open China's vast markets to American companies and help
promote American values there.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Election Divides Military  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's bitter election campaign
is reportedly costing President Hugo Chavez support inside the
armed forces, with many officers and soldiers flocking to his main
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent shift casts doubt on Chavez's vision of a
''civic-military'' revolution that would put the armed forces to
work for the poor. It's also stirring speculation of a possible
coup.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez took office in February 1999 and moved quickly to secure
support within Venezuela's 120,000-member armed forces, appointing
army officers to top government posts and dispatching tens of
thousands of soldiers to fix roads and hospitals. But now the
candidacy of Francisco Arias Cardenas, a former army officer who
helped Chavez stage a 1992 coup attempt, is attracting support from
officers and servicemen who oppose the president's perceived
attempts to politicize the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The election -- required by a constitution pushed through by
Chavez last year -- is set for May 28. For the first time in the
South American country's 42-year-old democracy, soldiers will cast
ballots for president, congress, governors, mayors and local
councils. Military personnel say this change, stipulated in the new
constitution, is causing concern among officers who want to keep
the armed forces out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military vote is taking place at the worst possible
time,'' said retired Gen. Fernando Ochoa Antich, who was defense
minister during the 1992 coup attempt. ''The country is so divided,
and this division has entered into the armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa told The Associated Press he has learned of elements
inside the army that are conspiring to overthrow the government.
And a group claiming to consist of military captains has
distributed a statement to Venezuelan journalists threatening a
coup unless Chavez makes ''radical changes'' in his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a group of retired generals called the Institutional
Military Front issued a communique denouncing ''grave
irregularities'' in this month's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probable that certain presidential candidates and vast
sectors of society will not accept the results of the election,''
the statement said. ''In that difficult moment, the armed forces
should tip the balance to maintain public order and preserve the
rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rumblings, many analysts believe a coup is unlikely
unless Chavez loses support among the masses. The president leads
Arias in polls by as much as 20 points even though Venezuela is
mired in a deep economic recession.
</P>
<P>
   After he took office, Chavez faced opposition from critics who
insisted a democracy could not coexist with the militarization of
civilian institutions. Nevertheless, his efforts to win the
military over were largely successful at first.
</P>
<P>
   Army officers, many of whom hailed from working-class families,
appreciated the president's agenda championing the rights of the
poor. They supported his tirades against the corrupt way officers
often were promoted in previous governments. Many generals and
colonels also were pleased to be given the chance to administer
hundreds of millions of dollars in funds earmarked for development
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional candidate Tarek William Saab, a key Chavez ally,
believes the president still enjoys the support of the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''The virtue of our revolution is that it is a civic-military
project in which the unity of the people is well reflected in the
national armed forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it's difficult to gauge the extent of Chavez's
military support since no reliable surveys exist. But the split
between Chavez and the three former commanders who helped him stage
his 1992 putsch -- including candidate Arias -- has uncovered deep
military dissatisfaction with Chavez's leftist agenda and given
officers an alternative outlet for their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's recent cancellation of two joint military training
exercises with the United States and his promotion of military ties
to Cuba ''has reinforced irritation with Chavez'' in the armed
forces, said retired Vice Admiral Mario Ivan Carratu. Carratu and
other retired officers confirmed that a group of current officers
recently sat down with Chavez, a former lieutenant colonel, and
asked him to stop wearing his military uniform at political rallies
-- an admonition the president has honored.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's program using 70,000 soldiers in public works projects
is also reportedly causing discontent among soldiers who believe
they should focus on defense. Arias has promised to ''return
soldiers to their barracks'' if elected.

<HEADLINE> Frost Seeks Funds, Mulls China Vote  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, the third-ranking
Democrat in the House, is pressing the Clinton administration to
pay for modernizing a defense plant in his district as he ponders
how to vote on a controversial China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman, Tom Eisenhauer, said there was ''no quid pro quo
here'' and the request was one of several factors that Frost is
considering as he makes up his mind on the China vote.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhauer declined to provide an estimate for the cost of the
modernization, and said Frost fears the plant, which provides 5,000
jobs, may be closed if the work isn't done.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the issue has been reviewed at strategy sessions on the China bill.
Frost has discussed the issue with President Clinton, and met in
his Capitol Hill office on Tuesday with Rudy de Leon, the
second-ranking official at the Pentagon, they added.
</P>
<P>
   Frost's request concerns a Northrop Grumman Corp. defense plant
in Grand Prairie, Texas that once was a Navy facility.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the jobs at the facility are union, and it is the
largest single employer in Frost's congressional district,
according to Eisenhauer.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plant's work, he said, is on military aircraft,
including the C-17 and B-2, while part of it is production of
civilian aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Serving his 11th term in the House, Frost is chairman of the
Democratic Caucus, the third-ranking post in the party hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   He also is one of a dwindling group of Democrats counted as
uncommitted on the China trade measure, which is scheduled for a
vote in the House next week.
</P>
<P>
   As a former chairman of the House Democratic Campaign Committee,
Frost has ties to organized labor, which opposes the China measure.
As a veteran lawmaker from Texas, he often has voted for trade
bills in the past, including the North American Free Trade
Agreement in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Cannes Films Cover Varied Topics  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France (AP) -- Twenty-three films are competing at Cannes
for the ultimate prize, the Palme d'Or, to be awarded Sunday. But
there are countless others showing in screening rooms large and
small all over this Riviera festival.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many to be glimpsed this week were a loving tribute to
Gregory Peck by a top documentary maker, and Kenneth Branagh's
lighthearted take on Shakespeare's ''Love's Labor's Lost,'' to the
tunes of Gershwin and Cole Porter.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''A Conversation With Gregory Peck''
</P>
<P>
   It's rare, to say the least, for the aggressive pack of
photographers at Cannes to quiet down in respect for a celebrity.
Shouting out the names of stars is, after all, how they do their
job. But there wasn't a sound to be heard but the clicking of
shutters when Gregory Peck had his photo call.
</P>
<P>
   It was proof that despite the hot young stars taking bows here,
a true movie legend like Peck always gets the most respect.
</P>
<P>
   The audience erupted in cheers when the 84-year-old actor
entered a screening of ''A Conversation With Gregory Peck,'' a
documentary by Barbara Kopple.
</P>
<P>
   Kopple won Oscars for both ''Harlan County USA'' and ''American
Dream.'' Then she turned her lens on Woody Allen for ''Wild Man
Blues,'' a close-up portrayal of Allen's European tour with his
jazz band.
</P>
<P>
   Her new film provides a glimpse into Peck's daily life, which he
now fills by traveling the country in a one-man show about his
career.
</P>
<P>
   The film was produced with Peck's daughter, Cecilia, and doesn't
pretend to be critical. But for Peck fans, it's a welcome look at a
star whose old movie clips, liberally displayed here, can still
evoke sighs.
</P>
<P>
   Included are scenes with Audrey Hepburn in 1953's ''Roman
Holiday,'' where she plays a princess on a goodwill tour of Europe,
and he the newspaperman in search of a scoop who falls for her
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Peck recalls how he insisted the newly discovered Hepburn
receive above-the-title billing -- telling producers the film would
make Hepburn a big star and he would look pretty silly with only
his name at the top.
</P>
<P>
   In the documentary, Peck tells the story of how he met his wife,
Veronique, a French reporter assigned to interview him. There's
also an amusing dinner scene with French President Jacques Chirac
in Paris -- testament to the kind of access Kopple had -- in which
the French leader tells Peck that if he'd met Veronique first,
''you wouldn't have had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Peck retorts: ''You're modest, aren't you. I like that
in a president.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Love's Labor's Lost''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Branagh obviously loves Shakespeare, but it might be
less known that he loves singing and dancing, Cole Porter,
Gershwin, and Fred and Ginger. He's decided to put them all
together in a musical version of ''Love's Labor's Lost,'' one of
Shakespeare's lesser-known comedies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love musicals,'' he says. ''They're silly, simple, escapist.
The boy gets the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Branagh's cast list, one might be taken aback by the
thought of Alicia Silverstone reciting the bard's words in the role
of a French princess. But Branagh says he wasn't looking for actors
who sounded Shakespearean.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's genuine, natural and light,'' he says of Silverstone.
''And I defy people to tell me she doesn't know what she's
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Branagh said in an interview, he has all his actors
read their lines in rehearsal, then paraphrase them in their own
words, to make sure they understand.
</P>
<P>
   The film might disappoint purists but should please musical
comedy fans, with numbers like ''I Get a Kick Out of You,'' ''Cheek
to Cheek,'' ''They Can't Take That Away From Me,'' and ''There's No
Business Like Show Business.''
</P>
<P>
   The dancing, particularly, is joyful, and it's done not by
professional dancers but by the actors themselves (the singing,
too). Adrian Lester lets loose his dancing talent, especially in a
routine that has him climbing, Astaire-like, up and over chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Branagh also stars, and Nathan Lane is a very funny vaudevillian
clown.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers may have trouble sorting out the winding plot. But
the energetic musical numbers and the spirit of silliness should go
a long way toward making up for that.

<HEADLINE> Russia Struggles To Fill Military  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- With soldiers dying in rebel ambushes in Chechnya,
Russia's military is having more trouble than ever filling its
ranks, leaving some units seriously undermanned.
</P>
<P>
   Never popular, military service enjoyed a brief surge last fall
when Russian troops moved into Chechnya and scored a string of
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, with the army bogged down in a war against
elusive guerrillas and suffering mounting losses, the enthusiasm
for military service has faded. The military says some 2,300
soldiers have been killed in the war, but critics say the true
figure is at least twice as high.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that trend more visible than in this spring's draft
call-up. Men aged 18 to 27 are eligible for two years compulsory
military service, with the armed forces calling up recruits every
spring and fall.
</P>
<P>
   The number of draft dodgers has doubled since the war began and
there are growing gaps in the military's ranks, said Col. Gen.
Vladislav Putilin, head of the military's mobilization department.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in four years, the army has been unable to
replace all soldiers as they leave the army after finishing their
tours of duty, Putilin said. ''The deficit is about 40 percent of
demand,'' he said, speaking on NTV television.
</P>
<P>
   Even last fall, when the Chechen war boosted enlistment, about a
third of the more than 210,000 men called up got exemptions or
deferments on health grounds, and 20,000 went into hiding,
according to the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the shortage, critics contend the military is
approving physically and mentally unfit teen-agers to fight, and is
targeting high school students so they can't get exemptions by
enrolling in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Tatyana Korovkina said her 17-year-old son Alexei got a draft
card telling him to attend call-up at the end of June, a day after
his 18th birthday. The timing means Alexei won't have time to get
into a college.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to get him now so he doesn't get a chance to apply
to college,'' Korovkina said.
</P>
<P>
   Military doctors increasingly overlook severe health problems in
recruits to meet quotas, according to the Soldiers' Mothers
Committee. Some doctors demand bribes to exempt young men from
service even if they are unfit, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A mother comes to me with documents that showed her son's
kidney wasn't functioning properly and he was unfit to serve,''
said Lyudmila Obratsova, one of the group's founders. ''The doctor
said, 'We won't call him up, but that's going to cost you
$1,400.'''
</P>
<P>
   Life in the cash-strapped military is hellish. Hunger and
squalid living conditions are part of recruits' daily routine along
with frequent bullying and beatings by older soldiers. Soldiers
sometimes beg on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin has tried to boost the military's image
and make service more appealing by reviving Soviet-style military
training in secondary schools. He decreed earlier this year that
students 15 and older receive combat training and take classes in
military history starting in September.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan is not expected to have much impact, with even
military officials saying it's more likely to turn kids off.

<P>
   ''These ideas haven't caught on,'' said Col. Oleg Falichev of
the military's Red Star newspaper. ''With the military so poor off,
all this talk of ways to militarize society don't have any real
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some young men have tried to exercise their right to alternative
service, but efforts to set up such a system have languished in
parliament for years. Lawmakers fear there would never be enough
recruits for the military if they approve an alternative service
system, said Sergei Sorokin, who leads the Movement Against
Violence, a private group championing alternative service.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of enthusiasm was palpable at a recent call-up outside
Moscow, where some draftees said they agreed with obligatory
service but struggled to explain why. Others said they'd had no
choice.

<P>
   Asked if he had tried to dodge the draft, a 19-year-old who
would only give his first name, Vitaly, said, ''There wasn't any
time.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices fell broadly today, with investors still
nervous about the impact that higher interest rates will have on
corporate earnings and stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 159.69 at 10,617.59.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 31.69 at 1,405.52, and the Nasdaq composite
index was off 143.19 at 3,395.52.
</P>
<P>
   As they've done for most of this week, investors refused to buy
into a market facing higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since June
on Tuesday, pushing the federal funds rate -- the interest that
banks charge each other for overnight loans -- to 6.5 percent, the
highest level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed indicated that inflation remains a risk, which raised
expectations among investors that the central bank was not yet
done.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they
cut into corporate profits by increasing the cost of borrowing
money.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of fear out there,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis. ''People are concerned and worried about how high interest
rates will go ... and this market will be volatile until there is
evidence on the table that the Fed will not derail the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be scouring new economic data in the coming weeks
to see if the Fed's actions are slowing the economy. The first
piece comes next Thursday, when the Commerce Department issues its
preliminary report on first-quarter gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a news vacuum right now and there are no earnings
stories to talk about for months, so there is nothing to fuel the
market,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are vulnerable to interest rate
fluctuations, fell today. Merrill Lynch dropped 6} to 102 5/16,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter fell 5 1/16 to 69| and Lehman Brothers
lost 4 1/16 to 81|.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also came under some selling pressure today.
Cisco fell 2] to 53, Intel lost 5\ to 118 11/16 and Apple Computer
dropped 5 1/16 to 95 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were mostly higher today, benefiting from the
escalating cost of crude oil. Crude prices surged above $30 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, and were
hovering slightly below that level in trading today.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron rose 2| to 93{ and Exxon Mobil rose 11/32 to 81 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 575.59 million
shares, up from 540.34 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively higher volume was tied to today's double-witching
expiration of stock and index options. Volume has been lower than
normal for about two weeks as many investors drop out of the market
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 12.59 at 478.36.

<HEADLINE> Allies Go Against U.S. on Iran Loan  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of America's best friends split away to
approve $232 million in World Bank loans to Iran, despite intensive
lobbying by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   She made three arguments against the loans: that Iran sponsors
terrorism, has not adopted sound economic principles and should not
be rewarded while it conducts a ''show trial'' of 13 Jews on
charges of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The allies, including best-friend Britain and Germany, were not
swayed, and joined the majority of the 24-member bank executive
board Thursday in approving the loans.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's new?
</P>
<P>
   The United States has gone it alone, or nearly alone, many
times.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, President Clinton is discovering that the allies are
not eager to embrace the idea that North Korea, Iran and other
so-called rogue states pose a potential long-range missile threat
and that a missile shield may be the solution even if it punches
holes in a 28-year-old arms control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Solana, the chief foreign policy official of the European
Union, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer all have trooped to Washington, listened
to the U.S. spiel and left unconvinced, although they were polite
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer told the German magazine Der Spiegel the other day he
was worried about a growing political gap between Washington and
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urgently recommend all partners to seek strong contacts with
Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A reason for the tension, Fischer said, was the U.S. proposal
for a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Plesch, director of the British American Security
Information Council, a private research group, said Thursday the
Europeans view the proposal as a Cold War strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot find a single supporter, any country'' in favor of a
new missile defense, he said. ''There is a concern that the threat
is grossly exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which does not want to tinker with the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, is taking heart from the Europeans'
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's chances of persuading President Vladimir Putin at
their summit talks June 4-5 to amend the treaty are probably
slimmer because of the allies' reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the administration has not had a happy experience,
overall, in trying to pursue a hard line toward Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   France lined up with Russia and China in the United Nations to
oppose the U.S. drive to give monitors unrestricted access to Iraqi
sites in their search for weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We struggle with some of our best friends to maintain the
sanctions,'' Leon Fuerth, national security adviser to Vice
President Al Gore, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a foreign policy debate, Robert Zoellick, an adviser to Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican presidential
nominee, said one reason for the division was that ''our allies
clearly want to arrange for their own economies'' in the Persian
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
   France and some other Europeans see delicious business
opportunities in Iran. Libya is attracting attention, as well,
despite its listing by the State Department as a sponsor of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attempt to isolate Cuba also attracts few supporters.
Close friend Canada is among the allies looking for business on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States for years often has stood alone, without
European support, in opposing condemnation of Israel in the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO allies did unite behind U.S. leadership in bombing
Yugoslavia to force withdrawal of Serb troops and police from
Kosovo. And the peacekeeping operation in the Serbian province as
well as in Bosnia is a shared arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   But many in Congress question whether the Europeans are carrying
their share of the load. As a consequence, the administration's
budget requests for peacekeeping operations have been pared. And a
feeling that, globally, the United States has carried a
disproportionate financial burden has prompted Congress to stall on
U.S. payments to the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> House OKs School of Americas Change  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are giving a new life to a
controversial Army school that trains Latin Americans in combat
techniques, giving the facility a new name rather than closing its
doors.
</P>
<P>
   On a 214-204 vote during consideration of a defense bill, the
House rejected a measure to shut down the School of the Americas at
Fort Benning, Ga., for at least 10 months while alleged human
rights violations are investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the training facility will stay open. But the Defense
Department instead of the Army will oversee it if the Senate takes
the same route. In addition, a board of academics and members of
Congress would monitor the conduct of the 54-year-old school, which
would be renamed the Defense Institute for Hemispheric Security
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Joe Moakley of Massachusetts, the primary
sponsor of the measure rejected Thursday by the House, said the
reforms ''amount to little more than a new coat of paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley contends some of the school's graduates, which include
former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and El Salvador assassin
Roberto D'Abuisson, developed terrorist techniques during training
at Fort Benning.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the school said it shouldn't be judged by its bad
apples.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Unabomber went to Harvard, and we're not talking about
closing down Harvard because he committed those atrocities,'' said
Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a protest group called SOA Watch has found new
reasons to rally against the facility. Four years ago, the Pentagon
acknowledged that training manuals used at the school recommended
bribery, blackmail, threats and torture against insurgents. The
manuals were destroyed in 1991 after an internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we take joy in this partial victory, we will continue to
move ahead in the struggle to close down this new-named school,''
said Roy Bourgeois, a founder and co-director of the protest group.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois' group almost got its wish last year when the House
narrowly approved a bill to cut off the school's funding. But that
measure lost out in a conference committee with senators, and the
funds stayed intact.
</P>
<P>
   The school graduates about 1,000 students each year -- about
one-tenth of the Latin American soldiers trained in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to improve its image, the School of the Americas
now offers courses in civil rights. Similar courses would be
mandated under the proposed congressional reforms, which have
President Clinton's support.

<HEADLINE> Russia Cites Chechnya Offensive  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian positions in the ruined Chechen
capital, Grozny, came under fire in a spate of hit-and-run rebel
attacks, marking what could be the beginning of a rebel
counteroffensive, military officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen fighters slipped through Russian lines and
apparently hid in the crumbling wasteland of bombed-out houses to
stage Thursday evening's attack. Insurgents fired on Interior
Ministry soldiers in three separate city districts, the military
command said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla fighters also shot at four army guard posts before
being beaten back into hiding places in the city, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Small fire fights are common most nights in Grozny, but
Thursday's shootout was unusually violent. Grozny has been under
Russian control since rebels abandoned it in February. Russia said
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov may have ordered Thursday's
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The high intensity of firing at federal forces deployed in
Grozny suggests that the militants have started implementing Aslan
Maskhadov's order to intensify subversive and terrorist activity,''
the military command's press service said in a statement, quoted by
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not mention casualties on either side, and could
not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The military has been saying for a week that Maskhadov ordered
rebels to step up their guerrilla campaign against Russian forces
starting Friday. But many rebels operate outside Maskhadov's
control, and it wasn't immediately clear who attacked the troops in
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Russia's Federal Security Service said it had
identified a key source of financing for the Chechen fighters. The
intelligence agency has made similar claims in the past, and
attributed the rebels' success to help from many quarters,
including the Baltic countries, Ukraine and Afghanistan. But it has
never provided solid proof.
</P>
<P>
   The security service said Friday that the Islamic charity
Al-Haramain, based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, had been channeling
funds to the Chechen rebels since 1997, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service said the charity -- which has come
under suspicion elsewhere of funding violence -- helped supply
Maskhadov and rebel units with weapons, food, medicine and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Haramain's Web site says it sends food and blankets to
Chechnya and Chechen refugees through its nearby office in the
former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. It says it also sponsors
Islamic studies throughout the Caucasus region. The site says
nothing about providing weapons or cash, and does not advocate
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Haramain was among six Islamic charities banned in Kenya in
1998 on suspicion of involvement in the bomb attack on the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops entered Chechnya in September after
Chechnya-based Islamic militants seized several villages in
Dagestan. Moscow also blamed Chechens for apartment bombings in
Russia last September that killed about 300 people.

<HEADLINE> USDA Puts Land in Reserve Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government on Friday accepted nearly 2.5
million acres of land into the Conservation Reserve Program, which
pays farmers to take environmentally sensitive land out of
production for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Montana had 263,629 acres approved, the largest amount of any
state. Texas was next with 197,297 acres, followed by Washington
with 195,621, North Dakota with 181,688, Iowa with 178,997 and
Kansas with 154,422.
</P>
<P>
   About 31.4 million acres are currently enrolled in the program,
including 420,000 on which CRP contracts are expiring Sept. 30. The
2.46 million acres accepted by the Agriculture Department Friday
will push the program's total enrollment to 33.5 million acres on
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum enrollment for the program under law is 36.4 million
acres.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an investment in protecting our environment that will
last for years,'' said Vice President Al Gore. ''The land enrolled
will result in cleaner water and create vitally needed habitats for
wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   Land put in the program must be planted with trees, grass and
other cover. In exchange, farmers are guaranteed payments for 10 to
15 years. The average annual payment for the acreage accepted in
the new enrollment will be $52.76 per acre, slightly above the
historic average of $50.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers offered 3.5 million acres in the latest sign-up period.
The offers are evaluated according to the cost and environmental
benefits of not farming the land.

<HEADLINE> Flooding Kills 125 in West Timor  </HEADLINE>
By HEATHER PATERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- U.N. and Indonesian officials on Friday
were evacuating islanders from lowlands in Timor, where deadly
floods have ravaged the Indonesian-held western half of the island
and were menacing the east.
</P>
<P>
   At least 125 refugees living in West Timor camps have drowned in
the surging floodwaters, which toppled bridges and swept away key
roads.
</P>
<P>
   All roads leading from the East Timorese capital have been
washed out, leaving residents and aid workers unable to travel
further than 30 miles from Dili by road.
</P>
<P>
   ''These roads are not designed, not built well enough, to handle
the sheer amount of traffic they are being used for,'' said Matt
Everitt of Timor Aid, in Dili.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the communication problems, it was unclear if the
floods had claimed any lives in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it doesn't mean there are no casualties, as areas are
virtually cut off,'' said Bernard Kerblat, chief of operations of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon rains had been drenching the region for weeks, but the
floods began only this week, said Jake Morland, a spokesman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Kupang, the capital of West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 125 refugees who drowned in West Timor were women
and children, he said. About 90,000 East Timorese still live in
western refugee camps -- out of the 250,000 who fled when violence
engulfed their half of the island in September. Many are relatives
of the pro-Indonesian militiamen who rampaged through East Timor
after its voters opted to secede from Indonesia in an Aug. 30
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The lowlands in West Timor have been worst hit by the floods. In
the southern Betun region, 100,000 people have been affected,
Kerblat told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was worsening rapidly, he said. People had no
reliable water supplies and were running out of food. There were
also fears of a possible outbreak of cholera.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.N. helicopters from East Timor had left to evacuate
people to higher ground, Morland said. Nearly 1,500 people from the
southern Belu region were already rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia allowed the U.N. aircraft to operate freely for at
least one week in its airspace, and the world body intended to send
aid to stranded refugees west of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ''A natural disaster transcends any (border) considerations,''
said U.N. administrator Sergio Vieria de Mello. The U.N.
helicopters are to have a member of the Indonesian military and an
interpreter on board at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and swirling floodwaters also were causing damage in the
East Timorese towns of Suai, Los Palos and Viqueque.

<HEADLINE> Supply Clerk Made Parachute Jump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) -- An apparent clerical error sent a supply
clerk with the 82nd Airborne Division out the door of an airplane
on his first parachute jump without any formal training.
</P>
<P>
   Army Spc. Jeff Lewis, who landed unhurt, said he was just doing
what a good soldier is supposed to do -- following orders.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 23, made the jump Feb. 22 at Fort Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Army said I was airborne-qualified,'' Lewis said Thursday.
''I wasn't going to question it. I had a job to do, and I had to
believe in what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. James Marshall, an 82nd spokesman, said officials will try
to make sure it doesn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was promoted from private first class to specialist a few
weeks after his jump. He graduated from Airborne School on May 5
and will make his first ''official'' jump with the 82nd Airborne in
June.
</P>
<P>
   All 15,000 soldiers in the 82nd Airborne must undergo parachute
training at the three-week Airborne School at Fort Benning, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   But when Lewis, a reservist who enlisted for active duty, signed
in at Fort Bragg in December, his records showed he was already
jump-qualified.
</P>
<P>
   So with freshly sewn airborne wings on his chest and an 82nd
patch on his shoulder, Lewis decided to ''go with the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his jump, Lewis attended a one-day refresher class for
airborne-qualified soldiers who have not jumped in at least six
months. But the class is not meant as a crash course in how to
parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis stepped out of the aircraft with the wrong foot, and his
equipment got twisted up. But he remembered what the jumpmasters
had said at the refresher class and kicked his feet, getting the
canopy open.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Lewis got nervous and told his platoon
sergeant what he had done.

<HEADLINE> Madonna's Boyfriend Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTIN GAZLAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Madonna's film director boyfriend was arrested for
pushing an ''alleged fan'' who tried to open the pregnant singer's
car door after harassing the couple for five months, the
boyfriend's spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Ritchie, director of the British hit ''Lock, Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels,'' was questioned for an hour after the incident
Wednesday and then released, said his spokesman, Kris Thykier.
</P>
<P>
   Police would release no details of the case, but said a decision
would be made June 1 whether to press any charges. The name of the
20-year-old man who lodged the complaint was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The altercation took place about 1 a.m. Wednesday outside the
home shared by Ritchie, 31, and Madonna, 41, in the upscale west
London neighborhood of Kensington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The incident involved a certain individual, an alleged fan,
who's been hassling them for five months,'' Thykier said. ''He
sometimes calls himself a fan; he sometimes calls himself a
free-lance photographer. ... He's gatecrashed parties, he hangs
around their house, and he always bangs on the car doors and
windows when they come and go.''
</P>
<P>
   The night of the scuffle, the spokesman said, ''They were on
their way out to dinner, when the guy actually tried to open the
car door on Madonna's side. When they came back later that evening,
the guy blocked them and wouldn't let them park the car. He was
flashing them through the window with his camera and he tried to
open Madonna's door.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guy pushed the guy. I'm not trying to justify what he did, but
he'd had enough. His girlfriend is five months pregnant, after
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Thykier said the man was unhurt, but called both the police and
an ambulance. The ambulance workers left after saying the man
needed no treatment, but police were obliged to investigate,
Thykier said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a man was ordered jailed for 10 years in California
after being convicted of stalking Madonna, making terroristic
threats and assault. He had been shot by a bodyguard after scaling
a wall to enter the grounds of the singer's Hollywood Hills estate.
</P>
<P>
   In October, police at London's Heathrow Airport escorted Madonna
off a British Airways jet after airline staff received a threat to
kill her. The caller had details of her travel arrangements.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper,
slipped out of town by Marine helicopter on Friday to celebrate
their 30th wedding anniversary at the Delaware shore.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the couple -- with a Secret Service detail, a military
aide and press aide in tow -- were borrowing the beach home of
campaign chairman Tony Coelho and would return to Washington on
Sunday.
</P>

   The Democratic presidential candidate recently promised campaign
reporters, apparently without consulting his wife, that they could
accompany him on vacation travels in a small press pool. White
House aides notified reporters of the trip Friday afternoon -- after
the Gores were en route to the coast -- and invited them to the

<HEADLINE> Rebels: UN Can Investigate in Congo  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Congolese rebels on Friday rejected a
human rights report accusing them of raping and killing civilians
and burying women alive, instead blaming such outrages on mobs that
suspected the women of witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a report Tuesday
that the rebels and allied Rwandan army units opposed to Congolese
President Laurent Kabila were punishing civilians for allegedly
supporting their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the rights group said, the rebels and their Rwandan
army allies attacked civilians on Feb. 5 in the village of Kilambo,
tying up the men and raping their wives in front of them, then
killing 30 of them.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, the rebels buried several women alive in
South Kivu province last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Kin-Kiey Mulumba denied the allegations and said
outsiders were free to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're ready to secure the area for an investigation
immediately,'' he said. ''If the responsibility of our soldiers is
established, we will punish them accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulumba said the women who were buried alive were killed by an
angry mob after they were suspected of witchcraft. Such incidents
are not uncommon in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   He said the rebels were not present in the remote village at the
time of the killings and arrived on the scene later.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda has already rejected the report.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Garreton, a Chilean lawyer who is the U.N. human rights
investigator for Congo and who has in the past accused both sides
of killings and torture, did not immediately comment on the rebels'
invitation to investigate the latest allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan Hutu militiamen, who fled Rwanda in fear of reprisals
for the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 people there, are
accused of most of the attacks against civilians, including
imprisonment of Congolese women as sex slaves, the Human Rights
Watch report said.

<HEADLINE> TV judge and her mom, a Connecticut judge, honored by Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state's highest court on Friday
handed down honors to a mother and daughter for their contributions
to the profession of juvenile judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judging Amy'' producer and star Amy Brenneman returned to her
home state and was recognized by the Supreme Court for her
on-screen depiction of the job. Her mother, Frederica Brenneman,
was lauded for her more than 30 years on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judge Brenneman has been a pioneer in the often thankless and
unglamorous work of the juvenile courts, and her daughter has
increased public awareness and recognition of this tough job
through her program,'' said Chief Justice Francis McDonald. ''We
appreciate the efforts of both Judge Brenneman and her daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   As a token of his appreciation, McDonald gave Judge Brenneman a
small pewter box emblazoned with the state seal. ''Juvenile judges
do the most demanding work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald praised Amy Brenneman for creating the popular
prime-time CBS drama based on her mother's career.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is really a tribute to Judge Brenneman,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, McDonald gave the actress a gavel bearing
the state seal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope you will use this on the show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Brenneman, who earned a religion degree from Harvard
University before pursuing an acting career, said she has always
admired her mother's work. And her mother is proud of her
daughter's swift accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ''She became a judge in two months,'' said Frederica Brenneman,
the second woman appointed as a juvenile judge in Connecticut. The
73-year-old Westport resident currently serves as a judge trial
referee.
</P>
<P>
   While Judge Amy Gray's personal life does not parallel that of
Amy Brenneman's mother, the actress said she strives for an
accurate depiction of the job and seeks guidance from her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''They call me a consultant,'' said Frederica Brenneman. ''I'm
unpaid, unhired and basically unneeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she is admittedly disturbed by slight inaccuracies in the
show, the Harvard Law School graduate said the important issues are
carefully and realistically brought to life.
</P>
<P>
   The telvision character is a newly divorced single mom who
leaves behind Manhattan, marriage and corporate law to move back to
Hartford with her 6-year-old daughter. She lives in her childhood
home with her social worker mother, and becomes reacquainted with
her novelist brother.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Brenneman, who expressed fond childhood memories of Bushnell
Park, said she is working to film future episodes in Connecticut.
She said she was ''very moved'' to see waterfront improvements in
the capital city as part of Riverfront Recapture.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always think the more specific a show is, the better it
is,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Cell Transplant Fuels Diabetes Hope  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eight adults with severe diabetes were able to
quit their insulin shots after Canadian scientists tried a new
technique in transplanting insulin-producing pancreas cells.
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to know how long the effect will last, but the
experiment is generating cautious excitement that these long
hoped-for transplants could finally work.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that they have those eight consecutive patients
insulin independent is unprecedented,'' said Dr. David Harlan,
diabetes transplant chief at the National Institutes of Health,
which hopes to help test the new technique. ''This is a very
compelling story.''
</P>
<P>
   Within months, the Canadian scientists plan to begin another
study at eight hospitals, including some in the United States, to
perform at least 32 additional cell transplants, a step toward
proving they can work.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, also called
juvenile diabetes even though people of any age can get it.
Patients' immune systems destroy pancreatic cells that secrete
insulin, a hormone crucial to converting sugar into energy.
</P>
<P>
   Type 1 diabetics need regular insulin shots to survive. Despite
that treatment, many patients ultimately go blind, develop kidney
failure or suffer other life-threatening complications.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics who get kidney transplants sometimes receive pancreas
transplants at the same time, and the new pancreas can reverse
diabetes. But it's a rare and grueling operation, so scientists for
years have hoped instead to inject diabetics with islet cells, the
insulin factories inside the pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, ''the results have been dismal,'' said Dr. James
Shapiro of the University of Alberta. Fewer than 1 in 10
islet-transplanted patients have been insulin-free a year later.
</P>
<P>
   So Shapiro's transplant team in Edmonton, Canada, tried a new
technique. All eight transplant recipients so far have normal blood
sugar without taking any insulin, he reported this week at meetings
of transplant surgeons and the Juvenile Diabetes Association.
</P>
<P>
   Before the transplants, these patients' diabetes raged despite
maximum insulin doses. One woman took 15 insulin shots a day yet
still had uncontrolled blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The first patient transplanted has lasted 14 months without
needing insulin, and half the patients have lasted almost a year.
Shapiro said none shows signs of rejecting the cells or serious
side effects from the transplant -- which merely required an
injection, not surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Eight patients aren't enough to prove this will work, cautioned
the NIH's Harlan. Nor does anyone know long-term effects. The next
experiments will be only for worst-case patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''As excited as I am, and everyone is, about these data, we have
to understand we don't know a lot yet,'' Harlan said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro made a number of changes to standard islet transplants.
The most important:
</P>
<P>
   --He didn't give patients steroids, which transplant recipients
commonly use to keep their immune systems from attacking
transplanted cells or organs.
</P>
<P>
   Islet-cell recipients will need immune suppression for the rest
of their lives. But Shapiro said animal studies suggest steroids
are toxic to islet cells, so instead of a steroid he substituted a
new genetically engineered anti-rejection drug called Zenapax.
</P>
<P>
   --He used islet-cell doses far higher than ever tried. A normal
pancreas has almost 1 million islet cells, yet surgeons have been
unable to cull more than half that number from donated pancreases.
So Shapiro used two pancreases to get enough.
</P>
<P>
   That's a problem, because only a few thousand pancreases are
donated in this country every year. Thus, if the transplants
ultimately work, there would be a shortage.
</P>
<P>
   And Shapiro cautions that questions about the long-term effects
of immunosuppressants means islet transplants for now will be
tested only in adults, not children.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, a network funded by the NIH and Juvenile
Diabetes Foundation will name the eight hospitals that will
participate in the new transplant study.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 167; Nasdaq Down 136  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell broadly today, with investors
still nervous about the impact that higher interest rates will have
on corporate earnings and stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the last hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average
was down 166.88 at 10,610.40.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 30.44 at 1,406.77, and the Nasdaq composite
index was off 136.13 at 3,402.58.
</P>
<P>
   As they've done for most of this week, investors refused to buy
into a market facing higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of fear out there,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis. ''People are concerned and worried about how high interest
rates will go ... and this market will be volatile until there is
evidence on the table that the Fed will not derail the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since June
on Tuesday, pushing the federal funds rate -- the interest that
banks charge each other for overnight loans -- to 6.5 percent, the
highest level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed indicated that inflation remains a risk, which raised
expectations among investors that the central bank was not yet
done.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they
cut into corporate profits by increasing the cost of borrowing
money.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be scouring new economic data in the coming weeks
to see if the Fed's actions are slowing the economy. The first
piece comes next Thursday, when the Commerce Department issues its
preliminary report on first-quarter gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, stocks are unlikely to advance, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a news vacuum right now and there are no earnings
stories to talk about for months, so there is nothing to fuel the
market,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are vulnerable to interest rate
fluctuations, fell today. Merrill Lynch dropped 6} to 102 5/16,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter fell 5 1/16 to 69| and Lehman Brothers
lost 4 1/16 to 81|.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also came under some selling pressure today.
Cisco fell 2] to 53, Intel lost 5\ to 118 11/16 and Apple Computer
dropped 5 1/16 to 95 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were mostly higher today, benefiting from the
escalating cost of crude oil. Crude prices surged above $30 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, and were
hovering slightly below that level in trading today.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron rose 2| to 93{ and Exxon Mobil rose 11/32 to 81 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 678.63 million
shares, up from 639.70 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively higher volume was tied to today's double-witching
expiration of stock and index options. Volume has been lower than
normal for about two weeks as many investors drop out of the market
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 10.94 at 480.01.

<HEADLINE> Census Sampling Debate Resurfaces  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Partisan bickering in Congress resurfaced
Friday over Census 2000 and the use of sampling, a statistical
method that could affect the way Congressional and state
legislative district boundaries are redrawn next year.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing of the House Government Reform Committee's census
panel, Democrats said sampling would help account for those people
who did not, or refused, to return a census form. Republicans
charged that using the statistical method could introduce more
error into the national population count, adding people who do not
exist while deleting real people who filled out a form.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau favors sampling. In the last count in 1990,
Census officials estimated a net undercount of 1.6 percent of the
population. Many of those undercounted were minorities or
inner-city residents who tend to vote Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Redistricting will be based on Census 2000 results and in
general, the GOP opposes sampling, fearing it could redraw
political lines to their disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Census Bureau intends to release both sampled and
non-sampled population figures. A 1999 Supreme Court decision
required reapportionment of Congressional seats to be based on
unadjusted data. States will have the option of using either set of
numbers for redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have said previously that the Census Bureau currently
expects that the corrected numbers using (sampling) will be the
more accurate numbers,'' Census director Kenneth Prewitt told the
subcommittee on Friday. ''If the Census Bureau does not have
confidence in the (sampled) results, we will not release it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sampled data will be based on the Census Bureau's Accuracy
and Coverage Evaluation of 314,000 households. At-home visits for
the evaluation begin in June.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the Secretary of Commerce in the next president's
administration has the option of telling the Census Bureau not to
release the sampled results. Commerce oversees the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, Vice
President Al Gore, supports sampling; his GOP counterpart, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, has said he favors an ''actual count.''
</P>
<P>
   As in 1990, more lawsuits are expected over the issue once
census results roll out, which could further test the
constitutionality of using sampled numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee chairman Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., said his
opposition goes beyond the political consequences. It was not until
two years after the 1990 census that a review of sampling
procedures revealed there were errors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once states draw their district lines, you can't come back a
year later and say 'Sorry. We made a mistake,''' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned whether the Census Bureau would have enough
time to accurately produce the sampled data. Unadjusted population
figures, are due to President Clinton by Dec. 31. Sampled numbers
are due to be released in groups of roughly 10 states per week
beginning in March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that the 2000 census may well be the best, fairest
and most accurate census ever,'' countered Rep. Carolyn Maloney of
New York, the subcommittee's ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who oppose the use of modern scientific methods in the
census would ensure the millions of people missed in the census are
left out permanently, and the millions of people counted twice are
forever kept in,'' she added. ''That is fundamentally unfair and
must stop.''
</P>
<P>
   On a related note, Prewitt said half of the 42 million
households which did not return a census form had now been
contacted in the current phase of the census. Census-takers will
try to reach the other half by early July.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Children Rally for Elian  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Paying homage to independence hero Jose Marti on
the 105th anniversary of his death, thousands of Cuban children
rallied outside the U.S. mission to Cuba on Friday and called for
the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Return our elfin prince to his fatherland!'' student Ernesto
Fidel del Canal shouted from a stage to the crowd of about 7,000
other children and teen-agers gathered behind a new bronze statue
of Marti. The statue, which stands more than 9 feet tall, depicts
Marti holding a baby in his arms and pointing an accusatory finger
at the nearby U.S. Interests Section -- an apparent reference to the
Elian case. It was put in place on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing their school uniforms and the red or blue neckerchiefs
of the Communist Pioneers youth group, the boys and girls cheered
wildly when President Fidel Castro arrived in his traditional olive
green uniform and cap. Castro held a small Cuban flag. He was
accompanied by top leaders, including Foreign Minister Felipe Perez
Roque and Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''How exciting,'' Oswaldo Ramos, 12, said when Castro walked
nearby. ''I hope he comes over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Marti, revered both here and among Cuban-Americans, died
fighting for Cuba's independence from Spain in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   The calls for Elian's return to Cuba are part of a national
campaign launched shortly after the boy was rescued off the coast
of Florida in late November. His mother and 10 others perished
during the sea journey from Cuba to the United States. The Cuban
government and the boy's father say Elian should be returned to
Cuba, while many Cuban exiles in Miami say he should not be sent
back to live under communism.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few months of his U.S. stay, Elian lived with his
relatives in Miami. He was returned to his father last month during
an armed raid by the federal government. The two are now staying on
a farm in Maryland as they await an appeals court decision on
whether they can return to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Safety Agency Expands GM Probe  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency has expanded its
investigation of some General Motors Corp. cars with reported
steering problems.
</P>
<P>
   GM recalled several models three years ago because the bolts
that hold the engine cradle in place were corroding, which could
separate the steering system. It limited the recall to 14 states
with weather conditions that would cause corrosion, but complaints
have continued to come in from other states.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday
that further investigation is needed to determine if the recall was
adequate. The agency said that there have been 200 complaints about
the problem, including reports of 32 crashes and 11 injuries.
</P>
<P>
   GM spokesman Greg Martin said the automaker is cooperating with
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is certainly a routine follow-up on the part of NHTSA,''
Martin said. ''We are confident that we have a well-defined vehicle
population as included in the initial recall.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will examine 1989 to 1991 model years of the
Chevrolet Lumina, Lumina APV and Monte Carlo, the Buick Regal, the
Oldsmobile Cutlass and Silhouette, the Pontiac Grand Prix and Trans
Sport. There are about 677,000 of the cars on the road.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA also announced Friday that it has upgraded its
investigation of nearly 1.3 million Ford Explorers from model years
1991 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 106 complaints that the spare tire has dropped
from under the vehicle onto the road because the cable failed to
hold it in place. NHTSA said one accident has been reported and in
six other cases, the wheel dropped off and damaged vehicles
following the Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA opens any safety investigation with a preliminary inquiry
in which the government and manufacturer exchange paperwork,
including any complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation then can be upgraded to an engineering
analysis, as in the case of the Explorer and GM cars, during which
engineers study parts to see if they are defective. An
investigation eventually can lead to a recall.
</P>
<P>
   Recalls included in the monthly report issued Friday were:
</P>
<P>
   --1999-2000 Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer; wipers can
fail and affect visibility, increasing the risk of a crash. There
are 208,903 of the vehicles on the road. The company has notified
vehicle owners and dealers will fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   --1997-2000 Chevrolet Corvettes; the seat belt can get jammed.
There are 71,569 of the cars on the road. Affected owners have been
notified and dealers will make repairs.
</P>
<P>
   --1996-1997 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana; fuel may leak and
could start a fire. There are 109,239 of the vans on the road. GM
has not yet decided on a remedy, NHTSA said.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA also announced that it has opened the following
investigations:
</P>
<P>
   --1995-1996 GM C/K Trucks, Sierra, Suburban, Yukon and Tahoe; 10
complaints of wires breaking in the headlight high-low control
circuit, which can make the headlights fail. There are about 1.7
million of the vehicles on the road.
</P>
<P>
   --1996-2000 Audi A4; 32 reports of malfunctioning brakes in wet
conditions, including one crash. There are an estimated 105,000 of
the vehicles on the road.
</P>
<P>
   --2000 Jeep Wrangler; one complaint that the drivers side air bag
is not properly attached to the steering wheel, which could mean it
won't deploy in a crash. It is unknown how many of the vehicles are
on the road.

<HEADLINE> Bush Adviser Proposes Iraq Policy  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior adviser to George W. Bush proposed
seizing control of parts of Iraq as a way of undermining President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing the Clinton administration's policy on Iraq as ''a
debacle,'' Robert Zoellick, a former State Department official,
said Friday that U.S. efforts against Saddam should include
''slowly taking away pieces of his territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam lost control of northern Iraq in the aftermath of the
Persian Gulf War in which the United States and its allies reversed
his annexation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser to Bush, the Republican presidential candidate,
suggested southern Iraq was a good target for the United States.
But he also said the Clinton administration had lost the confidence
of Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries by not taking tough
stands. ''You have to reverse the momentum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing Saddam was a menace, Leon Fuerth, national
security adviser to Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
presidential candidate, said, ''There is no country that wants to
undertake that policy'' of seizing territory from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate sponsored by The Washington Institute for Near East
Policy, a private research group, Fuerth said Saddam eventually
would bring about his own downfall, making a mistake that would
give the United States a ''legitimate right'' to depose him.
</P>
<P>
   Fuerth faulted former President Bush, the Republican aspirant's
father, for Saddam's survival after the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-led coalition ''had a sword against his neck but would
not use it,'' Fuerth said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Clinton administration had found scant support for
taking tough actions against Saddam, even for imposing economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've struggled with some of our best friends to maintain the
sanctions,'' Fuerth said.
</P>
<P>
   On another topic, Zoellick said President Clinton made a mistake
in letting himself by rebuffed by Syrian President Hafez Assad at
their meeting in March in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright should have set up a more
productive summit meeting, Zoellick said. But, he said, Albright
has been ''discounted in terms of power and influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuerth, challenging this account, suggested Clinton had expected
to make progress with Assad on the stalled Israel-Syria
negotiations but the Syrian leader turned out to be ''fickle.''

<HEADLINE> Student Uses Cadaver To ID Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By A.J. DICKERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Years ago, Rachael Rivers noticed a mole on her
back. A doctor told her not to worry about, so she didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in anatomy class, the 27-year-old student studied the body
of a woman who had died of melanoma. That woman had a skin lesion
that looked a lot like hers, in nearly the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   She saw a dermatologist, and it saved her life.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the Macomb Community College nursing student was
diagnosed with malignant melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer
that strikes more than 40,000 Americans annually, killing 7,300 of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers had surgery to remove the lesion from the small of her
back but was spared chemotherapy or radiation therapy. She'll have
follow-up checks to make sure the cancer is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fortunately, I got it taken care of,'' she said Thursday. ''I
was lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old woman whose body was studied by Rivers' class
had died of metastatic melanoma, said William Burkel, who directs
the University of Michigan's anatomical donation program, which
provided the body.
</P>
<P>
   Burkel was unaware of another situation where a student turned
out to have the same disease as a class cadaver.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know it does happen with medical students that they
suddenly get every disease they're studying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer; about 1 million
Americans are expected to be diagnosed a year. Caught early, most
skin cancer is curable.
</P>
<P>
   Melanomas often start as small, mole-like growths that increase
in size, change color, become ulcerated and bleed easily from
slight injury. Malignant melanoma can spread to other parts of the
body quickly, but when caught early is highly curable.

<HEADLINE> URGENT  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, his political ambitions
derailed by prostate cancer and a nasty split with his wife, today
abandoned his Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to think the core of me was in politics. It isn't,''
Giuliani told a City Hall news conference, folding his campaign
before ever officially announcing its start. The stunning decision
ended three weeks of intense speculation over his viability as a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've decided that what I should do is to put my health
first,'' he said. ''... This is not the right time for me to run
for office.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank God that it gives me really another 18 months to be
the mayor of New York City,'' he said. In those 18 months, an
unusually reflective Giuliani said, he hoped to heal any divisions
created during his six years in City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about whether the 55-year-old mayor would quit the
Senate race almost instantly followed his April 27 cancer
disclosure. Giuliani had said that his candidacy would be
contingent on his choice of treatment options -- a decision that he
still has not made.
</P>
<P>
   But that candidacy took another hit last week with his
announcement that he was discussing a legal separation from his
wife of 16 years, Donna Hanover. Hanover retorted with her own
bombshell, publicly suggesting he had an affair with a former
staffer. At the same time, the mayor was flaunting a relationship
with a third woman, Judith Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's announcement to a packed City Hall news conference
made no mention of either his wife or Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said his decision followed a sleepless night, but
expressed hope that his pulling out was ''all for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that I'd be able to campaign the way I should,''
said Giuliani, citing his upcoming cancer treatment. ''I don't know
that in August or September that I'd be able to continue the way I
should.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he broke the news to Republican leaders by phone,
and pledged his support to likely GOP nominee Rick Lazio, a Long
Island congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, long a political animal, told reporters that he had a
revelation that spurred his announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I woke up this morning and said, 'There are more important
things in life,''' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, campaigning in Brooklyn, offered no comment when made
aware of reports that the mayor was backing out. ''I have no
control or say over what happens on the other side,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The married mayor, shortly after the cancer announcement, went
public with confirmation that he was seeing his ''very, very good
friend'' Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP mayor said later that he and Hanover were discussing a
formal separation, although he apparently went public with the news
before telling his wife. Hanover's spokeswoman said today that she
had hired a matrimonial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But while the double-barreled revelations about Giuliani's
health and his marriage made for huge headlines, polls taken after
the mayor's announcements showed he was still running about even
with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders must now scramble to find a replacement
candidate in the 10 days before their May 30 convention in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP leaders, including Gov. George Pataki, had passed the
word that their favored replacement candidate to challenge the
first lady was U.S. Rep. Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said for several days that he would make no statement
about his intentions until Giuliani had made his decision. The
congressman, who has about $3.5 million in his campaign bank
account, had been preparing to run for the Senate until August when
Pataki endorsed the mayor's bid and asked Lazio to suspend his
effort. Lazio did so.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King has said he is interested, but he alienated
party leadership with his support of Sen. John McCain in the
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Giuliani told an hour-long town hall meeting
broadcast nationally that he regretted some of his most
controversial actions of the past year. He specifically
acknowledged a mistake in his handling of the slaying of Patrick
Dorismond, an unarmed black man killed in a recent scuffle with
undercover police.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should have also conveyed the human feeling that I had, the
compassion, the loss of the mother,'' Giuliani said. ''I think if I
could do it over again, I would have tried to balance it more.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Mitchell whether he has become more compassionate
because of his illness, Giuliani said ''something has to happen to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   In making a decision on treatment, Giuliani said he had
anticipated a different process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of approached it as if this was a big case, or a budget
decision,'' the former prosecutor said. But this decision he said,
''involves thinking about your life, mortality, the quality of your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's three options for treatment are surgery, external
beam radiation and radioactive seed implantation. The 15-year
survival rate is 95 percent for surgery and 60 to 70 percent for
the two less invasive options.

<HEADLINE> Blair Joins Wife at Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair joined his pregnant
wife, Cherie, at a London hospital Friday, prompting speculation
that she was about to give birth.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair, 45, who is expecting their fourth child, was
admitted to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in the afternoon. In
the evening, she was joined by the prime minister who raced past
crowds of waiting reporters and television crews in a
chauffeur-driven car.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair's due date is May 24. She was admitted to the same
hospital for tests on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Blairs have not said whether the child is a boy or a girl,
nor have they dropped any hints about names -- though Mrs. Blair has
said she would like to have a girl, which would balance the family
at two boys and two girls.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Blair's Downing Street office refused to
comment.

<HEADLINE> Cash Hard To Find in Paris  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Bewildered tourists and fed up French people
scoured Paris for ATM machines with cash on Friday, and the French
train and subway systems began accepting checks and credit cards
for fares as little as 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   On the 11th day of a strike by armored truck guards, the search
for cash required wits and wile.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are giving me checks for their morning newspaper. We
can't refuse, we'll lose the sale,'' said Jean-Louis Grimal, a
newsstand owner who said business was down 20 percent since the
strike began, causing people to think twice before sparing small
change.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by a string of holdups that have left 11 security guards
dead in the past five years, the armored truck guards are demanding
hazardous-duty pay of $208 a month and other benefits for what they
insist is a high-risk job.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for the guards and their employers were to
return to the negotiating table Saturday with an arbitrator
appointed by the government. Negotiations broke off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In cities around France, armored truck guards held protests
Friday. ''Striking for a Salary of Fear'' read a banner unfurled by
several hundred guards protesting in Paris. In suburban Nanterre,
guards held a silent march in memory of a colleague who died last
week after an armed attack.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, people around the capital, faced with empty automatic
teller machines, were scrambling for money ahead of the weekend,
when most banks are closed.
</P>
<P>
   Many merchants were demanding exact change as their own supplies
of bank notes ran low, and most lowered their limits for payment by
check and credit card.
</P>
<P>
   A manager at the Monoprix supermarket chain said the majority of
customers were abandoning cash for credit, making it likely that
the chain's payment to credit card companies would set a record
this month, since stores pay a surcharge for each purchase put on
credit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to cost us a lot more money this month,'' said the
manager, Marilyn Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on and ATM machines across the city turned up
empty, some people were panicking.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight-year-old Alice Barrey rushed into a supermarket
near her jewelry shop on the Champs Elysees after a fruitless
search for an automatic teller machine with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please tell me you take credit cards,'' she said. ''I have
people coming to dinner tonight and have no money in my wallet.''
She needed onions and butter.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Air Force Maj. Karen Groth, on a three-day holiday from her
base in Ramstein, Germany, said she would have changed money before
departing, even at a lower exchange rate, had she known about the
problems with automatic teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We waited to change money, because you get a better rate at
the ATM -- well, usually,'' Groth said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 148; Dow Off 150  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell broadly today as investors
resolutely refused to buy into a market facing rising interest
rates. Technology stocks, among the market's most highly valued
issues, led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 150.43 to 10,626.85.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite
index fell 148.10 to 3,390.61.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 30.26 to 1,406.95.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,960 down, 934 up and 483 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 850.53 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.
804.14 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 10.51 to
480.44.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates,
investors continued moving away from the stocks seen as most
vulnerable in the current market environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of fear out there,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis. ''People are concerned and worried about how high interest
rates will go ... and this market will be volatile until there is
evidence on the table that the Fed will not derail the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since June
on Tuesday, and indicated that inflation remains a risk. The Fed's
warning raised expectations among investors that more increases are
on tap later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they
cut into corporate profits by increasing the cost of borrowing
money.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are vulnerable to interest rate
fluctuations, fell today. Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
and Lehman Brothers were all lower.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also came under some selling pressure. Cisco
and Apple Computer dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell. Earlier this week, the company lowered its
previously reported first-quarter earnings by a penny and its
revenue by $28 million. Intel disclosed the revision in documents
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' eagerness to punish Intel betrayed their nervousness
about owning expensive stocks while escalating interest rates could
compromise corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Valuations in the technology sector got so stretched at the
start of this year,'' said Jim Weiss, deputy chief investment
officer for equities at State Street Research and Management Co. in
Boston. ''The rotation away from technology will continue as people
are looking for more diversification and some more defensive
elements.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were mostly higher today, benefiting from the
escalating cost of crude oil. Crude prices surged above $30 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, and were
hovering slightly below that level in trading today.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron and Exxon Mobil rose.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be scouring new economic data in the coming weeks
to see if the Fed's actions are slowing the economy. The first
piece comes next Thursday, when the Commerce Department issues its
preliminary report on first-quarter gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, stocks are unlikely to advance, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a news vacuum right now and there are no earnings
stories to talk about for months, so there is nothing to fuel the
market,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Volume topped Thursday's quiet pace due to today's
double-witching expiration of stock and index options. Volume has
been lower than normal for about two weeks as many investors
dropped out of the market to debate the Fed's future course of
action.

<HEADLINE> 'Judging Amy' Gets Positive Verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- ''Judging Amy'' star Amy Brenneman got a
positive judgment from her home state's Supreme Court Friday for
her TV depiction of a juvenile court judge -- a role inspired by her
mother, Frederica Brenneman, who served 30 years-plus on the
nonfictional bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judge Brenneman has been a pioneer in the often thankless and
unglamorous work of the juvenile courts, and her daughter has
increased public awareness and recognition of this tough job
through her program,'' Chief Justice Francis McDonald said. ''We
appreciate the efforts of both Judge Brenneman and her daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald praised Amy Brenneman for creating the popular
prime-time CBS drama based on her mother's career.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is really a tribute to Judge Brenneman,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald gave Judge Brenneman a small pewter box emblazoned with
the state seal and gave the actress a gavel bearing the state seal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope you will use this on the show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Brenneman, who earned a religion degree from Harvard
University before pursuing an acting career, said she has always
admired her mother's work, adding, ''I always think the more
specific a show is, the better it is.''

<HEADLINE> Spike Lee Backs Alabama Indictments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The indictments of two suspects in the
1963 bombing of Birmingham's Sixteenth Street Baptist Church is a
good start, said filmmaker Spike Lee, whose 1997 documentary about
the bombing, ''4 Little Girls,'' was nominated for an Academy
Award.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee said prosecutors should strive to convict every
perpetrator of all race crimes that rocked the city during the
1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is still a list of heinous crimes that haven't been
dealt with,'' Lee said. ''At one time, it was called 'Bombingham.'
</P>
<P>
   Lee said that suspects in race crimes should be pursued the same
way Nazi war criminals are, adding, ''They don't care if those guys
are on their last breaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime suspects Bobby Frank Cherry and Thomas E. Blanton Jr.
surrendered to authorities in Birmingham this week after a grand
jury indicted them each on eight counts of murder.

<HEADLINE> Civilians Flee Advancing Ethiopians  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZRON, Eritrea (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Eritrean civilians
fled advancing Ethiopian troops and the government struggled to set
up camps to house and feed them Friday, a week after Ethiopia
launched an all-out offensive to end a two-year border war with its
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. and Eritrean aid officials said Eritrea, a country of 4
million people in the Horn of Africa, was hovering on the edge of a
humanitarian tragedy: The more than half million people escaping
fighting in western Eritrea added to a drought crisis that already
threatened 300,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted evacuees, mostly women and children, tumbled out of
trucks Friday to stake out a patch of soil away from the rapidly
advancing front, which lay about 60 miles to the east. One evacuee,
14-year-old Abdullah Ali, sat surrounded by 3,000 other uprooted
Eritreans in a camp that has gone up overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know where my parents are,'' the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning Ethiopian offensive caught Eritreans by surprise,
splitting families as they fled. Ali rushed home when Ethiopian
warplanes roared over Akordat last weekend, but found no one there.
He fled the town 35 miles north of Barentu, then boarded a bus
evacuating panicked Eritreans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were playing soccer when the Ethiopian planes started
bombing. I left without my parents,'' said Metker Gebrhiwe, 15.
</P>
<P>
   Ali and Metker are just two of the 550,000 Eritreans the
state-run relief agency says have been forced from their homes by
the onslaught of Ethiopian troops, artillery and warplanes that
began May 12. The latest round of fighting over the 620-mile border
began when Ethiopia retook a piece of disputed territory Eritrea
had seized in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the government denied any
intention of taking over recognized Eritrean territory. ''Ethiopia
had no designs on sovereign Eritrean territory in 1993, and it does
not have such designs now,'' an official statement said, referring
to the year of Eritrea's independence from Ethiopia after a 30-year
guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Friday, 15 trucks and buses brimming with fleeing
Eritreans had already arrived at this 2-day-old camp stretched
across a desolate, rocky swath of land 10 miles north of Keren.
Naizei Woldenu, a regional aid official, said the camp would reach
its 30,000 capacity within days.
</P>
<P>
   With Ethiopian forces already in control of Barentu and Akordat,
Keren -- 50 miles north of the capital, Asmara -- displayed all the
trappings of a front-line city. Eritrean troops in camouflage
streamed through the streets. The manager of the main hotel was
said to have locked the doors and left. Account holders crushed at
bank doors to withdraw their money to stock up on food, or to
prepare to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The enemy could attack at any time,'' Ibrahim Osman said as he
fought to hold his ground among the crowd gathered in front of the
local branch of the Commercial Bank of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Goiton Berke arrived in Keren three weeks ago from Phoenix,
Ariz., to visit his hometown. He ended up consoling his mother and
sisters after his brother, an Eritrean soldier, was killed this
week by an Ethiopian artillery round.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are scared to death. We don't know anything,'' Berke said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Ethiopian state television said Ethiopian aircraft
had bombed a military training center in western Eritrea near the
Sudanese border as Ethiopian troops consolidated their control over
Barentu. Barentu had been an important command and control center
for the Eritrean army.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the Eritrean government on
the latest bombing report. On Thursday, the Ethiopians said they
hit targets near Eritrea's Red Sea port of Massawa.
</P>
<P>
   In Keren on Friday, scores of dust-covered trucks spilling over
with sandal-shod soldiers trundled through town, away from the
front and toward Asmara. The troop trucks were interspersed with
flatbed trucks carrying missile launchers, tanks, heavy artillery
and mobile radar units. They were headed south toward a second
front.
</P>
<P>
   In the barren settlement camp in Zron, meanwhile, the new
arrivals started to slowly piece together a routine, hoping their
stay wouldn't be long. The able-bodied lined up to help unload
trucks of wheat from the United States, dates from Saudi Arabia and
milk powder from the Netherlands, while others washed clothes and
stretched them over bushes to dry under the glaring sun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know when, but I'll go home,'' 14-year-old Abdella
Adris said as he joined the queue.

<HEADLINE> Mayor abandons Senate campaign  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, his political ambitions
derailed by prostate cancer and a nasty split with his wife, today
abandoned his Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to think the core of me was in politics. It isn't,''
Giuliani told a City Hall news conference, folding his campaign
before ever officially announcing its start. The stunning decision
ended three weeks of intense speculation over his viability as a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've decided that what I should do is to put my health
first,'' he said. ''... This is not the right time for me to run
for office.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank God that it gives me really another 18 months to be
the mayor of New York City,'' he said. In those 18 months, an
unusually reflective Giuliani said, he hoped to heal any divisions
created during his six years in City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about whether the 55-year-old mayor would quit the
Senate race almost instantly followed his April 27 cancer
disclosure. Giuliani had said that his candidacy would be
contingent on his choice of treatment options -- a decision that he
still has not made.
</P>
<P>
   But that candidacy took another hit last week with his
announcement that he was discussing a legal separation from his
wife of 16 years, Donna Hanover. Hanover retorted with her own
bombshell, publicly suggesting he had an affair with a former
staffer. At the same time, the mayor was flaunting a relationship
with a third woman, Judith Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's announcement to a packed City Hall news conference
made no mention of either his wife or Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said his decision followed a sleepless night, but
expressed hope that his pulling out was ''all for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that I'd be able to campaign the way I should,''
said Giuliani, citing his upcoming cancer treatment. ''I don't know
that in August or September that I'd be able to continue the way I
should.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he broke the news to Republican leaders by phone,
and pledged his support to likely GOP nominee Rick Lazio, a Long
Island congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, long a political animal, told reporters that he had a
revelation that spurred his announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I woke up this morning and said, 'There are more important
things in life,''' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking after Giuliani's announcement, said she had
wished the mayor a speedy recovery in a phone conversation. She
said little about the effect of his withdrawal on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This campaign is not about me or any opponent,'' Clinton said
at a brief news conference. ''I am not going to talk about politics
or ... the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The married mayor, shortly after the cancer announcement, went
public with confirmation that he was seeing his ''very, very good
friend'' Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP mayor said later that he and Hanover were discussing a
formal separation, although he apparently went public with the news
before telling his wife. Hanover's spokeswoman said today that she
had hired a matrimonial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But while the double-barreled revelations about Giuliani's
health and his marriage made for huge headlines, polls taken after
the mayor's announcements showed he was still running about even
with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders must now scramble to find a replacement
candidate in the 10 days before their May 30 convention in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP leaders, including Gov. George Pataki, had passed the
word that their favored replacement candidate to challenge the
first lady was U.S. Rep. Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said for several days that he would make no statement
about his intentions until Giuliani had made his decision. The
congressman, who has about $3.5 million in his campaign bank
account, had been preparing to run for the Senate until August when
Pataki endorsed the mayor's bid and asked Lazio to suspend his
effort. Lazio did so.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King has said he is interested, but he alienated
party leadership with his support of Sen. John McCain in the
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Giuliani told an hour-long town hall meeting
broadcast nationally that he regretted some of his most
controversial actions of the past year. He specifically
acknowledged a mistake in his handling of the slaying of Patrick
Dorismond, an unarmed black man killed in a recent scuffle with
undercover police.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should have also conveyed the human feeling that I had, the
compassion, the loss of the mother,'' Giuliani said. ''I think if I
could do it over again, I would have tried to balance it more.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Mitchell whether he has become more compassionate
because of his illness, Giuliani said ''something has to happen to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   In making a decision on treatment, Giuliani said he had
anticipated a different process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of approached it as if this was a big case, or a budget
decision,'' the former prosecutor said. But this decision he said,
''involves thinking about your life, mortality, the quality of your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's three options for treatment are surgery, external
beam radiation and radioactive seed implantation. The 15-year
survival rate is 95 percent for surgery and 60 to 70 percent for
the two less invasive options.

<HEADLINE> Carvey Sues Doctor for Artery Error  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It was no laughing matter when comedian
Dana Carvey came out of open-heart surgery and found out a doctor
had operated on the wrong artery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember just lying in my bed just sobbing,'' Carvey said
Thursday in San Francisco Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Carvey, 44, was testifying in his $7.5 million lawsuit against
the San Francisco surgeon who made the mistake during double bypass
surgery in 1998 to clear a blocked artery. Carvey has since
recovered after getting the blockage removed by angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   He sued surgeon Elias Hanna last year to recover damages for the
six months he spent recovering, saying he turned down offers to do
commercials, a television series and a spot on ''Hollywood
Squares.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna's defense lawyer contended Carvey has an ''unusual
anatomy'' and that his blood vessels were in atypical positions.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, his political ambitions
derailed by prostate cancer and a nasty split with his wife, today
abandoned his Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.

<P>

<HEADLINE> Democrats Drop Fuel Efficiency Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats dropped plans Friday to
challenge a Republican-written ban on raising auto fuel efficiency
standards, worried that a vote would have torn vulnerable
incumbents between their traditional labor and environmentalist
backers.
</P>
<P>
   The election-year decision angered environmental groups, who
have been vainly trying to repeal the prohibition ever since
Republicans pushed it into law in 1995, when they took control of
Congress. It has been re-enacted annually ever since as part of a
routine transportation spending bill that President Clinton has
never vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're extremely disappointed in the Republican leadership for
putting this rider in the bill again, and in the Democratic
leadership for apparently discouraging their members from trying to
strip it,'' said Gene Karpinski, executive director of the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Becker, director of the Sierra Club's global warming
project, said the club is ''outraged'' that Republicans were
backing the restrictions again, and ''profoundly disappointed that
the Democratic leadership didn't fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Olver, D-Mass., had prepared an amendment to this
year's transportation measure that would have stripped language
forbidding the government from even studying changes in the
standards.
</P>
<P>
   But the House approved the overall bill by 395-13 Friday, with
Olver never offering his amendment. Olver said he decided to hold
his fire after talking with ''a lot of different people,''
including House Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The environmental, labor communities are usually very strongly
pro-Democratic,'' he said in an interview. ''To end up dividing
them at this point, I think that's not a good political move.''
</P>
<P>
   Olver and others said that in particular, Democrats from
Michigan and other midwestern, automobile industry states would
have been forced into an uncomfortable position had a vote
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came as the House prepared to vote next week on
granting permanent normal trade relations to China, which is also
causing deep splits among Democrats. Party leaders believe that one
such wrenching issue this election year is enough, said aides
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A vote may have also put pressure on Vice President Al Gore, the
likely Democratic presidential candidate. Defeat of the effort
seemed certain, but it may have attracted enough votes for the
House to sustain a presidential veto -- more than one third of the
voting members. In that case, Gore may have come under conflicting
pressures over whether to urge Clinton to sign or veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Congress set the corporate average fuel economy, or
CAFE, standard at 27.5 miles per gallon on new passenger cars and
20.7 mpg for light trucks. But with growing concerns about air
pollution and the growing popularity of sports utility vehicles,
which get low gasoline mileage, some lawmakers have begun pushing
for higher requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, in the only vote so far challenging the GOP
restrictions, the Senate voted 55-40 against reconsidering them.
The Senate has yet to write its version of this year's bill.
</P>
<P>
   A letter to Clinton asking him to ''work with Congress'' to
improve fuel efficiency requirements had the signatures of 107
House members on Friday, including 12 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Among those lobbying to retain the current restrictions were the
National Association of Manufacturers and the Ford Motor Co., which
used its internal website to urge employees to write lawmakers to
keep existing standards.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter to congressional leaders, White House budget
chief Jack Lew said the administration ''strongly opposes'' the ban
on higher requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter did not threaten a veto of the $55 billion bill,
which contains money for airport, road and mass transit projects in
every state and is hugely popular among lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that discussions involving Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., Olver and others had occurred over the last two
days. They said that among those urging that the vote not occur was
Rep. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., who is challenging Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich., for his seat this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Stabenow said in an interview that she opposed having the vote,
but said she has already said publicly that the ban should remain
in place for another year.
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ''It's always difficult in Michigan because the
auto industry is so important, yet you also have a very strong
environmental presence.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4475.

<HEADLINE> Anglicans, Catholics Discuss Union  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops concluded a
week of prayer and dialogue Friday by announcing plans for a joint
commission to further explore the possibility of unification.
</P>
<P>
   The closed-door meeting was chaired by Anglicanism's spiritual
leader, Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, and Cardinal Edward
Cassidy, president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for
Promoting Christian Unity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt it was the logical outcome of this meeting,'' Cassidy
said of the commission. ''By the end of the year we hope to be set
up and running.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neither leader offered any specifics on how the
millions of Anglicans and Roman Catholics around the world would be
affected by the commission's decisions, Carey said the changes
could be felt at local congregations in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jane Doe and John Doe want to know what the cash value is of
all this,'' Carey said. ''It is to stimulate the quest, to raise
the expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said unification is unlikely to take place in his
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Among the obstacles to unification will be dealing with the
place of women -- who are not eligible for ordination as Catholic
priests -- and determining how power would be distributed in a
unified religion, bishops from both faiths said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have challenges, serious challenges that we have to face,''
Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
   This week's series of seminars and one-on-one discussions among
the bishops took place in a Catholic retreat in a posh neighborhood
near Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   A public service at St. Michael's Cathedral in downtown Toronto
on Wednesday evening drew more than 1,000 people to hear the church
leaders address issues that have been at the heart of the
400-year-old split between Anglicans and Catholics.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone OKs Jesse Jackson Visit  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Three days after warning Jesse
Jackson to stay away from Sierra Leone, the government said Friday
the U.S. envoy is now welcome to visit the troubled West African
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who visited neighboring Liberia on Friday, is touring
West Africa in a bid to calm tensions in Sierra Leone and win the
freedom of about 330 U.N. peacekeepers held captive by
Revolutionary United Front rebels. No clashes were reported Friday
between government forces and the rebels, and there were no signs
of progress in negotiations to free the peacekeepers, who have been
held for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson caused a stir last week when he said rebel leader Foday
Sankoh should be included in reconciliation efforts in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's forces have killed and maimed tens of thousands in
almost nine years of civil war. The rebel chief is widely blamed
for breaking last July's peace accord and plunging the country back
into conflict this month. He was captured Wednesday and remains in
government custody.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Sama Banya was quoted on state radio Tuesday as
saying Jackson should not come to Sierra Leone because of the
sympathy he expressed for Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   But several days after he was first quoted, Jackson issued a
statement saying his earlier comments apparently had ''been
misunderstood in Sierra Leone and elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to make it clear that Foday Sankoh and the RUF
alone are responsible for the current crisis in Sierra Leone,'' he
said in the statement. ''In my comments, my purpose was not to
compare the RUF and the ANC. There is no equivalence between the
two. My intention was merely to note that the ANC became a part of
the political process.'' He also suggested that Sankoh may have
forfeited his role in the Sierra Leone peace process.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Jackson on Friday, Banya said: ''the government
would welcome him today if he came.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The government had wanted that clarification (of Jackson's
comments) and he's done so,'' Banya said.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of Freetown, many residents despise Sankoh for
the atrocities committed by his rebels: killing, raping and cutting
off hands, legs, lips and ears of defenseless civilians. Some
expressed resentment toward Jackson for his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jesse Jackson is insensitive to the suffering of the Sierra
Leonean people,'' said George Khoryama of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's itinerary has changed repeatedly, and it was not clear
when he might seek to visit Sierra Leone. Part of his delegation
may visit Sierra Leone without him, according to a State Department
official in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The entire delegation plans to stop in Mali and Guinea over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The tour by Jackson, who is serving as President Clinton's
special envoy, has attracted media attention in the region, though
the United States is not playing a central role in peace efforts in
Sierra Leone. No American troops are among the U.N. peacekeepers,
and the United States has not sought to intervene directly between
the factions here.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. forces are still seeking to establish order in Sierra
Leone almost three weeks after the rebels began taking peacekeepers
hostage, launching attacks on U.N. and pro-government forces and
sending terrified residents streaming into Freetown to avoid
anticipated rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the U.N. Security Council voted to increase the size
of the peacekeeping contingent in Sierra Leone from 11,100 to
13,000. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to call for
an eventual increase to 16,500, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Sierra Leone's government said it was
investigating the actions of Sankoh and his RUF fighters. The
government has not said what it intends to do with the rebel chief.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where culpability is found, we will take the appropriate
action,'' presidential spokesman Septimus Kai Kai said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have not indicated how they will respond to Sankoh's
detention. In 1998, Sankoh was sentenced to death for treason, and
his rebels subsequently invaded Freetown, killing thousands before
they were driven out of the city.

	   CANAJOHARIE, N.Y. (AP) -- A community upset that its school board
dropped the nickname ''Redskins'' a year ago has decided to have no
mascot.
</P>
<P>
   Students and residents in the Canajoharie Central School
District overwhelmingly voted that they would rather have no name
for their teams, district officials announced Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll just be simplified,'' said Cathy Smith, who is part
Cherokee and originally wanted to keep the Redskins name.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that 'no mascot' lends dignity. I like it,'' said
Marcia Velicky, who helped organize Wednesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''No mascot'' was the top choice of 10 names, which included
Castleguards, Pioneers and Cougars. The school board decided
Redskins was offensive to Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents in the rural area 46 miles northwest of Albany
criticized the school board for throwing out the Redskins name a
year ago without notice that they were considering a change. As a
result, the committee was formed. For years, the name and the logo
of American Indian in full headdress was on athletic uniforms, high
school T-shirts, jackets and other items.
</P>
<P>
   If the school board goes along with the vote, high school sports
teams will feature CHS on their jerseys, while the middle school
will use CMS and CES for the elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1200 students from kindergarten through 12th grade and
289 adults cast ballots.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Settle With Jewish Siblings  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The Swiss government will pay $118,000 to a Jewish
brother and sister whose parents were gassed by the Nazis after
Switzerland kicked the family out during World War II, the Finance
Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry said it will pay Charles and Sabine Sonabend in an
out-of-court settlement to cover their costs from a legal battle
with the government. Ministry officials stopped short of calling
the payment ''compensation,'' apparently fearing that might
encourage claims from other Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger said he would meet the
Sonabends on Tuesday to express ''the sympathy and regret of the
government'' -- a move hailed by the Sonabends' lawyer as more
important than the cash offer. ''My clients see themselves as
representatives of all the other Holocaust refugees in
Switzerland,'' lawyer Marc Richter said.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by Germany, Nazi-occupied France and Nazi-allied
Italy, neutral Switzerland took in nearly 30,000 Jews during World
War II. But, fearing that it would be swamped by refugees or
provoke Germany's ire, it repelled an equal number to face almost
certain death.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the instances of anguish the policy caused, the plight of
the Sonabends is the best documented.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1942, the Sonabends decided to use their considerable
wealth to escape mass deportations of Jews from Nazi-held Belgium.
Simon Sonabend -- a prominent watch retailer -- paid smugglers to get
him, his wife Laja, 11-year-old Charles and 15-year-old Sabine from
Brussels into Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were confident,'' Charles Sonabend later told a historian
who documented the case for Swiss federal archives. ''We had
arrived in Switzerland and were saved.''
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to the Sonabends, Swiss authorities had issued a
confidential order closing the border to Jews. The family was
arrested promptly after arriving. Simon Sonabend was thrown into a
border town prison, while his wife and children were put in a
nearby convent.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss police records note how Laja Sonabend ''collapsed to the
floor in a dead faint'' during an attempt to bundle the family into
a car for transportation to the border. ''The children were
screaming for help,'' the records said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of local people took to the streets to protest the
deportation, but to no avail. Soon after the Sonabends were taken
across the border, they were traced by German authorities and
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Laja Sonabend were gassed at Auschwitz. The children
survived: A Jewish group managed to smuggle them to Paris, where
they spent the rest of the war in hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Charles now lives in London and his sister in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are satisfied that it's the best result we could have
obtained,'' said Richter, the Sonabends' lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Asst. Miami Police Chief Quits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The assistant Miami police chief who caused a furor
in City Hall by riding with federal agents during the raid to seize
Elian Gonzalez has quit the force.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. John Brooks, a 25-year police veteran, will become a
Broward County sheriff's captain.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' involvement in the armed raid last month triggered the
firing of the city manager and the resignation of its police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials in the predominantly Cuban-American city had
said that they didn't want Miami police to take part in any
government effort to seize the boy, and they were shocked to see
Brooks sitting in the passenger seat of the van that carried Elian
away.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Brooks rode along so officers on duty at the house
would realize it was an official action. Police on the scene had
only a moment's notice of the raid, and vehicles in the caravan
carrying the federal agents were unmarked.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need talented leaders with guts, vision and integrity,''
Brooks' new boss, Sheriff Ken Jenne, said in a statement Friday.
''I know that John will meet every challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Democrat Asked To Join GOP Group  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It turns out that the Republican Senatorial
''Inner Circle'' isn't as exclusive as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat, received an
invitation this week from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to join
the circle, made up of people who donate at least $1,000 a year to
the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter sent to Conrad's home, Lott told Conrad he was
nominated by GOP senators to serve as one of 40 members from
Washington, D.C., in the ''exclusive'' Inner Circle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, I invite you to accept this honor and help Republican
members of the United States Senate advance our powerful national
agenda of lower taxes, less government and common sense values,''
wrote Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really am honored by this,'' a chuckling Conrad said Friday.
''To have my colleagues get together and nominate me for their
inner circle.... I don't think I'll be sending them any money.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad said he thanked Lott for the letter Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''OK,'' Lott said, ''what letter, Kent?'' On hearing the letter
invited Conrad to join the group and attend the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia this summer, Lott said, ''You have to
wonder about these lists,'' Conrad recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Roy, a Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman, said
Conrad got the letter ''because we are eternal optimists and we
still had him in the undecided column.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows you how a big a tent the Republican party is,''
joked Lott spokesman John Czwartacki.

<HEADLINE> German Terror Suspect Said Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) -- Canadian authorities have arrested a
German man suspected of membership in a shadowy terrorist group
responsible for bombings and shootings in Germany in the 1980s and
early 1990s, German prosecutors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities identified the man as Lothar Ebke, 46. They
said he was arrested at his home in Yellowknife, Northwest
Territories, Thursday night at the request of German officials.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was being held pending extradition, the German
Federal Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A German court issued a warrant for Ebke on March 9 on suspicion
that he was involved with bombings blamed on the Revolutionary
Cells terrorist group. On April 18, federal prosecutors arrested a
51-year-old man, identified as Matthias B., in Berlin on similar
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Both allegedly belonged to the Revolutionary Cells from 1985
until 1993 or 1994. They were allegedly involved, along with
others, in the bombing of a social welfare office for asylum
seekers in Berlin on Feb. 6, 1987, and in an attempted bombing in
Berlin on Jan. 15, 1991. They were also being sought in connection
with shootings in Berlin in 1986 and 1987. A federal judge and
former city official survived the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Three other suspected members of the Revolutionary Cells were
arrested in Germany last December.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group are believed to have stolen more than 220
pounds of commercial explosives in 1987. Most of it has never been
recovered, prosecutors say.

<HEADLINE> In Atlantic City, MGM Grand calls it quits on one casino plan  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Some land speculators got rich.
Others held out too long. As for the tiny Roman Catholic church at
Oriental and New Jersey avenues, which stood in the way of the
casino plan, it accepted a buyout and disbanded after 91 years.
</P>
<P>
   The handwriting was on the wall: Casino giant MGM Grand Inc. was
coming to town, planning a $750 million to $1 billion casino on a
desolate 35-acre site near Showboat Casino Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it turns out the Monopoly-style maneuvering may have all
been for naught: MGM Grand, which spent four years and more than
$35 million assembling land for its project, is apparently planning
to cash in its chips on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company will take over a site owned by Mirage
Resorts Inc., which it is in the process of buying.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Grand officials weren't commenting on the change-of-heart,
which was reported by The Press of Atlantic City. James Murren, its
president, did not return telephone calls to his office Thursday
and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes, it seems like this town is snakebitten,'' said
Stuart Wiser, director of redevelopment for the city. ''At least
this one wasn't our fault, though.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials feared this in March, when MGM Grand announced it
would buy out Mirage in a $6.4 billion shocker.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, still pending, means that Mirage is walking away from
its plan to build a Las Vegas-style megacasino in the marina
district. It was Mirage, and chairman Stephen Wynn, who had
triggered renewed interest in Atlantic City and persuaded the state
to help finance a $330 million road-and-tunnel connector improving
access to the marina district site where it planned to build.
</P>
<P>
   MGM plans to assume control of that project and give up on its
so-called Uptown project, which has been little but trouble since
it was announced in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Property owners who had bought parcels years ago on speculation
immediately began jacking up the asking prices. MGM Grand bought
land that had been selling at $30 per square foot for $100 per
square foot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the city stepped in, declaring a nine-acre area within
MGM's project site in need of redevelopment, a precursor to eminent
domain proceedings. That prompted a lawsuit by Joseph Zoll, 58, a
Media, Pa., businessman who owned about 200 parcels of land around
the city, some of them in the MGM area.
</P>
<P>
   Zoll lost in court, but later sold to MGM and helped persuade
other holdouts to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Shalom Dai, a New York businessman who was asking $1,000
a square foot for his two MGM-area parcels. The city condemned his
properties and was in the process of seizing them, through eminent
domain, when the MGM-Mirage deal broke.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to Shalom Dai and tried to bring him in with Joe and
the rest of us,'' said Zoll attorney George Miller. ''I talked to
his lawyer and I talked to him. He believed he was going to get
$1,000 a square foot. Now, with no project, I don't know what his
property is worth,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The condemnation will continue, even if MGM is no longer
interested, said Wiser.
</P>
<P>
   Others went quietly. Holy Spirit Church, at Oriental and New
Jersey avenues, accepted a $3.7 million buyout from MGM. It held
its last Mass in September and was recently razed.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials have no regrets, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parish had been experiencing a decline in the number of
parish families for a period of time,'' said Andrew Walton, a
spokesman for the Diocese of Camden. ''That certainly was a
consideration in the Diocese's decision to close the parish,'' he
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Oriental Avenue, the canceled casino came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once they knocked the church down, I really thought they were
coming,'' said Hastings Payne, 66. ''I figured if they put a casino
there, this part of town would start to look better. It doesn't
look too good now.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, city officials still had not been notified by MGM
Grand that the casino project was off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expected it,'' said Louis Toscano, a spokesman for Mayor
James Whelan. ''From our perspective, it makes a lot of sense.
Those plans (in the marina district) are a lot further along than
Uptown.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 150; Nasdaq Down 148  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell broadly Friday as investors
resolutely refused to buy into a market facing rising interest
rates. Technology stocks, among the market's most highly valued
issues, led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of fear out there,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis. ''People are concerned and worried about how high interest
rates will go ... and this market will be volatile until there is
evidence on the table that the Fed will not derail the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 150.43 to 10,626.85. For
the week, the Dow gained 17.48 points thanks to powerful rallies on
Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell Friday. The Nasdaq composite
index dropped 148.31 to 3,390.40, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 30.26 to 1,406.95.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for
the sixth time since June, investors continued moving away from the
stocks seen as most vulnerable in the market's current environment.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fed announced its action on Tuesday, it also indicated
that inflation remains a risk. The warning raised expectations
among investors that more rate hikes are likely later this year -- a
negative trend for stocks because higher rates raise borrowing
costs and cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are particularly vulnerable to interest
rate fluctuations, fell Friday. Merrill Lynch fell 5{ to 103 9/16,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter slid 5\ to 69 7/16 and Lehman Brothers
lost 3 13/16 to 81~.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also came under pressure. Cisco Systems fell 1
15/16 to 53 7/16 and Apple Computer dropped 6} to 94.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell 6 1/16 to 117~. Earlier this week, the company
lowered its previously reported first-quarter earnings by a penny
and its revenue by $28 million. Intel disclosed the revision in
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' eagerness to punish Intel betrayed their nervousness
about owning expensive stocks while interest rates are rising.
</P>
<P>
   ''Valuations in the technology sector got so stretched at the
start of this year,'' said Jim Weiss, deputy chief investment
officer for equities at State Street Research and Management Co. in
Boston. ''The rotation away from technology will continue as people
are looking for more diversification and some more defensive
elements.''
</P>
<P>
   But oil stocks were mostly higher, benefiting from the rising
price of crude oil. A barrel of crude surged above $30 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, then fell back to $29.89
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron rose 2 7/16 to 93 5/16 and Exxon Mobil rose 19/64 to
81}.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be scouring new economic data in the coming weeks
to see if the Fed's actions are slowing the economy. The first
piece comes next Thursday, when the Commerce Department issues a
preliminary report on first-quarter gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, stocks are unlikely to advance, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a news vacuum right now and there are no earnings
stories to talk about for months, so there is nothing to fuel the
market,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Composite volume on the New York Stock Exchange came to 1.06
billion shares, topping Thursday's quiet pace due to the
double-witching expiration of stock and index options. Volume has
been lower than normal for about two weeks as many investors
dropped out of the market to debate the Fed's future course of
action.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the
NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 11.25 to
479.70.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.0 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index tumbled 2.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
fell 3.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 4.0 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Specter Warns Reno, Freeh on Memo  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Frustrated by the belated disclosure of key
memos in the fund-raising scandal, a key senator warned Friday he
may seek sanctions against Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI
Director Louis Freeh if more surprises surface.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., reacted angrily to the FBI's belated
disclosure this week that Freeh penned a memo in late 1996
suggesting a prosecutor was under pressure to drop the fund-raising
case to save Reno's job.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, often an ally of Freeh, said the director and Reno
should have disclosed the memo long ago but produced it only after
being formally subpoenaed by a Senate subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't produce it until he got a subpoena ... I think
they're afraid that if they don't come across with the documents,
they may be liable for obstruction of justice,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very dissatisfied with the attorney general's performance
and said so many times, and the I think the director has an
explanation to make as to why he did not inform the public of the
contents of his memo,'' Specter added.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's Senate subcommittee is investigating the Justice
Department's handling of several sensitive cases, including
fund-raising and China espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and House Government Reform Committee chairman Dan
Burton, R-Ind., are planning hearings next week to review Freeh's
memo. Burton said Friday he was less concerned about the FBI's
belated release of the memo and would focus instead on why Reno
discarded Freeh's urging to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Freeh memo suddenly appeared Wednesday night,
Specter said he was considering asking his colleagues to find the
Justice Department in contempt of Congress for slow and incomplete
production of documents in the fund-raising case.
</P>
<P>
   He said he may still proceed with the sanctions. ''If we find
that there are documents which they have not produced, we will push
for sanctions. In the face of their late production, we just might
consider sanctions anyhow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported Thursday that Freeh wrote a memo
on Dec. 9, 1996, disclosing that he asked Reno and Justice
Department public integrity section (PIS) chief Lee Radek to step
aside from the fund-raising probe because of purported comments
made by Radek.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh quoted Radek third-hand as saying there was ''a lot of
'pressure' on him and PIS regarding this case because the attorney
general's job might hang in the balance.'' He also urged in the
memo that a ''junkyard dog'' -- his term for an aggressive
prosecutor -- be named to take over the case.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Friday she never bowed to political pressure. ''I call
it like I see it, regardless of the consequences. I've got a
month-to-month lease on my apartment, and I've been prepared to go
home from the beginning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno added she did not recall Freeh briefing her on Radek's
purported remarks or ''talking about pressure because of the job. I
do have a recollection of him (Freeh) saying that we should get a
junkyard dog to prosecute the case, but I think that was said on
several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Radek, likewise, said he doesn't recall making such comments and
wouldn't have because there was ''no basis in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton scoffed at their explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an epidemic of memory loss in that administration,''
he said. ''Nobody who has testified before my committee from the
president's chief counsel on down to the attorney general can
remember anything.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's because they can't held for perjury if they say they just
can't remember,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Radek, former FBI Deputy Director Bill Esposito and FBI General
Counsel Larry Parkinson have been asked to appear at a hearing next
week before Specter's subcommittee, the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Esposito was the recipient of the Freeh memo and was identified
by Freeh as the agent to whom Radek made the purported comment.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Police Arrest Fireworks Owner  </HEADLINE>
By PETER DEJONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch police on Friday arrested one
of the owners of a fireworks warehouse that exploded last weekend,
killing at least 20 people and injuring almost 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm Pater turned himself in a day after an international
warrant was issued for him, police spokesman Jan Camphuis said. The
second owner, Rudi Bakker, is still at large. Both men are wanted
for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after the arrest, more than 100,000 people walked
silently through the soaking streets of Enschede in a memorial
procession for victims of the devastating blast six days ago. Dutch
Crown Prince Willem Alexander, Prime Minister Wim Kok and Mayor Jan
Mans were among the masses who came from across the country to pay
their respects.
</P>
<P>
   A minute of silence was held in a park near the flattened
working-class neighborhood of Enschede North.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thousands of people went through hell in those few moments,''
the prime minister told a memorial service. ''This disaster dealt a
catastrophic blow to the people of Enschede.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-mile procession was led by several victims' relatives
and a group of children. Two children, ages 6 and 10, were killed
in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, several hundred uniformed firefighters lined
up at the funerals of two firefighters who died battling the blaze.
Two more firefighters are to be buried on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Four of us did not return,'' read a condolence message in the
national daily newspaper de Volkskrant. ''We are stirred, immensely
saddened and barely realize what has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters Paul Gremmen, Theo Hesselink, Hans van der Molen
and Gerard Oude Nijeweme were called to put out a routine fire in a
poor residential neighborhood and were confronted with an inferno.
The men were killed when a series of storage bunkers containing 100
tons of explosives went up in an enormous blast that damaged 400
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Identification teams sifted through the last remaining rubble in
search of human remains. City officials said 10 people were still
missing from the blast, down from more than 200 earlier in the
week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Campaigns Should Be Civil  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- President Clinton appealed Friday to
Democrats and Republicans to avoid ''a mean election'' this fall,
saying the philosophical differences between the parties on taxes,
foreign policy, health care and crime are vast, but honest.
</P>
<P>
   In a luncheon fund-raiser for Democratic congressional
candidates, Clinton cited a list of issues where he believed the
Democrats had the right position over the past seven years. Then he
listed several issues that may play out on the campaign trail this
year -- and why he thinks the GOP's positions on them are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   On crime: ''Their policy is, I have to drag them kicking and
screaming to get any more for police.''
</P>
<P>
   On Medicare: ''They say our program is too costly. We say theirs
doesn't really do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   On a nuclear test ban treaty: ''They believe it's an
anachronistic document.''
</P>
<P>
   On tax cuts and economic growth: ''There's a huge difference
here. It cannot be papered over. Do we think this economic policy
is on automatic and you couldn't mess it up if you tried? I can
tell you, I don't believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, there are ''massive differences'' on
environmental policy and health care, ''huge differences'' on hate
crimes and a minimum wage increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a personal attack,'' Clinton said. ''I'm saying we
have honest differences. The divides between us, I think, are clear
and I believe we're right.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one area where Clinton saw agreement: a tax credit for
long-term care. ''There is a chance that we'll reach a bipartisan
agreement,'' he said. ''If so, I'll be thankful for it. It's a good
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he believes Vice President Al Gore will defeat
Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the race for the White
House, and Democrats will regain control of Congress for the first
time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a chance to change control of the House of
Representatives with a shift of just five seats,'' he said. ''We
have a chance, believe it or not, to be evened up or even to be one
ahead in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, Clinton said, the elections should be won
fairly, with civility.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I hope will happen is that we will not have a mean
election. We don't have to say they are bad people,'' Clinton said.
''We should assume we have two honorable people running for
president, honorable people running for Congress. We intend to do
what we say, they intend to do what they say. And you need to say,
'Where are the differences and what are the consequences?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer responded by criticizing
Clinton and Gore for not doing enough to ensure the future of
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of using the last days of his presidency to act as Al
Gore's campaign manager, the president would better serve our
nation if he worked in a bipartisan manner with the Congress to
save Social Security from bankruptcy,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   After the fund-raiser, Clinton visited the Mayer Sulzberger
Middle School to announce $185 million in grants to fund
after-school and summer school programs at 900 schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The president repeated his calls for Congress to take up his
education reform package, which seeks funds for school repair and
construction, hiring more teachers and stricter accountability for
failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed the importance of programs such as GEAR UP -- Gaining
Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs -- to help
more young people attend college. Through GEAR UP, passed by
Congress in 1998, middle schools in poor neighborhoods set up
partnerships with colleges, community groups and businesses to
encourage children to begin preparing for college at an earlier
age.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was introduced by Toya Doe, 12, a Sulzberger
seventh-grader and GEAR UP participant who wants to become a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The GEAR UP event was wedged onto Clinton's schedule between the
luncheon, which brought in $600,000 for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, and a reception that raised
$225,000 for Rep. Joe Hoeffel, D-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, Clinton flew to Chicago for a dinner to raise
$500,000 for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Soldiers End Uprising  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- For the third time in four years,
Paraguay's fragile democracy was severely tested Friday, this time
by mutinous soldiers and police who fired at the legislative
building from armored personnel carriers before surrendering four
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday morning, the government was back in full control.
Soldiers toting automatic weapons took up checkpoints around the
capital and passers-by stopped to gawk at bullet holes in the
colonial-style legislative palace.
</P>
<P>
   President Luis Gonzalez Macchi, who took office last March after
another political crisis, went on national television Friday to
assure citizens that the ''antidemocratic'' forces believed to be
loyal to a former coup plotter had been defeated for good.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rest easy, countrymen!'' he said. ''Public order has been
restored. The destabilizing and antidemocratic forces have been
disbanded, the crisis brought under control and the mutineers
detained.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his government's response to the coup attempt would be
to accelerate economic and social reforms sought by many in this
landlocked South American nation struggling with high unemployment
and discontent.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began when the soldiers barreled through the capital
late Thursday and headed to the palace.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff ended when soldiers surrendered at 2:45 a.m.
Friday, Col. Felix Dario Collante said. He refused to say how many
turned themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   Three congressmen and 12 police officers had been detained
Friday, though it was unclear what role they had played in the
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Walter Bower said the rebellious soldiers were
sympathetic to former army Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo, a fugitive
wanted in last year's assassination of Vice President Luis Argana --
a killing that brought Gonzalez Macchi to power. Oviedo was also
suspected in a brief mutiny in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the permanent council of the Organization of American
States ''vehemently condemned'' the coup attempt and expressed full
support for the Gonzalez Macchi's government.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution approved by the council called the attempt an
''assault on the democratic and constitutional order of Paraguay.''
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay's still wobbly democracy emerged from the defeat of the
35-year Stroessner dictatorship in 1989, but has been buffeted by
one political crisis after another in the intervening decade. The
latest upheaval was in March 1999, when Raul Cubas was ousted as
president and replaced by Gonzalez Macchi.
</P>
<P>
   Life appeared to return to normal Friday as shops and schools
opened and people went about their business. Hundreds of police,
their rifles slung from shoulders, guarded the building for hours,
but left the scene Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, helmeted soldiers with automatic weapons checked
identity papers at roadblocks on major highways leading from the
capital and to the international airport. One soldier stood atop an
armored personnel carrier at a major downtown intersection, another
behind a machine-gun mounted on the back of a jeep.
</P>
<P>
   Blocks away at the legislature, many Paraguayans expressed
skepticism that this would be the end to instability.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all worried. This may be over for now, but anything can
still happen in Paraguay,'' said Mario Isa, 20, who watched as a
truckload of soldiers in camouflage fatigues took posts on the
second-story balcony of the legislative palace.
</P>
<P>
   Two schoolgirls giggled as they passed the soldiers. But others
said they were anxious. ''The truth is, I was scared,'' said
Valeria Schussmuller, 21, who followed TV reports much of the
night. ''Here we are in 2000 and this is something out of the
1800s.''
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo has yet to complete a 10-year sentence for a brief
rebellion in April 1996 against former President Juan Carlos
Wasmosy, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo fled Paraguay after Cubas resigned and was granted
political asylum in Argentina, where he stayed before going into
hiding days before Argentine President Fernando de la Rua took
office Dec. 10. At last report, he claimed to be in a remote area
of Paraguay, making sporadic telephone calls to news media and
denouncing the government.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Agrees To Stop Training  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR ZIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Shaken by a spate of religious
killings in recent weeks, Pakistan has asked Afghanistan's Taliban
ruling militia to stop training Pakistani religious militants and
the Taliban have agreed, Pakistan's interior minister said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan issued the request during meetings this week with the
Taliban's Interior Minister, Mullah Abdul Razzak. According to his
Pakistani counterpart, Moinuddin Haider, Razzak promised the
Taliban would put an end to the training, although he refused to
give more details.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the Taliban had denied allowing training camps on
their soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many Pakistanis who have trained in Afghanistan indulge in
crimes when they return home,'' Haider said. ''We don't want any
Pakistani belonging to any religious group or sect being trained in
Afghanistan. We want to put an end to this.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, more than 20 Shiite Muslims have been killed in
separate attacks throughout the country. The assailants are
believed to have been extremist Sunni Muslims, although no arrests
have been made.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, which is dominated by Sunni Muslims, most people
live peacefully with their Shiite Muslim brethren. But a small
minority on each side are heavily armed, and the two sides
regularly clash.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who are Sunni Muslims, have been accused of
harboring and training Muslims militants from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most wanted militants -- Osama bin Laden, who
is accused of masterminding the deadly bombings of U.S. embassies
in Africa in 1998 -- also lives in Afghanistan. Washington says he
runs an international terrorist network from the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have refused hand over bin Laden to the U.S. or a
third country for trial. They say bin Laden is not carrying out any
activities on their soil.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has asked Pakistan to help convince the Taliban to
hand over bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is one of only three countries to recognized the
Taliban and is considered one of their greatest allies. But Haider
said Pakistan's influence on the Taliban is limited and at best
Islamabad could get the two sides talking.
</P>
<P>
   Another big concern for Pakistan is the use of Pakistani
territory to transit narcotics produced in Afghanistan to Western
markets. Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium, the
raw material used to make heroin, according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have agreed to reduce production by one-third,
Haider said. But the Taliban say they need foreign assistance to
put an end to the opium production. The Taliban also say that want
Western countries to reduce the demand for heroin, Haider said.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Denounces Opponents  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic pledged
Friday to defend Yugoslavia against ''enemies'' trying to break up
the country, as opposition groups staged more protests demanding an
end to a government crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing violence following two days of police attacks on
pro-democracy demonstrators, opposition leaders urged more than
5,000 supporters at a rally in Belgrade for restraint and peaceful
resistance to the regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''No television and no power is worth a single human life,''
declared Vuk Draskovic, a key opposition leader who joined the
protests on Friday after a two-day absence. ''I beg you to
understand we can only fight state terrorism by peaceful
resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The government on Wednesday took over Belgrade's opposition-run
Studio B television and radio, triggering pro-democracy activists
to launch a series of protests that have led to several arrests and
the injury of more than 150 people in clashes with police.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright openly
challenged officials of Milosevic's regime to break with him and
join the pro-democracy forces.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke during a joint press briefing with Portuguese Foreign
Minister Jaime Gama.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agreed that officials in Serbia face a choice,'' she said.
''They can stand for the freedom and the rights of all Serbs, or
they can prolong Milosevic's rule by participating in the
oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said they discussed ways that the United States and the
EU ''can make clear our solidarity and increase our support for the
courageous men and women who are demanding their rights in the
cities and towns across Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, several hundred activists from Otpor, or
Resistance, a popular student group which has been targeted by the
government, handed out leaflets in downtown Belgrade decrying the
president's crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 police stopped them to check their documents, taking
away at least one Otpor flag with the group's signature clenched
fist emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of riot police fired tear gas Thursday and charged at
over 10,000 protesters who lobbed stones and fire bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police intervention was extremely brutal, they are trying
to frighten the citizens into stopping the protests,'' said Goran
Svilanovic, an opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who had been absent from the demonstrations, returned
to the capital Friday saying he had contacted top Russian and Greek
officials over the crisis in Serbia. Both Moscow and Athens --
traditional allies of Belgrade -- have joined numerous other
countries and international organizations in condemning Milosevic's
latest attack on dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic seemed unimpressed. In a statement Friday, he said the
government would stand firm ''despite joint efforts by Yugoslavia's
enemies abroad and at home who are trying to break up the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the enemies were using ''armed and media aggression,
terrorism, sanctions, and treason'' by those who serve foreign
interests within the country -- an apparent reference to the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president's statement adds to fears of growing
violence in Serbia, where the government has launched the harshest
crackdown yet against opponents, following the slaying last week of
a top official which the authorities blamed on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic dispatched his police chief, Vlajko Stojiljkovic, to
the southern, opposition-run city of Nis where about 10,000 people
gathered Friday evening for an opposition rally.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions in Nis were high following an incident on Thursday when
a group of pro-government city officials was mobbed by opposition
supporters in front of the city hall. Two members of the ruling
Socialist Party were reported injured.
</P>
<P>
   Stojiljkovic has pledged to ''root out terrorism and violence,''
and to do everything so that Nis will ''remain a peaceful city,''
the state-run Tanjug new agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Dominican's Poor Had Easy Choice  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNAH A. NESMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- The power stayed on for
election day, and then the outages resumed -- letting refrigerators
grow warm, TV screens go black and electrical fans fall idle in the
muggy Caribbean heat.
</P>
<P>
   As if that wasn't enough discomfort for the residents of La
Cienega slum in the capital, rain has flooded the streets with raw
sewage, inundating a local school.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the routine indignity of everyday life in La Cienega --
and it helps explain why opposition leader Hipolito Mejia trounced
the incumbent Liberation Party candidate in Tuesday's presidential
election, despite a rapidly growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard about all the new construction, but none of that
(prosperity) reaches here,'' said Caty Adahamas, who at 18 is an
unemployed, unmarried mother of two subsisting on an allowance from
her stepfather, a furniture maker.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Leonel Fernandez -- whose four years
in power saw economic growth of almost 40 percent -- has improved
some things here, residents grudgingly admitted. There are some
newly paved streets, more phone lines and a colossal new bridge
being built overhead to span the muddy waters of the Ozama River.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the gnawing feeling of having been left
behind, that the increased foreign trade, investment and tourism
have served the interests of a small elite.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization cited the Dominican
Republic last month as one of several countries in Latin America
and the Caribbean that lacks both sufficient food for its people
and the funds to import it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, said 20-year-old Yohanda Lugo, her 5-year-old boy
can't go to kindergarten because his school floods when it rains. A
pockmarked concrete patio passes for a schoolyard, strewn with
three weeks' worth of uncollected garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost everyone in La Cienega, Lugo and Adahamas voted for
Mejia, the Dominican Revolutionary Party candidate who soundly
defeated Danilo Medina of the governing party and conservative
former President Joaqin Balaguer, 93, who served seven terms.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia fell short of the necessary majority to win in the
first-round vote, but his opponents declined to engage him in a
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia won hearts with a peppery tongue and promises to pay more
attention to human-scale problems. He also has tried to calm the
domestic and foreign business communities, assuring them he will
not deviate from the country's current economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''My strength is finance, management, the reordering of public
things, the making of institutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents warn of a repeat of the scandal-ridden administration
of the last Revolutionary Party president, Salvador Jorge Blanco,
who governed from 1982-86.
</P>
<P>
   But those who voted for Mejia are concerned with problems closer
to home.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Ramon Santana, who runs a small grocery store in La
Cienega, complained bitterly of lost business since the electricity
went off Wednesday evening and the beer in his coolers went warm
and flat. Santana, who lives in a back room of the store and earns
$100 a month at the best of times, can ill afford the
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   All he wants from Mejia and the presidency is ''that the lights
should stay on.''

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Angered by U.S. Congress  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Angered by a U.S. Congressional resolution
condemning Hanoi's communist government, Vietnam summoned U.S.
Ambassador Pete Peterson and protested the United States' ''brazen
interference into internal affairs,'' the official Vietnam News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Phan Quang, vice-chairman of the National Assembly's External
Relations Commission, told Peterson Thursday that Vietnam strongly
condemned Congress's action as ''groundless and arrogant ...
hindering the normalization process with Vietnam,'' VNA reported.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson was quoted as expressing regret at the nonbinding
resolution, passed to mark the recent 25th anniversary of the end
of the Vietnam War. He said it reflected the view of a minority,
not the official position of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are working tirelessly to promote bilateral relations,''
Peterson was quoted as saying. ''(We) cannot allow a minority group
to take the opportunity to spoil the achieved results and divide
our countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Quang was speaking on behalf of Vietnam's legislators, who are
currently holding their biannual parliamentary session. He asked
Peterson to convey their anger to U.S. lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional resolution criticized the Vietnamese Communist
Party's monopoly on power and its human rights record and called
for democratic general elections. Authored by Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, R-Calif., the resolution also urged Vietnam to release
all religious and political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for free and fair elections was ''an interference which
is beyond the imagination of Vietnamese voters, deeply insulting
Vietnamese people's choices in previous elections,'' Quang said. He
repeated Vietnam's long-standing contention that the country does
not hold political or religious prisoners, only lawbreakers. Human
rights groups maintain that Vietnam routinely clamps down on its
critics.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was the latest stumbling block for fragile but
improving relations between the United States and Vietnam. The two
nations re-established diplomatic relations five years ago.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Floods Kill At Least 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Floods in the northern Philippines
triggered by days of heavy rain killed at least 10 people and left
one person missing, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The tropical storm that dumped torrential rains over wide areas
of the northern Philippines was reported gaining strength as it
moved toward southern Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Rains, however, was expected to continue in the Philippines
until Sunday, the Office of Civil Defense said.
</P>
<P>
   It said floodwaters had receded in most of metropolitan Manila
and in the several provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people evacuated had fallen considerably. At the
height of the rains and floods, about 112,000 people were forced to
flee their homes to escape rising floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Six people drowned, three others were killed by collapsing
structures and another person died of electrocution, the civil
defense office said.
</P>
<P>
   The floods came at the start of the rainy season in the
Philippines. As many as 20 typhoons and tropical storms pass
through the country annually.

<HEADLINE> Rudolph Giuliani's marriage: the Achilles heel of a tough man  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani never mentioned the
tumult in his marital life when he ended his campaign for the U.S.
Senate on Friday. Instead, he dwelled on the need to get the best
treatment for his prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But news of his crumbling marriage has been as much in the
public mind as reports on his health since he revealed his cancer
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was the mayor who let loose the opening salvo in a
tit-for-tat exchange with his wife that decimated their union.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor first mentioned he had a ''very, very good friend''
after reporters spotted him escorting around town a divorced
45-year-old Upper East Sider, Judith Nathan. Then he announced that
he and wife Donna Hanover were talking about a separation.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover, an actress and television personality, quickly let it
be known that his public statement was made without her knowing it
was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Looking in shock, a teary-eyed Hanover said she had tried to
keep the marriage together, then accused the 55-year-old mayor of
having had ''a relationship'' earlier with his press aide, Cristyne
Lategano-Nicholas. Giuliani and his former aide both denied the
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than two weeks framed the end of a marital saga that
began 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday -- before the mayor pulled out of the Senate race -- a
spokeswoman for the 50-year-old Hanover confirmed reports that she
had hired a high-powered divorce lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover, a Naval officer's daughter, and her husband, a federal
prosecutor, met on a 1982 blind date.
</P>
<P>
   After a whirlwind romance, they made the perfect power couple,
with a newborn son in tow. Putting her career on hold, Hanover
became a model first lady for the nation's largest city, and an
upbeat, supportive wife and mother.
</P>
<P>
   For about 14 years, the marriage appeared to hum on
harmoniously.
</P>
<P>
   Then, starting about two years ago, the couple was rarely seen
in public together.
</P>
<P>
   Calling their troubles ''very, very painful,'' the mayor said
last week, ''For quite some time, it's probably been apparent that
Donna and I lead, in most ways, independent and separate lives.''
</P>
<P>
   She had picked up on her acting career, appearing in soap operas
and a movie, and hosting several television shows.
</P>
<P>
   And they followed a delicate dance of official schedules that
landed them at different venues. She was not at his side for the
1997 mayoral re-election campaign, saying she was focusing on
raising their two children, Andrew, 14, and Caroline, 10.
</P>
<P>
   From Gracie Mansion, the mayor's residence, the official
response to the separate goings-on was -- silence.
</P>
<P>
   This week's public pummeling finally broke open the
whisper-filled shell that protected them from the media glare. And
New York's aggressive tabloids, which until now played a spicy
guessing game, had a field day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rudy's Gal 'Pal' Never Far Behind,'' said the New York Post,
which added in a column that Giuliani ''did not base his career on
his brilliance as a family man.''
</P>
<P>
   And his wife ''has made a career distancing herself from the
mayor,'' said columnist Andrea Peyser.
</P>
<P>
   Even the reserved New York Times got into the marital fray.
''Why are men so beastly?'' asked Maureen Dowd in her column.
</P>
<P>
   With the mayor out of the Senate spotlight, his marital affairs
may soon start to disappear from front pages. Still, the sudden
public vulnerabilty of a politician known for his stiff upper lip
keeps fueling fascination with his life.
</P>
<P>
   New York magazine was going to press with a cover story titled
''Rudy's Loves.''
</P>
<P>
   The subtitle suggested that Giuliani had an Achilles heel worthy
of Greek drama, asking: ''Tough? Definitely. Mean? Sometimes.
Love-struck? Who knew?''

<HEADLINE> Rowland announces public safety appointment  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A semi-retired Superior Court judge who
conducted the grand jury investigation into Hartford police
corruption was nominated Friday as the state's next Commissioner of
Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Judge Arthur L. Spada, 68, is the fifth public safety
commissioner appointed by Gov. John G. Rowland. He will succeed
world-renowned forensic expert Henry Lee, who announced his
retirement last month.
</P>
<P>
   Spada, who starts the $129,000-a-year job on June 1, will run a
department that includes the divisions of state police and fire,
emergency and building services. Spada will serve on an interim
basis until confirmed by the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Art Spada has distinguished himself as a member of the
Superior Court,'' said Rowland. ''I have every confidence that
Judge Spada will make an outstanding commissioner and live up to
the proud traditions of the Connecticut State Police.''
</P>
<P>
   He will oversee about 1,100 state troopers and inherit a new
police communications system. The $80 million project is replacing
the 60-year-old radio system that has dead spots in some part of
the state. Some barracks started using the new system late last
year. It is expected to be in place statewide by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Spada is best known for conducting the grand jury into Hartford
police corruption in the mid-1990s. A total of eight officers were
indicted; two have been acquitted at trials.
</P>
<P>
   A Hartford native, Spada earned a law degree from the University
of Connecticut School of Law in 1957. Gov. Ella Grasso appointed
him to the Superior Court in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am honored that Governor Rowland has nominated me to this
position,'' Spada said in a news release issued by the governor's
office. ''I have always had the highest respect for the men and
women of the Department of Public Safety and I look forward to
leading an organization with a national reputation for
excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee announced his retirement last month, and said he wants to
focus his efforts on unsolved murders, including the slaying of
JonBenet Ramsey. Lee also plans to step down as head of the state
crime lab, a position he has held for 19 years.

<HEADLINE> Battle Over FCC Rules Rages  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A battle in a federal appeals courts pits
privacy groups and the telecommunications industry against the
FBI's efforts to modernize its electronic surveillance capability
against drug dealers, terrorists, spies and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of cell phones and other advances in the field of
wireless communications, the Federal Communications Commission has
upset the ''fragile balance'' between the right to privacy and the
needs of the FBI, a coalition of industry and advocacy groups
argued Wednesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition wants a three-judge panel to direct the FCC to
scale back new rules on information telecommunications companies
must be capable of providing law enforcement without a wiretap
warrant. By September 2001, the companies must be able to supply
the FBI:
</P>
<P>
   --The location of cellular phone users.
</P>
<P>
   --Any digits dialed after a call is connected such as numbers for
credit cards, bank accounts or call forwarding instructions.
</P>
<P>
   --''Packet-mode communications,'' a product of the fast-changing
telecommunications industry that contains both the voice content of
phone calls and the phone numbers involved in the call.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition says the FCC rules go beyond a 1994 law requiring
telecommunications carriers to help law enforcement agencies
conduct legally authorized electronic surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   But the government says privacy rights are being fully
protected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Information revealing the approximate location of wireless
callers ... is no different from the location information that
results from the detection of a telephone number in the landline
system,'' the FCC replied in written arguments filed with the
appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   However, Theodore Olson, one of the lawyers in the coalition,
said in an interview Friday that ''locating the person making the
phone call converts cellular phones into government tracking
devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson represents the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association and the Center for Democracy and Technology, two groups
in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Technology problems are colliding with the needs of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy groups want the FCC to require companies to ''strip
out'' the content portion of phone calls from the ''packet-mode
communications'' before they're turned over to the FBI in instances
where there is no wiretap warrant. The industry says it will be
expensive and technically difficult to separate pieces of the
''packets.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No one seems to agree as to how difficult or how expensive it
would be,'' said Olson. ''The technology hasn't yet caught up with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department told the appeals court that law
enforcement won't access any information it isn't entitled to, an
argument that the coalition said fails to meet constitutional
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once a surveillance device becomes a vehicle for the
acquisition of content'' of phone calls, ''it becomes subject to
the Fourth Amendment, whatever label or name it is given,'' the
coalition said in court papers. ''A fishing license cannot become a
license to drain the ocean to catch a fish.''
</P>
<P>
   In written arguments to the court, the Justice Department said
that ''contrary'' to the privacy groups' ''suggestion, law
enforcement has no desire to intercept the content portion'' absent
a wiretap warrant.
</P>
<P>
   If a telecommunications company ''has the technical ability to
strip out content from the packet stream ... that is perfectly
acceptable to law enforcement,'' said the Justice Department. ''The
privacy interests identified'' in the FCC's order ''are adequately
protected.''

<HEADLINE> Peru's Fujimori Continues Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's steel-fisted president, Alberto
Fujimori, continued on the campaign trail for re-election Friday,
battling against a contender who has refused to participate in a
May 28 runoff, alleging fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a growing political crisis, Fujimori flew to
Huanuco in the central Andes for a campaign rally as his supporters
assailed Alejandro Toledo, a U.S.-educated economist, for his
decision to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Tudela, Fujimori's running mate, called Toledo and his
allies ''complainers, cry babies... who play at politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo demanded on Thursday that the National Election Board
push back the runoff date from May 28 to June 18 so that there
would be time to eliminate the irregularities that marred the first
round. Hours earlier, a commission of election monitors from the
Organization of American States also sought a postponement.
</P>
<P>
   The board, controlled by Fujimori appointees, rejected the
request.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department supported the OAS request for a delay
and regretted Toledo's decision to withdraw as well as the election
board's ''hasty ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Branding Fujimori a dictator, Toledo called Friday for peaceful
street protests across Peru to force a delay in the runoff. But he
warned that he would not take part in a delayed election if the
irregularities were not corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ''The moment has arrived to stand up to the dictatorship,'' he
shouted to the roars of supporters at a street rally in Lima
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern fishing port of Chimbote police had to use tear
gas to drive back demonstrators who threw bottles and rocks at a
Fujimori campaign rally. Police formed a human barrier to keep the
protesters from Fujimori when he arrived from Huanuco.
</P>
<P>
   Romulo Munoz, a member of the election board, said Friday that
Toledo still had not made the written formal request to have his
name withdrawn from the May 28 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional experts agreed that Peruvian electoral laws do
not provide for a candidate to withdraw after elections have been
called and predicted the National Election Board would allow the
runoff to take place over Toledo's objections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is going to continue with the idea of the May
28 election,'' said political analyst Fernando Tuesta. ''What it
will produce is a seriously damaged government.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Toledo was refusing to take part in the runoff, he gave
every indication of still being on the campaign trail with his call
for massive street protests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are continuing our campaign ... until the day when a clean
election is carried out,'' Toledo said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo urged Peruvians to boycott the May 28 vote to discredit
the result, but political experts said a widespread boycott was
unlikely because voting is a legal requirement. Those who fail to
vote must pay the equivalent of a $40 fine, a large sum in a
country where the minimum wage is less than $120 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with foreign correspondents Friday, Toledo said,
''We're aware that voting is obligatory. Let's see if they can
collect fines from 5 million Peruvians.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 11 million Peruvians voted in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said Toledo apparently was aiming to
discredit Fujimori's election to a third five-year term through
widespread street protests at home and international pressure from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the objective of Mr. Toledo's declarations is to
undercut the legitimacy of an eventual triumph,'' said Anibal
Quiroga, a constitutional expert.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Julio Carrion agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Toledo has realized that to beat this guy he has to force a
political crisis,'' he said. ''Fujimori is not somebody who sticks
to constitutional rules or any sort of rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But discrediting Fujimori's government may be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   David Scott Palmer, an expert on Peru at Boston University,
notes that half of the electorate supports Fujimori because of his
success in fighting leftist guerrillas and eliminating annual
inflation that exceeded 7,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We overlook the fact that he really does have a genuine base
of support. When you reduce extreme poverty by 50 percent in the
poorest districts of the country, that's serious stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said OAS members would have difficulty reaching a
consensus on imposing serious sanctions against Fujimori's
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it would come to that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> State increases aid for poorest school districts to $156 million  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Seventeen of the state's poorest school
districts would share $156.6 million in state aid for programs in
and out of the classroom -- nearly four times the amount doled out
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Education Commissioner David Hespe announced the
funding plan Friday, a day after the state Senate agreed to a $15
billion school construction package for many of the same
impoverished districts.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the state awarded $40 million in the supplemental aid
program.
</P>
<P>
   The increase comes because the state recognized the needs of
these districts, Hespe said.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a long-running legislative and court battle,
the state Supreme Court ruled that the state must fund education
programs for 30 of the state's poorest districts, known as Abbott
districts after the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost half of our formula aid will go to these districts so
they can fund at a level equal to the wealthiest districts in the
state,'' Hespe said. ''We recognize the need to fully implement the
court decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hespe admitted the aid package itself is not fully funded.
</P>
<P>
   The department only budgeted $104 million for the upcoming
fiscal year, and he must ask the Legislature to cover the more than
$52 million he said the schools deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Legislature definitely has the final say. They approved
last year's (aid), and we're hoping they'll approve this year's,''
Hespe said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for state Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco,
R-Union, said he was not available Friday afternoon. Calls to
Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, were not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the 30 Abbott districts applied for supplemental aid,
requesting more than $487 million in state funds. Hoboken and
Elizabeth were declared ineligible. Paterson withdrew its request.
</P>
<P>
   Hespe said the 10 districts that did not apply were able to
cover program needs in their school budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Newark, by far the largest district in the group, would get $60
million in the funding plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gloucester City, with $1.5 million, is listed with the lowest
amount.
</P>
<P>
   State education officials are still evaluating a proposal by
Elizabeth for aid to its early childhood education plan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overwhelming increase in proposed aid, the group
representing children in the Abbott districts criticized the state
funding plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they did ahead of time was decide what they wanted to
spend and back into it,'' said Steve Block, the director of school
reform initiatives for the Education Law Center. ''This continues
the state's failure to follow the court's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Education still lacks clear standards
and definitions to asses a district's needs, Block said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is insufficient guidance upfront to determine the
complete funding costs envisioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The increased aid will bring an increase in state supervision of
local financial practices, Hespe said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the current review of each district's full
budget, the commissioner said he plans to develop a review
targeting specific budget areas and management practices in the
districts.

Giuliani Drops Out of NY Senate Race
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Saying he agonized over the decision for days, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani dropped out of the Senate race today, abruptly halting an emerging
campaign against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Battling prostate cancer and
with his marriage in turmoil, Giuliani said it wasn't the right time for him to
run for office. Giuliani's departure from the race propels Rep. Rick Lazio, a
relatively unknown Long Island congressman, to the top of a list of Republicans
hoping to replace him in the battle for the Senate seat.

China, EU Reach Trade Deal

   BEIJING (AP) -- China and the European Union clinched a deal Friday to open
Chinese markets to European goods, clearing Beijing's biggest hurdle to joining
the World Trade Organization and increasing pressure on the U.S. Congress to
give China permanent trading rights. Tariffs on 150 items that Europe produces
-- from gin to shoes -- will fall an average of 40 percent and mobile telephone
companies will get quicker access to China's markets as part of the deal, once
China joins the WTO.

New Computer Virus Hits PCs
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The FBI launched a hunt today for the author of a new
computer virus that is sneakier and more destructive than the ''Love Bug'' that
infected millions of machines around the world two weeks ago. The new virus,
called ''NewLove,'' penetrated thousands of computers around the globe yesterday
and today, causing them to crash. But it didn't spread with the lightning speed
of the Love Bug because many companies employed safeguards that had been put in
place against the Love Bug. The two viruses are similar, and both spread via
e-mail, but NewLove changes subject lines every time it is sent.

NH Gov. Vetoes Death-Penalty Repeal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The governor vetoed a bill today that would have
repealed the death penalty, something no state has done since the U.S. Supreme
Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976. The veto by Gov. Jeanne Shaheen,
which was expected, came a day after the Senate passed the measure 14-10. The
Senate vote fell short of the 16 votes needed to override a veto. The 400-member
House approved the repeal in March 191-163, also well short of the two-thirds
necessary for an override. Shaheen said yesterday that while she respects the
views of death-penalty foes, some crimes warranted execution.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay's Democracy Tested Again  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- For the third time in four years,
Paraguay's fragile democracy was severely tested Friday, this time
by mutinous soldiers and police who fired at the legislative
building from armored personnel carriers before surrendering four
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday morning, the government was back in full control.
Soldiers toting automatic weapons took up checkpoints around the
capital and passers-by stopped to gawk at bullet holes in the
colonial-style legislative palace.
</P>
<P>
   President Luis Gonzalez Macchi, who took office last March after
another political crisis, went on national television Friday to
assure citizens that the ''antidemocratic'' forces believed to be
loyal to a former coup plotter had been defeated for good.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rest easy, countrymen!'' he said. ''Public order has been
restored. The destabilizing and antidemocratic forces have been
disbanded, the crisis brought under control and the mutineers
detained.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his government's response to the coup attempt would be
to accelerate economic and social reforms sought by many in this
landlocked South American nation struggling with high unemployment
and discontent.
</P>
<P>
   The Paraguayan Congress overwhelmingly endorsed a state of siege
declared by the president. The measure allows police expanded
powers to ensure domestic security.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, authorities said that at least 35 congressmen,
civilians and others had been detained, suspected of joining a
plot.
</P>
<P>
   One of those suspects, Benjamin Maciel of the ruling Colorado
Party, professed his innocence. ''I am clean. I didn't do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher
harshly condemned the aborted coup. He congratulated the Paraguayan
soldiers who ''recognized and acted on their responsibility to
defend democracy and constitutional order.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began when the soldiers barreled through the capital
late Thursday and headed to the palace.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff ended when soldiers surrendered at 2:45 a.m.
Friday, Col. Felix Dario Collante said. He refused to say how many
turned themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Walter Bower said the rebellious soldiers were
sympathetic to former army Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo, a fugitive
wanted in last year's assassination of Vice President Luis Argana --
a killing that brought Gonzalez Macchi to power. Oviedo was also
suspected in a brief mutiny in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the permanent council of the Organization of American
States ''vehemently condemned'' the coup attempt and expressed full
support for the Gonzalez Macchi's government.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution approved by the council called the attempt an
''assault on the democratic and constitutional order of Paraguay.''
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay's still wobbly democracy emerged from the defeat of the
35-year Stroessner dictatorship in 1989, but has been buffeted by
one political crisis after another in the intervening decade. The
latest upheaval was in March 1999, when Raul Cubas was ousted as
president and replaced by Gonzalez Macchi.
</P>
<P>
   Life appeared to return to normal Friday as shops and schools
opened and people went about their business. Hundreds of police,
their rifles slung from shoulders, guarded the building for hours,
but left the scene Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, helmeted soldiers with automatic weapons checked
identity papers at roadblocks on major highways leading from the
capital and to the international airport. One soldier stood atop an
armored personnel carrier at a major downtown intersection, another
behind a machine-gun mounted on the back of a jeep.
</P>
<P>
   Blocks away at the legislature, many Paraguayans expressed
skepticism that this would be the end to instability.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all worried. This may be over for now, but anything can
still happen in Paraguay,'' said Mario Isa, 20, who watched as a
truckload of soldiers in camouflage fatigues took posts on the
second-story balcony of the legislative palace.
</P>
<P>
   Two schoolgirls giggled as they passed the soldiers. But others
said they were anxious. ''The truth is, I was scared,'' said
Valeria Schussmuller, 21, who followed TV reports much of the
night. ''Here we are in 2000 and this is something out of the
1800s.''
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo has yet to complete a 10-year sentence for a brief
rebellion in April 1996 against former President Juan Carlos
Wasmosy, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo fled Paraguay after Cubas resigned and was granted
political asylum in Argentina, where he stayed before going into
hiding days before Argentine President Fernando de la Rua took
office Dec. 10. At last report, he claimed to be in a remote area
of Paraguay, making sporadic telephone calls to news media and
denouncing the government.

<HEADLINE> Greene Promoted to Majors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Todd Greene, released by the Anaheim Angels in
spring training, is back in the major leagues with the Toronto Blue
Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays purchased Greene's contract from Triple A Syracuse
on Friday. The outfielder hit .297 with seven home runs and 14 RBIs
with Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered the Angels' catcher of the future, Greene has
battled shoulder problems during the last few years. He says he can
no longer catch regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Greene hit .243 with 14 homers and 42 RBIs last season. He spent
eight years in the Angels' organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I hadn't hurt my shoulder I'd still be catching there,''
said Greene, who had a torn labrum. ''I can still catch, just not
everyday. I'm in the major leagues so I'll do whatever they ask me
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays also purchased the contract of RHP Darwin
Cubillan. To make room, Toronto optioned shortstop Chris Woodward
and designated left-hander Eric Gunderson for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   To clear a spot on the 40 man roster the Blue Jays designated
third baseman Casey Blake for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Cubillan was 3-0 with three saves and a .40 ERA for Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward appeared in just one game for Toronto. Gunderson was
0-1 with a 7.11 ERA for the Blue Jays.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Peace Conference May Go On  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A peace conference suspended by
President Andres Pastrana after a gruesome killing by alleged
guerrillas will now probably be allowed to take place, a government
peace negotiator said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Envoy Fabio Valencia said the government is inclined to believe
rebels' claims that they had nothing to do with the deaths Monday
of a 53-year-old woman and a policeman who tried to remove a bomb
from around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's largest rebel army, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, said Thursday it was being wrongly blamed for
the deaths in a botched extortion attempt in central Boyaca State.
</P>
<P>
   The killings angered the South American country and prompted
Pastrana to suspend a late-May conference in rebel-held southern
Colombia to which 21 countries were invited for discussions on
battling illegal drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana had said the suspension would be in effect pending the
results of an investigation into the ''necklace-bomb'' killings.
</P>
<P>
   But in his remarks Friday, Valencia said the government may
allow the peace conference to go forward even before prosecutors
complete their inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're in conversations, in principle you have to believe
the other side,'' the negotiator said.
</P>
<P>
   That Colombians immediately suspected the rebels in the killings
is hardly a surprise. The FARC regularly uses threats, violence and
kidnapping to extort money from fellow Colombians.
</P>
<P>
   The group has not been known, however, to attach sophisticated
bombs to its victims.

<HEADLINE> Church Court Considers Role of Gays  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Presbyterian Church's highest court heard
arguments Friday on whether individual churches should be bound by
the denomination's law prohibiting practicing homosexuals from
holding church office.
</P>
<P>
   ''A literal interpretation of this law threatens to destroy or
seriously damage a church,'' argued counsel Peter Oddleifson,
referring to Christ Church in Burlington, Vt., which voted to
reject the church rule. ''It's not just one church. Our entire
denomination is in agony over it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the rule against ordination of sexually active
homosexuals is not an essential tenet of the church and should be
treated only as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   But counsel Gordon Fish countered that church governing bodies
enter into a solemn contract with the church and are responsible
for assuring compliance with church rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''Allowing individual interpretations threatens the unity of the
church,'' he argued. The approach advocated by Oddleifson, he said,
would ''balkanize'' the church.
</P>
<P>
   No ruling was expected before next week. A decision by the
16-member commission is binding unless the General Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) overrides it.
</P>
<P>
   The Christ Church case stemmed from its refusal to comply with a
strict interpretation of a 1997 amendment to the Presbyterian
constitution forbidding active homosexuals from holding church
office. The 2.6-million member denomination's Northeast regional
court had directed church authorities to bring Christ Church into
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian high court also heard a case stemming from a
same-sex ceremony performed in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. The Northeast
regional church court ruled that ceremonies of ''holy union'' for
same-sex couples may be conducted if it is made clear they are not
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Counsel Sharon Davison told the high court that such holy unions
are not marriages, but rather moments of faithfulness and
friendship celebrated and recognized by the church.
</P>
<P>
   But Fish argued that church officials were engaging in
''semantic hair-splitting.'' Same-sex couples didn't talk about
being ''holy unioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on language, he said, church officials ignored the
larger issue: scriptural prohibitions against same-sex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast commission also was challenged on a decision
involving a homosexual candidate for the ordained ministry who said
he did not intend to remain celibate, even though church rules
require clergy to observe either ''fidelity in marriage'' or
''chastity in singleness.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the commission decided that he could continue as a
candidate, and that his ''manner of life'' could be evaluated prior
to ordination.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexual issues will surface again when the General Assembly
of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) meets in Long Beach, Calif.,
from June 24 to July 1. Among legislation to be considered: a
proposal to ban same-sex marriage.

<HEADLINE> College Umps Work Pirates Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Three college umpires were recruited to work
the first three innings of the St. Louis Cardinals-Pittsburgh
Pirates game Friday night when the major league crew was delayed by
weather in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   College umpires Leo Lowder, Keith Urich and Rick Locaitis from
the Pittsburgh area worked the bases, with major league umpire Dan
Iassogna behind home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Iassogna, a relief umpire, was already in town to work part of
the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates received permission from the commissioner's office
to recruit the college umpires when it became clear that major
league umpires Ed Montague, Anthony Randazzo, Ted Barrett and Jerry
Layne would not arrive in time to start the game at 7:05 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived in the top of the fourth, with Montague at first
base, Randazzo at second and Barrett at third.
</P>
<P>
   That crew worked the Arizona-Montreal game Thursday, but was
delayed by weather in Toronto for much of the day Friday while en
route to Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The college umpires regularly work Duquesne and University of
Pittsburgh games.

<HEADLINE> Orioles-Rangers Game Postponed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Friday night's game between the Texas
Rangers and Baltimore Orioles was postponed due to heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   The game will be made up as part of a twi-night doubleheader on
Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has won four straight and seven of nine, moving over .500
(21-10) for the first time since April 15 (6-5).
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hot so we look forward to getting out there every day,''
Rangers outfielder Jason McDonald said. ''Hopefully, this rain will
let up and we'll be able to play tomorrow. But at the same time, a
lot of the guys who play regularly need a day off, so this will
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had played 17 games without a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could say that the off-day will help keep us on the streak
by giving us some rest,'' outfielder Chad Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas manager Johnny Oates said his team could benefit from the
rainout by giving two hot-hitting Rangers an extra day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanotto, batting .576 (19-for-33) with 10 hits in his
last 12 at bats, had been removed from Texas' lineup on Friday
night due to a recurring groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   And designated hitter David Segui, who began Friday fifth in the
league with a .351 average, had dizzy spells prior to the game.
Segui has had the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing you can do about it so why worry?'' Oates
said. ''The only headache is playing extra games in September. But
you can't control the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's Rangers starter, Esteban Loaiza, was rescheduled
to pitch Saturday night against the Orioles. Darren Oliver,
Saturday night's scheduled Rangers starter, will pitch Sunday night
instead of Mark Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Clark could start Tuesday night in Kansas City if Kenny Rogers
isn't ready. Rogers has been slowed by a strained posterior capsule
in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's scheduled starter, Jason Johnson, will be skipped in
the rotation, moving to a long relief role. Mike Mussina will make
his scheduled start for the Orioles on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're used to pitching every five days, so this keeps them
lined up,'' Orioles manager Mike Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he has no problem with being skipped.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fine with it as long as I get some innings (out of the
bullpen),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore has lost 13 of 15 and is 6-18 since April 22.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Texas sent OF Gabe Kapler to Triple-A Oklahoma on medical
rehab assignment. Kapler was placed on the 15-day disabled list on
May 4 with a partially torn muscle in his upper right quadriceps.

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A fire caused by a construction accident
destroyed a $30 million luxury apartment complex and a post office

   The fire hit hard at what was to be one of the gems in the
redevelopment of the old cigar-making section of Tampa, east of
downtown.The Park at Ybor City, a 454-unit development, was
scheduled to open at the end of the year.

   The fire also came at a time when the city was on edge from a
string of arson fires in parts of Ybor City and neighboring Tampa
Heights.

   Five firefighters and a postal worker were injured, although
none seriously.

People Work Harder, More Often To Pay for Basics: Report
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- We're pinched for time, money and fun, and it
might not get any better.
</P>
<P>
   People have to work harder and more to pay for the basics and
maintain a quality of life similar to their parents' generation,
says a report released today by the Vanier Institute of the Family,
a non-partisan national research organization based in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Most families, on average, needed to work a year and a half to
cover annual living expenses, says the report, based mainly on the
most recent figures from the 1996 census.
</P>
<P>
   That means either both parents must work or one put in about 65
to 80 hours a week for food, clothing, shelter, education and
recreation, said Alan Mirabelli, executive director of the
institute.
</P>
<P>
   If you lived in Toronto or Vancouver, two incomes were an
absolute necessity, suggests the report. If you lived in Kelowna,
British Columbia, or Sudbury, Ontario, one and half salaries might
get the average family by. And in Atlantic Canada, one salary and a
bit should have done the trick.
</P>
<P>
   The average family income for Canada in 1997 was $55,628, the
report says, citing Statistics Canada. Among the provinces, the
average ranged from a high of $61,110 in Ontario to a low of
$40,630 in Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   The time parents have to work to keep a family going wasn't a
surprise to Judith Maxwell, president of the Canadian Policy
Research Networks Inc., an independent, non-profit think-tank.
</P>
<P>
   She says overwork, combined with the inevitable hurrying of
children off to child care, school and other activities, causes
parents a tremendous amount of stress and worry and could affect
children later in life.

Historic Meeting Between Catholics, Anglicans
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSAUGA, Ontario (AP) -- A historic meeting between the Roman
Catholic and Anglican churches closed Friday with the creation of a
commission to study how to unite the two churches after a 466-year
rift.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is considered the first formal step toward
official harmony between the churches, although no one would
speculate Friday when Anglicans and Catholics might become one.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long it might be before the world's one billion
Catholics and 100 million Anglicans would worship in a single
church, Most Rev. George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, said
cryptically: ''How long is a piece of string?''
</P>
<P>
   This week, 26 Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops from 13
countries spent five days at the Queen of Apostles Renewal Center
poring over 35 years of ecumenical dialogue between the churches in
an effort to pinpoint exactly what it is that still keeps the
churches apart.
</P>
<P>
   Before unification, the churches would have to agree on the
ordination of women.

Federal Database Skirts Moral Questions: Privacy Watchdog
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The federal government appears to be missing the
point of serious concerns about its massive databank tracking the
lives of Canadians, the privacy commissioner suggested Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Human Resources Minister Jane Stewart and her officials said
this week that the database, holding up to 2,000 details about each
of 33.7 million Canadians, is a research tool that's secure and
legal.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the point, says commissioner Bruce Phillips, who
revealed the existence of the database Tuesday and publicized his
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who's been talking with Human Resources about the
issue for two years with no resolution, says the very existence of
the comprehensive, permanent database is ''inherently
problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt the database is legal, but it may ''not reflect
the spirit of the Privacy Act, the principles of the Privacy Act or
the objective of the Privacy Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is uncomfortable the database was created before its
research uses were spelled out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Secondly, there is absolutely no element of consent anywhere
in the database ... No effort has been made to obtain personal
consent.''

Family of Woman Shot by RCMP Questions Role of Police, Native
Leaders
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- It's troubling RCMP were allowed to
investigate the fatal shooting of an aboriginal woman by one of
their own officers, says the victim's family.
</P>
<P>
   And native leaders should share some of the blame for conditions
that led to the shooting of Connie Jacobs and her nine-year-old son
Ty, said Jacobs' sister Christina Applegarth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found it disturbing the RCMP would have been allowed to
investigate these matters when it was their officers and indirectly
a force they controlled -- the tribal police -- that were directly
involved in the events,'' Applegarth said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In hindsight, there may be nothing that another police force
might have found, but it would have been one less crucial factor to
speculate about.''
</P>
<P>
   Applegarth made scathing remarks Friday about the way police and
aboriginal leaders dealt with the shooting on a reserve near
Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Goodson released his final report Thursday from a
year-long, million-dollar inquiry into the deaths. The two were
killed by RCMP Const. Dave Voller on March 22, 1998, on the Tsuu
T'ina reserve just west of Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Voller exchanged gunfire with Jacobs, 37, after a child
apprehension went wrong. Ty was standing behind his mother and was
hit by the shotgun blast. Voller has been cleared of any
wrongdoing.

Judge Hands Three-year Term to Man Convicted in BioChem Bomb Case
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- A three-year prison term was handed Friday to a
man convicted of planting bombs at BioChem Pharm. Inc. buildings in
a failed bid to manipulate the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Thresh, 25, was found guilty on one stock-fraud charge
and two explosives charges. Justice Jean-Guy Boilard issued the
sentence after a guilty verdict by a Quebec Superior Court jury.
</P>
<P>
   Thresh's wife, Carole Perron, 30, who is more than eight months
pregnant, was acquitted on one stock-fraud charge.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution argued the couple cooked up the clumsy bomb plot
hoping to drive down the price of BioChem's stock and then benefit
from it on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs weren't prepared properly, the court was told. Nobody
was injured, but the buildings were damaged when the bombs went off
in Montreal and nearby Laval on Nov. 25, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The North American stock exchanges halted trading in BioChem
stock immediately after the bombings, and the price stayed steady
when trading resumed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Two former Ku Klux Klansmen charged with
murder in the 1963 church bombing that killed four black girls made
in initial appearance in court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Blanton Jr., 61, of Birmingham, and Bobby Frank
Cherry, 69, of Mabank, Texas, appeared in Jefferson County District
Court before District Judge Pete Johnson. They had turned
themselves in Wednesday after being charged.
</P>
<P>
   Both were shackled and handcuffed as they were brought into
court amid heavy security. A second hearing was set for June 30.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by Johnson whether he understood the charges against
him, Cherry said: ''Yes, but I didn't know anything about the
bombing until it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanton and Cherry were each charged with eight counts of murder
-- two counts covering each of the four girls slain in 16th Street
Baptist Church on a Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   One count was for intentional murder and the other involved
''universal malice'' because the bomb was placed where it could
have killed any number of people.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton and Cherry are being held without bail.

Giuliani Drops Out of NY Senate Race
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Putting his health first, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dropped out
of the Senate race today, abruptly halting an emerging campaign against first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Battling prostate cancer and with his marriage in
turmoil, Giuliani said it wasn't the right time for him to run for office.
Giuliani's departure from the race propels Rep. Rick Lazio, a relatively unknown
Long Island congressman, to the top of a list of Republicans hoping to replace
him in the battle for the Senate seat.

   ZRON, Eritrea (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Eritrean civilians fled advancing

Eritrea, a country of 4 million people in the Horn of Africa, was hovering on
the edge of a humanitarian tragedy: The more than half million people escaping
fighting in western Eritrea added to a drought crisis that already threatened
300,000 others.

police who fired at the legislative building from armored personnel carriers
before surrendering four hours later. By this morning, the government was back
in full control. Soldiers toting automatic weapons took up checkpoints around
the capital and passers-by stopped to gawk at bullet holes in the colonial-style
legislative palace. President Luis Gonzalez Macchi went on national television
today to assure citizens that the ''antidemocratic'' forces believed to be loyal

New Computer Virus Hits PCs

infected millions of machines around the world two weeks ago. The new virus,
called ''NewLove,'' penetrated thousands of computers around the globe yesterday
and today, causing them to crash. But it didn't spread with the lightning speed
of the Love Bug because many companies employed safeguards that had been put in
place against the Love Bug. The two viruses are similar, and both spread via
e-mail, but NewLove changes subject lines every time it is sent.

Church Court Considers Role of Gays
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Presbyterian Church's highest court heard arguments
today on whether individual churches should be bound by the denomination's law
prohibiting practicing homosexuals from holding church office. ''A literal
interpretation of this law threatens to destroy or seriously damage a church,''
argued counsel Peter Oddleifson, referring to Christ Church in Burlington, Vt.,
which voted to reject the church rule. He said the rule against ordination of
sexually active homosexuals is not an essential tenet of the church and should
be treated only as a guide. No ruling was expected before next week.

30 percent of all fake ID documents in this country, according to some law

to enable users to steal people's identities, get loans or convince enemies

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in Drug Plot  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A house painter who helped an Army colonel's
wife smuggle drugs from Colombia was sentenced Friday to a longer
prison term than she was -- despite blaming her for orchestrating
the widely publicized plot.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Edward Korman sentenced the admitted middleman, Hernan
Arcila to five years, three months in prison. Two weeks ago, Korman
gave Laurie Hiett -- wife of the former commander of U.S. anti-drug
operations in Colombia -- a five-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Both defendants had faced to up to nine years in prison after
pleading guilty to conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities accused Hiett of shipping $700,000 in cocaine and
heroin to Arcila's home. She and Arcila, 51, were arrested after
authorities intercepted two packages of heroin mailed from a post
office at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to ask for forgiveness for the mistake I made,'' said
Arcila, who had no previous criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The case has embarrassed Army officials and ruined the military
career of Col. James Hiett, accused of helping his wife launder
$25,000 in illicit profits.
</P>
<P>
   Arcila's attorney, Telesforo Del Valle, had argued that his
client was recruited by -- and took orders from -- Mrs. Hiett and his
friend Jorge Ayala, a civilian driver for U.S. military commanders
in Colombia. Ayala was arrested earlier this year in Colombia,
where he is fighting extradition.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Colombia who has lived in the United States for
almost 30 years, Arcila had ''a minor role compared to that of
Laurie Hiett, who was able to use her position at the embassy ...
to orchestrate the whole conspiracy,'' the lawyer told Korman.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Dunst argued Arcila was a key
participant in the crime: ''Without him, it wouldn't have been
successful.''

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Meets With Rebel Leader  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Malaysia's ambassador held a jungle
meeting with a leader of Islamic rebels who have held 21 Western
and Asian hostages for nearly a month, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Manzoor Hussein Arshad met with an Abu Sayyaf rebel commander on
Thursday near the site where the captives are being held on the
southern Philippine island of Mindanao, two former rebels who
escorted him said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place on a forested mountainside where the
hostages are held, as hundreds of armed men stood guard, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign governments were also considering independent
efforts to free the hostages out of growing frustration over the
slow start of negotiations, a government official said. The
hostages themselves have urged their governments and international
organizations to step in.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf snatched three Germans, two French, two Finns,
two South Africans, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos
on April 23 from Malaysia's Sipadan Island and took them to Jolo,
about an hour away by boat.
</P>
<P>
   But security considerations for formal talks, delayed by clashes
between the rebels and troops and by frequent changes in the
government negotiating team, have been a sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're preparing the ground for the meeting, which will take
place tomorrow or the next day,'' Libyan envoy Abdul Rajab
Azzarouq, one of the negotiators, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with the Abu Sayyaf, the smaller and more extreme of the
two Muslim separatist groups, could take days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people have been displaced by rising violence
in Mindanao since last month, when the army attacked a 10-mile
stretch of highway held for five years by the larger rebel group,
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. The MILF pulled out of peace
talks, and said Friday it is considering the government's offer to
return to the table on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is also holding about eight Filipino hostages on
the nearby island of Basilan.

<HEADLINE> Republicans grapple with Giuliani-less campaign  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- With Mayor Rudolph Giuliani out, New York
Republicans were left Friday searching for a new giant killer to
take on Hillary Rodham Clinton in the state's U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Most attention focused on Rep. Rick Lazio, a little-known Long
Island politician who quickly picked up the endorsement of Gov.
George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CNN's ''Larry King Live,'' Pataki said New York
Republicans had plenty of qualified potential replacement
candidates, but ''clearly the best would be Rick Lazio.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Friday that he was ready to back Lazio, if he was
the GOP choice. Just minutes after the mayor pulled out of the
race, Lazio announced in Washington that he was jumping in.
</P>
<P>
   One veteran New York pollster said Giuliani's departure from the
race had to be good news for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''All things being equal, I don't think she should be doing
cartwheels, but maybe a few handstands,'' said Lee Miringoff, head
of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Miringoff said Giuliani's departure would give the first lady a
good shot at picking up suburban, Jewish and independent voters who
had been leaning toward Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Other independent pollsters disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as he (Lazio) catches up to her in name recognition,
he catches up to her,'' predicted John Zogby. ''I think very soon,
you're going to see them tied.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you can say it's all over and she's going down
to Washington as the senator,'' said Maurice Carroll, director of
the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown Pataki -- who already killed one Democratic
political giant, three-termer Mario Cuomo, in the 1994 governor's
race -- as the strongest potential Giuliani alternative.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki said again Friday that he wouldn't enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not running. I've said that for months,'' he said. ''I
appreciate people being encouraging, but I'm not going to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Republicans were convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's Pataki's for the asking,'' said Nelson Warfield, a New
Yorker who served as Bob Dole's presidential campaign press
secretary in 1996. ''I think he will ponder asking.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Pataki has passed the word to other GOP leaders
that he wants Lazio to become the candidate. The word seemed to
have gotten around.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican Party is going to coalesce around him in about
3.2 seconds,'' said Kieran Mahoney, a veteran New York political
operative who counts Pataki among his clients. ''Everybody I've
talked to is for Lazio, and I've talked to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, also a Long Island Republican, said Friday that
he would seek the nomination, but conceded that if Pataki ''decides
to anoint Rick,'' the race would be over.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are facing a fast-approaching deadline. The party's
nominating convention is May 30 in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   While Miringoff and others said Giuliani's departure would boost
Clinton, Republicans scoffed at that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rudy Giuliani's departure paves the way for Hillary Clinton's
defeat,'' Warfield said, citing the mayor's high negatives in most
polls. ''Without the Rudy haters, Hillary Clinton's vote-base is
much weaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the races changes and becomes about Hillary again and
that's the strongest asset we've ever had,'' Warfield added.
</P>
<P>
   And while Lazio is relatively unknown at the moment, Mahoney
said that should not be a handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a guy named George Pataki who wasn't that well known
in 1994,'' the veteran GOP operative recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Both Warfield and Mahoney said raising money should not be a
major problem for whoever runs against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Giuliani proved there was a tremendous amount of anti-Hillary
money out there nationally that will come flooding in to whoever
the Republican nominee is,'' Warfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be a fully-funded race,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, head
of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, pledged.
</P>
<P>
   ''In one sense, it's a more difficult race for Hillary Clinton
than it was before, because now it's all about her, and that always
works to her disadvantage,'' McConnell added.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage Lazio may have is that he has strong ties to the
state's Conservative Party. No Republican running for statewide
office in New York has won since 1974 without Conservative Party
support. Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long had refused to
back Giuliani because of the mayor's support for abortion rights
and his closeness Liberal Party boss Raymond Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Long said Friday that he wasn't going to jump immediately behind
Lazio and that the congressman would have to ''win the endorsement
of the party's leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Rudy caused me this problem for 14 months,'' Long said. ''You
think I'm going to solve it in 14 hours?''

   The injured children -- two 5-year-old girls and an 11-year-old
girl -- were airlifted by helicopter to Children's Hospital in
Washington, Montgomery County Police spokesman Derek Baliles said.
One 5-year-old girl was listed in critical condition and the other
two girls were in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the hospital's trauma unit said their prognosis was
''excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   The other 33 young children who had been traveling home from
school on the bus were transported to another hospital, checked for
minor injuries and reunited with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Baliles said the driver of the farm truck, William Thornton
Patton Jr., 30, of Silver Spring, Md., lost control of the vehicle.
The trailer separated from the truck and crashed into the front of
the school bus, authorities said. Patton was taken to a hospital
with minor injuries, including a broken rib.
</P>
<P>
   The school bus driver, Andre King, 33, of Laurel, Md., was
pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Derwood is near Rockville, about 20 miles north of downtown
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Supporters Predict China Trade Win  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders and Clinton
administration trade allies seized on a new pact between Europe and
China on Friday to predict a House victory next week on the China
trade bill. Under pressure from fellow Democrats, President Clinton
canceled his plan to pitch the deal on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., chairman of the House Rules
Committee, and other supporters claimed new momentum, citing both
the China-European Union agreement and a bipartisan
leadership-backed side plan for a watchdog commission to monitor
human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be able to have the votes necessary for a strong
victory,'' Dreier said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on a fund-raising trip to Philadelphia and Chicago,
abruptly canceled a five-minute, televised Oval Office address on
behalf of the legislation that he had scheduled for Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton decided to abandon the speech after talking with House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and other congressional Democrats
during his flight to Chicago, said White House spokeswoman Jennifer
Palmieri.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been talking with them for the past couple of days about
what's the most productive way to get votes on this,'' Palmieri
said. ''They've advised us that they don't think that the Oval
Office address is the most productive way to get votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, D-Mo., an opponent of the legislation, had been asked
by some in his party to deliver a televised response to Clinton's
address. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said some of the members who had urged Clinton to make
the speech changed their minds Friday, saying they felt the address
would raise the stakes for the legislation and ''make it more
divisive and high profile than it needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC and CBS had said they would not carry the address. ABC said
the network had already covered both sides of the issue on its news
programs, and CBS said the speech amounted to lobbying. NBC, CNN
and FOX had said they would carry it.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said the vote remains close and predicted a weekend
of hard lobbying. The bill is supported by the business community
and opposed by labor, environmental and some veterans' groups.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would establish permanent normal trade relations with
China, scrapping 20 years of annual reviews. It would also enable
American companies to benefit fully from a market-opening deal
reached by the United States and China last November.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claimed new converts, although supporters appeared to
have won more.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Dreier announced that his committee --
which sets ground rules for floor debate -- will meet Tuesday,
followed by House debate Wednesday and a vote either late Wednesday
or on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The side legislation, by Reps. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and Doug
Bereuter, R-Neb., would set up a legislative and executive branch
commission to monitor human rights in China and establish a
mechanism for protecting U.S. companies from surges in Chinese
imports.
</P>
<P>
   Dreier said he hoped everything could be handled in one package,
with a single vote. However, such an approach could bring
difficulties in the Senate, where leaders want to keep the trade
bill and the side legislation separate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, where passage of the China trade bill seems assured,
was waiting for the House to act first.
</P>
<P>
   Five formerly undecided House members -- Democrats John LaFalce
of New York, Thomas Sawyer of Ohio and Diana DeGette of Colorado;
and Republican Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas -- announced their
support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Closing the door on China will not improve human rights in
China. It would be a step back,'' DeGette said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., announced his support,
saying he believed that ''in the long run, engagement will foster
democracy and significantly improved living standards in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., told reporters he was still officially
undecided but ''leaning to yes.'' Earlier, Rep. Chet Edwards,
D-Texas, announced he was switching from undecided to ''yes'' and
Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., indicated he was likely to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents claimed three new converts to the ''no'' column: Reps.
Robert Andrews, D-N.J.; Rod R. Blagojevich, D-Ill.; and Karen
McCarthy, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., a leading opponent,
told reporters, ''As bad as our trade deficit with China is today,
it will grow even worse if we approve a permanent trade deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents need about 70-75 Democratic votes, and Rep. Robert
Matsui, D-Calif., the top Democratic head counter, said ''we're
well on our way'' to that range.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters welcomed the news that the 15-member European Union
had finished negotiating a market-opening pact with China on
Friday, removing the last obstacle to China's long-sought entry in
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., said it ''is further evidence that we
need to pass this agreement ... We know that if we don't pass this,
that the Europeans will take advantage of reduced tariffs and added
access to the Chinese markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade concessions that China gives to any one country to gain
entry to the WTO must be extended to all other WTO members. But for
the U.S. to gain such benefits, Congress must grant China permanent
normal trade relations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> O'Donnell Wins Daytime Emmy Award  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell won her fourth straight Daytime
Emmy Award as best talk show host on Friday, saying she felt a
little like a spoiled child for winning again.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell has won the award every year she was nominated.
Longtime winner Oprah Winfrey no longer competes in the category.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wow,'' O'Donnell deadpanned, minus the tears she displayed
while winning in the past. ''I feel sort of like the spoiled kid
who gets this too many times.''
</P>
<P>
   The late Shari Lewis won the award for best performer in a
children's series. Her daughter accepted the award with her
mother's puppet, Lamb Chop.
</P>
<P>
   Shemar Moore of ''The Young and the Restless,'' who won his
first Emmy as best supporting actor, brought a cell phone to the
stage to make a call.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mom, I won this damn thing,'' he said when she finally
answered. Sarah Brown of ''General Hospital'' won the best
supporting actress award, letting out a scream in delight.
</P>
<P>
   The 27th annual Daytime Emmy Awards were given out during a
ceremony at New York's Radio City Music Hall, televised on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   It was Regis Philbin's last chance to win a best talk show Emmy
as Kathie Lee Gifford's partner. Gifford announced that she is
quitting their talk show this summer. No replacement has been
named.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin had seven previous nominations without a win. But he was
a strong favorite for his first Emmy award in the category of game
show host for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Millionaire,'' the program that has transformed prime-time
television during its nine months on the air, was shunted off to
the Daytime Emmy awards because the prime-time show had no category
where it would fit.
</P>
<P>
   That decision aggravated ABC, the show's producer and Philbin,
who called it ''silly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emmys gave a lifetime achievement award to ABC's Barbara
Walters, the pioneering interviewer who created and starred in
daytime television's, ''The View.''
</P>
<P>
   The soap opera ''The Young and the Restless'' earned 28
nominations, more than twice its closest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The awards show was deprived of its own long-running serial when
hard-luck soap star Susan Lucci won her first Emmy last year after
18 losses. Lucci wasn't nominated as best actress in a daytime
drama this year. She was the show's co-host, with O'Donnell.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 3, Tigers 0  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Carl Everett and Mike Stanley homered Friday night
and Jeff Fassero pitched seven shutout innings to lead the Boston
Red Sox to a 3-0 victory over the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero (5-1) gave up four hits and two walks and struck out
eight to give Boston its 10th win in 12 games. Rich Garces retired
the side in order in the eighth and Derek Lowe pitched the ninth
for his ninth save.
</P>
<P>
   Everett hit a long fly ball in the fourth inning that got held
up in a 17 mph wind, and right fielder Juan Gonzalez calmly stood
at the bullpen wall and waited for it to come down.
</P>
<P>
   But in the sixth, neither the wind nor Gonzalez could keep
Everett's two-run shot in the park as it sailed into the
right-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moehler (1-2) took the loss despite allowing just one
earned run on seven hits in six-plus innings. He struck out three
and walked one in his first appearance since going on the disabled
list for an appendectomy on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Sadler led off the sixth with a ground ball that third
baseman Dean Palmer threw into the Boston dugout for a two-base
error. Two outs later, Everett hit his 13th homer of the year over
Gonzalez and into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley led off the seventh with his seventh homer to make it
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The game was not without its highlights for the Tigers. Left
fielder Shane Halter threw out Brian Daubach trying to go from
first to third on a single, and second baseman Jose Macias caught
Sadler going from second to third on a ground ball in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Fassero has walked three batters in his last four starts
after walking 12 in his first three. ... The Tigers will make up a
May 9 postponed game against Kansas City as part of a split,
day-night doubleheader on July 22, the team announced Friday. The
game is scheduled for 1:05 p.m. The originally scheduled game
against the Royals that day has been moved from a 5:05 p.m. start
to a 7:05 p.m. start. The team also announced that Thursday night's
postponed game against Cleveland will be rescheduled for 1:05 p.m.
on June 24, as part of a split day-night doubleheader in Cleveland.
... When the Tigers activated Moehler from the 15-day disabled
list, they put Mark Johnson on the DL with a strained lower back.
... Detroit also optioned Masao Kida to Triple-A Toledo and called
up Brandon Villafuerte. ... Boston 3B John Valentin was in the
lineup for the first time since he was put on the 15-day disabled
list effective April 6 with left knee tendinitis. INF Andy Sheets
was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 13, Cardinals 1  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jason Kendall became the first Pittsburgh
Pirates player to hit for the cycle in Three Rivers Stadium and
Kris Benson pitched a three-hitter in a 13-1 victory Friday night
over the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   One night after Mark McGwire hit three homers and drove in seven
runs in Philadelphia, he went 0-for-3 with a strikeout as Benson
held the Cardinals without an extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall had a two-run homer in the first, an RBI single in the
second, a double in the third and a two-run triple in the eighth.
He is the first Pirates player to hit for the cycle in Three Rivers
Stadium's 30-year history and the first to do so anywhere since
Gary Redus at Cincinnati on Aug. 25, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The five RBIs are Kendall's career high.
</P>
<P>
   Benson (4-4) seemingly got stronger as he went along, striking
out a career-high 11 -- all from the third inning on -- while
allowing one hit over the final six innings. He pitched eight
shutout innings, allowing four hits, in beating Milwaukee 3-0 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Since starting 0-3, Benson has allowed only nine earned runs
while winning four of six starts, lowering his ERA from 5.96 to
3.02.
</P>
<P>
   The expected pitching matchup between St. Louis rookie Rick
Ankiel (3-2) and Benson never materialized as Ankiel gave up seven
runs in 2 2-3 innings in the shortest of his eight starts in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel, whose .192 opponents batting average was the second
lowest among NL starters entering the game, has lost his two starts
to the Pirates by a combined score of 23-8.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young also homered as the Pirates, only 17-30 against
left-handed starters last season, improved to 7-7 against them this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates jumped on Ankiel so quickly they had an 8-1 lead by
the time the major league umpires arrived in the fourth inning. The
crew was delayed in Toronto by weather and was replaced by one
major league replacement umpire, Dan Iassogna, and three college
umpires.
</P>
<P>
   The first four Pirates batters reached base against Ankiel, with
Mike Benjamin leading off the first with a single ahead of
Kendall's second homer, a shot down the right-field line on a 3-2
pitch. Kendall, who moved from third to second in the order earlier
this week, has nine hits in his last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Aven walked ahead of Brian Giles' RBI single, and Pat
Meares added a run-scoring single later in the inning. Giles was
2-for-5 in his first game since signing a contract extension worth
at least $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who also had a single, helped himself by walking and
scoring on Kendall's single in the second, and the Pirates chased
Ankiel with another four-run inning in the third. They added a
third four-run inning in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, 14-for-32 against left-handers this season, had a
two-run double ahead of Kendall's double and Bruce Aven's two-run
single in the third. Young added his sixth homer, in the fourth off
Darren Holmes.
</P>
<P>
Notes: McGwire batted third for the first time this season. He hit
cleanup in his first 30 starts. ... McGwire had homered in 11 of
his previous 22 games. ... Pirates OF Wil Cordero missed his fourth
successive game after returning to his Puerto Rico home to testify
in a child custody case. ... Cardinals 2B Fernando Vina left after
being struck by a Benson pitch in the fifth. ... McGwire was lifted
in the seventh.

<HEADLINE> Maradona Back on Soccer Field  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Diego Maradona, briefly, was back on a soccer
field, scoring goals.
</P>
<P>
   With little defense and no goalkeeper to contend with, it wasn't
much of a test of Maradona's skills. But the former superstar did
tally four times in a friendly, half-hour game Friday night against
University of Havana soccer players.
</P>
<P>
   Maradona didn't even bother to lace up his cleats for the match
in Havana's Marianao neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly overweight and sweating heavily in a jersey from
Argentine club Boca Juniors, Maradona played with five teammates,
including his manager, Guillermo Coppola. They won 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Maradona arrived in Cuba in January to be treated for a heart
condition and the cocaine use that caused it.
</P>
<P>
   His Cuban doctors have said he is fit enough to play in an
exhibition game in honor of German soccer great Lothar Matthaeus in
Munich next Friday. But they insist Maradona must return to Cuba
immediately after that game to continue his rehabilitation.

<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Frank Thomas hit a three-run homer to key a
five-run third inning as the Chicago White Sox beat the Toronto
Blue Jays 5-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sirotka allowed just two runs on seven hits in seven
innings for the White Sox. Sirotka (3-3) struck out four and walked
two.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Foulke pitched 1 2-3 innings for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays had the bases loaded with two outs in the eighth,
but Foulke struck out pinch-hitter Darrin Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvim Escobar (4-5) allowed five runs, five hits, struck out
nine and walked three in seven innings. Four of the five hits
Escobar allowed came in the five-run third.
</P>
<P>
   After Carlos Lee led off with a double, Mark Johnson walked and
Ray Durham hit a two-run double. Escobar then walked Jose Valentin,
before Thomas homered to left-center to make it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista had an RBI groundout in the sixth for Toronto to
make it 5-1. Homer Bush added a run-scoring groundout in the
seventh, and Carlos Delgado's RBI single in the eighth completed
the scoring for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sirotka is 3-0 lifetime at SkyDome. ... Todd Greene,
released by the Anaheim Angels in spring training, is back in the
major leagues with Toronto. The Blue Jays purchased Greene's
contract from Triple-A Syracuse on Friday. The outfielder hit .297
with seven home runs and 14 RBIs with Syracuse. ... The Blue Jays
also purchased the contract of RHP Darwin Cubillan. To make room,
Toronto optioned SS Chris Woodward and designated LHP Eric
Gunderson for assignment. ... Attendance was 18,268. ... Escobar
was perfect in four of his first five innings. ... Foulke has
pitched 18 scoreless innings in his last 11 outings.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The show that transformed prime-time television,
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' won a Daytime Emmy award on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The game show was shunted off to the Daytime Emmy awards when
the prime-time show declared it had no category it could compete

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Residents Return Home  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Residents of burned-out neighborhoods
returned to their homes Friday for the first time in nine days,
hoping to salvage something from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what was destroyed, there's always a tiny something
that survives,'' said Judi DeHaven, who lost her home of 23 years.
''Whatever it is, a picture frame, a memento, it can help us out a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The wildfire that roared across this mesa-top community
destroyed more than 200 dwellings and left 405 families homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were slowly gaining an upper hand on the
47,500-acre fire, helped by lower temperatures and favorable winds.
By nightfall, it was more than 80 percent contained, with total
containment predicted for late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And Los Alamos slowly was coming back to life. Bandelier
National Monument, where the fire was set May 4 to clear out
underbrush, was expected to reopen Saturday. Los Alamos National
Laboratory was expected to partially reopen Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the northwest side of town, Irma Sutphin combed through the
ashes with a three-tined gardening tool while her mother, Alicia
Lopez, used a metal mop as a rake.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at my stuff,'' Lopez lamented as she pulled ceramic
figurines and melted jewelry from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The mementos were all that remained from the house she has lived
in since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my childhood home,'' Sutphin said as she tried to
gauge where some belongings might have ended up after the flames
went out.
</P>
<P>
   Not much remained.
</P>
<P>
   Sutphin's son, Stan, 14, was excited when he found his computer,
but then realized it was a toaster.
</P>
<P>
   Across the city's devastated neighborhoods, insurance adjusters
have spent the past several days writing checks to customers to
cover temporary housing, clothing and other necessities.

   On the western side of Los Alamos, Willard Hemsing, whose house
also was destroyed, wondered where he, his wife and four children
were going to live. Then neighbor Inez Ross offered her two-bedroom
home, which escaped unscathed, to the Hemsings. They gladly
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Ross says she'll spend time in Michigan with her sister while
the Hemsing's house is rebuilt, probably six months. Ross is a
retired English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's working out for the best. This is the way I can help,''
Ross said. ''What's amazing is that my house is OK, and I was
wondering why my house survived while theirs burned, and I think
it's a message from God saying we're supposed to help.''

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Elections Problematic  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENEZUELA, Caracas (AP) -- An election monitor expressed concern
Friday that computer glitches could create problems during this
month's national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Perina, the head of the Organization of American States
observation team in Venezuela, said his group is concerned about
election officials' apparent inability to correct the malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   Two afternoon newspapers in Caracas ran banner headlines Friday
saying it would be impossible to hold the vote on May 28 as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, we are concerned that there are serious technical
problems,'' said Perina, the head of the OAS team sent to monitor
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Perina met with the National Election Council to
discuss the campaign and some of the computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far, from what we have seen, we believe the problems are
fixable but we won't know for certain until next week,'' Perina
told The Associated Press. He said OAS technicians are assisting
the council as part of the team's monitoring role.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans head to the polls this month to elect a president,
congressmen, governors, mayors and local councils because of a new
constitution pushed through by President Hugo Chavez last year that
requires more than 6,000 public offices to be ''re-legitimized''
through new balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The technical difficulties could have widespread implications
for the vote since they could delay the printing of ballots and the
preparation of software to tabulate votes.
</P>
<P>
   Election authorities blame the problems on the huge number of
candidates -- more than 36,000 -- running for state and local
offices.

<HEADLINE> Mets 4, Diamondbacks 3  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bobby J. Jones earned his first victory in more
than a year and the New York Mets posted consecutive wins for the
first time this month, using Mike Piazza's home run to beat the
Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets stayed ahead in the seventh inning when a quick relay
from left fielder Jon Nunnally to shortstop Rey Ordonez to Piazza
cut down Tony Womack at the plate. Womack tried to score from first
on Jay Bell's two-out double.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza erased a 3-2 deficit with his two-run homer in the fifth
off Todd Stottlemyre (7-2). Piazza later protected the lead by
catching Ordonez's one-hop throw and lunging to tag out the speedy
Womack.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had not won two in a row since April 29-30 at Colorado.
Arizona stole a team-record seven bases, yet lost for the fourth
time in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Jones (1-1), in his eighth season with the Mets, recorded his
first win in the majors since April 17, 1999. He missed most of
last year because of an injured right shoulder and had a calf
problem last month.
</P>
<P>
   Activated from the disabled list Thursday, he was rained out of
a start against Colorado. Instead, he faced Arizona and allowed
three runs and six hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Turk Wendell, working on his 33rd birthday, John
Franco and Armando Benitez each finished with a scoreless inning.
Lenny Harris singled in the ninth and stole second and third, but
Benitez struck out Womack to end it for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who had won four straight starts, was trying to
become the majors' first eight-game winner. He helped himself,
hitting a two-run single in the second and then doubling and
scoring in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre struck out eight, including Piazza in his first two
at-bats. In the fifth, Derek Bell singled with one out and Piazza
connected with two outs for his 11th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Piazza was injured and unable to play when the
Mets eliminated Arizona in Game 4 of the NL division series. His
replacement, Todd Pratt, hit the winning home run in the 10th
inning at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Johnson, making his first start for the Mets, had an RBI
grounder in the fourth and Rey Ordonez followed with a run-scoring
single that made it 2-all. Ordonez had been 0-for-19 with two outs
and runners in scoring position this year.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Womack extended his hitting streak to 15 games, one short
of his career high set in 1998 in Pittsburgh. Teammate Steve Finley
had his hitting string end at 13 games. ... Stottlemyre turns 35
Saturday. ... Johnson played left field for the first time since
1996 with Pittsburgh. He got an assist for a throw that led to
trapping Stottlemyre. ... Jay Payton grounded out, making him
hitless in his last 20 at-bats for the Mets.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 5, Marlins 3  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Adrian Beltre hit a two-out, two-run double in the
eighth inning as the Los Angeles Dodgers won for the fifth time in
six games, beating the Florida Marlins 5-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored three runs in the eighth, spoiling another
solid outing by Vladimir Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez pitched seven innings, allowing five hits and two runs.
But the bullpen couldn't hold the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Braden Looper, replacing Nunez to start the eighth, gave up
doubles to Gary Sheffield and Beltre. He also walked Shawn Green
and surrendered an RBI single to Chad Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges (2-0) pitched a scoreless seventh, Terry Adams
pitched a scoreless eighth and Jeff Shaw allowed two hits in the
ninth before earning his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez, meanwhile, got his third consecutive no-decision, all
coming in strong starts.
</P>
<P>
   He held the Dodgers scoreless through four innings before giving
up a pair of runs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Chan Ho Park looped a single into center field,
and with two outs, Mark Grudzielanek tripled over Preston Wilson's
head in center. Wilson slipped as he trotted toward the line drive
and couldn't get up in time to make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield then singled home Grudzielanek, giving Los Angeles a
2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millar got the only hit off Park through the first five
innings. He hit a home run, his fourth of the season, to left field
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins, who have lost four of their last five, started to
get to Park in the sixth. Mark Kotsay tripled over the head of Todd
Hollandsworth, scoring Luis Castillo from first and tying the game.
Kotsay scored on a passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   Park allowed three hits and three runs in six innings. He walked
four and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Castillo was caught stealing in the third inning, breaking
the Marlins' streak of 15 straight stolen bases. It also broke
Castillo's personal streak of 14 straight. ... Wilson struck out
once to give him a major league-high 60. ... The announced crowd of
16,467 was the smallest the Dodgers have played in front of since
their season-opening trip to Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Gov. Signs Four Gun Bills  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN K. PAULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Gov. Bill Owens signed four gun bills Friday,
saying that while the new laws might not have prevented the
Columbine High School shootings, they could have allowed for more
charges to be filed.
</P>
<P>
   The new laws:
</P>
<P>
   -- Make it a felony for a person to purchase or obtain a firearm
for another person who reasonably should know the transaction is
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bar a person from giving a firearm to any juvenile without the
consent of the parent or legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make it illegal for a person not to make reasonable efforts to
prevent a juvenile from committing a crime with a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   -- Increase the penalty for possession of a weapon by a felon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think today is a reflection of Columbine. While I didn't get
all I wanted, this is a substantial improvement,'' the Republican
governor said, acknowledging that the new laws were the product of
compromises between gun control supporters and opponents.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Ken Gordon, D-Denver, issued a statement
saying the bills ''do not address the core problem of access to
guns by felons and juveniles.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These bills are small steps in the right direction, but in no
way make up for the Republican majority killing meaningful
legislation that would close the gun-show loophole, require safe
storage of guns in the home, or stop 18-year-olds from buying a
handgun at a gun show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mauser, whose son, Daniel, was killed in the rampage, said:
''I think clearly they're more punitive than they are preventative.
They're not bad laws, but they aren't as effective as they should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Attending Friday's signing ceremony was state Rep. Don Lee, a
Republican from Littleton, whose son, Shawn, was in the high
school's cafeteria when gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold began
their rampage. Harris and Klebold killed 13 people and wounded 23
others inside the school on April 20, 1999 before taking their own
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Lee helped draft the bill that would require parental consent
for providing a firearm to a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill is one that came directly out of Columbine. This
would not have prevented what happened at Columbine, but it would
have had a consequence for the participants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing law, two men in the Columbine case were charged
with providing a handgun to minors, as Harris and Klebold were 17
when they got the guns.
</P>
<P>
   But Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said Klebold's
girlfriend, Robyn Anderson, who admitted supplying a rifle and two
shotguns to the youths, escaped arrest because the law then didn't
make it illegal to provide long guns to minors.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Gunmen Kill Family of 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Gunmen firing assault rifles killed 11
adult members of a single family in Nicaragua and then burned their
home, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Thursday near the town of Siuna, about 200 miles
northeast of Managua, came a day after three soldiers were killed
in an ambush in the same general area, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The lone survivor of the attack, Guadalupe Montenegro, was once
a member of a group of former Sandinista soldiers suspected of
numerous attacks in the area, national police said.
</P>
<P>
   The group of ex-Sandinista soldiers was one of several groups of
former combatants that formed to demand government aid in the
aftermath of Nicaragua's Contra war in the 1980s. The group
officially disarmed in 1997 under an agreement with the government,
but police say some members kept their weapons and turned to crime.
</P>
<P>
   The dead, some of whom were badly burned, included seven women
and four men. Authorities said they all were members of the same
family, but did not specify the exact relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, nearly a dozen assailants attacked a military
truck in the region, killing an army captain and two soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's attacks bring the number of assaults to four in the
past two months in the country's Atlantic coast region. Last month,
gunmen ambushed a police vehicle, killing five people.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, a government representative escaped injury
when soldiers shielded him from gunmen.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Friday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Yankees-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Manager Joe Torre must have done a double take when
the four umpires for Friday's game came out on the field wearing
Cleveland windbreakers and caps. The crew's equipment didn't arrive
from Seattle by game time, delaying the start for five minutes. ...
INF Clay Bellinger, who had made four consecutive starts at
shortstop with Derek Jeter out, was only cleared to play after
going through pregame warmups without difficulty. Bellinger was
struck in the left shoulder by a pitch on Tuesday night before
Friday was unable to lift his arm above his head. ... With their
three-game sweep here earlier this month, the Yankees entered
Friday night's game 24-9 (.727) at Jacobs Field. New York has won
14 of the last 18 games against Cleveland and is 54-27 against the
Indians since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Thursday's postponed game against Detroit will be
made up as part of a day-night doubleheader against the Tigers on
June 24 at 1:05 p.m. The second game will start at 7:05 p.m. ...
RHP Charles Nagy had successful arthroscopic surgery to remove bone
chips from his right elbow Friday at Lutheran Hospital. Nagy had
made 192 consecutive starts since Oct. 3, 1993, before being placed
on the 15-day disabled list on Thursday. Nagy is expected to be
sidelined 6-to-8 weeks. ... Indians manager Charlie Manuel said LHP
Ricardo Rincon was going to visit famed surgeons Dr. Frank Jobe and
Dr. James Andrews before having surgery on his left elbow. Rincon,
the Indians' most consistent reliever this season, went on the DL
Thursday with bone spurs. ... RHP Paul Rigdon was recalled from
Triple-A Buffalo and will make his major league debut when he
starts on Sunday against the Yankees. Rigdon was 4-1 with a 3.07
ERA in seven starts for the Bisons.
White Sox-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The White Sox won five of their six games at SkyDome
last season, batting .335 and outscoring the Blue Jays 40-23. ...
The White Sox are in the midst of a 38-game stretch where they play
22 games against the New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays purchased the contracts of RHP Darwin
Cubillan and OF-DH Todd Greene from Triple A Syracuse. To make
room, Toronto optioned SS Chris Woodward and designated LHP Eric
Gunderson for assignment. In order to clear a spot on the 40 man
roster the Blue Jays designated minor league 3B Casey Blake for
assignment. ... Greene, released by Anaheim in spring training, hit
.297 with seven home runs and 14 RBIs for Syracuse. ... RHP Pete
Munro will make his first start of the season on Monday. Munro
replaced LHP Lance Painter, who returned to the bullpen.
Tigers-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: OF Luis Polonia began serving a three-game suspension
for last month's brawl against the Chicago White Sox after his
appeal was rejected by the commissioner's office. OF Juan
Encarnacion's suspension also was upheld; he will begin serving on
May 27. Paul Beeston, the chief operating officer of the
commissioner's office, reduced C Robert Fick's suspension from five
games to four, and it will begin Tuesday. ... The Tigers activated
RHP Brian Moehler from the 15-day disabled list and put RHP Mark
Johnson on the DL with a strained lower back. Detroit also optioned
RHP Masao Kida to Triple-A Toledo and called up RHP Brandon
Villafuerte. Moehler, recovering from an April 22 appendectomy,
started Friday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: 3B John Valentin was back in the lineup for the first
time since he was put on the 15-day disabled list, effective April
6, with left knee tendinitis. INF Andy Sheets was optioned to
Triple-A Pawtucket. ... The Red Sox presented legislators with a
plan for a new $627 million Fenway Park. The team is asking
taxpayers to pitch in $275 million to buy the land and build a
parking garage.
Orioles-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Before Friday night, the Orioles had given up 29
homers in May, allowing at least one home run in 14 of 16 games
during the month. ... Baltimore's bullpen entered Friday night with
an 8.59 ERA in May and had six blown saves. ... Before Friday,
Orioles opponents had scored four or more runs in an inning 20
times this season, including one seven-run inning, six six-run
innings and four five-run innings.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Rangers owner Tom Hicks was released from a hospital in
Sante Fe, N.M., on Friday after being treated for dehydration.
Hicks felt faint at a business meeting Thursday night and was
hospitalized as a precautionary measure. Hicks also owns the Dallas
Stars, and he attended the Stars' playoff game in Denver against
the Colorado Avalanche on Friday night. Hicks said he was
dehydrated after taking a steam bath and did not drink enough
fluids to compensate. ... Frank Catalanotto's streak of 10 straight
hits, which was halted Thursday night, is the longest in the major
leagues since Kansas City's Joe Randa had 10 consecutive hits last
June 8-12. Catalanotto's streak of reaching base 12 straight times
also was stopped Thursday night. It tied Jim Edmonds of the St.
Louis Cardinals for the longest in the majors this season.
Catalanotto had 10 hits and two walks; Edmonds had nine hits and
three walks.
Twins-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA:Travis Miller went a season-long 2 1-3 innings in
relief but was lifted with one out to go, leaving him short of his
second save of the year. Twins manager Tom Kelly wasn't taking any
chances after Miller gave up a pair of singles in the ninth. After
all, the Twins bullpen has blown six saves in 12 chances. So closer
Bob Wells came on to finish Minnesota's 10-5 win at Oakland on
Thursday night even though it wasn't a save situation. ...
Minnesota pitchers did not walk a batter against Oakland during
Thursday's 10-5 win over the A's. Oakland entered the game leading
the majors in walks with 219. Twins pitchers have allowed the third
fewest walks in the AL with 133.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Left-handed reliver Mike Magnante is listed as
day-to-day after spraining his left ankle while delivering a pitch
Thursday night. ''Basically, the team told me it was up to me if I
could pitch,'' Magnante said. ''I plan on being available unless it
balloons up on me.'' Rich Sauveur is the only other lefty in the
A's bullpen. ... Kevin Appier had his shortest outing of the season
and failed to get through the sixth inning for the second straight
outing when he went just three innings Thursday night against
Minnesota. He allowed five runs and had a no decision. Appier had
gone at least six innings in four of his first five starts but
since returning from the disabled list for a strained right
forearm, he's given up 10 runs, five earned, in 8 2-3 innings
pitched.
Devil Rays-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: RHP Billy Taylor was recalled from Triple-A Durham
and RHP Jeff Sparks was optioned to the International League team.
At Durham, Taylor was 1-0 with a 4.29 ERA with 21 innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: OF Rickey Henderson, signed as a free agent Wednesday
night after being released by the New York Mets, arrived at Safeco
Field an hour before the game with Tampa Bay and was activated. RHP
Kevin Hodges was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma to make room for
Henderson. With Seattle, Hodges was 0-0 with a 4.26 ERA in three
games and 6 1-3 innings, all in relief.
Royals-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals, who led the AL with 48 steals heading
into Friday night's game against the Angels, have had just five

   CINCINNATI: When Ken Griffey Jr., played at Wrigley Field in
1990, he was just 20 and became the second youngest player -- behind
Al Kaline -- to start an All-Star game. ... The Reds were more than
six hours late arriving in Chicago because of bad weather. Their
charter flight from Cincinnati on Thursday was delayed 3{ hours by
poor weather and once they took off, conditions were so lousy they
had to divert to Milwaukee and then take a 90-mile bus ride,
arriving at their hotel around midnight. ... Asked how his team's
chemistry is, Reds manager Jack McKeon had this reply: ''To this
day I don't know what chemistry is. I didn't take it in high
school.'' ... The Reds have won four straight series and 8 of their
last 10.

   CHICAGO: Manager Don Baylor had no problem with Sammy Sosa's
display of anger after his star shattered a clubhouse table with
his bat Wednesday. Baylor called a release of emotions from the
Cubs' miserable start. ''I'm still waiting for mine,'' Baylor said.
Baylor recalled a tantrum he had during his playing days with the
Angels when he was smashing a bat in the runway to the dugout and
he nearly hit a teammate. ''I missed him,'' Baylor said. The
teammate's name? Nolan Ryan. ... The Chicago Tribune reported that
the Cubs are talking with the Yankees about trading LF Henry
Rodriguez to New York for OF Ricky Ledee and a pitching prospect
for their moribund bullpen. General manager Ed Lynch refused
comment. Gene Michael, the Yankees' top scout, was at Wrigley on
Friday. Rodriguez is out of the Cubs' lineup, nursing a bruised
knee after fouling a ball off it. Also attending Friday's game was
Dan Evans, who is an assistant to White Sox's general manager Ron
Schueler.

Cincinnati Reds and in the National League until this season.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: LHP Trever Miller has been claimed on waivers from
the Phillies by the Los Angeles Dodgers. To take his spot on the

Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Miller was 0-0 with an 8.36 ERA in 14
appearances this season. Schrenk had started the season with the
Phillies before being optioned to Scranton on May 4. He is 1-1 with
a 6.30 ERA in eight appearances. ... Eight of the Phillies' nine
opponents this season have been above .500.
Dodgers-Marlins:

<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers didn't arrive in South Florida until 2
a.m. EDT. They spent almost three hours waiting for Thursday's game
to be called for rain in Chicago. It took them an hour and a half
to get to the airport, then they spent another six hours on the
plane -- four on the runway and two in the air. They were not
allowed to take off until the bad weather cleared. The Padres,
waiting in Miami for the same plane to take them to Atlanta, didn't
get off the ground until about 3 a.m. ... The Dodgers claimed LHP
Trever Miller off waivers from Philadelphia on Friday. ... Before
the game, bullpen coach Rick Dempsey was in the stands, talking to
some friends when OF Shawn Green joked, ''Hey Demper, we're not
supposed to be in the stands.'' Green, of course, was referring to
the Dodgers' fight Tuesday at Wrigley Field.

Padres-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: 2B Bret Boone and 1B Ryan Klesko returned to Atlanta

in his pitching shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim will purchase the contract of right-hander Brett

Belcher from the 15-day to the 60-day DL.
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Stoneman said the moves will be

</P>
<P>
   Dickson went on the 15-day DL April 29 with a strained left hip

<HEADLINE> Padres 11, Braves 7  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Phil Nevin hit his first grand slam and drove in
a career-high six runs, powering the San Diego Padres to an 11-7
victory over Atlanta and ending the Braves' six-game winning streak
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone added a three-run homer in his return to Atlanta as
the Padres scored four runs in the first inning, fell behind 5-4 in
the third and put the game out of reach with Nevin's homer in the
seventh against Kevin McGlinchy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin also had an RBI single in the first and broke a 5-5 tie in
the fifth with a run-scoring grounder to third. He broke his
3-day-old career mark for RBIs in a game, having driven in five
runs Tuesday against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, limited to 16 games because of injuries, went
3-for-3 to raise his average from .196 to .241 before leaving with
a sore knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, coming off sweeps of Philadelphia and San Francisco,
lost for only the fifth time in 22 games at Turner Field despite 15
hits, including two homers by Andruw Jones. Chipper Jones and Brian
Jordan also homered.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had a horrible game defensively, giving up two runs in
the fifth after Terry Mulholland made an ill-advised throw to
second, leaving the bases loaded. Two batters later, third baseman
Chipper Jones went to second when he had a chance for an out at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland (3-4) left in the seventh after bobbling a bunt along
the third-base line, an error that left the bases loaded with no
outs and the Padres clinging to a 6-5 lead. The Braves brought in
the right-handed McGlinchy to face the right-handed Nevin, but the
strategy backfired when he hit a 3-2 pitch over the wall in
right-center for his 11th homer of the season. The second error of
the inning, by first baseman Andres Galarraga, gave the Padres
another run.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland allowed nine hits and eight earned runs in six-plus
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Boone, returning to Turner Field for the first time since being
dealt by the Braves in an offseason trade, came up in the opening
inning with two runners on and the Padres already ahead 1-0. He
struck a blow against his former team by hitting a two-out homer to
right-center.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves quickly overcame the four-run deficit. Chipper Jones
hit his 10th homer in the first, a two-run shot, and Andruw Jones
had a two-run drive the next inning. Jordan put the Braves ahead
with his seventh homer, a solo liner in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta followed Jordan's homer with two more hits, knocking out
starter Brian Meadows. But Matt Whiteside (1-0) escaped a
bases-loaded, no-out jam to keep the Braves' lead at 5-4 and wound
up earning the win.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman got the last out in the ninth for his seventh
save in eight opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres got a scare in the third when Gwynn went down near
second base as he was about to get caught in a rundown. He remained
on the ground for a few seconds, clutching his troublesome left
knee, before limping to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was able to remain in the game and added his third hit in
the fifth, a bloop single to center that tied the score at 5. He
then was replaced by pinch-runner Kory Dehaan.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones hit his second homer of the game and 12th of the
season in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Braves lost leadoff hitter Quilvio Veras in the first.
He was struck on the right knee by a pitch from Meadows and hobbled
off with a contusion, his status is day to day. ... Atlanta's four
homers were a season high. ... The Padres didn't allow a stolen
base after giving up a team-record 10 to Florida on Thursday with
Wiki Gonzalez behind the plate. Carlos Hernandez caught Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The tall ship Moshulu, with lights strung
along the ropes to its mast, has commanded the waterfront at Pier
34 and symbolized the rebirth of nightlife along the Delaware River
waterfront for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Moshulu, once the world's largest squarerigger, was docked
off Penn's Landing on the eastern edge of Philadelphia from 1975 to
1989, until it was damaged by fire. It then docked in Camden, N.J.,
until developer Eli Karetny and his HMS Ventures bought the ship in
1994 and opened it two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Karetny, who released a statement Friday saying he was
cooperating with investigators, also opened Eli's Pier 34 seafood
restaurant in 1992 at the same pier where the Heat was. In 1994,
part of that pier collapsed but was later repaired. No injuries
were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The 394-foot-long Moshulu was launched in 1904 in Hamburg,
Germany, under the name Kurt. It was in Astoria, Ore., when the
United States entered World War I, confiscated the ship and gave
renamed it Moshulu, which means ''Fear Not'' in the language of the
Seneca tribe of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, the Moshulu was in service in the grain trade and
won a 1939 race among the grain carriers for the fastest time from
Australia and around Cape Horn to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, now permanently tied at Pier 34, is decorated in
Victorian style and the restaurant's menu reflects the lands it
once visited.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 11, Indians 7  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Ricky Ledee and Paul O'Neill hit two-run
homers, Bernie Williams had a three-run double and the New York
Yankees outlasted the Cleveland Indians 11-7 on a frigid Friday
night when only the weather made it feel like October.
</P>
<P>
   Two of baseball's best teams combined for 18 runs, 23 hits,
three errors, 15 walks and 16 strikeouts in a 3-hour, 45-minute
game played with the temperature in the mid-40s and the wind chill
dipping below 30.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch reached base four times and was in the middle of
three rallies for New York, which won its second straight following
a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez hit a three-run homer and Richie Sexson had a solo
shot for the Indians. Cleveland, which placed two starters and a
reliever on the disabled list Thursday, needed a strong outing from
Dave Burba but got a dud instead.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which placed shortstop Derek Jeter on the 15-day DL
before the game, scored five runs in the fourth, three in the fifth
off Scott Kamieniecki (1-2) and two more in the sixth to pull away
after the Indians tied it 6-6 with a four-run fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who swept a three-game series here at the beginning
of the month, are 11-3 against the Indians the past two years and
25-9 at Jacobs Field since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza (4-2), making his first relief appearance since
April 7, pitched 2 2-3 innings to improve to 6-0 in his career
against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Omar Vizquel struck out in three straight at-bats,
stranding two runners each time.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch followed a double by rookie Alfonso Soriano with RBI
single to snap a 6-6 tie in the fifth. O'Neill's two-out, two-run
shot made it 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians got a run back on Roberto Alomar's RBI single in the
bottom of the inning, but Ledee connected for his second homer in
the sixth to give the Yankees an 11-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson homered leading off the fourth and Ramirez's three-run
shot in the inning tied it 6-6 against Andy Pettitte, who worked
out of a bases-loaded jam in the third by getting Sandy Alomar to
hit into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   After Sexson connected for his fourth homer, the Indians put
runners at first and second with none out before Pettitte struck
out Vizquel and Travis Fryman.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramirez came through, crushing a 2-1 pitch 428 feet for his
12th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte allowed four hits and three earned runs in four
innings. He walked five -- four in a row to force in a run in the
third -- and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   Burba's wildness set up New York's five-run fourth when the
Yankees took a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With two on and two outs, Burba couldn't get a 3-2 pitch past
Knoblauch, who fouled off three full-count pitches in a row during
a 10-pitch at-bat before walking.
</P>
<P>
   Williams then doubled to left, scoring three. O'Neill followed
with an RBI single and Tino Martinez's pop to left fell for a
run-scoring hit to make it 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Burba gave up six runs and seven hits in a season-low 3 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Soriano, activated for the game, was robbed of a hit with
the bases loaded in the second on center fielder Jolbert Cabrera's
diving catch. ... Both of Ledee's homers have come against the
Indians. ... The umpires wore Indians' pullover jackets and caps
when their equipment didn't arrive from Seattle. ... Indians
reliever Mark Watson made his big league debut in the seventh. The
lefty struck out the side in the eighth. ... And just what
Cleveland needed, another injured pitcher. RHP Paul Shuey has
swelling in his right hip and was unavailable for Friday's game. He
is day-to-day, but manager Charlie Manuel said he didn't expect
Shuey to go on the DL.

<HEADLINE> Activist Leader in Vieques Detained  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A leader of anti-Navy activists on
the island of Vieques was detained for allegedly trying to prevent
a military convoy from leaving the Navy base.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rabin, of the group Coordinator of Justice and Peace for
Vieques, was detained Thursday night by Puerto Rican police outside
the Navy's Camp Garcia, said Agent Ricardo Ayala of the Vieques
police force. Activists want the Navy to end its bombing exercises
on the island of 9,300 people.
</P>
<P>
   But Angel de Leon, a spokesman for the group, said Rabin was in
his vehicle, which had stalled in the middle of the road, and was
not trying to block the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, federal agents detained 216 people, including Rabin,
and cleared them from the bombing range and other Navy land on the
island of Vieques. Some had been camping on the range since an
April 1999 accident in which a civilian guard was killed by two
off-target bombs.

<HEADLINE> Sather Resigns As Oilers' Boss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Glen Sather, the architect of the
Edmonton Oilers' five Stanley Cup championship teams from 1984-90,
resigned Friday night as president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't wish this franchise any bad luck,'' Sather said during
a news conference at Skyreach Centre. ''It's the first time since
I've been 16 years old that I've been unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This hasn't been a quick decision, but it's something that I
had to do. I never contemplated leaving this organization. I
thought I'd retire here. But things change.''
</P>
<P>
   Sather, 56, who joined the Oilers as a player in 1976 and became
general in 1979, has reportedly been targeted by the New York
Rangers and Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no job offer on the table,'' said Sather, who was
under contract at $2 million annually for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder in 1997, Sather
has not been happy with the team's ownership group in recent
months. He has had problems with Cal Nichols, chairman of the
Edmonton Investors Group that took over the team in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a clashing of strong personalities,'' Sather said. ''If
this is a mistake, then I'll live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Muckler, the head coach for Edmonton's fifth Stanley Cup in
1990, spent more than a decade working with Sather.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you think of the Oilers, you think of Glen Sather,''
Muckler told the Edmonton Sun. ''He's done so many great things for
that franchise and for that community.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I never, ever thought this day would come. Mind you, I never
thought, back in the '80s, that anybody would leave, myself
included.''
</P>
<P>
   Oilers captain Doug Weight wasn't surprised by Sather's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the rope was getting shorter over the last couple of
seasons,'' Weight said. ''I think if this happened two years ago I
would have been very surprised. ... It's going to be really strange
going back to Edmonton and not have Glen there.''
</P>
<P>
   A Rangers spokesman said the team would have no comment. Sather
said earlier that he was given by the Oilers to talk with the
Rangers.

Giuliani Drops Out of NY Senate Race
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rep. Rick Lazio became the favorite to replace Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in the New York senate race, after Giuliani ended his campaign today
against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Battling prostate cancer and with his
marriage in turmoil, Giuliani said it wasn't the right time for him to run for
office. Giuliani's departure from the race propels Lazio, a relatively unknown
Long Island congressman, to the top of a list of Republicans hoping to replace
him.

''With sincerity, I swear to the people of this country that I will follow the

Eritrea, a country of 4 million people in the Horn of Africa, was hovering on
the edge of a humanitarian tragedy: The more than half million people escaping

Friday. The attack on Thursday near the town of Siuna, about 200 miles northeast

a trial that captivated this gambling community with tales of love, drug

controversy in accepting the award. Rosie O'Donnell won her fourth straight Emmy
as best talk show host. She's won the award every year she was nominated.

<HEADLINE> Motorcycle Gang Target of Raid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Federal agents across the nation raided
the homes of members of a motorcycle gang Friday, arresting more
than two dozen people and confiscating firearms, drugs and
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Mongols were arrested in Pasadena, San Diego,
Porterville and Frazier Park, as well as cities in Georgia and
Oklahoma, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The case was cracked after an ATF agent infiltrated the
motorcycle gang and spent two years as a member.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our undercover agent put himself at great and prolonged peril
to develop evidence of murder, weapons and narcotics violations and
other serious crimes,'' said ATF Los Angeles Division Director
Donald R. Kincaid.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF said at least 29 Mongols were arrested in connection
with violent crimes, including murder. Seventy firearms, 10 pounds
of narcotics, 21 stolen motorcycles and more than $27,000 cash were
seized.
</P>
<P>
   The Mongols were formed in the early 1970s in Southern
California. Officers say the organization has about 200 members and
21 chapters nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Regis Philbin Shut Out at Emmys  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe it isn't a perfect year for Regis Philbin
after all: He was shut out of Daytime Emmy Awards Friday for his
talk show and as host of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Barker of ''The Price is Right'' and Tom Bergeron of
''Hollywood Squares'' were the surprise winners of the best game
show host award.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't feel bad, Regis,'' Bergeron said. ''(Disney chief
Michael) Eisner's buying you the Statue of Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' won the Daytime Emmy for best
game show. Even though it has transformed prime-time television
since its debut nine months ago, it was shunted off to the Daytime
Emmy awards when the prime-time awards show declared it had no
category it could compete in.
</P>
<P>
   The decision annoyed ABC, producer Michael Davies and Philbin.
But Davies, wearing red plaid pants, ignored the controversy in
accepting the award.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regis Philbin, you are a god,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell won her fourth straight Emmy as best talk show
host. She's won the award every year she was nominated. Longtime
winner Oprah Winfrey no longer competes in the category.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' also won its third award as best
talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wow,'' O'Donnell deadpanned, minus the tears she displayed
while winning in the past. ''I feel sort of like the spoiled kid
who gets this too many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Geary, Luke Spencer on ''General Hospital,'' won as best
actor in a daytime drama for the second year in a row. It was his
third win overall.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran actress Susan Flannery, who plays Stephanie Forrester in
''The Bold &AMP; The Beautiful,'' was honored as best actress.
</P>
<P>
   ''General Hospital'' was named best soap opera for the seventh
time, the most ever in this category.
</P>
<P>
   The late Shari Lewis won the award for best performer in a
children's series. Her daughter accepted the award with her
mother's puppet, Lamb Chop.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sesame Street'' won the award for best pre-school children's
series for the sixth straight time, the only show to win since the
category was established.
</P>
<P>
   Shemar Moore of ''The Young and the Restless,'' who won his
first Emmy as best supporting actor, brought a cell phone to the
stage to make a call.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mom, I won this damn thing,'' he said when she finally
answered. Sarah Brown of ''General Hospital'' won the best
supporting actress award, letting out a scream in delight.
</P>
<P>
   The 27th annual Daytime Emmy Awards were given out during a
ceremony at New York's Radio City Music Hall, televised on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   It was Philbin's last chance to win a best talk show Emmy as
Kathie Lee Gifford's partner. Gifford announced that she is
quitting their talk show this summer. No replacement has been
named.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin had seven previous nominations without a win.
</P>
<P>
   The Emmys gave a lifetime achievement award to ABC's Barbara
Walters, the pioneering interviewer who created and starred in
daytime television's, ''The View.''
</P>
<P>
   The soap opera ''The Young and the Restless'' earned 28
nominations, more than twice its closest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The awards show was deprived of its own long-running serial when
hard-luck soap star Susan Lucci won her first Emmy last year after
18 losses. Lucci wasn't nominated as best actress in a daytime
drama this year. She was the show's co-host, with O'Donnell.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Street absent during aftermath of pier collapse  </HEADLINE>
With AM-NJ--Pier Collapse Bjt
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mayor John Street was no where to be found
Friday as media gathered at the site of a collapsed pier on
Delaware Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Street was in South Carolina, attending the medical school
graduation of his nephew, said his spokeswoman, Barbara Grant. The
mayor had assessed the situation and decided not to come back
immediately, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In his place, the mayor's Chief of Staff, Stephanie
Franklin-Suber, took center stage, fielding questions from media
Thursday night and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mayor Street may be out of town, but he has been in constant,
consistent communication,'' Franklin-Suber said later Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Street issued a statement requesting that all the piers along
the Delaware River be inspected. The nearly two dozen piers were
OK'd by city inspectors late Friday, Franklin-Suber said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal, of course, will be to ensure that nothing of this
nature ever occurs again along our waterfront or anywhere else in
the city,'' Street said.

<HEADLINE> Expos 3, Astros 2, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Jose Vidro singled home the winning run with one
out in the 10th inning Friday night, leading the Montreal Expos
over the Houston Astros Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, 0-10 in one-run games this season, is the only team in
the majors without a one-run win.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal had lost its previous seven home games that went extra
innings since beating Los Angeles 5-4 in 10 innings on Aug. 4,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Wilton Guerrero singled off Joe Slusarski (0-1)
leading off the 10th, Peter Bergeron sacrificed and up came Vidro,
who earlier homered for the second straight game. He singled to
center as Guerrero slid home well ahead of the throw.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal won in its last at-bat for the sixth time this season
and has won five of seven overall.
</P>
<P>
   Rondell White's eighth-inning homer off Jose Cabrera gave
Montreal a 2-1 lead, but Mitch Meluskey tied it in the ninth with a
home run off Dustin Hermanson (5-3), who has blown two of four save
chances since taking over the closer's role from Ugueth Urbina, who
had a bone chip removed from his right elbow Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro homered off Octavio Dotel in the first, but Meluskey's
sacrifice fly tied it in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Tony Armas, making his second start of the season,
allowed one run, four hits and six walks in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel allowed one run and three hits in seven innings, striking
out eight.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Third base umpire Jerry Crawford missed the beginning of
the game due to travel problems. He arrived midway through the
third inning. ... Dotel has allowed nine home runs. ... The Astros
will return to Milwaukee on Monday to play a doubleheader beginning
at 1:05 p.m. EDT, after the last two games of their three-game
series were rained out. ... Houston has had four rainouts this
season, including their season opener in Pittsburgh on Apr. 3 and a
rare rainout in Los Angeles on Apr. 17. ... The Astros are playing
their first game on artificial turf since their season-opening
three-game set in Pittsburgh Apr. 4-6. ... The Expos signed
free-agent LHP Jim Poole to a major league contract Friday. Poole
was released by Detroit on Wednesday after going 1-0 with one save
and a 7.27 ERA in 18 games this season. He is expected to join the
team on Saturday. ... Expos C Chris Widger has a deep bone bruise
on his left hand and will be rested for the first two games of the
series. Lenny Webster made his fifth start of the season and went
1-for-4. ... Vidro's error was his first since last Sept. 24,
breaking a streak of 44 consecutive errorless games. ... Vladimir
Guerrero has 12 intentional walks, the most in the majors.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 106, 76ers 90  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Reggie Miller took his frustration out on
the Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, returning from a one-game suspension, scored 25 points
to lead the Indiana Pacers to a series-ending 106-90 victory over
the 76ers in Game 6 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The playoffs is when I'm at my best,'' said Miller, suspended
for retaliating against the 76ers' Matt Geiger in Game 4. ''To not
be a part of that (in Game 5), especially when your team is up 3-1,
it kept bothering me all week. The more upset I got, the more I
wanted to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia was trying to become the first NBA team to win a
best-of-seven series after falling behind 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana advanced to the Eastern Conference finals for the third
straight season and the fifth time in seven years, but is still
seeking its first trip to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are we celebrating for?'' Miller said. ''We've been here
four, five times. We have nothing to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose added 21 points for Pacers, who will play the winner
of the Miami-New York series.
</P>
<P>
   Miller took over in the third quarter. He capped an 8-1 run by
converting a backdoor alley-oop for his first basket since the
first quarter and a 74-63 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Miller nailed a jumper then hit a wide-open 3-pointer to make it
83-69 with 31 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Best made a pair of free throws as Indiana took its
biggest lead to that point, 85-69, after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   After the 76ers cut it to 90-79 midway through the fourth,
Miller iced the game with another 3-pointer to make it 93-79. He
turned and stared at the 76ers' bench following the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't say anything,'' Miller said. ''Looks say a thousand
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia didn't get any closer than 14 the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told Mark (Jackson) after Game 5 that I was going to shoot
as much as possible,'' Miller said. ''Sometimes, if you want
something done right, you have to do it yourself. I wanted to get
going quickly because if my teammates saw me do that, they were
going to jump on my back.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was stopped for about three minutes with 2:36 left in
the game after a fan threw a bottle of water on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't get as ugly as Game 3 when several fans threw
debris on the court, including a full can of beer that nearly hit
Philadelphia's George Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fans need to check themselves,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought about the fans' derisive chants the entire
series, Miller said, ''I thought they were saying, 'Reggie
rocks.'''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron McKie led the 76ers with 19 points, and Allen Iverson had
18. Rik Smits added 18 for Indiana and Jackson had 12 points and 11
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really moved the ball extremely well, especially in the
beginning,'' Indiana coach Larry Bird said. ''We turned it over
early, but I wasn't concerned. We were setting the tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller quieted the sellout crowd early by making his first four
shots. He shot 6-of-8 in the first quarter for 13 points, but
didn't score again until making two free throws early in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was 10-for-19 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a great player,'' McKie said. ''He steps up his game in
the playoffs. I got to see it up close in person.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia never led after Iverson opened the game with a
fallaway jumper. Indiana went on a 10-1 run and led the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers got within one point several times and tied it twice
on driving layups by Toni Kukoc in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really proud of my team, but they're better,'' Sixers
coach Larry Brown said. ''Reggie was phenomenal. They came in and
did great, did whatever they wanted offensively. That's the best
anybody has executed against us all year.''
</P>
<P>
   A dunk by Austin Croshere gave Indiana its biggest lead to that
point, 39-25, early in the second. But the Sixers went on a 16-3
run to cut it to 42-41.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc made it 45-45 on a layup after a block by Theo Ratliff.
Kukoc tied it at 47 a minute later. Indiana led 56-53 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacers took control by outscoring Philadelphia 29-16 in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a veteran team and they know what they're doing,''
said Kukoc, who scored 12 points. ''Every time they took a 10-point
lead, we had to bring it. We weren't able to keep them from doing
it again.''
</P>
<P>
   As the final seconds ticked, Iverson appeared inconsolable,
sitting on the bench with a towel over his face.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a competitor. When I see the clock go down and I'm out, I
know the game is over,'' Iverson said. ''I saw the whole season
pass by just like that and it hurt.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Pacers hit nine of their first 10 shots and were
14-of-18 (77 percent) in the first quarter to take a 37-25 lead.
... The Sixers were 10-of-26 (39 percent) in the first and couldn't
take advantage of six turnovers. ... Eric Snow, who sat out the
last three games because of a chip fracture in his right ankle,
played six minutes. ... Indiana outrebounded Philadelphia 46-41.
... Sixers rookie Jumaine Jones scored his first points of the
series in the final minute. ... A fan behind the Sixers basket held
a Superwoman sign with Miller's face superimposed over Superwoman.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 2, Stars 0  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Patrick Roy tied an NHL record with his 15th
career playoff shutout as the Colorado Avalanche beat the Dallas
Stars 2-0 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Shjon Podein and Adam Deadmarsh scored goals and rookie Martin
Skoula had two assists as Colorado took a 2-1 lead in the
best-of-seven Western Conference finals. Game 4 is Sunday in
Denver, where the Avalanche are 7-0 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Roy matched the shutout mark set by Clint Benedict of Ottawa and
the Montreal Maroons in the 1920s, and extended his league record
for playoff victories to 120.
</P>
<P>
   Roy, whose 21 saves included a stop on Brett Hull on a breakaway
early in the third period, also beat Dallas 2-0 in the first game
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Ray Bourque returned to the Colorado lineup after
missing four games because of a knee injury. He helped replace Adam
Foote, the defenseman sidelined by an eye injury
</P>
<P>
   Dallas allowed 40 shots, its most in 13 games this postseason.
Ed Belfour had 38 saves.
</P>
<P>
   The teams, who hadn't played since Monday night, skated to a
fast-paced first period.
</P>
<P>
   Podein scored just 1:39 into the game, taking a pass from Chris
Drury along the boards and beating Belfour from the slot. Podein's
fifth goal of the playoffs marked his career high.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado later killed off two penalties, and Dallas withstood
two short-handed situations, including a four-minute penalty on
Mike Modano for a high-sticking incident that left Deadmarsh with a
bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche got off four shots on the Modano penalty, but
Belfour was outstanding, including stops on Joe Sakic and Dave
Andreychuk.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, outworking the Stars, outshot Dallas 20-4 in the
second period but managed only a power-play goal by Deadmarsh.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche, who had only seven shots on their first five
power plays, finally broke through at 14:50. Sakic won a faceoff
against Guy Carbonneau to the left of Belfour, and Skoula's long
shot was redirected by Deadmarsh from in front of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first goal in nine games for Deadmarsh, who leads
Colorado in scoring in the playoffs with four goals and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' top four scorers in the playoffs -- Hull, Modano, Joe
Nieuwendyk and Jamie Langenbrunner -- failed to get off any shots in
the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Muller's double-minor for high sticking in the third period
gave Colorado its ninth and 10th straight power-play opportunities,
but Belfour and the Stars killed off the penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The teams also met in the conference finals last year, with
Dallas prevailing 4-3 en route to winning the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado defenseman Greg de Vries required seven stitches to
repair a cut over his right eye late in the first period but
returned.

<HEADLINE> David Brower Quits Sierra Club  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Pioneering environmentalist David Brower
has quit the Sierra Club's board of directors, accusing the group
of fiddling while the world burns.
</P>
<P>
   Brower, 87, one of the century-old environmental group's most
charismatic and respected leaders, said Thursday the organization's
officials have lost their zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world is burning and all I hear from them is the music of
violins,'' Brower said. ''The planet is being trashed, but the
board has no real sense of urgency. We need to try to save the
Earth at least as fast as it's being destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brower, who joined the club in 1933 and was its first executive
director, said the club is not responding to such issues as
overpopulation, immigration, mass transit and wilderness
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overpopulation is perhaps the biggest problem facing us and
immigration is part of that problem,'' he said. ''It has to be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brower, a seminal figure in the U.S. environmental movement, led
the group in the '50s and '60s. The board removed him in 1969 after
members complained about his often strident views and lack of
consultation on crucial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Brower went on to found Friends of the Earth and the League of
Conservation Voters. Both now rank among the nation's most
respected and powerful environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   He was subsequently re-elected to the Sierra Club board in 1983,
1986, 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club President Carl Pope said he was sorry to see Brower
go.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll miss him, but at the same time, this is a large
organization, with 600,000 members, 63 chapters and dozens of
committees,'' Pope said. ''None of us agree with everything the
board does -- including me.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio Is Front-Runner for GOP Nod  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   Months ago, New York's top Republicans persuaded Rep. Rick Lazio
to drop his Senate bid in favor of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. On
Friday, the Long Island moderate jumped back in and became the
instant front-runner for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a former prosecutor, local legislator and U.S. congressman
I believe I am ... the Republican who is best able to unite our
party and defeat Hillary Clinton in November,'' Lazio said in a
statement shortly after the New York City major announced he would
not be running.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio enters the race well behind the first lady in both name
recognition and cash. But he does have the political currency he
picked up when he did as asked by Gov. George Pataki and stepped
aside in favor of the better-known Giuliani. He has kept his name
in circulation as a fallback candidate, sometimes to the dismay of
GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CNN's ''Larry King Live,'' Pataki said New York
Republicans had plenty of qualified potential replacement
candidates, but ''clearly the best would be Rick Lazio.'' And
Giuliani said he had called Lazio and pledged his ''help and
support'' should he become the GOP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The state party meets May 30 to pick its nominee, although other
hopefuls could challenge that choice in a September primary.
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance Friday night, Lazio wasn't anxious to talk
about his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an exceedingly difficult time for the mayor,'' Lazio
said of Giuliani, who dropped out because of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's made a difficult decision,'' he said. ''I think he has
made it for the best interest of the state and for the party and
for his own health and I think this day belongs to Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio is regarded on Capitol Hill as an energetic lawmaker
on the fast track, he is largely unknown and untested in New York
outside his Suffolk County district.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the four-term congressman is in many ways a perfect fit for
the New York GOP.
</P>
<P>
   He is a pro-death penalty Roman Catholic from the politically
critical suburbs. While he supports abortion rights generally, he
opposes Medicaid funding and so-called ''partial birth'' abortions,
which makes him palatable to the party's more conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   His pro-environment record, support of gun control measures and
attention to issues like breast cancer seem certain to appeal to
the soccer moms the first lady is courting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lazio is fiscally conservative. Asked by Republican House
leaders this year to take the lead on a minimum wage increase,
Lazio pushed to include tax breaks for businesses that made the
package palatable to his more conservative GOP colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't hurt that the 43-year-old Lazio's boyish good
looks project well on television.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats are almost certain to seize on Lazio's ties to
former Speaker Newt Gingrich and his support of the Contract With
America.
</P>
<P>
   His voting record is more moderate. Lazio's district contains
some of the poorest neighborhoods on Long Island and at least some
of the legislation he has sponsored reflects that.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he has pushed through bills in the House to pay for
breast and cervical cancer treatment for low-income women, to make
it easier for the disabled to work and to fund a cleanup of the
Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio grew up on the South Shore of Long Island. His father was
of Italian descent and owned an auto parts store. His mother, a
former Navy WAVE, was of Danish ancestry. He attended Vassar
College, then American University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   After working for several years as a Suffolk County prosecutor
and legislator, Lazio was elected to Congress in 1992 defeating
longtime Democratic Rep. Thomas Downey. Lazio, a virtual political
unknown then also, won by painting Downey as a junket-loving
Washington insider with ties to the House check bouncing scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has raised $3.5 million, compared to $12 million for
Clinton. Under campaign financing laws, the Giuliani campaign,
which raised $19 million, has a variety of options -- ranging from
investing the money to finance a later campaign, to giving it to
charity, to finding ways to help finance his successor in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, another Long Island Republican, said he also
wants the nomination. ''But if Rick is selected by the governor I
will certainly support Rick. ... I'm not going to run a suicide
mission and more importantly I'm not going to divide the party.''

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Seattle starter Brett Tomko left Friday night's

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Jackson May Miss Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It turns out that Mike Jackson may not throw
a single pitch this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Phillies reliever, signed during the offseason
to a $3 million, one-year contract, stopped himself while throwing
off the mound on Friday due to soreness in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just feel like I can't be the type of pitcher that Mike
Jackson is capable of being with the stuff that I have,'' Jackson
said. ''And I still feel like I would be on a roller coaster with
my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillies manager Terry Francona was not optimistic about
Jackson's chances of recovering this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't look like it's going to work with Mike,'' Francona
said. ''If it turns out that it was sort of a gamble, I wouldn't
second guess it one bit. I was happy when we got him.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals appeared set to sign Jackson to a $12
million, three-year contract, even calling a news conference on
Nov. 19, but the news conference was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia then signed him on Dec. 1 to a deal that would have
guaranteed him $7 million for two years if he remained healthy. The
Phillies have an option for 2002 that would make the contract worth
$11.25 million for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that he is hurt, but do I regret signing him? No,''
said Phillies general manager Ed Wade. ''It was a risk but I was
hoping to pay him in full and I'm sure he was hoping to collect in
full.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson got hurt during the team's first series of the year
while warming up in Arizona and never threw a pitch for the team.
Jackson's rehab took a step forward when he threw to hitters for
the first time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Ciccotti, the Phillies' team physician, examined
Jackson on Friday night and recommended that he see orthopedist Dr.
Craig Morgan in Wilminton, Del., on Tuesday for another opinion.
Ciccotti hopes to treat Jackson without operating.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would love to avoid it,'' Ciccotti said. ''That may not be
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ciccotti was the one who had examined Jackson prior to the
Phillies' signing and he still thinks it was a sound decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a risk like any pitcher at the major league level who
had thrown the innings he had,'' Ciccotti said. ''But he had proven
himself with his record.''
</P>
<P>
   The physician couldn't say how long it would be before a
decision is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on what we see,'' he said. ''There is certainly a
reasonable chance that he would miss the rest of the season.''

<HEADLINE> Blair's Wife Gives Birth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The wife of British Prime Minister Tony Blair gave
birth to a boy early Saturday morning -- the couple's fourth child,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair, 45, and the baby were in good health, officials at
Blair's Downing Street office said. Mrs. Blair and the baby went
home later Saturday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair had been due to give birth on May 24, but was
admitted to Chelsea and Westminster hospital in west London at
midday Friday. The prime minister joined her early in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, whose name was not immediately disclosed, becomes the
first child born to a serving British prime minister in 152 years.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that Mrs. Blair might have a
Caesarean delivery, but no details of the birth were disclosed. The
Downing Street spokesman, who would only say that the couple were
''delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair is a prominent lawyer who practices under her maiden
name of Cherie Booth. She and the prime minister have two teenage
sons, Euan and Nicholas, and a 12-year-old daughter, Kathyrn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heavy public hints from his wife, Blair has said he will
not be taking parental leave, but he does plan to initially scale
back his official workload.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair recently praised Finnish Prime Minister Paavo
Lipponen for taking six days after his wife, Paivi, gave birth to
their second daughter in March.
</P>
<P>
   She's even pushed her case in court.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Blair went to the High Court to challenge her
husband's government on the subject of parental leave. She was
representing 2.7 million workers from the Trade Union Congress, who
she said were being unlawfully excluded from the right to take
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Lord John Russell was the previous prime minister whose wife
gave birth while in office. The Russell's had a son in 1848.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Saying he agonized over the decision for days, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani dropped out of the Senate race Friday, abruptly halting an emerging

run for office. Giuliani's departure from the race propels Rep. Rick Lazio, a
