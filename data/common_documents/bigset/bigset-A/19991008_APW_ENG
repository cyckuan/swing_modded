<HEADLINE> Pianist Talks About NYC Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's all about form for concert pianist Maurizio  
Pollini. 
</P>
<P>
	The famed 57-year-old Italian pianist, often praised for his  
elegant playing, was at Weill Recital Hall Tuesday night to talk 
about ``Perspectives: Maurizio Pollini,'' his concert series at 
Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The pieces, many of which will be performed by Pollini, are  
dedicated to composers of the last half of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many groundbreaking masterpieces that used musical forms  
of the past, composers from the 14th century onwards based their 
music on new forms, Pollini said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pianist will play Beethoven, Schoenberg and Stockhausen at  
the first Perspectives concert this Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Drop in Salmonella at Small Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's new inspection system for  
food has reduced the occurrence of salmonella in raw meat and 
poultry by as much as 50 percent in small processing plants. 
</P>
<P>
	That is similar to the reduction that the Agriculture Department  
reported earlier in large plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our ability to greatly reduce the prevalence of salmonella in  
meat and poultry is a significant achievement in our ongoing 
efforts to ensure the safety of the American food supply,'' 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmonella was found in 7.5 percent of the ground beef tested  
before the new system was in place, but 3.3 percent six months 
afterward. The occurrence of salmonella in chicken was reduced from 
20 percent to 13.9 percent six months later. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program sets pathogen standards for plants and requires  
companies to identify key points in the manufacturing and packing 
processes where food can be contaminated and take steps to minimize 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The government estimates that there are 1.4 million cases of  
salmonella every year and as many as 600 deaths.

<HEADLINE> 3 Jewish Schools Opening in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- In the lands where the Nazi regime wreaked its  
deepest destruction on Jewish communities, the sound of children 
singing Hebrew is once again echoing off the walls of new Jewish 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Sunday, three such schools are being dedicated within  
three days in Austria, Germany and Poland in the hopes of helping 
rejuvenate the Jewish culture across central and eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``They basically are rebuilding Jewish life in these communities  
from the ground up, from the children,'' said Ed Serotta, director 
of the Central Europe Center for Research and Documentation, a 
Vienna-based institute that chronicles contemporary Jewish issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools' dedications come at the end of a decade that has  
seen a strong Jewish resurgence in central and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until 1989, most experts in the field talked of a dying  
European civilization of ``last Jews,'' with thousands having left 
for Israel, the United States or other countries. Germany's Jewish 
population, for example, had dropped from 500,000 before World War 
II to 28,000 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has swelled to more than 75,000 today. Much of the growth  
is attributed to Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union and 
Jews rediscovering roots that were unknown during communism. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the resurgence, though, many of the Jews have gaps of  
knowledge about their culture. In Germany, schools and community 
groups exist in larger cities, but smaller communities have serious 
trouble finding people who can lead services and teach the lessons 
of the Torah. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jewish schools, funded by the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation,  
are trying to bridge that gap. 
</P>
<P>
	They are not the first or only Jewish education programs in the  
region. But experts say there is always a need for much more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some needs are being met, but it's obviously insufficient,''  
said Amir Shaviv, assistant executive vice president for special 
operations at the New York-based American Jewish Joint Distribution 
Committee. The group funds programs aimed at building Jewish 
communities in former communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Before 1989, when Jews in communist countries had almost no  
access to information about their heritage, Shaviv's group and 
others like it worked to bring Jewish literature in as a lifeline. 
But now, with the openness of democracy in places like the former 
East Germany and Poland, the demand for assistance is huge, Shaviv 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the three Lauder Foundation schools, one is brand-new and two  
others are expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the existing schools is in Warsaw, Poland. The 165  
elementary and middle school students learn a dual curriculum of 
Jewish and secular studies. Recent guests include First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who observed a Hebrew lesson during her 
visit this week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Vienna, the Lauder Chabad School can accommodate up to 400  
students -- mostly Russian-speaking immigrants who came to Vienna in 
the 1970s. Classes at the new school will combine general secular 
subjects with Jewish history and philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Berlin school is a new facility, and it is taking on a  
different mission -- serving adults. 
</P>
<P>
	It will educate teachers and offer adult education courses. A  
dormitory will house high school graduates for a one-year immersion 
program in Jewish life before they enter college. 
</P>
<P>
	Such programs are much-needed but often ignored in favor of more  
traditional philanthropy, Serotta said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the decades since the Holocaust, he said, philanthropic  
groups have focused on documenting survivors' stories and 
establishing networks of social welfare for adults. Groups like the 
Lauder Foundation that focus on the future of Jewish culture are a 
rarity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody else is doing it,'' Serotta said. ``No one else is  
devoting an entire foundation to rebuilding Jewish life for the 
children in the lands of the Holocaust.''

<HEADLINE> New CBS Series Adds New Twist to TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Just when it seemed broadcast television  
couldn't get any more outrageous, CBS is stepping in with a 
candidate called ``Survivor'' that will strand 16 contestants on a 
deserted tropical island for the chance to win $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Described as a ``reality adventure'' series but sounding a bit  
like ``Lord of the Flies,'' ``Survivor'' will strand 16 Americans 
on an uninhabited island in the South China Sea and pit them 
against each other in a ``rigorous contest of physical and mental 
endurance,'' the network said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner gets a $1 million payoff. CBS ordered 13 episodes to  
air in summer 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Contestants will be selected through a nationwide search. Then  
they will be placed on Pulau Tiga island off the Borneo coast for 
an expected six weeks of round-the-clock taping, CBS said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16 contestants will have to forage for food and shelter,  
though outdoor specialists and medical teams will be available for 
emergencies, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of each episode, the participants will cast secret  
ballots to expel ``losers.'' Then, the last seven who were expelled 
choose the winner from the remaining two. 
</P>
<P>
	``Survivor'' is part of a pattern, with broadcast networks  
venturing beyond traditional series to try to stem the loss of 
viewers to cable TV and the Internet. Among the examples: UPN's 
primetime wrestling show ``WWF Smackdown!'' and ABC's hit 
summertime game show, ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The novel ``Lord of the Flies'' by William Golding, published in  
1954, is about a group of boys who survive the crash-landing of an 
airplane and try to survive on an uninhabited island. They descend 
into barbarism, splitting into different tribes and fighting one 
another.

	Fortier Jailed for 12 Years  
</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Going well above sentencing guidelines, a  
federal judge resentenced Michael Fortier to 12 years in prison 
today for failing to notify authorities about plans for the 
Oklahoma City bombing. Fortier has already served a little more 
than four years in prison. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
ordered the resentencing because it said U.S. District Judge G. 
Thomas Van Bebber used wrong guidelines when he sentenced Fortier 
last year to 12 years in prison and a $200,000 fine.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Tanzanian whose house was allegedly used as a  
bomb factory was arrested in connection with last year's deadly 
bombings of two U.S. embassies in east Africa and brought to the 
United States for trial. The arrest brought to nine the number of 
people in custody in connection with the Aug. 7, 1998, bombings in 
Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. 
Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, who was arrested yesterday in South Africa,

	OTTAWA (AP) -- In a polite rebuke to Quebec separatists,  
President Clinton said today the United States is proud to be 
partners with ``a strong, united, democratic Canada.'' The 
president dedicated a new U.S. Embassy before flying to a 
conference in Quebec, the French-speaking province whose leaders 
are dedicated to splitting off from Canada. Clinton made a point of 
stressing warm relations with Canada, which to the surprise of many 
Americans is the United States' biggest trading partner with more

torture of opponents. Mary Robinson, U.N. high commissioner for 
human rights, said the decision against the Chilean dictator was 
``a signal of hope to those fighting for justice for victims of 
human rights violations.'' Separately, the State department 
released a document today showing U.S. intelligence may have played 
an ``unfortunate part'' in the death of an American at the hands of 
Chilean security forces following Pinochet's 1973 coup.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Forest Protections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 40 million acres of federal forest lands  
would be protected from development under a plan President Clinton 
is expected to announce next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, which would keep two-thirds of America's remaining  
wild forests pristine, ``is one of the most significant land 
preservation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the 
century,'' Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy would include a broad environmental review aimed at  
barring construction of roads in the 40 million acres of 
undeveloped forces, said sources who have followed development of 
the new policy and spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is expected to announce the new initiative during a trip  
next Wednesday to George Washington National Forest in Virginia. 
White House officials declined comment on the plan, whose details 
were still being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	The areas earmarked for protection are spread across 192 million  
acres of federal forests from the Southern Appalachians to the 
Chugach National Forest in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary aim of the president's initiative will be to block  
future construction of timber roads in the forests, which now are 
roadless. Such a ban will keep remote forest areas out of the reach 
of loggers, miners and developers as well as protect against 
erosion and other environmental harm, environmentalists said. 
</P>
<P>
	A timber industry spokesman criticized the expected move, saying  
it will increase the risk of forest fires and insect infestation in 
dozens of forests and force the continued use of logging imports 
that keep Americans out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not that surprised -- they've been trying to get us out  
of the national forests for some time,'' said Michael Klein of the 
American Forest and Paper Association. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, about 60 million acres of the 192 million acres of  
federal forests are considered wild, or undeveloped. The rest of 
the acreage, governed by the U.S. Forest Service, is host to a wide 
range of activities, including logging, camping, skiing, mining and 
off-road-vehicle riding. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration in February imposed an 18-month moratorium on  
road building in 33 million acres of roadless forests. 
Environmentalists faulted that plan, saying it exempted too many 
forests, especially in the Northwest and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was expected to expand the protection to about 40  
million acres. It was unclear whether the plan would include any of 
the 9 million acres of roadless areas in the Tongass National 
Forest -- the nation's largest -- in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	It also was unclear whether about 10 million acres of roadless  
areas on smaller parcels of forests -- those parcels that are 5,000 
acres or less -- will be part of Clinton's plan.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Runoff Creates 'Dead Zone' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- There's a new problem from Hurricane  
Floyd's deluge: Sewage-tainted floodwaters are creating a growing 
``dead zone'' in Pamlico Sound where fish and other aquatic life 
cannot survive, scientists said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The brown freshwater plume containing human and animal waste is  
flowing into coastal estuaries. It sits atop the salt water, 
robbing the salt water of oxygen from surface air and reducing its 
salinity. 
</P>
<P>
	Both ingredients are essential for aquatic life.  
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing is an ecological event on the catastrophic  
scale,'' said Hans Paerl, a marine scientist at the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on eastern North Carolina on  
Sept. 16, killing at least 48 people as it flooded hog lagoons and 
sewer plants, homes and cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting sludge is flowing from the Neuse and Tar rivers  
into Pamlico Sound, the nation's second-largest estuary, and from 
the Cape Fear River near Wilmington into the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest affected area is a 350-square-mile expanse of  
Pamlico Sound and part of adjacent Core Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Paerl said he found drastically low oxygen levels in the bottom  
waters of Pamlico Sound -- 1 milligram per liter, compared to the 
normal 7 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
	While fisherman have to avoid the dead zone, they still have  
been able to catch fish and shrimp in areas not affected by the 
dirty water, said Nancy Fish, a spokeswoman for the state Division 
of Marine Fisheries. Initial testing showed the catch was safe to 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paerl and other scientists said it may be next spring or  
summer before the runoff's long-term effect on the sound and the 
Atlantic is known. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, massive flooding doubled the size of a Gulf of Mexico  
``dead zone'' that some scientists believe was caused by fertilizer 
runoffs in the Mississippi River basin. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation in Pamlico Sound, an estuary second in size only  
to Chesapeake Bay, especially concerns scientists because 
pollutants won't readily be flushed into the ocean. The Pamlico has 
just three inlets to the Atlantic, and most of the sound's water 
leaves via evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sound is acting like a giant bathtub,'' Paerl said. Making  
matters worse, he said, is that the pollutants become more 
concentrated as water evaporates. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the Cape Fear coast, the runoff is at least 40 feet deep and  
covers 300 square miles, said Larry Cahoon, marine scientist at the 
University of North Carolina at Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a brown ocean right now,'' Cahoon said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cahoon said Cape Fear never experienced plummeting oxygen levels  
because of its rapid water flow. But he said the brown color is 
indicative of a large amount of nutrients that could eventually 
feed algae blooms that use up oxygen and kill fish.

<HEADLINE> Valentine Remarks Stir Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On a night when the New York Mets moved one win  
away from playing for the National League pennant, their manager 
found himself on the hot seat again. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Valentine, often the center of controversy, was in that  
familiar position following publication of an article in this 
week's Sports Illustrated. In the story, Valentine talked about a 
team meeting the Mets players held in Philadelphia when the team 
was in the middle of a seven-game losing streak that nearly cost 
them any chance at the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not dealing with real professionals in the clubhouse,''  
Valentine said in the article. ``You're not dealing with real 
intelligent guys for the most part. A lot can swim, but most of 
them just float along, looking for something to hold on to. That's 
why, I'm sure, they're having a players-only meeting. Because 
there's about five guys in there right now who basically are 
losers, who are seeing if they can recruit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mets general manager Steve Phillips, who fired three of  
Valentine's coaches earlier this year, told reporters the remarks 
were ``an ill-timed fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said there were some inaccuracies in the story but did  
not deny the tenor of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Mets' 9-2 win over Arizona on Friday night, Valentine  
said the controversy clearly had not affected the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like I said before the game, they don't care about any of that  
nonsense,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman John Olerud said he had not seen the article.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to comment on it. I don't know what was  
written or what was said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Dennis Cook said, ``I don't want to comment on it until  
I read it and I probably won't read it until the end of the season. 
I don't know anything about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure with the Mets, which began at the end of the  
1996 season, Valentine has feuded publicly with a number of 
players, including Pete Harnisch, Todd Hundley and Bobby Bonilla. 
Harnisch and Hundley are no longer with the team and Bonilla spent 
most of the season on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla often has been criticized for non-production in a season  
in which he made $5.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher To Return This Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FIORANO, Italy (AP) -- Changing his mind after three days of  
practice, Michael Schumacher will compete in the last two Formula 
One events of the year, his first races since he broke his leg in a 
July crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael saw there had been a big improvement in his physical  
condition and therefore he has decided to take part in the two 
final and very important races of the season,'' Ferrari said today, 
referring to the Grand Prix races in Malaysia, Oct 17., and Japan, 
Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time world champion had said he would not compete in  
those events because he didn't think he was ready following his 
accident at the British Grand Prix. He has been test driving for 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Schumacher completed 58 laps at the Fiorano circuit  
where he broke an unofficial track record set by Ferrari's second 
driver Eddie Irvine, Italian sports dailies reported, citing track 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
	In changing his mind, Schumacher wanted to ``give the maximum  
support to Ferrari in the fight for the championships and to 
fulfill the wishes of the team and all the fans,'' the automaker 
said.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate was unchanged  
at 4.2 percent in September, the lowest rate in nearly three 
decades, even though the number of payroll jobs actually fell last 
month as Hurricane Floyd cut into hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that September's rate  
matched August's rate at 4.2 percent, a 29-year low. The nation's 
jobless rate has been below 4.4 percent since March. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers cut payroll jobs in September by 8,000, the first  
decline since January 1996 when a winter blizzard disrupted hiring 
plans. The Labor Department said that while the growth in payroll 
jobs would have been extremely weak in September compared with the 
robust gains reported for most of this year, the hurricane cut 
growth by 50,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hurricane Floyd huffed and puffed and blew a lot of jobs away  
in September,'' said KeyCorp economist Ken Mayland. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expected companies to add 220,000 jobs. In August,  
businesses added 103,000 jobs to their payrolls, less than what the 
government previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the weak job growth, wages grew in September. Average  
hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, grew by 0.5 
percent to $13.37 in September, much sharper than the 0.2 percent 
increase in August. 
</P>
<P>
	While strong wage growth is a good development for workers,  
economists and members of the Federal Reserve worry that it could 
be a recipe for sparking inflation. Their fear: employers foraging 
for qualified workers woo them with higher wages and benefits, 
costs likely to drive up consumer prices if not constrained by 
other forces. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Fed policy-makers decided not to raise interest  
rates for now but, expressing concerns that the tight labor market 
could lead to inflation down the road, they left open the 
possibility of a third rate increase later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the increase in the average hourly earnings, Mayland,  
citing the decrease in payroll jobs, believed the report would 
reduce the odds of a Fed rate increase at its next meeting on Nov. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably makes the Fed a little less likely to raise rates  
in November,'' he said. Mayland said the fact that job growth 
slowed so much in September would probably ease the fear about 
future wage pressures being triggered by employers forced to pay 
higher salaries in competition for a dwindling supply of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have been volatile in the last month over  
concerns about the prospects for higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates fell in the inflation-sensitive government bond  
market immediately after the job figures were released. But rates 
edge up within minutes. In morning trading, yields on 30-year 
Treasury bonds hovered near Thursday's late rate of 6.18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, another 21,000 manufacturing jobs were lost, but  
government analysts noted that the average monthly decline in 
manufacturing slowed to 15,000 per month from June through 
September, less than half the 36,000 monthly average in the first 
six months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. manufacturers have seen foreign demand for their products  
rebound somewhat from a global financial crisis which began in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The service sector, normally the driving force of job creation  
in the United States, suffered a decline of 9,000 in September, 
reflecting a drop of 49,000 jobs at retail businesses. Government 
analysts said that job loss was particularly heavy where businesses 
were forced to close because of Hurricane Floyd, which raked the 
East Coast in September. 
</P>
<P>
	But even without the hurricane, there was widespread weakness as  
department stores cut 17,000 jobs,the fifth consecutive monthly 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a drop of 23,000 government jobs in  
September,while business services added only 39,000 jobs, well 
below their average monthly gain of 126,000.

<HEADLINE> Germans Offers $3.3B to Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Everyone says they want to get it over as  
quickly as possible. But that was one of the few things both sides 
agreed on when German negotiators and Nazi labor camp survivors met 
to settle compensation for wartime atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany offered Thursday to pay $3.3 billion to former slave  
laborers and other victims of Adolf Hitler's World War II regime, 
calling it ``a considerable amount.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for survivors termed the offer ``shameful,''  
``an insult'' and ``disgusting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the offer ``represents a basis for serious discussion,''  
said the main U.S. negotiator, Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart E. 
Eizenstat. 
</P>
<P>
	Another round of talks is planned in several weeks in Bonn, with  
an eye toward completing an agreement by year's end and starting 
payments in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides noted that survivors are elderly and more are dying  
every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's money offer came on the closing day of a  
multinational meeting aimed at working out compensation for people 
who worked in forced or slave labor camps to the benefit of 
Hitler's war machine -- as well as other victims of the Nazi period. 
</P>
<P>
	German industry says the number of surviving forced and slave  
laborers is about 900,000; estimates from the other side are as 
high as 2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	German envoy Otto Lambsdorff, who presented Germany's joint  
government and industry offer, said a new foundation would 
administer the funds. About a third of the money is from the 
government and two-thirds from German industry, negotiators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an insult,'' Rudy Kennedy of London, whose mother, sister  
and father were killed in the Holocaust, said outside the State 
Department, which served as meeting host. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world will judge the morality of this offer and ... will  
condemn it,'' said Mel Weiss, an attorney for some survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambsdorff acknowledged that the money ``is not enough to help  
all those who feel they suffered during that period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``It is not easy to make the case to German  
citizens'' for such payments while they are suffering cutbacks in 
social services and other financial problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German diplomats accompanying Lambsdorff also stressed that the  
new money comes on top of more than $55 billion in compensation 
that Germany already has paid for various Holocaust-related crimes 
since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambsdorff said 20 companies beyond the 16 originally sued in  
the United States had agreed to contribute to the foundation. He 
said the foundation would receive claims not only against 
contributing companies, but against any wartime German company, 
even if it no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that have been sued in the United States on forced  
labor and related claims include Bayer pharmaceuticals, carmakers 
DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor Co. and chemical conglomerate 
Hoechst AG. Names of all companies that have pledged contributions 
have not been publicly released. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the money in the new offer, about $2.3 billion,  
would go to slave and forced laborers, Lambsdorff said, with slave 
laborers getting $5,500 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department says an estimated 12 million workers were  
forced to work in German industry and agriculture during World War 
II. Some produced materials for the war, and some took over jobs 
from German men, freeing them to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the United States and Germany, the other  
countries involved in the negotiations are Israel, Poland, Belarus, 
Ukraine, Russia and the Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Growth Better Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Increased government spending is likely to propel  
China's economic growth past the official projection of 7 percent 
this year, Chinese state media said Friday, citing a recent 
government research report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimates  
growth in China's gross domestic product -- the total value of goods 
and services -- will reach about 7.6 percent in 1999, the official 
newspaper China Economic Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report estimates next year's GDP growth at between 7.5 and 8  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But CASS, a government-run think tank, warned that structural  
problems in the economy could continue to create problems in the 
future, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	China's state industries are struggling to restructure after  
decades of central planning that left most inefficient and laden 
with debts. The banks are overloaded with irrecoverable loans, 
weakening the financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, also carried by other newspapers, noted that  
consumers fearful of losing their jobs are refraining from 
spending, further hurting growth prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	China recorded growth of 7.8 percent last year, after the  
government channeled billions of dollars into public works 
programs. This year, however, the economy has slipped deeper into a 
deflationary spiral. Economic growth fell to 7.1 percent at an 
annual rate in the second quarter from 8.3 percent in the first 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The retail price index, China's benchmark inflation indicator,  
has been falling for almost two years and investment in fixed 
assets, a key factor in stimulating growth, has not revived despite 
the government's spending program. 
</P>
<P>
	To counter those trends, the government has increased payments  
to laid-off workers, pay for civil servants and export tax rebates.

<HEADLINE> Shaky Ride Yields $2.2M in Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A jury awarded $2.22 million Thursday to 13  
people traumatized by severe plane turbulence. The plaintiffs 
included the sister of filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who found the 
plane ride more frightening than her brother's movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``My brother has spent his life scaring me; but they were  
games,'' Nancy Spielberg said after the jury in U.S. District Court 
in Manhattan returned its verdict. ``I would really rather feel 
fear on Dolby sound with popcorn than by a real-life, near-death 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She called the verdict a slap on the wrist for American  
Airlines, which had admitted liability but contested the amount 
which should be awarded for the turbulence aboard the June 26, 
1995, Los Angeles-to-New York flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really need more like a punch in the face,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark Slitt, a spokesman for the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline,  
said he was disappointed by the size of the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not studied it in detail,'' he said, saying the  
airline would weigh its legal options when it did so. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury ended four hours of deliberations by awarding  
individual damages ranging from $150,000 to $215,000 for the 28 
seconds of turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
	Most damages were for emotional trauma after lawyers for the  
plaintiffs took the unique legal position that fear of death was so 
damaging that it deserved a large award usually given to those with 
physical injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real message is that it's not inconsequential when you  
scare people and they think they're going to die,'' said James P. 
Kreindler, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, who were among 101 people 
on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Kreindler said the airline could have avoided the turbulence by  
steering around a storm and should have illuminated a seat belt 
sign to warn passengers about the possibility of rough weather 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Miriam Lewinger, a 74-year-old New Rochelle woman who was  
awarded $150,000, said she was ``absolutely delighted'' by the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``This seems like a fair reward. Nothing could really reward us  
for the pain and suffering and emotional strain,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it's over. I'm hoping that all the airlines get the  
message,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified during the trial that she is still haunted by the  
screams, despite counseling she had received. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded $160,000 to Ms. Spielberg of Riverdale, N.Y.  
Her two daughters, ages 6 and 2 during the turbulence, were awarded 
a total of $375,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Spielberg testified during the one-week trial that the  
turbulence tossed her against the ceiling just after she had begun 
playing a card game with her 6-year-old daughter, Jessica. 
</P>
<P>
	She said people flew over seats and into aisles and the plane  
made a groaning noise before it nosedived as a chorus of screams 
and cries filled the fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I knew at this point -- it wasn't a matter of thinking -- I  
just knew that we were going to die,'' she said. ``Nobody was calm. 
Everybody thought we were dying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turbulence hit while Flight 58 was over Minnesota. It made  
an emergency landing in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Sultan Funds Harvard Professorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The Sultan of Oman is funding a new  
professorship at Harvard that will focus on international 
relations, diplomacy and the advancement of women. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming from the ruler of a country where women wear veils and  
are often segregated from men, it might seem a contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
	But Harvard officials said that under Sultan Qaboos bin Said's  
nearly 30-year leadership, Omani women have made significant 
strides in education and the workplace -- enough to give the 
university little pause about taking his money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is the university would not accept a gift if there  
were hypocritical issues,'' said Brad Voigt, a fund-raiding 
director for the John F. Kennedy School of Government. 
</P>
<P>
	The school would not divulge how much money the sultan is  
donating. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard has had ties to the Middle Eastern country for several  
years. A graduate of the Kennedy School, Frances Cook, is a former 
American ambassador to Oman and arranged three years ago to bring a 
group of young Omani scholars to visit Harvard.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Fire Mananger and GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The only constant about the Baltimore Orioles  
under owner Peter Angelos is an unwavering lack of continuity. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos fired manager Ray Miller and general manager Frank Wren  
on Thursday, forcing the once-proud franchise to essentially start 
from scratch in its bid to reach the World Series for the first 
time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Orioles begin spring training next season, they will  
have their fifth manager in seven years and their third GM in three 
years. Miller was fired after two straight losing seasons. Wren was 
dumped with two years left on a three-year contract he signed last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning with the dismissal of manager Johnny Oates in 1994,  
Angelos has fired either his manager or general manager after every 
season except 1996, when Baltimore advanced to the playoffs for the 
first time in 13 years. This is the second time he's canned both 
his manager and GM -- in 1995, he said farewell to manager Phil 
Regan and GM Roland Hemond. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe they ought to install a revolving door on the warehouse  
behind the baseball diamond at Camden Yards, where the players come 
and go almost as often as the front office personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Brown, Rafael Palmeiro, Roberto Alomar, Bobby Bonilla,  
Eric Davis and a host of other stars have worn the Orioles' orange 
and black before going elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller took over the team in November 1997 after Angelos forced  
the resignation of Davey Johnson, who twice took the Orioles to the 
AL championship series, but lost both times. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Miller, the team's former pitching coach, the Orioles went  
79-83 in 1998, then slumped to 78-84 this year despite a $78.5 
million opening-day payroll, third-highest in baseball behind the 
New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren was cited for several incidents in which he rubbed  
management the wrong way. The most notable offense came last month, 
when Wren ordered the team flight to Anaheim to leave on time after 
Cal Ripken called to say he would arrive late. Ripken had to 
scramble to make his own arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Orioles management cannot and will not abide having a  
general manager operate in such an unreasonable, authoritarian 
manner and treat anyone in this way, especially someone such as Cal 
who has done so much for the Orioles and for baseball,'' vice 
chairman and chief operating officer Joe Foss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren declined comment, saying he was in the process of  
negotiating a settlement. He replaced Pat Gillick last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren made several fine trades, getting starter Jason Johnson for  
Danny Clyburn and obtaining a handful of good pitching prospects 
for Juan Guzman and Harold Baines. But he also put together a 
bullpen consisting of Seattle Mariners rejects Heathcliff Slocumb, 
Mike Fetters and Mike Timlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullpen had 20 blown saves by the All-Star break, leaving  
Baltimore with a 36-51 record and nothing to play for but third 
place in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 54, did not return phone calls Thursday. But during the  
final weekend of the regular season he cited poor pitching for the 
team's lack of success and compared himself to several fine 
managers who also struggled this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you bring a reliever in and he blows a save, you look  
bad. If he does well, you're a brilliant tactician,'' he said. 
``Did Jimmy Leyland all of a sudden get stupid in Colorado this 
year? Did Davey Johnson get dumb when he hit the west coast? Is 
last year's manager of the year, Jim Riggleman, stupid or did his 
club get old on him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Miller, Angelos lauded his contributions to the  
1997 team as a pitching coach. But 1998 and 1999 were another 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad for Ray,'' Orioles shortstop Mike Bordick said.  
``He obviously wasn't the one throwing the ball or hitting the 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Milwaukee Brewers manager Phil Garner is considered the  
leading candidate to replace Miller. Garner was in the midst of his 
seventh straight losing season when he was fired by the Brewers in 
August, but he didn't have much talent to work with for the 
low-budget Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Trebelhorn, the Orioles' director of player development and  
former manager of the Brewers and Chicago Cubs, also is a 
possibility. So is former Orioles star Don Baylor, who managed the 
Rockies from 1993-98, and Riggleman, fired by the Chicago Cubs on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time that Miller failed to field a winner as  
a major league manager. He went 50-50 with the Minnesota Twins in 
the second half of the 1985 season and was fired in September 1986, 
with the team struggling at 59-70. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles had a club-record .279 batting average and set a  
franchise record with 1,572 hits, but Baltimore lost 24 games when 
it scored six runs or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a good year, and things happen after you don't  
produce the way you're expected to,'' infielder Jeff Reboulet said. 
``It's tough to blame one person for everything going on, but the 
finger usually ends up pointing at the manager. It's part of the 
game.''

<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The car driven by fourth-generation stock  
car driver Adam Petty was disqualified Friday after NASCAR 
inspectors said they found an altered part in its carburetion 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	A NASCAR official said a routine inspection following  
second-round qualifying for Saturday's All Pro Auto Parts 300 Busch 
Series race found a groove etched into the gasket below the 
carburetor, allowing extra air flow to reach the carburetor. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent rules infraction nullified Petty's qualifying lap  
of 175.913 mph that was the fastest in Friday's qualifying session 
and had briefly placed the 19-year-old Busch Series rookie 26th in 
the 43-car field. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Petty will miss the race and everybody from 27th  
through 36th moved up one spot. That also moved Mike Dillon, who 
had failed to qualify by speed or as a provisional, into 36th. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from Petty or his team.

	SAFETY ISSUE: H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler, general manager of Lowe's  
Motor Speedway, wants race fans attending the events Saturday and 
Sunday at the suburban Charlotte track to have fun and put away 
worries about security in the wake of the bombings at two area 
Lowe's Home Improvement stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler, joined by Earl Woodham, representing the Federal Bureau  
of Alcohol, Tobacco &AMP; Firearms, met with the media Friday at the 
track to give assurances that nobody is expecting any trouble this 
weekend, despite increased security precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have heightened security precautions, but we are going to  
have a good time,'' Wheeler said. ``All week, I have been out 
talking to race fans and making myself visible. I think this 
weekend is really shaping up well. 
</P>
<P>
	``These misconceptions toward what is going on with the Lowe's  
stories situations, as far as the bombings are concerned, has 
included a lot of wrong information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodham said he would not hesitate to bring his family to the  
track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not address the investigation (into the bombings), but  
a separation between the investigation and the events this weekend 
has to be made,'' he said. ``Everyone should have a heightened 
sense of awareness because no matter what you are doing these days, 
you risk harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to do it coming here. You have to do it in your  
backyard. Lowe's Motor Speedway is just as safe as your backyard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Race officials are expected a crowd close to 170,000 for  
Sunday's UAW-GM 500. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------

<P>
	PAIRED UP: Matt Kenseth, who will vie for Winston Cup Rookie of  
the Year in 2000, also will share time in a Busch Series car with 
hometown friend Jason Schuler. 
</P>
<P>
	It was announced Friday that Kenseth will drive the No. 17  
Reiser Racing Chevrolet in about 20 races next season, while 
Schuler, moving up from the NASCAR Re-Max Challenge Series in the 
Midwest, will drive 10 to 15 short-track and intermediate races for 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Kenseth and Schuler are from Cambridge, Wis., where they  
classmates in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited for Jason,'' Kenseth said. ``He's run a long time  
without any help, and I'm glad to see him get something good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schuler would like to get closer to Kenseth on the track,  
</P>
<P>
	``Matt has always been a step ahead of me.'' he said. ``Now it's  
up to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team also announced a two-year sponsorship deal with Pfizer  
Consumer Health Care's Visine brand.

<HEADLINE> Inside Fund-Raising Microsoft Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- When your company puts on a United Way auction,  
the big-ticket items might be a round of golf with the boss, dinner 
for two prepared by the best in-house chef and tickets to a 
road-company performance of the latest Broadway hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Things are different at Microsoft.  
</P>
<P>
	For this year's Microsoft Giving Campaign, chairman Bill Gates --  
the world's richest man, worth about $90 billion at last count -- is 
again offering to serve as guide for a tour of his $53.4 million 
mansion on the shores of Lake Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's tour sold for $42,525. The bidding this year had  
gone over $15,000 by early this week, but there were still nearly 
four weeks to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The computerized silent auction -- employees only, sorry -- ends  
Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	There are alternatives for those not moved by tours of  
40,000-square-foot megamansions. 
</P>
<P>
	How about ``the ultimate child's birthday party''? Certainly the  
ultimate high-tech child's birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
	Location: Microsoft's ``hardware room,'' where kids could check  
out cutting-edge hardware and games -- some not yet on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Extras: Decorations in the theme chosen by the bidder, plus  
food, drinks and cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	No kids?  
</P>
<P>
	There are numerous options in the adventure category -- a ride in  
a stunt plane, a tandem skydive, a ride in a hot-air balloon, 
whale-watching and whitewater rafting on the Olympic Peninsula's 
Skokomish River. 
</P>
<P>
	Other getaways are on the block, too -- a romantic weekend in a  
downtown hotel, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	For the not-so-romantic -- or perhaps for those trying to reach a  
man's heart by way of his stomach -- one group is offering a 
``weekend of barbecue and beer in Kansas City,'' complete with 
airfare, hotel room and rental car. 
</P>
<P>
	For the musically inclined, there's a Stratocaster guitar signed  
by all of the B-52s and an autographed boxed set of Dave Brubeck 
CDs. Art buffs can bid on a day with Microsoft's in-house art 
curator. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sales office in Charlotte, N.C., is offering a ride  
in a two-seat stock car driven by an instructor at the Richard 
Petty Driving School, with the winning bidder promised a 
``simulated Winston Cup qualifying run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly a free car wash, though Microsoft's chief legal  
counsel, Bill Neukom, was offering those to employees last week -- 
his way of supporting the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are some down-to-earth items listed on the in-house  
Web site -- a good bottle of wine, Sonics tickets, a round of golf 
with an executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's goal this year is $15 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The average corporate donation is $12,352, said United Way  
spokeswoman Christy Hicks in suburban Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's 1998 campaign raised $12.2 million, which -- combined  
with an impressive record of employee volunteerism and a policy of 
matching individual employee's donations up to $12,000 a year -- won 
it the United Way Spirit of America Award.

<HEADLINE> Mayor To Resign Over Puppy's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILFORD, Ill. (AP) -- A mayor accused of beating a 6-month-old  
beagle puppy to death with a shovel says he will resign due to 
public furor over the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Mayor James Cook said  
he planned to resign today because of a flood of hate mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the trustees are getting nasty letters and stuff like  
that,'' Cook said. ``City Hall is being flooded with prank calls. 
It would be in the best interest for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cook is accused of clubbing the puppy, named Snoopy, with a  
shovel outside a grain elevator on Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor has said he struck the dog with the shovel to shoo it  
away from workers who were building a grain bin. He said that when 
he saw how badly he had inadvertently injured the puppy, he felt 
the kindest thing would be to put it out of its misery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog's owners said the puppy was a gift for their 6-year-old  
son and had been missing for several days when its remains were 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook has pleaded innocent to charges of animal cruelty. If  
convicted, he could be sentenced to 30 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Police reports indicate Cook paid the owners $150 as  
compensation for their loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Milford is about 100 miles south of Chicago.

<HEADLINE> HMO Bill Faces Fight in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly one in three House Republicans joined  
with Democrats to approve a controversial new right to sue health 
insurance plans, part of a wide-reaching patient protection bill. 
But in the Senate, the GOP has held together, and the legislation 
faces an uphill struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	As the issue heads to a conference committee, where lawmakers  
from both chambers will try to work out the differences, Democrats 
and their allies are hoping that Thursday's strong House vote will 
pressure the Senate to cave. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, backed by insurance and business groups, are  
counting on the Senate to hold the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how Republicans can stand in the way of this kind  
of groundswell,'' said a hopeful Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who 
led his party when the Senate debated the issue in July. ``The 
Senate flunked its test earlier in the year but we have a second 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Don Nickles, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, vowed  
to stop many of the provisions passed by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will work aggressively to ensure that this Congress does not  
pass any legislation that would cause a dramatic increase in health 
care costs (or) increase the number of uninsured,'' said Nickles, 
R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest groups on both sides promised to keep up the pressure.  
</P>
<P>
	``The fight is not over,'' said Karen Ignagi, president of the  
American Association of Health Plans, the HMO trade group, which 
was intensely involved in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate versions have two major differences. The  
Senate includes no new rights to file lawsuits. And many of the 
Senate provisions apply only to the 48 million Americans in health 
plans that fall under a 1974 federal benefits law. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're clearly miles apart,'' said Larry Levitt, an analyst  
at the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent policy group in San 
Francisco. ``The Senate had plenty of opportunity in their debate 
to go as far as the House did and decided pretty forcefully not 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested the Senate and the House might agree on many minor  
differences between their bills, and possibly how many people are 
covered. However, he said, ``The right to sue is still very 
tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many issues that were contested only a year ago are now  
essentially givens. Democrats have won the most basic question: 
Whether there should be new federal regulations at all for health 
insurance companies, which are traditionally regulated by states. 
</P>
<P>
	And many of the patient protections found in both bills were  
once a source of much debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would guarantee access to reasonable emergency  
room care, give patients the right to see pediatricians and 
obstetricians without permission from primary care doctors, and 
require HMOs to pay for routine care associated with clinical 
trials. It would require HMOs to disclose a lot of information and 
let patients take their complaints to outside arbitrators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill is nearly identical.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think mountains have been moved here,'' said Ron Pollack,  
president of Families USA, a liberal consumer group. Still, he 
said, ``It's far from clear we're going to end up with a bill 
that's enacted into law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the right to sue has overwhelmed all else. And no  
one is sure whether the 2000 election politics will stiffen each 
side's spine or encourage a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert downplayed the differences.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-five percent of that bill was stuff that I've been  
working on for years to try to get passed,'' Hastert, R-Ill., told 
reporters Friday in Topeka, Kan. He called the right-to-sue issue, 
which tangled his leadership team in knots for months, ``a little 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically what happened yesterday was a bipartisan issue that  
was passed on a bipartisan basis,'' Hastert said. ``We've taken a 
step forward.''

	VEVEY, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss food and beverage conglomerate  
Nestle is selling its Findus brand and parts of its frozen food 
business in Europe to the Swedish investment group EQT Scandinavia 
BV for undisclosed terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Nestle said Friday the deal includes all of its frozen food

<P>
	Those businesses being sold generate about $608 million in

</P>
<P>
	Nestle, which had $51.6 billion in sales overall last year, said  
it will keep its frozen lines of prepared dishes, pizzas and snacks

<HEADLINE> Stars' Modano Not Out for Revenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- For Dallas Stars center Mike Modano, revenge is  
not the name of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, who suffered strained neck ligaments after being sent  
head first into the boards last week, is urging restraint when the 
Stars play Anaheim tonight at Arrowhead Pond. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am calling on my teammates to set an example for all  
players,'' Modano said Thursday. ``I am looking forward to getting 
back on the ice and playing as soon as possible, but not to getting 
even. 
</P>
<P>
	``More importantly, I don't want anyone getting even on my  
behalf,'' he said. ``Somewhere along the road, players have lost 
respect for one another and the sport, and that is unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano also broke his nose and sustained a mild concussion after  
Anaheim defenseman Ruslan Salei cross-checked him from behind in 
Saturday's game. Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said afterward that the 
Stars would be forced to respond to the hits that put Modano in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars' Darryl Sydor is also out with a fractured eye socket  
from a fight with the Mighty Ducks' Jim McKenzie. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, knocked unconscious during the game, says he might leave  
hockey if the NHL's trend toward increasing violence doesn't abate. 
His injuries left him gun-shy about taking another hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two wrongs don't make a right, and we know that,'' defenseman  
Richard Matvichuk, one of the league's hardest hitters, told The 
Dallas Morning News. ``We've got to worry about wins and not 
revenge against other players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the hit against Modano, the league suspended Salei for 10  
games, and he will forfeit $109,756 in salary. McKenzie was 
suspended for four games, and will lose close to $13,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Players say the suspensions should reduce tensions between the  
teams, which have to face each other four more times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's extremely unprofessional to really take a run at somebody  
who wasn't even involved in the play,'' said Anaheim goalie Guy 
Herbert. ``If (Salei) was playing, he's got to expect he's going to 
be hit, but I don't think they're going to go after somebody 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, who met with reporters after a light workout, said that  
if the career-ending or life-threatening violence doesn't stop, he 
will get off the ice for good -- even though neurological tests show 
he is recovering well. 
</P>
<P>
	``If things continue, I'm not going to play anymore,'' said  
Modano, who led the Stanley Cup champions in regular-season scoring 
with 81 points and playoff scoring with 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars' best offensive player also said that he considered  
retiring after watching replays of the hit by Salei and hearing 
others tell him he was inches from being paralyzed. He remembered 
waking to find doctors and trainers hovering over and yelling at 
him to try to move his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone through my mind a lot, especially when you know  
you're a marked man every time you're on the ice,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senators Fans Sue Holdout Yashin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ottawa Senators star Alexei Yashin may have thought his latest  
holdout would net him a big payday. 
</P>
<P>
	But by failing to honor the last year of his contract, he could  
cost himself even more. 
</P>
<P>
	An Ottawa hockey fan filed a $27.5 million lawsuit against  
Yashin and his agent this week, accusing the two of interfering 
with the contractual relationship between the Senators and their 
fans. The unprecedented claim is far from an empty-netter, but the 
plaintiffs -- the class action could grow to include 11,000 season 
ticket-holders -- want athletes everywhere to know that the public's 
tolerance is limited. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt your situation will be looked upon with interest by  
other professional athletes,'' Arthur Cogan, the fans' attorney, 
wrote Yashin. ``Perhaps the time will come when athletes in all 
sports will not act with impunity when the decide to intentionally 
breach their obligations and consider only themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans who pay serious money for a first-class product are  
directly affected by arbitrary and wrongful conduct by a 
professional athlete. I strongly believe that the rights and 
interests of fans do count and must be taken into consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holding out is a way of doing business in the NHL these days,  
with restricted free agents using all available leverage to get the 
best contract possible. This season, Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe, 
Hurricanes forward Keith Primeau and Coyotes goalie Nikolai 
Khabibulin are among those sitting out because of stalled 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yashin is not a free agent; he is in the final season of a  
four-year deal that guaranteed him $3.6 million. Still, he wants 
more -- $23 million more for the two seasons after this one -- and 
he's holding out for the third time in five years to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll say, 'We didn't want to hurt the fans.' But who do you  
think it's hurting?'' Cogan said in a telephone interview. ``Hey, 
this is not going to be the same team anymore. It's not the same 
entertainment value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin has been training in Switzerland, and his agent, Mark  
Gandler, declined to comment for this story. The NHL also declined 
to comment on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators suspended the 25-year-old former captain when he  
didn't show up for the start of training camp. Although they would 
not comment on the suit, the Senators did release correspondence 
notifying Yashin that they will neither renegotiate nor trade the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the NHL's collective bargaining agreement requires  
arbitration in such disputes, the team cannot sue Yashin. And 
because the fans have a contract with the team -- but not with 
Yashin -- they have to take an indirect approach, arguing he 
intentionally interfered with their agreement with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it has never been applied in sports, the argument  
attempted by the fans is older than the NHL itself. In a 1853 
English case called Lumley v. Gye, a theater operator with an 
exclusive contract with an opera singer sued a competitor who 
induced the singer to sing elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The approach presents two problems for the plaintiffs: One is  
showing that, by failing to produce Yashin, the Senators have 
breached the ticket contract. The other is proving that Yashin or 
Gandler intended to cause that breach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me to be something of a stretch, to find an  
intention directed at the fans and not just at the team,'' said 
Harvard law professor Paul Weiler, who wrote the textbook on sports 
law and is a native Canadian. ``It depends to some extent on how 
broadly the Canadian courts will consider intention. It is a 
difficult thing to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, filed this week in Ontario's Superior Court of  
Justice, details how the Senators had their most successful season 
ever last year, and how Yashin was a big part of that. With 44 
goals with 50 assists, he accounted for 35 percent of the team's 
scoring and was a finalist for the NHL's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	In the offseason, Yashin was the centerpiece of a marketing  
campaign that helped close 11,000 season ticket contracts at an 
average of $4,000 -- a total of more than $40 million in Canadian 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans were aware and relied upon the fact that the defendant  
Yashin was contracted to play for the Club for the 1999-2000 NHL 
season, and as a result purchased their tickets with the 
expectation that Yashin would fulfill his contract with the Club 
for the 1999-2000 season and play hockey,'' the complaint reads. 
``Yashin and Gandler acted deliberately and maliciously and in a 
manner calculated to diminish ... the contract between the 
Plaintiff and the Club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Weiler said, that doesn't necessarily amount to  
inducing a breach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price of a ticket is much, much more based on the name of  
the team than the specifics of what's happening in the short run,'' 
Weiler said, ``as the Orioles or Dodgers season ticket-holders 
learned this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiler noted that Denver fans have no right to sue John Elway  
for retiring or Terrell Davis for getting injured, even though 
their absence makes Broncos tickets worth less. However, Cogan 
noted, neither Elway nor Davis -- nor the underperforming Dodgers 
and Orioles -- violated a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the rules, these things can happen. But it's not  
provided that he can breach a contract,'' Cogan said. ``It's a 
wrongful act. That's the key thing here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks damages of $8 million apiece from Yashin and  
Gandler, and punitive damages of $5 million and $6.5 million, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Cogan said he is handling the case for expenses. Ticket-holders  
wanting to sign up must agree that they will donate any damages 
they win to charity, a condition insisted upon by Leonard Potechin, 
the name plaintiff in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	A 73-year-old retired real estate broker, former minor leaguer  
and Senators season ticket-holder ``from day 1,'' Potechin said the 
idea for the lawsuit came while when he and his friends were having 
a beer after a round of golf. While they were complaining about 
Yashin's holdout, Cogan walked in. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what happens in court, Potechin said, the group has  
``already won'' by forcing both sides to remember the fans. But the 
real victory for the self-described hockey nut would be to get 
Yashin back into a Senators uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy is worth the price of admission. He's an outstanding  
player, no question about it,'' Potechin said. ``I just find it 
unacceptable that star hockey players would withhold their services 
for a buck.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Basketball Pioneer McLendon Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio (AP) -- Basketball Hall of Famer John  
McLendon, the last surviving student of Dr. James Naismith, the 
sport's creator, died Friday at his home. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	McLendon served as a consultant to the NBA's Toronto Raptors  
from their inception. 
</P>
<P>
	``He accumulated a lot of wisdom and perspective, and he brought  
some common sense to the table,'' Raptors general manager Glen 
Grunwald said. ``He was always able to cut to the meat of an issue 
in a folksy kind of way. We'll miss him a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLendon played at the University of Kansas in the early 1930s  
under Naismith. 
</P>
<P>
	In those days, blacks were barred from the university pool even  
though swimming was a graduation requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I jumped in and they drained the pool,'' McLendon recalled  
several years ago. ``Dr. Naismith wasn't about to have any of that 
so he sent over three of the biggest men on the basketball team to 
sit by the pool every time I swam. The administration wasn't happy, 
but there were no problems after that. '' 
</P>
<P>
	McLendon went on to a 25-year coaching career and was inducted  
into the Hall of Fame in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the first college coach to win three consecutive national  
titles, with Tennessee State of the NAIA from 1957 to 1959. The 
following season, he became the first African-American professional 
coach with the Cleveland Pipers of the American Basketball League. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Joanna; daughters, Querida Banks of  
Silver Spring, Md., and Nanette Adams of Shaker Heights; a son, 
David Bryant of Cleveland Heights; five grandchildren; four 
great-grandchildren; two sisters and a brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Services will be Wednesday in Cleveland.

	Clinton Seeks Delay for Test Ban Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an effort to avert defeat, President  
Clinton Friday appealed to the Senate to delay acting on the 
nuclear test ban treaty, agreeing the vote could be put off beyond 
the 2000 presidential election. Senate Democrats, meanwhile, worked 
on a plan to force postponement of next week's vote if Republican 
leaders decline Clinton's request. Senate Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle said Democrats may invoke a seldom-used parliamentary 
procedure that would block further action.

	TEZIUTLAN, Mexico (AP) -- Digging into mounds of mud with  
buckets, shovels and their bare hands, soldiers and survivors 
searched desperately Friday for people buried alive when hillsides 
collapsed in southeastern Mexico after more than a week of 
relentless rain. At least 267 people were confirmed dead from the 
floods, but the number ``is rising by the hour,'' President Ernesto 
Zedillo said Friday during a visit to this devastated city, 110 
miles east of Mexico City. Calling it ``the tragedy of the 
decade,'' Zedillo promised government help for families who have 
lost homes.

	Search for Colo. Boy Ends Unsuccessfully  
</P>
<P>
	RUSTIC, Colo. (AP) -- Rescuers ended the search for a missing  
3-year-old boy on Friday after a week of searching the rugged 
Colorado mountains. Jaryd Atadero vanished while on a hike with his 
6-year-old sister and 11 members of a Christian group who were 
staying at a cabin resort run by their father, Allyn Atadero, a 
physical education teacher. Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden 
called off the search after a half-dozen searchers and a couple of 
dogs again failed to turn up any evidence of the boy's location. 
Investigators believe he probably died from a fall in the rocky 
terrain or from exposure, as the nights have been in the 20s.

	Floyd Causes Sewage-Tainted Floodwaters  
</P>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Sewage-tainted floodwaters from Hurricane  
Floyd are creating a growing ``dead zone'' in Pamlico Sound where 
fish and other aquatic life cannot survive. The brown freshwater 
plume sits atop the salt water, robbing it of oxygen from surface 
air and reducing its salinity. Both ingredients are essential for 
aquatic life. ``What we're seeing is an ecological event on the 
catastrophic scale,'' said Hans Paerl, a marine scientist at the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

the nation's largest auto insurer committed fraud by its use of

	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- With a battle line drawn, the United Auto  
Workers continued negotiations with Ford Motor Co. as a midnight 
strike deadline approached. Both sides remained tightlipped about 
the status of the negotiations. UAW officials have said they were 
opposed to Ford's plans to spin off or sell its parts unit, which 
employs 23,500 UAW workers. The new contract would cover about 
100,000 hourly workers.

themselves among the pythons and other wild animals -- including 
each other. The last contestant on the island wins $1 million. The 
players must work together to survive, but every three days they 
will hold secret ballots to expel a fellow contestant. When the

kicked off the island will decide who ends up the winner.

Piazza, with John Olerud driving in three runs and keying a big 
sixth inning for a 9-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks and a 
2-1 lead in the NL division series. Rick Reed, pitching to backup 
Todd Pratt, worked six strong innings. After Olerud and Darryl 
Hamilton hit two-run singles in the sixth, the Mets' bullpen and a 
loud crowd of 56,180 closed out the first postseason game at Shea 
Stadium since 1988. New York gets its chance to advance to the next 
round tomorrow afternoon in Game 4.

<TEXT>
<P>
	VEVEY, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss food and beverage conglomerate  
Nestle is selling its Findus brand and parts of its frozen food 
business in Europe to the Swedish investment group EQT Scandinavia 
BV for undisclosed terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Nestle said Friday the deal includes all of its frozen food  
activities in Britain and Scandinavia as well as parts of the 
business, mainly vegetables and fish, in five other European 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Those businesses being sold generate about $608 million in  
sales, Nestle said in a statement. They employ about 3,500 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nestle, which had $51.6 billion in sales overall last year, said  
it will keep its frozen lines of prepared dishes, pizzas and snacks 
in continental Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and to  
``consultation procedures with the workforce in some countries.''

<HEADLINE> JAMA Names Woman New Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A vice dean at the Johns Hopkins medical school  
was appointed on Friday as the first woman to head the Journal of 
the American Medical Association in its 116-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Catherine D. De Angelis succeeds an editor fired after the  
influential journal published a survey of college students' sexual 
attitudes that coincided with President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``JAMA is now positioned and poised for the 21st century,'' said  
Dr. Roger Rosenberg, chairman of the search committee that 
appointed De Angelis. 
</P>
<P>
	He was joined by Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson, the AMA's chief  
executive officer, and Dr. D. Ted Lewers, the chair of its board of 
trustees, who said De Angelis' new position makes her ``one of the 
most influential voices in all of medicine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Angelis, who assumes her new Chicago-based post in January,  
is now editor in chief of the AMA's Archives of Pediatrics &AMP; 
Adolescent Medicine and a member of JAMA's editorial board. 
</P>
<P>
	A pediatrician, she has authored more than 150 papers as well as  
books. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scranton, Penn., native became a nurse in 1960, and  
completed medical school at the University of Pittsburgh in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	De Angelis' predecessor, Dr. George Lundberg, was fired in  
January, provoking a controversy over the journal's editorial 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who also is the AMA's executive vice president, felt  
Lundberg inappropriately injected the organization into a political 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg, now the editor in chief for an online medical  
information site, was highly critical of the AMA after his firing, 
saying he had to battle AMA leaders, members and lobbyists to 
retain editorial independence of his publication. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked, De Angelis said she was not offered any guidelines  
about editing the journal in the wake of Lundberg's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA has since created a board to serve as a buffer between  
the editor in chief and the organization's management. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt that editorial freedom will be the byword,''  
said De Angelis. 
</P>
<P>
	She said in addition to the journal's standard fare of  
groundbreaking scientific news, she also will focus on issues 
linked to women's and children's health.

3-year-old boy on Friday after a week of searching the rugged

	Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden called off the search after  
a half-dozen searchers and a couple of dogs again failed to turn up 
any evidence of the boy's location. 
</P>
<P>
	Several searchers who don't want to give up will be allowed to  
return to the wilderness area about 80 miles northwest of Denver, 
sheriff's Deputy Cindy Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trail will be closed to the public through the weekend at  
least, partly because officials are concerned that the wreckage of 
an Air Force helicopter that crashed during the search hasn't been 
completely removed. Five people on board suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 70 searchers, trackers and dog teams had tried to  
find the boy in the Poudre Canyon since he disappeared on Oct. 2. 
Jaryd vanished when he ran ahead of one bunch of hikers and failed 
to catch up with a second group. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gordon said trick winds in the canyon complicated the  
search. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kind of swirl around. Any scent that is there is kind of  
mixed up,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Jury Winding Down Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The top prosecutor investigating JonBenet  
Ramsey's death hinted Friday an announcement may be imminent in the 
nearly 3-year-old case. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunted told reporters to  
stay in contact with his office over the weekend. But later, his 
spokeswoman, Suzanne Laurion, said: ``Alex told me to tell you 
there will be no public statements on the Ramsey case today or this 
weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She declined further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury that has been considering evidence for nearly 13  
months met Friday and was scheduled to meet again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Hunter said the jury was wrapping up its work, but  
emphasized it's only part of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The normally tight-lipped Hunter also thanked other prosecutors  
who had helped and said his wife told him as he left for work: ``Go 
get 'em ... go get 'em.'' He smiled, but offered no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter has been under pressure for three years to find the child  
beauty queen's killer. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet was found strangled, bound and beaten in her home on  
Dec. 26, 1996, about seven hours after her mother, Patsy Ramsey, 
called 911 to report the girl was missing. She told police she had 
found a 2 1/2-page note demanding $118,000 for JonBenet's safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parents have been considered suspects, and both have said  
they are innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury met Thursday and Friday, the first back-to-back  
session in months. Some jurors were at the courthouse earlier in 
the week to review evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel has an Oct. 20 deadline to issue indictments, issue a  
report or disband without taking action.

<HEADLINE> Ali's Daughter Making Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERONA, N.Y. (AP) -- With a grin, Laila Ali predicted a win. In  
her mind, the bout will be a rout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to knock her out,'' Laila said Thursday on the eve  
of her first professional boxing match. ``I'm coming to knock 
somebody out, not just to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laila, the second-youngest of Muhammad Ali's nine children, will  
make her debut tonight at Turning Stone Casino against April 
Fowler, a veteran of one pro fight. Laila promised that her 
infectious smile, which lit up a room full of microphones and 
cameras, would soon disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see me tomorrow, you're going to see a whole 'nother  
look,'' she promised. ``Right now, I have cameras in my face and 
I'm a very charming person. That other side of me is showing, but 
tomorrow is going to be a whole 'nother story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Fowler was not impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't tell me it was her for two weeks,'' Fowler said.  
``When I accepted the fight, I did not know it was her. After I 
found out it was her, I freaked out. Then after they told me she's 
never even been in the ring, I kind of eased up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler, who lost her debut way back in March 1998, came dressed  
in black. If she was nervous, she easily hid any anxiety behind a 
pair of dark sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just a name to me,'' said the 5-foot-6 native of  
Michigan City, Ind., who weighed in at just under 164 pounds. ``I'm 
not getting in the ring with her father, I'm getting in the ring 
with her. The pressure's not on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laila was all too aware of that. Because of the hoopla, she has  
requested that the fight not be shown on television or videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's enough pressure on me as it is,'' said the 5-foot-10  
Laila, who weighed in at 168. ``I've said what I have to say. Now I 
have to deliver. I don't know exactly how I'm going to feel, but 
I'm comfortable in the ring. It will be a new feeling for me. I 
know what I'm capable of doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be staged in a 2,600-seat auditorium, and 600  
tickets were still available late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Providing room for the media promised to be more challenging  
than attaining a sellout. Promoter Mike Acri said about 90 
journalists from faraway places such as France, Germany, Italy, 
Sweden, Holland, Brazil and Japan will be there to record the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	The headliner of the seven-bout card understood all the fuss.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know you guys are not here for me,'' said 34-year-old  
Donovan ``Razor'' Ruddock, who will continue his comeback against 
journeyman Jose Ribalta in a 10-round bout. ``She's taking all my 
press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laila said her mother, Veronica, the third of Muhammad Ali's  
four wives, will be there, but she wasn't sure about her father. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like my father to be here, but it goes two ways,''  
said Laila, who operates a nail salon in Los Angeles in her spare 
time. ``Even though he's my dad and he's around me and my boxing 
career, it makes me nervous because he is the greatest and I feel 
like I can't do things wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That her parents weren't thrilled with her decision to box was  
not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm totally fine with the fact that he doesn't really want me  
to box,'' said Laila, 21, who was too young to see her father fight 
in person. ``He'd rather me just go to school like I was going to. 
He doesn't want me to get hurt, but he never once told me not to 
box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So box she will.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll feel better about this whole thing after I fight because  
there's so many questions, so many people wondering, so many 
expectations,'' said Laila, who was 7 when her parents divorced. 
``I'm the one you guys are going to be looking at. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I don't feel like everyone's here for just me.  
It's the name. That is what puts the pressure on me. I'm always 
going to be recognized as Muhammad Ali's daughter. I can't say, `I 
want everyone just to see me for me' because that's not going to 
happen until I do what I need to do.''

<HEADLINE> McCain To Discuss Wife's Addiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain and his  
wife Cindy are going on national television this weekend to discuss 
her past addiction to painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain acknowledges in a Dateline NBC interview with Jane Pauley  
that he missed warning signs of his wife's 1989-1992 addiction to 
prescription drugs while he was in the midst of his own scandal in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should've understood,'' McCain said. ``I should've detected  
this earlier on. Clearly there were signs ... I'd call almost every 
day and sometimes she would sound a little bleary and unconnected 
and I would think she's just tired or sleepy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, in the interview to be broadcast Sunday, said he still  
feels partially responsible. ``And maybe I was wrapped up too much 
in Washington and my ambitions to pay as much attention as I should 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the story of Mrs. McCain's addiction has been widely  
reported in Arizona, the lawmaker's home state, it has not been the 
subject of much national attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The McCains decided to address the issue now, rather than wait  
for his political opponents to bring it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McCain said she got the prescription pain medicines through  
a charity she founded, the American Voluntary Medical Team. A 
doctor wrote prescriptions at her direction for medical missions 
worldwide, and she sometimes doubled the amount of medication 
needed, keeping some for her own use. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Pauley interview, Mrs. McCain said she hid her addiction  
from everyone, including her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said she did not deprive people who needed the drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	``I took a good portion of them, but I didn't take all of  
them,'' Mrs. McCain said. ``I have done good things and the best 
thing I've done is go into recovery and stay drug-free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the time of Mrs. McCain's addiction, her husband and four  
other senators were being investigated for interceding with a 
federal regulator on behalf of savings and loan figure Charles 
Keating. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating eventually was convicted of fraud in California and  
federal courts for bilking investors out of hundreds of millions of 
dollars. Those convictions have since been overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain received a mild rebuke from the Senate Ethics Committee  
for exercising poor judgment in the Keating affair.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tries To Reassure Chretien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- He is sitting down with a leading Quebec  
separatist, but President Clinton also hopes to use his one-day 
visit to assure Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien that he holds 
fast to the notion of a united Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton arrived in Ottawa late Thursday night for a brief visit  
to address a conference on federalism and dedicate a new U.S. 
Embassy -- benign activity that the White House says reflects the 
placid nature of U.S.-Canadian relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our two nations, the harmony we seek to promote within, the  
friendship we seek to promote between us, has shown the world a 
better way and given ourselves a great responsibility for the new 
millenium,'' Clinton said at the embassy dedication. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton also was meeting today with Lucien Bouchard,  
separatist premier of Quebec, which has held two referendums on 
independence. The White House played down the significance of the 
meeting, and took pains to point out that it does not signify an 
official embrace of independence for the French-speaking province. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position on this issue is longstanding. It is an internal  
issue for Canadians to resolve,'' said White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart. ``A strong and united Canada is a great model for the 
world and a great partner for the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart cast Clinton's session with Bouchard as rather routine  
in nature. ``It is traditional that we pay a courtesy call on 
provincial leaders. We do that every place,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chretien told reporters Thursday that he is comfortable that  
there has been no shift in U.S. policy regarding Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the position of Mr. Clinton,'' Chretien said. ``He was  
very clear when he came to Canada. Remember, he said, `Vive le 
Canada.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Chretien was referring to a comment Clinton made during his last  
official visit in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Chretien said the new embassy, with its view of the Canadian  
Parliament headquarters, is ``a lasting symbol of the abiding 
warmth of our relationship.'' He called Clinton's visit ``a sign to 
Canadians of the respect you have for our nation and the values you 
place on our friendship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The cornerstone of the Canada-U.S. partnership remains firm.  
... This is a day to celebrate a new beginning in an old 
friendship,'' the prime minister said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton opened his fifth visit to Canada by inaugurating the new  
$37 million embassy, then meeting with Chretien in his office at 
Parliament. Their agenda includes discussing agriculture, and more 
than $1 billion in trade that flows daily across the U.S.-Canadian 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was to fly by helicopter to Mont Tremblant, a  
Quebec resort north of Montreal, to address the federalism 
conference. The three-day meeting, which drew about 600 delegates, 
was billed as a nonpartisan exchange of ideas among academics and 
decision-makers. 
</P>
<P>
	It is at Mont Tremblant that Clinton was meeting Bouchard, who  
managed to buttonhole another conference participant, Mexican 
President Ernesto Zedillo, on Wednesday. Clinton and Bouchard met 
on a previous Clinton visit, when Bouchard served as leader of the 
official opposition in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebec, an enclave of 7 million, is largely dissatisfied with  
the Canadian federal system. Less than a year ago, its residents 
re-elected a government dedicated to splitting off from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchard told conference participants Wednesday to ``pay  
attention not only to federalism's successes, which are undeniable, 
but also to its failures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois promised a third  
referendum on independence before the end of his current mandate in 
2003, enthusiasm for the idea seems to be waning. Recent polls show 
support for Quebec sovereignty has fallen as low as 41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After addressing the federalism conference, Clinton was flying  
to Chicago, where he was addressing U.S. Hispanic leaders on 
Saturday before returning to Washington.

<P>
	PAINESVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- If someone got Penny Page angry, she  
signed them up for a magazine subscription -- or a hundred. A judge 
sent her to jail for two months on forgery charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Page, 46, sent a total of 350 magazine subscriptions to a

<HEADLINE> CBS Show To Strand 16 Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cross MTV's ``Real World'' with ``Lord of the  
Flies'' and what do you get? 
</P>
<P>
	A new CBS game show that will strand 16 Americans on an  
uninhabited island in the South China Sea to fend for themselves 
among the pythons and other wild animals -- including each other. 
The last contestant on the island wins $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even the network is sure how the players on ``Survivor''  
will cooperate or compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a double-edged sword,'' CBS spokesman Michael Naidus said  
Friday. ``They need each other to survive, but they know only one 
can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen men and women, to be selected from applications filed  
through CBS's Web site through Nov. 16, will be filmed 
round-the-clock during as much as seven weeks on Pulau Tiga island 
off Malaysia's Borneo coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine ``Gilligan's Island'' where the stakes and the setting  
are genuine. 
</P>
<P>
	The players must work together to survive, but every three days  
they will hold secret ballots to expel a fellow contestant. When 
the group is whittled down to the final pair, those most recently 
kicked off the island will decide who ends up the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The criteria are up to the participants, said producer Mark  
Burnett. Those voted out early on will be returned home, while 
those who will be casting the final ballots will remain in 
Malaysia, keeping an eye on the contestants through videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	A Swedish version of the show has been on there for three years  
and is a smash ratings hit. Charlie Parsons, a veteran British TV 
producer who created the idea, sold the U.S. and Canadian rights to 
Burnett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine the chance to take seven weeks out of your life, all  
expenses paid, get a leave of absence from work,'' said Burnett. 
``It's like living a National Geographic experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a fishbowl.  
</P>
<P>
	Burnett called it fair to draw comparisons to ``Real World,''  
which puts young people's unguarded daily lives on camera, and to 
``Lord of the Flies,'' the 1954 William Golding novel about kids 
who survive a plane crash only to descend into barbarism on an 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	``While not survival on the edge of death, it's a very  
forbidding island,'' Burnett said. ``I'm sure there's going to be 
major conflicts, but I don't expect them to be hunting each other 
with spears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, there will be rules to bar serious misbehavior. Burnett  
said contestants in the Swedish version have tended to vote out the 
least sociable people. In that sense, it's a sort of 
survival-of-the-fittest -- and the nicest. 
</P>
<P>
	Fruit, fish and fresh water are abundant, Burnett said, and each  
contestant can bring one thing from the outside world, besides 
clothing and necessary medicine. On the Swedish series, contestants 
have picked such diverse items as a Bible, toothbrush and toilet 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone smart will bring a fishing line,'' Burnett suggested.  
</P>
<P>
	Medical specialists will be placed away from the group on the  
10-square-mile island in case of emergency, said CBS spokesman 
Chris Ender. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the contestants will have background checks, medical  
screenings and psychological evaluations. We will make sure 
everybody headed for Malaysia is ready for the experience,'' Ender 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-episode series will air next summer.  
</P>
<P>
	Neal Gabler, author of ``Life The Movie,'' said the program may  
seem outrageous but reflects the evolution of popular culture. 
People want to see real human behavior, not fictional 
entertainment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life has thrown up to us so many interesting narratives that  
fiction can't compete,'' Gabler said. ``How can anything in 
conventional entertainment compete with an O.J. Simpson or a Monica 
Lewinsky? We now want the real thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett had a much simpler explanation: ``People like to watch  
other people in uncomfortable situations.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Players Allegedly Bilked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Several NFL players apparently were victims  
of a high-roller accused by federal investigators of bilking 
investors for at least $31 million, the Austin American-Statesman 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents believe the players, including three members of the  
Arizona Cardinals and one Cleveland Browns player, contributed to a 
$5.5 million investment wired to Brian Russell Stearns by Los 
Angeles sports agent Robert Caron. 
</P>
<P>
	Stearns, 29, was arrested at his $2.2 million Lake Austin home  
last month. The FBI seized the house, two jets worth more than $10 
million, a $2 million helicopter and $800,000 in vehicles, plus 
undisclosed amounts of money in bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	According to investigators, Stearns conned a Georgia man for  
$3.3 million, a New York man for $26 million, and might have conned 
more than $4 million from about 100 residents of Brady, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in New York this week indicted Stearns on a  
charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Stearns, who has 
maintained his innocence through an attorney, remains in Bastrop 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	In court documents unsealed Thursday, Cardinals players Eric  
Swann, Johnny McWilliams and Larry Centers, who now plays for the 
Washington Redskins, all invested money with Stearns. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals wide receiver Chad Carpenter, who was propositioned to  
join the investor group, told Internal Revenue Service 
investigators that Browns offensive lineman Lomas Brown invested 
$300,000 to $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported that FBI agents believe the players gave  
Stearns the money through Caron. 
</P>
<P>
	Caron told the Statesman he knew Stearns but had nothing to do  
with the investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think right now would be a good time to comment,'' he  
said. ``It is a surprise to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stearns has been accused of selling bogus securities to people  
he lured by saying he was a ``master investor'' who knew the 
secrets to overseas markets that could bring a 40 percent return 
every 35 days.

<HEADLINE> AP Names Editorial Services Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim Gallivan, a specialist in news technology  
for The Associated Press, has been named to the new position of 
coordinator of editorial services. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment was announced today by Vice President and  
Executive Editor William Ahearn. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallivan, who has been AP's director of news technology, will  
help news managers develop new services for AP members, subscribers 
and commercial clients. He also will coordinate efforts to enhance 
traditional services for member Web sites and other distribution 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallivan joined the AP in 1979 as an editorial clerk at AP  
headquarters. Three years later he joined a technology group 
responsible for the cooperative's news, election and e-mail 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallivan has managed that group -- now called News Technology --  
since 1987, first as systems editor, then as director. In 1996 he 
won the Gramling Achievement Award, a $10,000 employee prize, for 
his contribution to the redesign and support of AP's news computer 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallivan, 49, is a native of Salt Lake City.

<HEADLINE> Minimum Wage Increase Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats acknowledge that an  
increase in the $5.15-an-hour wage is all but inevitable, but many 
are looking for a way to offset the estimated $16 billion cost to 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Under legislation circulating in the House, the minimum wage  
would rise $1 over three years and businesses would get $35 billion 
in tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about two dollars of tax relief for every dollar it's  
costing,'' Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who is part of a group drafting 
the measure, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio declined to provide details and cautioned that the bill  
was still in flux. But congressional sources familiar with the 
draft who spoke on condition of anonymity said it would increase 
the minimum wage by 33 cents the first year, 33 cents the second 
year and 34 cents in the final year. 
</P>
<P>
	A centerpiece of the five-year tax relief package would be a  
phased-in reduction in estate tax rates, a top priority for small 
business groups. It would be similar to the estate tax reductions 
in the 10-year, $792 billion GOP tax cut vetoed by President 
Clinton but would stop short of repeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the bill would also increase the deduction  
for business meals, boost a reforestation credit for timber 
companies, extend an expiring credit for businesses that hire from 
certain hard-to-employ groups, make health insurance 100 percent 
tax deductible for the self-employed and expand pensions and 
401(k)s, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the tax cuts would take effect in 2001, meaning sponsors  
would not have to find a way to pay for it in 2000. Lazio said any 
tax relief after 2000 would use part of the projected non-Social 
Security surplus, which could trigger a veto threat from President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, House Democrats began circulating a petition  
aimed at forcing a floor vote on a straight $1 minimum wage 
increase over two years. Democrats are also looking at a business 
tax relief package but would probably pay the costs by closing 
corporate tax shelters and other revenue offsets.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks Bumble Away Game 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This is not how the Arizona Diamondbacks won the  
National League West Division. 
</P>
<P>
	For a team so aware of fundamentals that the shortstop and  
second baseman back up the mound in case of overthrows back to the 
pitcher, the Diamondbacks came apart at the seams Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was a 9-2 blowout by the New York Mets that put  
Arizona one loss away from elimination in the NL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	There were three errors and eight walks as Arizona played like  
an expansion team, which, of course, is what the second-year team 
was supposed to be this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won 100 games, 101 now,'' manager Buck Showalter said on  
the eve of Game 3. ``Nothing's going to happen to make me feel 
different about this club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, plenty did.  
</P>
<P>
	Starter Omar Daal helped New York to its first run with a couple  
of walks in the second inning. Then shortstop Andy Fox's overthrow 
on an attempted double play allowed another Mets run in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Daal kicked a ball into foul territory, helping create a  
bases-loaded jam for himself in the fourth. Then Tony Womack kicked 
a ball around in right field, compounding the damage in a six-run 
Mets sixth that included three more walks. 
</P>
<P>
	Daal and Womack were particularly disgusted with themselves.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got behind in the count so many times,'' the Arizona starter  
said. ``I just didn't do my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the happiest guy right now,'' Womack said. ``It  
happened. Mistakes happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're good enough without giving them extra outs,''  
Showalter said. ``You do that, you're going to pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was not characteristic of the way we played this year.''  
</P>
<P>
	All in all, not pretty.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight we struggled and we paid for it,'' Steve Finley said.  
``We've got a great defense. Tonight we didn't execute and make the 
plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Mets were perfect on defense including a  
sparkling play by shortstop Rey Ordonez on Matt Williams leading 
off the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	When Showalter's team got in trouble in the sixth, he went to  
the bullpen for left-hander Dan Plesac to face the Mets left-handed 
hitters. The move made sense. Plesac has been poison on left-handed 
batters this season, limiting them to a .186 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
	So, of course, lefties John Olerud and Darryl Hamilton both  
reached him for two-run singles that broke the game wide open. 
</P>
<P>
	It was typical on a night when almost nothing went right for  
Showalter and the Diamondbacks.

<HEADLINE> Moseley-Braun Nominated As Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Carol Moseley-Braun, who served one term as the  
nation's first black female senator but lost a bitter re-election 
fight, has been nominated by President Clinton as ambassador to New 
Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun, an Illinois Democrat, had been under discussion  
for months as a potential nominee. The nomination, announced 
Friday, requires Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am delighted,'' Moseley-Braun said. ``I'm very pleased. I  
look forward to the hearing by the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House first raised the ambassadorship with her in  
December, shortly after she lost her bid for re-election to Peter 
Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald used his personal fortune to attack Moseley-Braun on  
several controversies that had surrounded her during her term. She 
was heavily criticized for a 1996 visit to a Nigerian dictator and 
never-proven allegations that she used 1993 campaign funds to pay 
for personal luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving office, she has spent time on the lecture circuit  
and worked part-time for the Clinton administration's push to use 
more federal dollars to rebuild public school buildings. The 
$56-an-hour job for the Education Department involves giving 
speeches to boost the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun was the lead supporter in Congress of a bill to  
provide $22 billion to build and modernize 5,000 schools nationwide 
over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	She also served in the Illinois General Assembly and as Cook  
County recorder of deeds. She has degrees from the University of 
Illinois and the University of Chicago Law School.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Runoff Creates 'Dead Zone' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- There's a new problem from Hurricane  
Floyd's deluge: Sewage-tainted floodwaters are creating a growing 
``dead zone'' in Pamlico Sound where fish and other aquatic life 
cannot survive, scientists said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The brown freshwater plume containing human and animal waste is  
flowing into coastal estuaries. It sits atop the salt water, 
robbing the salt water of oxygen from surface air and reducing its 
salinity. 
</P>
<P>
	Both ingredients are essential for aquatic life.  
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing is an ecological event on the catastrophic  
scale,'' said Hans Paerl, a marine scientist at the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on eastern North Carolina on  
Sept. 16, killing at least 48 people as it flooded hog lagoons and 
sewer plants, homes and cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting sludge is flowing from the Neuse and Tar rivers  
into Pamlico Sound, the nation's second-largest estuary, and from 
the Cape Fear River near Wilmington into the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest affected area is a 350-square-mile expanse of  
Pamlico Sound and part of adjacent Core Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Paerl said he found drastically low oxygen levels in the bottom  
waters of Pamlico Sound -- 1 milligram per liter, compared to the 
normal 7 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
	While fisherman have to avoid the dead zone, they still have  
been able to catch fish and shrimp in areas not affected by the 
dirty water, said Nancy Fish, a spokeswoman for the state Division 
of Marine Fisheries. Initial testing showed the catch was safe to 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paerl and other scientists said it may be next spring or  
summer before the runoff's long-term effect on the sound and the 
Atlantic is known. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, massive flooding doubled the size of a Gulf of Mexico  
``dead zone'' that some scientists believe was caused by fertilizer 
runoffs in the Mississippi River basin. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation in Pamlico Sound, an estuary second in size only  
to Chesapeake Bay, especially concerns scientists because 
pollutants won't readily be flushed into the ocean. The Pamlico has 
just three inlets to the Atlantic, and most of the sound's water 
leaves via evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sound is acting like a giant bathtub,'' Paerl said. Making  
matters worse, he said, is that the pollutants become more 
concentrated as water evaporates. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the Cape Fear coast, the runoff is at least 40 feet deep and  
covers 300 square miles, said Larry Cahoon, marine scientist at the 
University of North Carolina at Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a brown ocean right now,'' Cahoon said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cahoon said Cape Fear never experienced plummeting oxygen levels  
because of its rapid water flow. But he said the brown color is 
indicative of a large amount of nutrients that could eventually 
feed algae blooms that use up oxygen and kill fish.

<HEADLINE> Education Association Endorses Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's largest teachers' union today  
endorsed Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, saying he ``understands what children need to start 
school ready to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement by the National Education Association was the  
second of its kind in three days for Gore, who is being challenged 
by former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. On Tuesday, the American 
Federation of Teachers, the second-largest teachers union in the 
country, announced its support for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president is still courting the endorsement of the  
AFL-CIO, the federation backed by 13 million labor members. Gore 
was once thought to be assured of the endorsement, but Bradley has 
been aggressive in seeking it and some of the federation's 68 
member organizations have questioned Gore's ability to win in a 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO is holding its biennial convention next week in Los  
Angeles. On Thursday, President Clinton met with Teamsters 
President Jim Hoffa in New York, although he denied he was trying 
to spur support for Gore. The Teamsters are the largest union in 
the AFL-CIO, and Hoffa has been critical of an early endorsement 
and the administration's support for the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In its endorsement, the 2.5 million-member National Education  
Association said it was backing Gore because of his support for 
full funding of Head Start, a preschool program for poor children, 
as well as for expanded preschool and afterschool programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The association also praised Gore for ``leading the charge'' for  
smaller class sizes and school reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore has earned our support,'' said NEA President Bob  
Chase. ``Time and again he has stood up for children and public 
education. Now it is time -- proudly and enthusiastically -- for us 
to stand with Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call seeking reaction from the Bradley campaign was not  
immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Va. Lab Has Blast Tenderizing Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENA VISTA, Va. (AP) -- Coming soon to your supermarket meat  
counter: a dynamite new way to tenderize cube steaks, pot roasts 
and brisket. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydrodyne Inc., a Puerto Rico-based research company, has  
discovered a way to immerse packaged, leathery cuts of meat into 
water, send a shock wave through it by detonating a small explosive 
charge and -- voila! -- melt-in-your-mouth meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the company is on the verge of signing a deal with a major  
meat processor that will bring this technology to market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This method will essentially make lower grade meats more  
valuable than they were before,'' Hydrodyne president Stanford 
Klapper said. ``The consumer will be able to pay a lower price for 
meat, but still get higher grade quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Klapper said, a low-quality steak that may cost  
$1.99 per pound in a supermarket today may cost $2.49 after it's 
been through the Hydrodyne process. But that cut of meat will be as 
tasty and tender as a $5.99 per pound strip steak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hydrodyne method -- tested in a Buena Vista lab -- works by  
lowering a metal basket filled with about 400 pounds of 
vacuum-packed meat into a sealed, water-filled vat anchored in 
concrete. Then, an explosive charge the size of an orange is 
detonated from above, sending supersonic shockwaves rebounding back 
and forth through the meat. The shockwaves tear certain fibers that 
bind muscle tissue, thus tenderizing the meat without changing its 
appearance or flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hydrodyne process requires no government approval because it  
does not penetrate the meat packaging or introduce any foreign 
substances into the meat, Klapper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new method will shave days, perhaps months off the time it  
takes to tenderize meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydrodyne's staff occasionally tests meat after it's blasted. A  
bottle of steak sauce sits in the fridge as an aid to the testers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good. I definitely can tell the difference,'' said staff  
member Ron Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Surplus meat is donated to the Natural Bridge Zoo for tiger  
food. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hydrodyne process was invented by John Long, 79, a retired  
nuclear weapons designer who holds several patents besides the one 
for Hydrodyne. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg Brown &AMP; Root, a subsidiary of Dallas-based Halliburton  
Co., has exclusive rights to design, build, operate and maintain 
Hydrodyne equipment in meat processing plants worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Long came up with the idea for using explosives to tenderize  
meat in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Morse Solomon, research leader of the USDA's meat science lab in  
Beltsville, Md., said the Hydrodyne process has the potential to 
revolutionize the meat industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland lab has a small prototype of the Hydrodyne system  
and has conducted its own tests through a research and development 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydrodyne officials say the process also works on pork chops,  
chicken and lamb. 
</P>
<P>
	But some people in the meat trade still need some convincing.  
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds exciting, but I'd have to see it to believe it,''  
said William O'Brien, whose family owns O'Brien Meats in Salem. ``I 
guess it's possible in this new age we're in now. My father was 
leery about cooking meat on an electric stove back in his day. I 
wonder what he'd think about microwaves and now this?''

<HEADLINE> IBM Cuts Up To 1,000 PC Div. Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM is cutting up to 10 percent of its personal  
computer workforce, or up to 1,000 workers, in a cost-cutting 
effort to turn around the division, which lost nearly $1 billion 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5 percent to 10 percent reduction in the 10,000-person staff  
will mostly hit marketing employees as the company consolidates its 
staff for different brands -- including Aptiva PCs, ThinkPad laptops 
and Netfinity computer servers -- under one marketing umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM notified employees Wednesday of the cuts, which will be  
completed by the end of the year. The company, which employs 
291,000 people overall, does not expect any layoffs and said it 
will offer employees jobs in other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which pioneered the personal computer industry in the early  
1980s, lost about $150 million in the second quarter in the unit, 
which sells PCs to both consumers and businesses. Fierce price wars 
have sharply reduced profits at major computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM has been struggling to repair its so-called Personal Systems  
Group for several years, and some analysts have even suggested that 
IBM should stop selling personal computers. Last summer, IBM 
replaced the head of its consumer PC division with Michael Braun, 
but Braun's role is unclear now that IBM has folded the unit with 
the operation that sells PCs to businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to do better, and we know it. That's the reaosn behind  
these actions,'' IBM spokeswoman Trink Guarino said today. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM plans to release its third-quarter financial results Oct.  
20. The company is making an aggressive effort to emphasize its 
faster-growing businesses, which include selling computer services 
to large corporations and selling software. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of IBM were down more than 4 percent, to $4.93 3/4 at  
$111.43 3/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Celtics Welcome Back Russell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Hall of Famer Bill Russell, who won 11 NBA  
championships in 13 years with Boston, will return to the Celtics 
next week to work with the team's big men. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in Coach (Rick) Pitino and our Celtic team. They  
have heart, they're smart, they're talented and they have the 
ability to be winners,'' Russell said in a statement released by 
the team. ``If I can be of any help, I'll try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell had remained out of the public eye for much of the time  
since his playing days ended in 1969. But he returned to Boston in 
May for a tribute in his honor, and decided he missed being a part 
of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the Boston Celtics,'' he said. ``The pride I feel for  
the uniform, my teammates, my coach and our fans -- Celtic pride -- 
is a way of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell was expected to observe the team at practice on Sunday  
and work with the players Monday and Tuesday. Practice is closed to 
the public.

<HEADLINE> Bombing Defendant Seeks Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A survivor of the Oklahoma City bombing  
says he believes that Michael Fortier is genuinely sorry for not 
telling authorities what he knew about the bomb plot before the 
blast. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Paul Heath said Fortier's remorse is not enough to  
justify releasing him from prison after 4 years and two months. 
Fortier is scheduled to appear before a federal judge for a 
resentencing hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family prays that the judge certainly doesn't let him out  
for time served,'' said Heath, a Veterans Administration 
psychologist who heads a survivors group. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, 30, of Kingman, Ariz., has been in prison since  
pleading guilty in August 1995 to having advance knowledge of the 
plot to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The April 19, 
1995 bombing killed 168 people and injured hundreds more. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pleaded guilty to trafficking in guns the government  
says were stolen to finance the bombing, hiding evidence and lying 
to FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Van Bebber sentenced Fortier to 12  
years in prison -- a sentence that was set aside by the 10th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The appellate court granted Fortier a new sentencing hearing in  
June, ruling that Van Bebber used the wrong guidelines to decide 
the length of his prison term. It said that involuntary 
manslaughter guidelines should have been used, not those for 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier's attorneys maintain that his cooperation with  
government prosecutors at the trials of convicted bomber Timothy 
McVeigh and co-conspirator Terry Nichols qualify him to be 
``released immediately for time served.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier's initial sentencing was delayed nearly three years  
until after the trials of both men. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was convicted of murder, conspiracy and weapons charges.  
He is appealing his death sentence. Nichols was convicted of 
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy and sentenced to life in 
prison.

<HEADLINE> Labor, Religious Groups Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Organized labor and organized religion are  
coming together in new ways. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, unions and activist clergy have worked together  
informally to organize Hispanic and black workers trapped in 
low-income service jobs traditionally ignored by the labor 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the AFL-CIO prepares to open its annual convention on  
Monday, union leaders and religious groups want to solidify the 
relationship with a formal plan to boost wages and improve working 
conditions on farms and in hotels, restaurants and other low-wage 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that human beings are created in the image of God,  
and deserving of dignity and respect,'' AFL-CIO President John 
Sweeney said Friday in a speech kicking off a three-day gathering 
of union and religious leaders preceding the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plan of action is scheduled to be unveiled Sunday, when  
the meetings with clergy ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that, together with family and faith, work is  
sacred because we pour into it our time and our talent and our 
creative capacity and our commitment to our loved ones,'' Sweeney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those attending the conference included Roman Catholic Cardinal  
Roger Mahony and United Methodist Bishop Jesse DeWitt, president of 
the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's campaign to forge stronger bonds with religious  
leaders is part of a broader strategy to strengthen its ability to 
organize at the grassroots level, particularly among blacks and 
Hispanic immigrants, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the effort has yielded results. Church leaders and  
union organizers worked together in Los Angeles to obtain a job 
security agreement for University of Southern California workers 
and to raise wages for employees at Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Clergy supported unions during the United Parcel Service strike  
in 1997, and have been involved in other labor talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers hope the help of clergy will boost a campaign to  
increase wages and benefits at hospitals affiliated with the Roman 
Catholic church, said Merrick Masters, a University of Pittsburgh 
professor who studies labor relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``What labor is trying to do is strengthen its grass roots  
base,'' Masters said. ``That involves not only linking themselves 
with religious organizations, but also environmentalists and 
constituencies that are typically underserved in the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new partnership also reflects labor's historical roots.  
Clergy and labor worked together to improve conditions in steel 
mills at the turn of the century and when the automobile industry 
organized in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	Clergy appear pleased with the clout union support can add to  
their own efforts to improve conditions in low-income communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Friction sometimes develops with churchgoers who find themselves  
the target of clergy-supported organizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a congregation of business people and corporate  
executives, and many congregations are that way, advocating on 
behalf of a living wage is a controversial issue because somebody's 
got to pay for it and there's going to be one less Lexus in the 
driveway, maybe,'' said the Rev. Jim Conn, who prepares urban 
strategy for the United Methodist Church in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparing the plan to be released on Sunday, union and church  
leaders are discussing a broad range of initiatives that would 
tackle wages, working conditions, benefits and racism in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to reaffirm our ministries and our mission. The  
mission of the labor movement is economic and social justice. The 
ministry of the church is feeding the poor and caring for the 
sick,'' said Arlene Holt, the AFL-CIO's liaison to religious 
groups. ``We need to have a public policy that assures that.''

<HEADLINE> Alabama Cities To Vote on Mayors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Thanks to the resignation of city's  
longtime mayor, the political dialogue here has come to resemble 
something out of the Jerry Springer show. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't come to fisticuffs or broken chairs yet. But at weekly  
City Council meetings, members shout, interrupt each other, call 
each other names, point fingers and stage walkouts -- all of which 
can be seen on the local cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
	It is against this raucous backdrop that voters in Alabama's  
largest city are being asked to choose among 14 candidates who want 
to succeed Richard Arrington, the city's first black mayor and 
dominant political figure for 20 years. Polls show William Bell, 
who became interim mayor when Arrington quit, is the odds-on 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montgomery, meanwhile, another long-dominant figure, Mayor  
Emory Folmar, faces six opponents in his bid for a seventh term. It 
is the biggest field of challengers since Folmar whipped more than 
40 candidates to be elected the first time in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Elections in both cities are Oct. 12, the same day voters  
statewide decide on Gov. Don Siegelman's proposal for a state 
lottery. If no candidate gets a majority, a runoff between the top 
two vote-getters will be held three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is relying on his two decades of City Council service and  
close ties to Arrington in his quest for the mayor's seat in 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington resigned in July after two decades, handing the job to  
Bell, the council president, for a trial run. Arrington's move gave 
Bell the benefit of incumbency. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll last month showed Bell with a 2-to-1 lead over his  
closest opponent, Councilman Bernard Kincaid, an Arrington foe. But 
more than 40 percent of the likely voters were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's ties to the ex-mayor could become a liability among those  
undecided voters because of a string of questions that have emerged 
involving city contracts under Arrington and a land deal between 
the city and one of Arrington's friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Some City Council members have moved to rein in Bell's power  
because of what they say was Arrington's almost unlimited control. 
That has prompted wild council meetings in which black ministers 
have claimed white council members are trying to usurp Bell's 
authority because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
	``You (can) call it a race card if you like. But it's right!''  
the Rev. Abraham Woods preached to the council, drawing a standing 
ovation from a crowd full of Bell supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene disgusted Roberta and Franklin Wood, who have been  
coming to council meetings for a month in hopes of getting paving 
and other improvements in their neighborhood, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ridiculous. There's no togetherness here,'' said Wood,  
74, who backs Kincaid.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Brind'Amour Out 3-6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers center Rod Brind'Amour  
has a second hairline fracture in his left foot and will be out for 
three to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The second fracture was discovered in an X-ray at Pennsylvania  
Hospital Thursday while doctors were checking the recovery of his 
other fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not uncommon for X-rays to initially not show fractures,  
especially in the feet,'' Dr. Arthur Bartolozzi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour was resting at home Friday and was not in much pain,  
Bartolozzi said. He had practiced with the team Wednesday, and said 
he hoped to play in Saturday's game against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour was placed on injured reserve Oct. 2, ending the  
longest consecutive-game streak in the NHL. He did not play in the 
Flyers' first two regular season games -- both losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour, who has played in 484 straight regular-season  
games, suffered a hairline fracture on Sept. 25 during the first 
period of the Flyers' 4-2 exhibition loss at New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour had not missed a game since Feb. 22, 1993, when a  
hand injury kept him out of a game against Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Runoff Creates 'Dead Zone' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- There's a new problem from Hurricane  
Floyd's deluge: Sewage-tainted floodwaters are creating a growing 
``dead zone'' in Pamlico Sound where fish and other aquatic life 
cannot survive, scientists said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The brown freshwater plume containing human and animal waste is  
flowing into coastal estuaries. It sits atop the salt water, 
robbing the salt water of oxygen from surface air and reducing its 
salinity. 
</P>
<P>
	Both ingredients are essential for aquatic life.  
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing is an ecological event on the catastrophic  
scale,'' said Hans Paerl, a marine scientist at the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on eastern North Carolina on  
Sept. 16, killing at least 48 people as it flooded hog lagoons and 
sewer plants, homes and cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting sludge is flowing from the Neuse and Tar rivers  
into Pamlico Sound, the nation's second-largest estuary, and from 
the Cape Fear River near Wilmington into the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest affected area is a 350-square-mile expanse of  
Pamlico Sound and part of adjacent Core Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Paerl said he found drastically low oxygen levels in the bottom  
waters of Pamlico Sound -- 1 milligram per liter, compared to the 
normal 7 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
	While fisherman have to avoid the dead zone, they still have  
been able to catch fish and shrimp in areas not affected by the 
dirty water, said Nancy Fish, a spokeswoman for the state Division 
of Marine Fisheries. Initial testing showed the catch was safe to 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paerl and other scientists said it may be next spring or  
summer before the runoff's long-term effect on the sound and the 
Atlantic is known. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, massive flooding doubled the size of a Gulf of Mexico  
``dead zone'' that some scientists believe was caused by fertilizer 
runoffs in the Mississippi River basin. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation in Pamlico Sound, an estuary second in size only  
to Chesapeake Bay, especially concerns scientists because 
pollutants won't readily be flushed into the ocean. The Pamlico has 
just three inlets to the Atlantic, and most of the sound's water 
leaves via evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sound is acting like a giant bathtub,'' Paerl said. Making  
matters worse, he said, is that the pollutants become more 
concentrated as water evaporates. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the Cape Fear coast, the runoff is at least 40 feet deep and  
covers 300 square miles, said Larry Cahoon, marine scientist at the 
University of North Carolina at Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a brown ocean right now,'' Cahoon said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cahoon said Cape Fear never experienced plummeting oxygen levels  
because of its rapid water flow. But he said the brown color is 
indicative of a large amount of nutrients that could eventually 
feed algae blooms that use up oxygen and kill fish.

<HEADLINE> JAMA Set To Name New Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A vice dean of Johns Hopkins University School of  
Medicine appears to be the leading candidate to become the new 
editor of the American Medical Association's influential journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources close to JAMA, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Thursday that they had learned Dr. Catherine D. DeAngelis 
would be named editor of the Journal of the American Medical 
Association, succeeding Dr. George Lundberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg's firing in January provoked a controversy over the  
journal's editorial independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA refused to confirm that DeAngelis was the pick. The AMA  
had been scheduled to introduce the journal's new editor at a news 
conference today in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	DeAngelis is the editor of the Archives of Pediatrics and  
Adolescent Medicine, published by the AMA, as well as a member of 
JAMA's editorial board. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached Thursday at her office at Johns Hopkins' medical school,  
where she is vice dean for academic affairs and faculty, she 
declined to confirm her selection. 
</P>
<P>
	JAMA has been run by interim co-editors since Lundberg's firing.  
He was dismissed after publishing in JAMA a survey of college 
students' sexual attitudes that coincided with President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	AMA executive vice president Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson felt  
Lundberg inappropriately injected the organization into a political 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg, who took a job as editor in chief for an online  
medical information site, was highly critical of the AMA after his 
firing, saying he had to battle AMA leaders, members and lobbyists 
to retain editorial independence of his publication. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA has since created a board to serve as a buffer between  
the editor in chief and the organization's management.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate was unchanged  
at 4.2 percent in September, the lowest rate in nearly three 
decades, even though the number of payroll jobs actually fell last 
month as Hurricane Floyd cut into hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that September's rate  
matched August's rate at 4.2 percent, a 29-year low. The nation's 
jobless rate has been below 4.4 percent since March. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers cut payroll jobs in September by 8,000, the first  
decline since January 1996 when a winter blizzard disrupted hiring 
plans. The Labor Department said that while the growth in payroll 
jobs would have been extremely weak in September compared with the 
robust gains reported for most of this year, the hurricane cut 
growth by 50,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hurricane Floyd huffed and puffed and blew a lot of jobs away  
in September,'' said KeyCorp economist Ken Mayland. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expected companies to add 220,000 jobs. In August,  
businesses added 103,000 jobs to their payrolls, less than what the 
government previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the weak job growth, wages grew in September. Average  
hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, grew by 0.5 
percent to $13.37 in September, much sharper than the 0.2 percent 
increase in August. 
</P>
<P>
	While strong wage growth is a good development for workers,  
economists and members of the Federal Reserve worry that it could 
be a recipe for sparking inflation. Their fear: employers foraging 
for qualified workers woo them with higher wages and benefits, 
costs likely to drive up consumer prices if not constrained by 
other forces. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Fed policy-makers decided not to raise interest  
rates for now but, expressing concerns that the tight labor market 
could lead to inflation down the road, they left open the 
possibility of a third rate increase later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the increase in the average hourly earnings, Mayland,  
citing the decrease in payroll jobs, believed the report would 
reduce the odds of a Fed rate increase at its next meeting on Nov. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably makes the Fed a little less likely to raise rates  
in November,'' he said. Mayland said the fact that job growth 
slowed so much in September would probably ease the fear about 
future wage pressures being triggered by employers forced to pay 
higher salaries in competition for a dwindling supply of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have been volatile in the last month over  
concerns about the prospects for higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates fell in the inflation-sensitive government bond  
market immediately after the job figures were released. But rates 
edge up within minutes. In morning trading, yields on 30-year 
Treasury bonds hovered near Thursday's late rate of 6.18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, another 21,000 manufacturing jobs were lost, but  
government analysts noted that the average monthly decline in 
manufacturing slowed to 15,000 per month from June through 
September, less than half the 36,000 monthly average in the first 
six months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. manufacturers have seen foreign demand for their products  
rebound somewhat from a global financial crisis which began in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The service sector, normally the driving force of job creation  
in the United States, suffered a decline of 9,000 in September, 
reflecting a drop of 49,000 jobs at retail businesses. Government 
analysts said that job loss was particularly heavy where businesses 
were forced to close because of Hurricane Floyd, which raked the 
East Coast in September. 
</P>
<P>
	But even without the hurricane, there was widespread weakness as  
department stores cut 17,000 jobs,the fifth consecutive monthly 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a drop of 23,000 government jobs in  
September,while business services added only 39,000 jobs, well 
below their average monthly gain of 126,000.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Tight Race on Ala. Lottery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- With ministers united against Gov. Don  
Sigelman's plan for a lottery and a ticket-fixing scandal leaving 
critics warning about government corruption, Siegelman has gone 
back on the campaign trail to push the issue that got him elected 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters decide Tuesday whether to expand gambling in this Bible  
Belt state to help pay for school programs and college 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lottery is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change  
education in Alabama forever,'' Siegelman tells voters on swings 
across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls have shown a tight race, with enough undecided  
voters to give either side a victory -- a change from the summer, 
when polls showed the lottery favored by more than 60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lottery supporters outspent opponents 3-1, but church ministers  
have crossed denominational lines to preach against the ballot 
measure. Nothing else has so united the state's ministry, said the 
Rev. Joe Bob Mizell of the Alabama Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the abortion issue -- the sanctity of human life -- has not  
come as close to bringing denominations together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Jim Bennett is predicting nearly 60 percent  
turnout, which would eclipse the 1998 governor's race and set a 
record for a ballot with no state or national offices up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had one this controversial before. There is a lot  
of emotional feeling in the lottery election that will bring out 
lots of voters on both sides,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman, a Democrat, handily defeated Republican incumbent Fob  
James last year by promising to copy Georgia's lottery and use an 
estimated $150 million a year in proceeds to fund free college 
tuition, purchase computers for every school and start a voluntary 
pre-kindergarten program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature quickly approved his proposal and sent it to  
voters for a statewide referendum. It must receive a majority to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman's effort has been dogged, however, by a scandal over  
the fixing of traffic tickets for friends of state officials. The 
state police director was forced to resign, and three of 
Siegelman's aides have been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics warn that the scandal should leave voters wary about how  
the lottery would be run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people understand what is going on here,'' Siegelman  
responded. ``They can separate this ticket-fixing stuff from the 
future of the children of this state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, a Nov. 2 referendum that would either ban  
video gambling or secure its legal standing has also unified 
religious groups in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	In that battle, Gov. Jim Hodges hasn't campaigned for either  
side, despite the video gambling industry's significant help in 
defeating his predecessor, who tried to outlaw the games. Hodges 
has only said he will vote to ban the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Video gambling became legal in South Carolina through a  
little-noticed legislative amendment in 1986. Now there are 33,000 
machines across the state, and opponents claim it destroys families 
and exploits the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Video operators claim the tax revenue their industry brings in  
helps fund education and can help eliminate a much-disliked car 
property tax.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Upward; Dow Up 99.10 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today as investors brushed off  
concerns about rising inflation and turned their focus toward the 
positive earnings news expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 99.10 at 10,636.15, erasing all of Thursday's 
51-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 15.58 at 1,333.22. While the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 14.60 at 2,875.30, its gains were stemmed by some weakness 
in technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	If stocks continued their gains through the end of the day, all  
three indexes would be on track to have their best weekly gains 
since the first week in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks turned higher this afternoon after fluctuating most of  
the morning as investors tried to determine whether the 
government's employment report signaled that inflation was 
accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising oil prices and some bargain hunting helped lift stocks  
from their earlier slump. In addition, investors expected another 
strong earnings season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed may not be finished raising interest rates, but for  
now, the market isn't focused on that,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior 
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks seesawed this morning after the Labor Department reported  
that employers cut their payrolls by 8,000 jobs in September, the 
first drop since January 1996. Analysts had expected companies to 
add 220,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline was mostly attributed to Hurricane Floyd, which cut  
into hiring at companies along the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the decline in jobs, wage pressures rose in  
September. Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation 
pressures, grew by 0.5 percent to $13.37 in September, much sharper 
than the 0.2 percent increase in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The report sent mixed signals to the stock market. There was  
relief over the decline in job growth but concern that the rising 
wages could mean inflation is picking up momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors worry that any signs of rising inflation may cause the  
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the third time this 
year to keep the economy from overheating and to head off a 
resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market reacted to the upside and the downside of the jobs  
report,'' Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Wachovia 
Securities in Charlotte, N.C. ``There is a lot of uncertainty in 
the market and this report just shows the nervous atmosphere that 
is out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,  
noted that there was a meaningful shift this week in what stocks 
investors were buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of technology and Internet shares, which have led the  
market in recent months, there was lots of buying of big names in 
other sectors, namely consumer, financial, drug and transportation 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a shift from those stocks that have done very  
well recently but are pricey to those where the performance hasn't 
been great but they are undervalued,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also said that the small-cap stocks haven't been  
performing as well today as the broader market. That was reflected 
in the Russell 2000 index, which was down 1.25 at 426.82 today. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson led the Dow higher, rising 4 1/16 to 98 5/16.  
American Express, Wal-Mart and General Electric also rose today. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox was one of the biggest losers, falling 10 11/16 to 32 1/16  
after the copier maker warned third-quarter earnings would be lower 
than analyst expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil company stocks, including Atlantic Richfield and Royal Dutch  
Shell, also were under pressure amid a slump in crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 725.90 million 
shares, up from 643.76 million shares on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Hispanics Groom Talent for Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- With predictions that Hispanics will become the  
largest U.S. minority early in the next millennium, their leaders 
are looking to groom young talent to add political clout to the 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, as many as 8,000 people -- most of them between the  
ages of 18 and 34 -- are gathering in Chicago for the U.S. Hispanic 
Leadership Conference, which runs through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are afraid of change and some people are afraid of  
Latino progress. But Americans have nothing to be afraid of,'' 
former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros said Friday during a speech 
before thousands of high school students. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this country,'' he said. ``We don't want to hurt it; we  
only want to help it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers are clear -- if not a bit astounding.  
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics make up about 11 percent of the U.S. population -- half  
of them younger than age 20. That means that by 2050, one out of 
every four Americans will be of Hispanic descent, according to U.S. 
Census estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros told the students that such numbers place a great deal  
of responsibility on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want us to be a poor, hostile, angry, uneducated  
population in America. ... You can be the ones to break the 
pattern,'' he said. ``Can you do it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the students broke into uproarious applause.  
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros was one of many Hispanic leaders who encouraged  
conference attendees to go to college, register to vote and 
organize politically -- all goals backed up at the conference by 
workshops and a college and job fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to keep people accountable,'' said Cisneros, who now  
heads Univision, a major Spanish-language television network. ``We 
also, from time to time, have to defend ourselves when people come 
after us just because we are Latino.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Cisneros, officials attending the conference  
included everyone from Aida Alvarez, head of the U.S. Small 
Business Administration, to Raymond Anrecio, a manager at General 
Motors' Public Policy Institute. President Clinton was scheduled to 
speak at the conference Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being here, I feel everyone is a role model. All of them give  
me good goals,'' said Davina Gonzalez, an 18-year-old high school 
senior from Santa Ana, Calif., who was one of many to swarm 
Cisneros to get photos or autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez -- who wants to be a child psychologist and made her  
first plane trip to take part in the conference -- said being chosen 
to participate was inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me very proud. It makes me feel like I will be able  
to be happy -- to live in a nice house with a yard, to have a family 
and to be able to buy them things they need,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Florida State Penalizes Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick admitted what he did was  
wrong after the Heisman Trophy hopeful and a Florida State teammate 
were arrested on charges of stealing clothing from a department 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was indefinitely suspended, and Laveranues Coles, who  
was on probation because of past legal and academic difficulties, 
was kicked off the team. Both players are wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	They were arrested Thursday and released without bond on felony  
charges of grand theft. They were accused of paying only $21.40 for 
clothing worth $412.38 on Sept. 29. A Dillard's clerk who rang up 
the deep discount also was charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said he did not get a chance to  
meet with Coles, but talked privately with Warrick. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very remorseful,'' Bowden said. ``I said, `Pete, do you  
realize you were wrong?' And he said `Yes, I realize I was wrong.' 
That's the main thing. He knows that he broke a rule, and if you 
break a rule, this is the consequences that you get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden, however, said he did not feel betrayed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know boys are boys, and some of them seem to find adversity  
more than others,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, nicknamed ``Trouble'' by his grandmother, is one of those  
people. He was charged last year with hitting his stepmother 
outside her home. He was suspended for last year's opener against 
Texas A&AMP;M and later served 150 hours of community service for the 
misdemeanor battery charge. He also was suspended for this year's 
opener for academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles' eligibility for the 1999 season was in limbo for more  
than two months while school officials made sure he took no money 
from a sports agent to attend a party in Houston. Coles reimbursed 
a girlfriend for an airplane ticket and apologized to teammates 
before being reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Florida State Athletics Director Dave Hart  
described Warrick as a ``good citizen'' although, he too, had a 
prior run-in with the law. Disorderly conduct and resisting arrest 
charges against Warrick last year over an altercation in the 
parking lot of a Tampa fast-food restaurant eventually were 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest put Warrick's Heisman Trophy hopes in jeopardy, but  
William J. Dockery, president of the Downtown Athletic Club in New 
York, which awards the Heisman, said Warrick remains eligible for 
the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If any candidate is convicted of a felony, he would no longer  
be eligible to receive the Heisman Trophy,'' Dockery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said Warrick's only hope of returning for the rest of his  
senior season might be to get the charge reduced to a misdemeanor. 
School rules prohibit an athlete facing a felony from playing until 
the case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``A misdemeanor puts it in our hands,'' Bowden said.  
</P>
<P>
	An off-duty police officer saw and taped Coles purchasing two  
bags of clothing, one right after another, on video surveillance 
equipment. Police said Coles handed the first bag to Warrick. 
Neither bag contained enough merchandise -- $300 -- to make the 
charge a felony. However, Assistant State Attorney Warren Goodman 
said the purchases were considered a single transaction so the 
amounts were totaled. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick will be allowed to practice with the team, but was not  
there Thursday. Quarterback Chris Weinke said the players have not 
been distracted from their game Saturday against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``My focus has been on the game, will be on the game and will  
continue to be on the game for the next few days,'' Weinke said. 
``That stuff is out of our hands. We can't control it. We can 
control what we do on the field.''

<HEADLINE> NatWest Chief Executive Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The hostile takeover bid of National Westminster  
Bank PLC's by the Bank of Scotland has resulted in the resignation 
of Natwest's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest said Friday that Derek Wanless' departure was part of  
wider boardroom shakeup that was a direct response to the Scottish 
bank's $34.4 billion bid, launched last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Against the background of an unsolicited and hostile bid from  
the Bank of Scotland, the board has decided to restructure the 
senior management team to place the bank in the best possible 
position to deal with this unwelcome offer,'' NatWest said in a 
statement to the London stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir David Rowland, currently NatWest chairman, will take on the  
additional role of group chief executive, the company said, and Ron 
Sandler, formerly chief executive of Lloyds of London, has been 
appointed chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes take effect immediately, NatWest said.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Natwest dropped its controversial offer to  
buy British life insurance firm Legal &AMP; General Group PLC. The Bank 
of Scotland cited the Legal &AMP; General offer as proof that NatWest 
was straying outside its core banking business. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland made its offer for NatWest, a rival more than  
twice its size, on Sept. 24. NatWest quickly rejected the bid.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi, Volvo Join Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Sweden's Volvo  
AB are forging stronger ties in an effort to become a more 
formidable force in the global market for trucks and buses. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Mitsubishi still needs to resolve a bigger  
problem: its passenger car business. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced Friday, Volvo will buy a 5 percent  
stake in Mitsubishi for $270 million. Mitsubishi will buy up to 5 
percent of Volvo by the end of 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese automaker also plans to make its truck and bus  
operations a new subsidiary by 2001, with Volvo taking a stake of 
up to 19.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the new subsidiary are still being worked out, and  
Volvo has not said whether it will contribute any truck- or 
bus-making operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined production and sales of trucks and buses by  
Mitsubishi, Volvo and Scania AB -- a Swedish truckmaker Volvo is 
acquiring -- will surpass that of the current world leader 
DaimlerChrysler, according to Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is part of a wave of increasing foreign involvement in  
Japan's auto sector, which is striving to become more globally 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mitsubishi posted a profit for the fiscal year ended  
March 31 in contrast to a loss the previous fiscal year, its car 
sales have not picked up. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsuyoshi Mochimaru, auto analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson  
in Tokyo, said the Volvo-Mitsubishi alliance fails to address 
Mitsubishi's problems with car sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mitsubishi's outstanding problem is in passenger cars, not  
trucks,'' Mochimaru said. ``There are way too many unprofitable 
models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. bought Volvo's passenger car division earlier  
this year. Rich from that sale, Volvo acquired a majority share in 
rival truckmaker Scania, although that merger still needs the 
approval of the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi said it would benefit from the new alliance because  
the two automakers will be able to exchange technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that this will make us more competitive at a time when  
severe demands from the world's consumers are expected in 
technology, in ecology and safety,'' company spokesman Noriaki 
Okoshi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without ruling it out, Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson said  
there was no plan to acquire all of the new Mitsubishi trucks and 
bus company. ``A 20 percent share is large in Japanese terms for a 
foreign owner,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Volvo Trucks, Karl Erling Trogen, said that  
including Scania in the cooperation with Mitsubishi is a 
possibility and that he could see potential in such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	The two automakers have already been cooperating in their truck  
business. Starting last year, the Mitsubishi Canter, a small truck, 
has been sold through Volvo outlets in England, France and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	They have also been studying the possibility of developing  
medium-sized trucks together as well as of using Volvo parts in 
Mitsubishi large trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement strengthens this cooperation further and  
creates possibilities for more cooperative ventures,'' Johansson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Motors President Katsuhiko Kawasoe said the alliance  
is complementary, because Mitsubishi is strong for small- and 
mid-sized trucks in Asia while Volvo leads the European, North 
American and South American markets with its heavy trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	After the new share issue, Volvo will be the third-biggest  
shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, after Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 
and Mitsubishi Corp.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Gains vs. Euro and Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar gained ground against the euro and  
the yen Friday, reacting to a rally in U.S. stocks and a potential 
lack of harmony within the European Economic Union. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0622, down  
from $1.0710 late Wednesday while the British pound fell to $1.6520 
from $1.6523. The dollar rose to 107.56 Japanese yen from 107.49 
yen late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the euro in early trading in response to  
comments from Dutch Central Bank President Nout Wellink, who said 
his country would have raised interest rates Thursday if the 
Netherlands weren't part of the EEU. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellink spoke shortly after the European Central Bank left its  
key borrowing rate unchanged at 2.5 percent on Thursday. The 
central bank's actions govern monetary policy for the 11 nations 
that have adopted the single currency known as the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement ``is an indication that there's no longer harmony  
within the euro zone,'' said Hillel Waxman, chief currency trader 
at Bank Leumi in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	A big gain in the U.S. stock markets, where the Dow industrials  
had its biggest weekly point gain in three months, helped increase 
interest in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop in oil prices and a mixed reading from a U.S. government  
report on unemployment also cooled some inflation jitters that have 
plagued American markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported that employers cut their payrolls  
by 8,000 jobs in September, the first drop since January 1996. 
Analysts had expected companies to add 220,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, wage pressures rose in September despite the loss of  
jobs. Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, 
grew by 0.5 percent to $13.37 in September, much sharper than the 
0.2 percent increase in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department also said the nation's unemployment rate  
was unchanged at 4.2 percent in September, a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	The report had been keenly awaited because the Federal Reserve  
said earlier this week it is prepared to raise interest rates for a 
third time this year if inflationary pressures grow. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were ``befuddled'' but eventually emboldened with the  
report, Waxman said. The inflationary influence of rising wages had 
to be balanced against a drop in jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the stock market goes up, ``that always puts steam in  
the dollar,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5022 Swiss francs on Thursday,  
up from 1.4872 Wednesday, and 1.4715 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4714. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8412  
German marks, up from 1.8259; 6.1752 French francs, up from 6.1239; 
and 1,822.80 Italian lire, up from 1,807.77.

<HEADLINE> Wallace Looking for Win No. 50 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Milestones are hard to come by for Roger  
Penske's teams these days. 
</P>
<P>
	In CART, his team has been stuck on 99 victories since midway  
through the 1997 season. For NASCAR Winston Cup driver Rusty 
Wallace, it's No. 50 that has been illusive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm starting to think that No. 50 is jinxing me,'' said  
Wallace, who would like nothing better than to get Penske Racing 
South back to victory lane Sunday in the UAW-GM 500 at Lowe's Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The CART team is making major changes for 2000, with new drivers  
-- Gil de Ferran and Greg Moore -- as well as a new chassis and 
possibly a change of engine manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need that kind of change in NASCAR,'' Penske said.  
``We're close there. We think we've got what we need to win for 
Rusty in Winston Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 43-year-old Wallace, one of the top stars in NASCAR's  
Winston Cup series since taking Rookie of the Year honors in 1984, 
has only one victory each of the past two seasons, after piling up 
25 in the four previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	He won No. 49 in April, winning from the pole in Bristol, Tenn.  
Since then, his best finish has been third in August on the road 
course in Watkins Glen, N.Y., and Wallace is coming off a 
fourth-place finish last Sunday in Martinsville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	To help in Wallace's quest for another victory, the team has  
gone back to building its own chassis -- and is debuting one this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	This one was built specifically for high-banked 1 1/2- or 2-mile  
ovals. Penske also has another new one ready for the race on the 
one-mile oval in Phoenix and a third for the inaugural race at 
Homestead's almost-flat 1 1/2-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should help because I think we lost our way a little  
bit,'' Wallace said. ``With the other cars, we didn't have a base 
to work from in our handling. When you've got a great-handling car, 
you bring that same set-up back and you work on it a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we've been bringing different chassis with different  
setups to the racetracks, and our base has been completely gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace got off on the right foot Wednesday, putting the team's  
No. 2 Ford Taurus second in the 43-car lineup, right alongside the 
Pontiac of pole-winner Bobby Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody has a good outlook when you qualify good and  
get a good place to pit,'' Wallace said. ``Your team morale is real 
high and it keeps a smile on your face all week long. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're sitting there 30th, and you've got to go qualify the  
next day, you're worried about how you're going to run and stuff 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no Winston Cup activity on the 1 1/2-mile speedway oval  
on Friday, but the teams will get one hour of practice today, 
following the conclusion of the All Pro Auto Parts 300 Busch Series 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Always at Charlotte, it's a week-long process and it's a lot  
of fun,'' Wallace said. ``But, in a way, I wish we would get here 
on Friday and run Friday, Saturday and Sunday, like we do almost 
everywhere else.''

<HEADLINE> Capitals 3, Sabres 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Alexei Tezikov scored the game-winner with  
a goal similar to the controversial play that decided last season's 
Stanley Cup championship, giving Washington a 3-2 victory over 
Buffalo on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In Buffalo's first home game since Brett Hull's controversial  
goal in triple overtime of Game 6 last season gave the Dallas Stars 
the Stanley Cup, the winner again came with an attacking player in 
the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	This time the rules allowed him to be there, but Sabres  
goaltender Dominik Hasek insisted that Capitals forward Jaroslav 
Svejkovsky interfered with him on the power-play goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Bondra and Jan Bulis also scored for Washington (1-1), and  
goaltender Olaf Kolzig made 26 saves. Wayne Primeau and Brian 
Campbell scored for the Sabres, who are still looking for their 
first win after a season-opening 2-0 loss to Detroit in which Hasek 
made 42 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Tezikov, traded by Buffalo to Washington for Joe Juneau last  
March, scored the game-winner midway through the second period. The 
goal, which would have been reviewed last season, rattled in off 
the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in the front of the same goal where Hull scored his  
Cup-clincher with a skate in the crease, Hasek slammed his glove 
against the post and argued that Capitals forward Svejkovsky 
interfered with him on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	A change in the rules prompted by Hull's goal allows an  
attacking player to be in the crease when a goal is scored as long 
as the goalie is not interfered with. Svejkovsky stood next to 
Hasek on the play but did not appear to touch the goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
	Tezikov's goal would have been reviewed last year. Under this  
season's rules, on-ice referees make the calls and there are no 
video replays to decide a man-in-the-crease situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres scored first when Primeau knocked in a loose puck  
during a scramble in front of Kolzig at 5:56 of the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Bondra tied it at 14:19 on a five-on-three when he batted  
in Curtis Brown's giveaway. Olaf Kolzig made 10 saves in the first 
and robbed Michael Peca in front with 2:06 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek made 25 saves but only three in the third. His 12 saves in  
the first included big stops with 1:24 on Konowalchuk and Bulis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulis, a native of Hasek's hometown of Pardubice, Czech  
Republic, put the Capitals up 2-1 at 5:10 of the second period, 
with a slap shot that trickled in between Hasek and the near-side 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell tied it at 7:37 of the second, pushing in Brian  
Holzinger's rebound, and Tezikov put Washington back in front, 3-2, 
with the Capitals' second power-play goal.

<HEADLINE> FSU Moves Forward Without Warrick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The loss of wide receivers Peter  
Warrick and Laveranues Coles, both arrested in a department store 
theft scam, will not change Florida State's game plan for Miami 
Saturday, but it will mean a new focus for the top-ranked 
Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost a lot of firepower,'' coach Bobby Bowden said. ``Now  
we find out if we have a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy, Warrick was  
indefinitely suspended and Coles kicked off the team because he had 
a record of prior legal and academic trouble. Warrick will miss at 
least the game against No. 19 Miami and possibly the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was Florida State's offensive leader, averaging 15.5  
yards every time he touched the ball during his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Those touches this year included 36 catches for 508 yards and  
seven touchdowns -- four receiving, two running and one on a punt 
return. He also has passed for a touchdown and ranks 12th 
nationally with 16.2 yards per punt return. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take more than one player to replace him. Little-used  
Germaine Stringer, along with Marvin Minnis, who missed the season 
opener because of an injury, will share time at Warrick's flanker 
position. Cornerback Reggie Durden will get more action returning 
punts, a duty he shared with Warrick. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was the team's fastest player, clocked at 4.2 seconds in  
the 40-yard dash. He had 12 catches this season for 179 yards and 
one touchdown after being suspended in the opener for missing a 
final exam during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Morgan will replace Coles at split end. Florida State  
substitutes often at nearly every position and has several 
experienced backups at receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for a new star to be born,'' quarterback Chris  
Weinke said. ``We're not changing our game plan. We're not changing 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, maybe one thing, Bowden said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't run the reverse pass,'' he said, referring to a play  
that has Warrick, a former high school quarterback, throwing the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests of Warrick and Coles have overshadowed an intense  
rivalry between Florida State (5-0) and Miami (2-2), smarting from 
identical 27-23 losses to No. 2 Penn State and No. 16 East 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden once lamented that the words ``he played Miami'' would be  
carved on his tombstone because losses to the Hurricanes might have 
cost him at least one national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles, however, have had the better of the rivalry in  
recent years, winning four straight from the Hurricanes. Florida 
State also will be trying to extend a 44-game unbeaten streak at 
Doak Campbell Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The last home loss was to Miami in 1991. It was the the famous  
``wide right'' game the Hurricanes won 17-16 when Seminoles walk-on 
Gerry Thomas missed a 34-yard field goal by inches with 25 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Butch Davis plans no changes because of the absences  
of Warrick and Coles, saying he was sure Florida State had capable 
replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his players, however, were disappointed Warrick and  
Coles would not be playing. Tight end Bubba Franks said he wished 
they would be in the lineup ``so nobody will have any excuses when 
we win.''

<HEADLINE> GM Exec on Payroll After Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A General Motors marketing executive was kept on  
the payroll nearly two years after he pleaded guilty to defrauding 
a Little Caesars subsidiary, though he says he didn't tell GM about 
the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Rotondo, 38, left GM on Oct. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Court records show that Oakland County prosecutors charged  
Rotondo and his associate, former brother-in-law Adalgiso ``Nick'' 
Mancini, in February 1997 with four counts each of false pretenses. 
</P>
<P>
	They were accused of generating false purchase orders totaling  
$168,000 from Blue Line Distributing, a Farmington Hills company 
that delivers pizza dough and other supplies to Little Caesars 
franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotondo, GM's director of marketing operations, pleaded guilty  
in November 1997. He was sentenced to three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Terry Sullivan declined to say whether Rotondo  
resigned or was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't get into that,'' Sullivan told The Oakland Press for  
a Friday story. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which has an ethics policy, was unaware of the  
case, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure this matter is being taken very seriously. This is a  
very serious issue and we understand that,'' a senior GM official 
told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotondo said he decided that it was time to leave GM.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unfortunate situation that happened. I had tried to  
do the right thing by cooperating with the authorities and I made 
full restitution,'' said Rotondo, who acknowledged keeping GM in 
the dark about his legal difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	According to prosecutors, Mancini, who was a buyer for Blue  
Line, generated 11 phony purchase orders to buy kiosks from 
Pinnacle Production, a Bloomfield Hills company created by 
Rotondo's cousin but later turned over to Rotondo. 
</P>
<P>
	The kiosks were to be shipped to a third company. An audit of  
the Blue Line account showed that $168,000 had gone out for kiosks 
that never appeared.

<HEADLINE> Warrick Lawyer Seeks Quick Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A lawyer for Peter Warrick, Florida  
State's suspended star receiver, hopes to get a felony charge 
against his client resolved quickly so he can again play with the 
top-ranked Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, 22, teammate Laveranues Coles, 21, and 19-year-old  
Dillard's department store clerk Rachel Myrtil were charged with 
grand theft Thursday. The clerk was accused of selling the two 
players $412.38 worth of clothing for only $21.40. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth person, Shedrick Jermaine Rhodes, 23, who is not a  
player, was arrested on a lesser charge of petty theft for 
allegedly buying $82 worth of clothing from Myrtil for $10.70. That 
closes the case and no further arrests are expected, police 
spokesman Scott Hunt said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer John Kenny said Friday it was standard procedure  
to have cases delayed because that normally works in a defendant's 
favor, but Warrick's situation is different. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, Peter cannot afford to take too long,'' Kenny  
said. ``He has more interest in saying, `Let's get it done.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy, but his  
arrest might have dashed those hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	His return, however, would help Florida State's push for a  
second national championship and his chances to impress NFL teams. 
Although expected to be a first-round choice last year, Warrick 
passed up the NFL draft and returned for his senior season, seeking 
redemption for a poor performance and loss to Tennessee in the 
national championship Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was removed from the team because he already was on  
probation for past legal and academic difficulties. Warrick was 
suspended indefinitely under a school policy that prohibits 
athletes charged with felonies from playing until the charges are 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	One way to do that would be to plead guilty or no contest. First  
offenders normally are placed on probation, assistant state 
attorney Warren Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another option would be to try and have the charge reduced to a  
misdemeanor. Rhodes, whom Kenny said he understands is Warrick's 
cousin, was charged with a misdemeanor because he allegedly took 
less than $300 worth of merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Warrick nor Coles was alleged to have taken more than  
$300 in clothing individually, but each was charged with a felony 
because they made their purchases of $244.38 and $168 together, 
with Coles paying for each. Rhodes was with the other two but made 
his purchase separately, Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny said he had spoken with prosecutors but they discussed  
nothing of substance and he still had not seen the state's 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick is set for a first court appearance Monday, but Kenny  
said neither he nor his client would be there because he has filed 
a written notice of appearance. Normally, it then would be at least 
six weeks before a trial date. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all hope to resolve this before then,'' Kenny said.  
</P>
<P>
	So do many Florida State fans and officials who were stunned by  
the severity of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The door certainly is open for Peter to return,'' athletic  
director Dave Hart said. In anticipation of that, Warrick will be 
allowed to practice with the team while suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talent alone obviously does not make you immune to  
accountability,'' Hart said. ``Sometimes this is learned in very 
tough circumstances.''

<HEADLINE> E. Timor Refugees Return to Capial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Tears of joy and sorrow cascaded down  
the cheeks of East Timorese refugees on Friday as they returned to 
their ravaged capital -- their delight to be home tempered by the 
knowledge that militias were still threatening thousands of others 
still stuck in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 166 refugees arrived from West Timor, where refugee camps  
house an estimated 256,000 people who fled violence unleashed by 
pro-Indonesian militias after East Timorese voted overwhelmingly on 
Aug. 30 to break away from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Their return on two chartered U.N. flights from  
Indonesia-controlled West Timor set off a wild celebration in Dili, 
East Timor's capital, where charred buildings still stand as grim 
reminders of the recent chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	People raced through the city to welcome the refugees, some of  
whom kissed the ground as they got off the planes. Others simply 
wept or hugged the priests and nuns who greeted them at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Joao da Silva waited in a soccer field, looking for his  
brother's family. He bounded up to his sister-in-law and her 
children after they passed through a makeshift clinic, then hugged 
his brother tightly. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also tales of woe. One teen-age girl and her younger  
brother were told their grandmother had died while they were away. 
They leaned against a wall and wept. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's strong emotions were tempered, however, by fear for the  
refugees who remained behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The militias are still hunting pro-independence people in the  
camps,'' said Amando Sarmento, 29, who arrived on the second flight 
Friday with 11 relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations planned to charter two flights a day to  
return refugees until arrangements could be made to ship people by 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not known yet how many East Timorese were killed by the  
militias, which, backed by parts of the Indonesian army, went on a 
spree of looting, killing and burning after the U.N.-backed vote. 
</P>
<P>
	But hundreds of thousands of East Timorese were driven from  
their homes, some to West Timor and many more into the nearby 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
	The commander of the international peacekeeping force,  
Australian Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, was to have his first meeting 
late Friday with Matan Ruak, head of the pro-independence Falintil 
guerrillas who have fought Indonesian rule since the 1975 invasion 
of East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Falintil has agreed with the peacekeepers' demand to disarm, but  
refused to do so until the 1,400 remaining Indonesian soldiers have 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Indonesian troops have gone, but more than 1,000 are to  
remain until the independence vote is endorsed by Indonesia's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people flocked to Dili's port on Friday,  
shouting ``Get out of our country, you scum!'' as Indonesian troops 
loaded trucks onto a ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove has also sent a second letter to the Indonesian  
military, insisting that four officers be available to work on the 
investigation into the slaying of Dutch journalist Sander Thoenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoenes, who worked for The Financial Times and The Christian  
Science Monitor, was shot and killed in Dili, allegedly by men in 
Indonesian uniforms, the day after the peacekeeping force landed on 
Sept. 20.

<HEADLINE> CompuServe's Rebate Fuels Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The CompuServe online service is making a  
comeback in North America, propelled by an offer for rebates on the 
purchase of new computers, the service's operators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online Inc. said the service's net membership grew by  
300,000 in United States and Canada in the July-September quarter, 
the most growth since AOL bought CompuServe. The company attributed 
more than half of the growth to the promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of CompuServe subscribers had been steadily declining  
for years; when AOL announced the purchase in late 1997, it 
inherited 2.6 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide membership was about 2 million before the spike last  
quarter, AOL said. While it provided North American figures, it did 
not provide a comparable worldwide total. 
</P>
<P>
	``CompuServe is in the midst of a dramatic and really successful  
turnaround,'' said Audrey Weil, AOL senior vice president and 
general manager for CompuServe. ``We have revitalized and 
repositioned this business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an announcement at the Internet World conference, she said  
CompuServe will try to lure additional customers by offering 
instant rebates for the first time. Currently, customers must mail 
in a form. 
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe offers $400 off certain computers with a three-year  
commitment to the $21.95 monthly service, which costs $790 for 
three years. Someone buying an eMachines computer, which starts at 
$399, effectively gets the computer for free, although the monitor 
is not included and can cost $100 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which is not alone in offering rebates, also offers  
a $100 rebate for a one-year commitment. The rebates apply only to 
computers bought at certain retailers or directly through certain 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, CompuServe extended the program to some Apple  
Macintosh computers, including the iMac marketed for home Internet 
use.

<HEADLINE> Senators Fans Sue Holdout Yashin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ottawa Senators star Alexei Yashin may have thought his latest  
holdout would net him a big payday. 
</P>
<P>
	But by failing to honor the last year of his contract, he could  
cost himself even more. 
</P>
<P>
	An Ottawa hockey fan filed a $27.5 million lawsuit against  
Yashin and his agent this week, accusing the two of interfering 
with the contractual relationship between the Senators and their 
fans. The unprecedented claim is far from an empty-netter, but the 
plaintiffs -- the class action could grow to include 11,000 season 
ticket-holders -- want athletes everywhere to know that the public's 
tolerance is limited. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt your situation will be looked upon with interest by  
other professional athletes,'' Arthur Cogan, the fans' attorney, 
wrote Yashin. ``Perhaps the time will come when athletes in all 
sports will not act with impunity when the decide to intentionally 
breach their obligations and consider only themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans who pay serious money for a first-class product are  
directly affected by arbitrary and wrongful conduct by a 
professional athlete. I strongly believe that the rights and 
interests of fans do count and must be taken into consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holding out is a way of doing business in the NHL these days,  
with restricted free agents using all available leverage to get the 
best contract possible. This season, Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe, 
Hurricanes forward Keith Primeau and Coyotes goalie Nikolai 
Khabibulin are among those sitting out because of stalled 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yashin is not a free agent; he is in the final season of a  
four-year deal that guaranteed him $3.6 million. Still, he wants 
more -- $23 million more for the two seasons after this one -- and 
he's holding out for the third time in five years to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll say, 'We didn't want to hurt the fans.' But who do you  
think it's hurting?'' Cogan said in a telephone interview. ``Hey, 
this is not going to be the same team anymore. It's not the same 
entertainment value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin has been training in Switzerland, and his agent, Mark  
Gandler, declined to comment for this story. The NHL also declined 
to comment on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators suspended the 25-year-old former captain when he  
didn't show up for the start of training camp. Although they would 
not comment on the suit, the Senators did release correspondence 
notifying Yashin that they will neither renegotiate nor trade the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the NHL's collective bargaining agreement requires  
arbitration in such disputes, the team cannot sue Yashin. And 
because the fans have a contract with the team -- but not with 
Yashin -- they have to take an indirect approach, arguing he 
intentionally interfered with their agreement with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it has never been applied in sports, the argument  
attempted by the fans is older than the NHL itself. In a 1853 
English case called Lumley v. Gye, a theater operator with an 
exclusive contract with an opera singer sued a competitor who 
induced the singer to sing elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The approach presents two problems for the plaintiffs: One is  
showing that, by failing to produce Yashin, the Senators have 
breached the ticket contract. The other is proving that Yashin or 
Gandler intended to cause that breach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me to be something of a stretch, to find an  
intention directed at the fans and not just at the team,'' said 
Harvard law professor Paul Weiler, who wrote the textbook on sports 
law and is a native Canadian. ``It depends to some extent on how 
broadly the Canadian courts will consider intention. It is a 
difficult thing to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, filed this week in Ontario's Superior Court of  
Justice, details how the Senators had their most successful season 
ever last year, and how Yashin was a big part of that. With 44 
goals with 50 assists, he accounted for 35 percent of the team's 
scoring and was a finalist for the NHL's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	In the offseason, Yashin was the centerpiece of a marketing  
campaign that helped close 11,000 season ticket contracts at an 
average of $4,000 -- a total of more than $40 million in Canadian 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans were aware and relied upon the fact that the defendant  
Yashin was contracted to play for the Club for the 1999-2000 NHL 
season, and as a result purchased their tickets with the 
expectation that Yashin would fulfill his contract with the Club 
for the 1999-2000 season and play hockey,'' the complaint reads. 
``Yashin and Gandler acted deliberately and maliciously and in a 
manner calculated to diminish ... the contract between the 
Plaintiff and the Club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Weiler said, that doesn't necessarily amount to  
inducing a breach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price of a ticket is much, much more based on the name of  
the team than the specifics of what's happening in the short run,'' 
Weiler said, ``as the Orioles or Dodgers season ticket-holders 
learned this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiler noted that Denver fans have no right to sue John Elway  
for retiring or Terrell Davis for getting injured, even though 
their absence makes Broncos tickets worth less. However, Cogan 
noted, neither Elway nor Davis -- nor the underperforming Dodgers 
and Orioles -- violated a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the rules, these things can happen. But it's not  
provided that he can breach a contract,'' Cogan said. ``It's a 
wrongful act. That's the key thing here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks damages of $8 million apiece from Yashin and  
Gandler, and punitive damages of $5 million and $6.5 million, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Cogan said he is handling the case for expenses. Ticket-holders  
wanting to sign up must agree that they will donate any damages 
they win to charity, a condition insisted upon by Leonard Potechin, 
the name plaintiff in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	A 73-year-old retired real estate broker, former minor leaguer  
and Senators season ticket-holder ``from day 1,'' Potechin said the 
idea for the lawsuit came while when he and his friends were having 
a beer after a round of golf. While they were complaining about 
Yashin's holdout, Cogan walked in. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what happens in court, Potechin said, the group has  
``already won'' by forcing both sides to remember the fans. But the 
real victory for the self-described hockey nut would be to get 
Yashin back into a Senators uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy is worth the price of admission. He's an outstanding  
player, no question about it,'' Potechin said. ``I just find it 
unacceptable that star hockey players would withhold their services 
for a buck.''

<HEADLINE> Top Horses To Face New Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lemon Drop Kid and Silverbulletday will take on  
new challenges Sunday at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kid, who moved into the 3-year-old championship picture by  
adding a victory in the Travers to his win in the Belmont Stakes, 
will make his debut against older horses in the 1 1/4-mile Jockey Club 
Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, a 3-year-old filly who has won eight of nine  
starts this year and 14 of 16 career outings, will race for the 
first time against older fillies and mares in the 1 1/8-mile Beldame. 
</P>
<P>
	``Always respect your elders,'' said Scotty Schulhofer, trainer  
of Lemon Drop Kid. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially when some of those elders are 5-year-old Behrens,  
winner of four of his last five starts, including two Grade I 
stakes; 4-year-old Almutawakel, winner of the Dubai World Cup and 
second last month in the Woodward at Belmont, and 7-year-old River 
Keen, second in Pacific Classic at Del Mar and winner of the 
Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behrens is probably at the top of those,'' Schulhofer said.  
``He's an excellent horse, and he's doing very well. I'm not 
confident I can beat him, but I'm sure going to try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million Gold Cup and $500,000 Beldame are two of three  
Grade I stakes Sunday at Belmont. The other is the $400,000 
Frizette for 2-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	In two Grade I stakes Saturday, More Than Ready, winner of five  
of six starts, and Hopeful winner High Yield are among seven 
2-year-olds in the $400,000 Champagne at 1 1-16 miles; and Val's 
Prince, the Man o'War winner, will meet seven rivals in the 
$600,000 Turf Classic over 1 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Also entered Friday for the Gold Cup, a weight-for-age stakes,  
were Back Ring Al, Catienus, Jack Grandi and two other 3-year-olds 
-- Stephen Got Even, third in the Woodward, and Vision and Verse, a 
close second to Lemon Drop Kid in the Belmont and Travers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any horse who wins the Belmont and the Travers and was the  
2-year-old he was has got to be a good horse,'' said Jim Bond, 
trainer of Behrens, whose four-race winning streak ended when he 
lost by a nose to Victory Gallop in the 1 1/8-mile Whitney Handicap. 
``But he has to run an A-plus race to beat older horses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-year-olds will carry 123 pounds, the others 126.  
</P>
<P>
	John Ward, trainer of Beldame starter Beautiful Pleasure, feels  
the same way about Silverbulletday's challenge to older fillies and 
mares. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like Silverbulletday has been running in the college  
ranks,'' he said. ``Now she's moving into the pros. I don't think 
Silverbulletday can make any mistakes and win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday's only defeat this year was a seventh against  
males in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes. She is trained by Bob Baffert, 
who also prepares River Keen. 
</P>
<P>
	Beautiful Pleasure, winner of the Personal Ensign, will be one  
of Silverbulletday's four rivals in the Beldame. The others are 
Catinca, winner of the 1 1-16-mile Ruffian at Belmont, and Rap and 
Dance and 3-year-old Queen's Word. The 3-year-olds will carry 119 
pounds, and rest 123. 
</P>
<P>
	Finder's Fee, winner the Matron last month at Belmont, will face  
four other juvenile fillies in the 1 1-16-mile Frizette.

<HEADLINE> Students Treat Computerized Patient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Louis Garcia's eyes seem a little yellow. He  
feels fine, but his wife worries his new cholesterol medicine might 
be causing a side effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical student assigned to his case asks if Garcia drinks  
alcohol, orders some tests and sends him home to await the results 
-- he has no other symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	But a few days later, Garcia arrives at the emergency room at 5  
a.m. with a fever and abdominal pain. This routine case of jaundice 
suddenly got worse -- he needs emergency drainage of his bile ducts 
and may have cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Teaching medical students how to deal with a tricky case like  
Garcia's is getting more difficult in today's health-care 
environment: With more outpatient care and shorter 
hospitalizations, there's less time for hands-on learning about 
certain illnesses at the side of the experienced physician. 
</P>
<P>
	Textbook instruction on how to handle various symptoms cannot  
substitute for that start-to-finish experience of diagnosing a 
mysterious complaint, choosing a treatment and getting the patient 
through sometimes side effect-prone therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Garcia: He's a ``virtual patient,'' a computer simulation  
based on a real patient treated by Dr. James McGee, a 
gastroenterologist at Beth Israel-Deaconess Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He's so sophisticated that diagnosing and treating him is pretty  
close to a face-to-face doctor visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Type in a question about Garcia's health and a videotape of him  
answering immediately pops up. An actor was taped answering every 
question Harvard Medical School's physicians and professors could 
think of. 
</P>
<P>
	Student-doctors conducting a ``physical exam'' see close-up  
video of the patient's body. Even the faint curve in the spine of a 
female virtual patient clearly shows, a sign of her bone-destroying 
osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
	The simulators ``won't replace real patients by any means,''  
McGee stresses. But they give student-doctors more practice with 
conditions they may not see enough in medical school, so they're 
better equipped before treating your family. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard is programming virtual patients with conditions ranging  
from HIV and chest pain to depression and pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	They're like flight simulators that pilots use -- better to learn  
by hurting a virtual patient than a real one. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the simulators pose numerous pitfalls for would-be  
doctors, whose every decision, and every mistake, is analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just ordered $740 of unnecessary medical tests,'' the  
simulator interrupts at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Another lesson: Plan ahead. Take virtual patient Carolyn Smith,  
a 79-year-old who fractured a hip four years ago but complains that 
``I'm still wobbling'' and seems to be getting shorter. 
</P>
<P>
	Classic osteoporosis signs, so you ask about calcium in her  
diet, osteoporosis in her family and whether she's ever taken 
estrogen, a hormone that protects women's bones. You examine her 
spine and run a few tests, including ruling out a bone-weakening 
thyroid problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoa,'' the simulator says, ``you forgot to order a  
mammogram.'' A breast X-ray for a bone complaint? Yes, because if 
you ultimately prescribe bone-protective estrogen, you first need 
to know she is free of breast cancer that that hormone can 
stimulate. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtual patients even teach the art of talking with and  
educating worried patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's mammogram, for instance, finds a slight abnormality that  
a radiologist might merely want to re-examine in six months. A 
frightened Smith demands a biopsy. At some point, the med student 
realizes that salving a patient's feelings can be worth an 
unnecessary test. 
</P>
<P>
	And one day Smith's teen-aged granddaughter accompanies her to  
the ``doctor.'' Knowing osteoporosis is in the family, a good 
student-doctor will wheedle out of the girl the admission that she 
chooses Coke over milk and shuns other calcium-rich food like 
broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to teach how to work with people to prevent disease,''  
McGee explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Some medical schools already use various types of simulators,  
but Harvard says its version is more lifelike, allowing multiple 
patient interactions over time and numerous outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
	They're expensive, costing over $200,000 each to create, funded  
mostly by the nonprofit Macy Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Harvard says the virtual patients are important enough that  
it currently is negotiating to create a library of simulators 
available for every medical school.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fluctuate; Dow Down 3.48 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fluctuated in early trading today  
as investors tried to determine whether the government's employment 
report signaled that inflation was accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 3.48 at 10,533.57. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 0.58 at 1,318.22 and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 21.25 at 2,839.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks seesawed after the Labor Department reported that  
employers cut their payrolls by 8,000 jobs in September, the first 
drop since January 1996. Analysts had expected companies to add 
220,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the decline in jobs, wage pressures rose in  
September. Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation 
pressures, grew by 0.5 percent to $13.37 in September, much sharper 
than the 0.2 percent increase in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department also said the nation's unemployment rate  
was unchanged at 4.2 percent in September, a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	The report sent mixed signals to the stock market. There were  
relief over the decline in job growth, but there also was concern 
that the rising wages could mean inflation is picking up momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors worry that any signs of rising inflation may cause the  
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the third time this 
year. The Fed boosted rates twice this summer to try to keep the 
economy from overheating and to head off a resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 111.35 million 
shares, down slightly from Thursday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index fell 1.65 at 428.11.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.41 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.3 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Says Grain Glut Worsening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The stockpiles of grain that have kept  
commodity prices depressed for two years are growing, the 
government said Friday. That could mean another tough year for 
growers in 2000 and keep the cost of federal farm programs soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's bumper crops will push the corn surplus to nearly 2  
billion bushels -- more than 20 percent of the nation's total 
production -- and boost wheat stocks to 987 million bushels, the 
Agriculture Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's expected to knock 10 cents off the price farmers get per  
bushel of corn, dropping it to $1.85, and a nickel off the price of 
wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we've still got big production in the United States,  
big production around the world, and you're going to have to see 
some change in weather or in the farm program to reduce supply,'' 
said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities Inc. of West Des 
Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, the Senate is expected to send President Clinton an  
$8.7 billion package of emergency farm-income assistance and 
disaster relief, the second multibillion-dollar bailout package in 
as many years. 
</P>
<P>
	The way things stand, additional such assistance will likely be  
necessary in 2000, said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., 
who would like to change the farm program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concept of so-called emergency funding is going to start  
wearing thin with nonagricultural senators and congressman,'' he 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the latest aid package, direct government payments to  
farmers are expected to reach $21 billion this year, eclipsing the 
old record of $17 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Commodity prices collapsed in 1998 because of the financial  
crisis in Asia and Russia and strong crop production worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department expects farm exports -- down $10  
billion this year from their record of just under $60 billion in 
1996 -- to improve only slightly next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Government price supports are just high enough to encourage  
farmers to continue planting crops already in surplus, but the 
subsidies aren't enough to keep many producers in business without 
other sources of income, said Howard Doster, an agricultural 
economist at Purdue University. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we grow another big crop (next year) and the Asian economy  
stays the way it is, the conditions could stay the way they are. 
But I still have hope for next year,'' said Nathan Johnson, who 
grows corn and soybeans near Lowry, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Drought and flooding have taken their toll on some crops,  
especially soybeans and cotton in the East and South, but USDA 
increased its forecast of this year's corn crop by 1 percent from 
last month because of higher-than-expected yields in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The department lowered its forecast of the cotton crop by 6  
percent and reduced its estimate for soybeans by 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA said it expects soybean prices to be 20 cents a bushel  
higher than previously thought this year, reaching an average of $5 
a bushel, because of the decline in production. The government is 
not allowed to estimate cotton prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought started in the East and spread across portions of  
the Midwest and down across much of the South. It turned out to be 
a boon for some growers in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is expected to harvest 1.2 million pounds of apples  
this year, up 160,000 pounds from last year, because the drought 
reduced insect and disease problems and September rains came in 
time to increase the size of the fruit. Production also is up in 
Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern grape crops also are better this year because of the dry  
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, USDA says this year's orange crop will hit 12.1  
million tons, up 22 percent from last year when a freeze badly 
damaged California's production. Orange prices are unlikely to 
change much, however, because of low inventory and high demand for 
juice, said Andy LaVigne, chief executive officer of Florida Citrus 
Mutual.

<HEADLINE> Actor Orders Edit in Comedy Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Monty Python star John Cleese ordered train crash  
footage edited out of the comedy group's upcoming 30-year 
anniversary special due to this week's train tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	A train collision Tuesday near London's Paddington Station  
killed at least 33 people, and authorities feared the death toll 
would rise much higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Monty Python) always specialized in bad taste, but there are  
some jokes you could never do,'' Cleese said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The special, which will be aired Saturday by the British  
Broadcasting Corp., will include some fresh Python material and a 
reworking of the troupe's ``dead parrot'' sketch by the creators of 
``South Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny, who dies in every episode of the cartoon series, will  
take the place of the parrot. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sent it to us without us asking,'' Cleese said of the  
creators of ``South Park.'' ``We're going to send them a bronze 
Python foot as a thank you, with their names spelled wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congress Back Pension Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of workers would get detailed  
information in plain language when employers change pension plans 
under legislation offered by lawmakers from both parties and 
endorsed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``This legislation would ensure that all Americans have the  
necessary information to plan for retirement,'' the president said 
in a written statement Thursday. ``It would shine sunlight on 
changes in retirement benefits. And it would do this without unduly 
burdening employers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is the latest response to the trend among companies  
to convert traditional pensions to ``cash balance'' plans, which 
have raised concerns that workers frequently are unaware they may 
get lower benefits, particularly if they are older. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, to be jointly introduced in the House and Senate by  
Democrats and Republicans, would require basic notice of pension 
changes at least 45 days before they take effect. For pension plans 
with 100 or more participants, the notice would have to detail the 
new benefit formulas and illustrate how benefit accrual rates might 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, participants in the larger plans could obtain an  
individual benefit statement describing in plain language the 
changes affecting that person. These statements could be requested 
90 days after the change's effective date and would have to be 
provided within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers now must provide notice when they make pension changes  
that would reduce the rate at which employees earn future benefits. 
But such notices do not have to be ``clear and complete,'' as the 
legislation would require. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employees have a right to know and understand the personal  
impact of any changes to their personal pension,'' said Rep. Jerry 
Weller, R-Ill., one of the prime House co-sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 companies have converted to cash-balance pension  
plans in recent years. Such plans are popular among younger workers 
because they often can be shifted from job to job and frequently 
permit lump-sum payouts. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the accrual rate of benefits is changed, older  
employees often find that their peak earning years no longer 
translate into higher retirement payments -- and sometimes into cuts 
of 20 percent to 50 percent from what they had expected. This has 
led to claims of age discrimination and investigations by the 
Internal Revenue Service, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
and Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Several groups of employees that have opposed pension changes at  
their companies, including IBM and Bell Atlantic, said the 
disclosure bill does not go far enough. They want employees given a 
choice between the new and old plans and some redress for lost 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, employees across the country should have a right to  
meaningful disclosure, but they must also be given the right to 
choose which pension plan works best for them,'' said Janet Krueger 
of the IBM Employee Benefits Action Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers also were less than thrilled with the bill. Jim Klein,  
president of the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, 
said requiring detailed individual disclosure statements would be 
``complex and cumbersome'' and might persuade more and more 
employers to drop pension plans altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we want companies to stay within the defined benefit  
system, we cannot make it more onerous for them to do so,'' Klein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders said they hoped to get the bill to Clinton  
before the year is out, although that may prove difficult with time 
running short.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Piazza Out of Game 3 Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a startling shakeup for the New York Mets,  
All-Star catcher Mike Piazza was out of the starting lineup for 
Game 3 of the NL division series against Arizona on Friday night 
because of an injured left thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Pratt was to take the place of Piazza. The best-of-5 series  
was tied at one each going into the Mets' first home playoff game 
since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza missed a game Sept. 18, a day after being hit in the  
thumb of his glove hand by a foul tip off the bat of Philadelphia's 
Ron Gant. Piazza may have hurt himself again Wednesday night in 
Game 2 against the Diamondbacks on a tag play at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt said on the trip back to New York, he talked with Piazza.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was hurting,'' the reserve catcher said. ``He told  
me it was sore. I knew there was a chance I would be playing. I 
know it's not feeling right or he'd be in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt said he was excited by the chance to start but was trying  
to keep things in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come to the park every day knowing there's a chance I might  
play,'' he said. For me, it's another game, a chance to give Mike 
another day's rest. That's what I think of it as.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza hit .303 with 40 home runs and 124 RBIs this season. He  
played the first two playoff games against Arizona and had two 
singles in nine at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	During Thursday's off-day, Piazza went for X-rays, which were  
negative. But his thumb did not appear any better when he arrived 
at Shea Stadium on Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in today and showed us a rather ugly looking  
situation,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``It was swollen 
and he couldn't bend it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been a continuation kind of thing,'' Valentine  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About three hours before gametime, Valentine said Piazza would  
try to take batting practice. Valentine still held out slight hope 
Piazza might be able to play, but did not sound encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would hamper his hitting and the catching could  
aggravate it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thumb is the most important finger for a catcher,'' Pratt  
said. ``You feel it every time you catch a pitch. It absorbs a lot 
of pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benny Agbayani was listed as the cleanup hitter in Piazza's  
place against Arizona's Omar Daal. Pratt was to bat seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you can't replace Mike Piazza in the lineup,'' Mets  
pitcher Al Leiter said. ``Hopefully, he'll be ready tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt hit .293 with three home runs and 21 RBIs in 140 at-bats  
this season.

<HEADLINE> Father of Boxer Buster Douglas Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The father of former heavyweight champion  
Buster Douglas, himself a former amateur champion, has died of 
colon cancer at age 59. 
</P>
<P>
	William L. Douglas II, who also was a pro boxer, died Thursday  
at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas' record was 41-14-1 in his 13-year career, with 31  
knockouts. He was the Golden Gloves middleweight champion in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Buster Douglas won the undisputed heavyweight title in February  
1990 with a shocking knockout of then-unbeaten Mike Tyson in the 
10th round of a fight in Tokyo. Douglas went in to the fight as a 
42-1 underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost the title to Evander Holyfield in his next fight on a  
third-round knockout, and he didn't fight again for six years. At 
one point, he weighed around 400 pounds and was reported to be 
close to death from a diabetic coma. 
</P>
<P>
	Buster Douglas returned to the ring in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	William Douglas also is survived by another son, William; four  
grandchildren and a great-grandson. His wife, Lula Pearl Douglas, 
and sons Arthur and Robert, are deceased. 
</P>
<P>
	A private service will be conducted by the Gary Memorial Chapel  
funeral home of Bexley. Burial will be in Glen Rest Memorial 
Estates.

<HEADLINE> Germans Offers $3.3B to Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Everyone says they want to get it over as  
quickly as possible. But that was one of the few things both sides 
agreed on when German negotiators and Nazi labor camp survivors met 
to settle compensation for wartime atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany offered Thursday to pay $3.3 billion to former slave  
laborers and other victims of Adolf Hitler's World War II regime, 
calling it ``a considerable amount.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for survivors termed the offer ``shameful,''  
``an insult'' and ``disgusting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the offer ``represents a basis for serious discussion,''  
said the main U.S. negotiator, Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart E. 
Eizenstat. 
</P>
<P>
	Another round of talks is planned in several weeks in Bonn, with  
an eye toward completing an agreement by year's end and starting 
payments in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides noted that survivors are elderly and more are dying  
every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's money offer came on the closing day of a  
multinational meeting aimed at working out compensation for people 
who worked in forced or slave labor camps to the benefit of 
Hitler's war machine -- as well as other victims of the Nazi period. 
</P>
<P>
	German industry says the number of surviving forced and slave  
laborers is about 900,000; estimates from the other side are as 
high as 2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	German envoy Otto Lambsdorff, who presented Germany's joint  
government and industry offer, said a new foundation would 
administer the funds. About a third of the money is from the 
government and two-thirds from German industry, negotiators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an insult,'' Rudy Kennedy of London, whose mother, sister  
and father were killed in the Holocaust, said outside the State 
Department, which served as meeting host. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world will judge the morality of this offer and ... will  
condemn it,'' said Mel Weiss, an attorney for some survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambsdorff acknowledged that the money ``is not enough to help  
all those who feel they suffered during that period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``It is not easy to make the case to German  
citizens'' for such payments while they are suffering cutbacks in 
social services and other financial problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German diplomats accompanying Lambsdorff also stressed that the  
new money comes on top of more than $55 billion in compensation 
that Germany already has paid for various Holocaust-related crimes 
since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambsdorff said 20 companies beyond the 16 originally sued in  
the United States had agreed to contribute to the foundation. He 
said the foundation would receive claims not only against 
contributing companies, but against any wartime German company, 
even if it no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that have been sued in the United States on forced  
labor and related claims include Bayer pharmaceuticals, carmakers 
DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor Co. and chemical conglomerate 
Hoechst AG. Names of all companies that have pledged contributions 
have not been publicly released. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the money in the new offer, about $2.3 billion,  
would go to slave and forced laborers, Lambsdorff said, with slave 
laborers getting $5,500 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department says an estimated 12 million workers were  
forced to work in German industry and agriculture during World War 
II. Some produced materials for the war, and some took over jobs 
from German men, freeing them to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the United States and Germany, the other  
countries involved in the negotiations are Israel, Poland, Belarus, 
Ukraine, Russia and the Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey Pushes for Tycoon's Take </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Former tycoon Robert E. Brennan has failed  
to pay a penny of the $45 million he owes New Jersey, so the state 
is asking a judge for a cut of his income, contending he is living 
in luxury. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing on the state's motion is scheduled today before State  
Superior Court Judge Philip M. Freedman, who shepherded the June 
settlement of stock fraud charges against Brennan and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan avoided a trial by agreeing to pay $45 million and  
accepting a lifetime ban on participating in the securities 
industry in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, 56, a longtime New Jersey resident now living in Juno  
Beach, Fla., did not return a message left Thursday at Due Process 
Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The club is in Colts Neck, N.J., and is operated by Pirates  
Associates, which pays Brennan $388,000 a year in consulting fees, 
according to court papers filed Monday by the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Divorced and with three adult children, Brennan has ``few  
expenses other than travel and entertainment,'' and has not let 
bankruptcy cramp his style, the state contended. 
</P>
<P>
	He ``pays no rent, travels by chauffeur driven limousine, owns  
no property, pays no salaries, travels abroad with some degree of 
regularity and appears to have no extraordinary expenses related to 
ill health or day to day living,'' the state argued. 
</P>
<P>
	It listed Brennan's ``lifestyle expenditures'' in June and July,  
which included $2,829.10 at a liquor store and more than $1,900 in 
fees at three golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
	The state contends that it could be entitled to Brennan's entire  
income, or just 25 percent, depending on which guidelines are used. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if the state collects $388,000 for 20 years -- the  
maximum period the debt is owed under state law -- it would reap 
just $7.76 million of the $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The state claims that since Brennan is not paid hourly, it is  
properly seeking an ``order to pay out of income.'' It is also 
seeking money from any personal bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is to compensate the investors state regulators  
believe Brennan swindled. In the settlement, Brennan denied 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan became nationally known in the 1980s through television  
commercials for his First Jersey Securities Inc. in which he 
stepped from a helicopter and told investors to ``come grow with 
us.'' The company has been inactive since 1987.

<HEADLINE> Ito: Courts Need More Interpreters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The judge who presided over O.J. Simpson's  
criminal trial made a rare public appearance Friday to encourage 
support for his pet project -- bringing more court interpreters into 
a system populated by many minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Lance Ito told an American Bar Association  
gathering on race and ethnicity that he has been working for six 
years to integrate more interpreters into the court system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our court deals with 200 languages on a daily basis,'' Ito  
told the group, adding that census estimates show that in the year 
2000, some 40 million Americans will speak a language other than 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been a lack of understanding of the widespread need  
for interpreters, particularly in federal immigration courts, which 
require interpreters only for the testimony of an immigrant but not 
for the entire proceeding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal in the justice system is that any person who comes  
into the system who does not speak English will be in the same 
position as someone who does speak English,'' Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ethnic bar associations have dropped the ball on this,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge opened his remarks with a joke: ``My claim to fame is  
not having tried a certain football player a number of years ago. 
It's that for the past six years I've chaired the court panel on 
interpreters.''

<HEADLINE> HMO Bill Faces Fight in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly one in three House Republicans joined  
with Democrats to approve a controversial new right to sue health 
insurance plans, part of a wide-reaching patient protection bill. 
But in the Senate, the GOP has held together, and the legislation 
faces an uphill struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	As the issue heads to a conference committee, where lawmakers  
from both chambers will try to work out the differences, Democrats 
and their allies are hoping that Thursday's strong House vote will 
pressure the Senate to cave. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, backed by insurance and business groups, are  
counting on the Senate to hold the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how Republicans can stand in the way of this kind  
of groundswell,'' said a hopeful Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who 
led his party when the Senate debated the issue in July. ``The 
Senate flunked its test earlier in the year but we have a second 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Don Nickles, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, vowed  
to stop many of the provisions passed by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will work aggressively to ensure that this Congress does not  
pass any legislation that would cause a dramatic increase in health 
care costs (or) increase the number of uninsured,'' said Nickles, 
R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest groups on both sides promised to keep up the pressure.  
</P>
<P>
	``The fight is not over,'' said Karen Ignagi, president of the  
American Association of Health Plans, the HMO trade group, which 
was intensely involved in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate versions have two major differences. The  
Senate includes no new rights to file lawsuits. And many of the 
Senate provisions apply only to the 48 million Americans in health 
plans that fall under a 1974 federal benefits law. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're clearly miles apart,'' said Larry Levitt, an analyst  
at the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent policy group in San 
Francisco. ``The Senate had plenty of opportunity in their debate 
to go as far as the House did and decided pretty forcefully not 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested the Senate and the House might agree on many minor  
differences between their bills, and possibly how many people are 
covered. However, he said, ``The right to sue is still very 
tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many issues that were contested only a year ago are now  
essentially givens. Democrats have won the most basic question: 
Whether there should be new federal regulations at all for health 
insurance companies, which are traditionally regulated by states. 
</P>
<P>
	And many of the patient protections found in both bills were  
once a source of much debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would guarantee access to reasonable emergency  
room care, give patients the right to see pediatricians and 
obstetricians without permission from primary care doctors, and 
require HMOs to pay for routine care associated with clinical 
trials. It would require HMOs to disclose a lot of information and 
let patients take their complaints to outside arbitrators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill is nearly identical.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think mountains have been moved here,'' said Ron Pollack,  
president of Families USA, a liberal consumer group. Still, he 
said, ``It's far from clear we're going to end up with a bill 
that's enacted into law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the right to sue has overwhelmed all else. And no  
one is sure whether the 2000 election politics will stiffen each 
side's spine or encourage a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert downplayed the differences.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-five percent of that bill was stuff that I've been  
working on for years to try to get passed,'' Hastert, R-Ill., told 
reporters Friday in Topeka, Kan. He called the right-to-sue issue, 
which tangled his leadership team in knots for months, ``a little 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically what happened yesterday was a bipartisan issue that  
was passed on a bipartisan basis,'' Hastert said. ``We've taken a 
step forward.''

<HEADLINE> Xerox Warns of Earnings Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Shares of Xerox Corp. plunged 24 percent  
Friday after the company said its third-quarter earnings would fall 
due to increased pressure from competitors and lower productivity 
from its sales force. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox said it expects a 10 percent to 12 percent drop in  
earnings per share from 53 cents in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had been expecting Xerox to earn 58 cents a share for  
the three-month period ending Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock fell $10.25 to close at $32.50 a share as  
the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with more 
than 46 million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox announced in April that it was reorganizing its  
14,000-person sales force in a push to boost sales of ``bundled'' 
services to corporate customers, integrating fax machines, 
printers, copiers and personal computer software. The company said 
it planned to move its sales force away from geographical coverage 
toward coverage of specific industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just taken longer to implement and it's caused more  
disruption than we anticipated,'' said Xerox spokesman Judd 
Everhart. ``The disruption has an impact on their ability to get in 
front of our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox said third-quarter results were also hurt by economic  
weakness in Brazil, which was forced to devalue its currency 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was also weaker than anticipated both in the United  
States and Europe, particularly in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to announce third quarter results on Oct. 18.

<HEADLINE> Phelps Dodge Won't Raise Asarco Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Copper giant Phelps Dodge Corp. is staying put in  
the fight for Asarco Inc., refusing to top the $1.17 billion offer 
made by Grupo Mexico and marking a possible end to the bidding war 
for the New York-based producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco's board had agreed Tuesday to be acquired by Phelps Dodge  
for about $1.1 billion in cash and stock, but on Thursday, Grupo 
Mexico came back with a higher all-cash offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Grupo Mexico, which has a 10 percent stake in Asarco, offered  
$29.50 per share in cash, topping Phelps Dodge's offer by more than 
3 percent. Asarco then reversed itself, saying Friday that it was 
recommending to shareholders that they accept Grupo Mexico's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals have come about as the industry, which was battered by  
overproduction and softened demand from Asia, is slowly rebounding 
from rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry leader Phelps Dodge had hoped that Asarco would be the  
third member of a merger with Cyprus Amax Minerals Co., which it is 
acquiring for $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Friday, Phelps Dodge called its last offer its  
best, and declined Asarco's request to submit another offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phelps Dodge will not raise its offer for Asarco, and we're  
confident that shareholders of Phelps Dodge and Cyprus Amax will 
understand and appreciate the financial discipline behind our 
decision,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Tuzamos, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said  
Phelps Dodge might not be out of the race just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be that Phelps Dodge is taking the tack of waiting to  
see how strong the financing commitment of Grupo Mexico is,'' 
Tuzamos said. ``They may just be taking several more days to 
deliberate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the company could also be protecting itself from financial  
strain, Tuzamos added. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may be afraid that making too high an offer would hurt  
them too. It's not a clear call,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco will pay a $30 million fee if it breaks the Phelps Dodge  
deal and pursues negotiations with Grupo Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of  
Phelps Dodge rose $1.62 1/2 to $56.06 1/4, while shares of Asarco fell 
43 3/4 cents to $29.31 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Twins Owner Agrees To Sell Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad has  
agreed to sell his team to Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor and Wild 
lead investor Robert Naegele Jr. for $120 million if a new stadium 
is built. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a great ride,'' Pohlad said today, recalling the  
1987 and 1991 World Series championships during his 16 years as 
team owner. ``This is a day of high emotion for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very optimistic and very pleased that things worked out  
over in St. Paul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he stressed that the sale doesn't become final until a  
stadium is built. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal faces several formidable obstacles, but Pohlad is  
optimistic that it will be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman announced the proposed sale Thursday  
night. Coleman has sought the sale as part of a plan to build a new 
stadium along the city's riverfront and entice the Twins to leave 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Pohlad would hand over control of the team  
to Taylor, owner of Minnesota's NBA team, and Naegele, managing 
partner of the NHL expansion Wild, once the new stadium is assured. 
Until then, the team will be under dual stewardship, said Twins 
President Jerry Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for a new $325 million stadium, as now structured, are  
contingent on St. Paul voters approving a Nov. 2 referendum calling 
for a sales tax increase that would finance one-third of the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Coleman's plan, the Twins would pay one-third and the  
state would be asked to pay for the other third of the outdoor 
park. The plan needs approval from the Legislature, where 
opposition is considerable. Gov. Jesse Ventura also opposes public 
funding of a new ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, after intense opposition from voters across the  
state that included 150,000 calls to Capitol switchboards, the 
House voted 84-47 against a stadium-funding plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball owners must approve any transfer, a  
process that usually takes 6-18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Pohlad reportedly turned down at least two offers in the last  
two years, most recently one from Minneapolis attorney Clark 
Griffith, who said he offered between $110 million and $120 million 
for the club. Griffith is the son of Calvin Griffith, who sold the 
team to Pohlad in 1984 for $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Griffith brought the team from Washington, D.C., in 1961.

<HEADLINE> Puppy-Killing Mayor Won't Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILFORD, Ill. (AP) -- The mayor here has decided to stay on the  
job after all -- despite the public outcry that arose when he killed 
a beagle puppy named Snoopy with a shovel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor James Cook, who faces an animal cruelty charge, had said  
he would resign Friday because of the hate mail and death threats 
he had received since the Aug. 22 incident. 
</P>
<P>
	But at a special village board meeting on Friday, Cook said many  
town residents had asked him to stay on as mayor of Milford, about 
90 miles south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook also said a legal defense fund had been started for him at  
a bank. He said the town support had ``renewed my faith in the 
basic goodness of our Milford community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cook said he struck the puppy with a shovel to shoo it away from  
workers who were building a grain bin at the elevator he manages in 
nearby Bryce. He said when he saw how badly he had injured the 
6-month-old dog, he felt the kindest thing would be to put it out 
of its misery. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother of the 6-year-old boy whose puppy Cook killed shook  
his hand after the meeting and said she had forgiven him. 
</P>
<P>
	``God forgives, so I will, too,'' said Christy Miller. ``It's  
been blown way out of proportion. When he gets death threats, 
that's not right. What he did was wrong, but he's paid too much for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police reports indicate Cook paid the owners $150 as  
compensation to the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said her son still misses his dog.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little boy,'' she said. ``He's still hurting, but he'll  
get over it in time.''

<HEADLINE> Indictments Soon in China Trade Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major American aerospace company and a  
government-owned Chinese trading firm face charges of violating 
U.S. export controls, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department decided to pursue the charges after  
determining that some machine tools were diverted for possible use 
on Chinese missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Justice officials have approved offering the companies a  
plea bargain of reduced charges in return for guilty pleas, 
according to a source familiar with the case. If a deal is not 
reached, the Justice Department will seek an indictment, it was 
learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are McDonnell Douglas, now a subsidiary of the  
Boeing Co., and the China National Aero-Technology Import Export 
Corp., a state-owned Chinese aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved McDonnell Douglas' sale in 1994 of surplus  
machine tools to the Chinese company for $5 million. The U.S 
government had licensed the tools to the Chinese company only for 
use on commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	However, McDonnell Douglas learned shortly thereafter that the  
tools had been diverted to a facility that produces Chinese 
Silkworm missiles, and informed the U.S. government of the 
diversion. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors believe that the companies knew or should have known  
that the tools would be diverted before the diversion was reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials, however, have argued that the case against the  
Chinese company is stronger than the one against McDonnell Douglas 
because the U.S. company reported the diversions to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Time magazine, which first reported the story on its Website,  
said the deadline given the companies was Oct. 21, but the exact 
date could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry McCracken, a spokesman for Boeing, told Time, ``We  
continue to believe that McDonnell Douglas acted properly in this 
matter. We've maintained that this is how the system was supposed 
to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Fires Leave Nevada Devastated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Nevada's most widespread wildland fire season  
on record left a legacy of devastation the size of the state of 
Delaware, threatening the lives of surviving animals and the 
livelihood of scores of ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Nevadans are worried more about seeds than smoke. Among the  
top priorities is to replant the barren ground with native grasses 
and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most extensive rangeland reseeding effort ever  
undertaken in Nevada -- and maybe anywhere,'' said Gene Kolkman. The 
Ely district manager for the federal Bureau of Land Management is 
coordinating that part of a statewide emergency action plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difficulties we face from this disaster are enormous.''  
</P>
<P>
	A rash of thunderstorms in early August and then again in the  
middle of the month sparked fires that burned 2,468 square miles of 
grass, brush and trees, primarily in the northeastern part of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 major fires blackened areas ranging from a few  
hundred acres to the Poker Brown fire southwest of Winnemucca, 
which covered 243,281 acres -- more than 380 square miles. By 
contrast, the District of Columbia encompasses 69 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those years that will stick out in your mind  
because of the kind of activity we've had, the acreage burned,'' 
Nevada Division of Forestry spokesman Steve Frady said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frady has seen nothing like this year, even after spending  
nearly 25 years fighting fires in Nevada. The 777,116 acres in 1996 
isn't half of this year's 1.58 million acres -- one-third of the 
total acreage burned in the nation. Wildlife division statistics 
make this the worst year in more than one-half century. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 20 miles east of Reno, Ed DePaoli looks at ashes blanketing  
what once was a grassland range. 
</P>
<P>
	``We normally would run between 200 to 300 cattle on this range  
during the late year,'' DePaoli said. ``I think we can move things 
around a bit to get by. It's our winter range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DePaoli said reseeding by the Bureau of Land Management and  
others is going to be a huge effort, since in some allotments 
nearly 90 percent was burned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough,'' DePaoli said.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 3 million pounds of grass seed are on order for fall  
planting. Sagebrush and other desert shrubs will have to wait for 
spring. Reseeding is expected to take at least three years and cost 
$50 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, new grass will replace cheat grass that found its  
way into Nevada around the turn of the century as inexpensive 
filler in packing crates. Its seed scattered into the air and 
thrived in the arid ground of the high desert, crowding out more 
beneficial plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheat grass provides sparse pasture for spring grazing, then  
quickly turns brown and lifeless in early summer -- tinder for the 
first bolt of lightning or careless camper. And since it grows 
faster than sagebrush or more nutritional grasses, it thwarts their 
recovery by competing for scant nutrients and water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over time, cheat grass can dominate a landscape,'' said  
Sherman Swanson, extension range specialist for the University of 
Nevada College of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Frady said because of the fires, some ranchers might have to  
scale back or stop operations altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the range fires we've had, we've had the livelihood of  
families affected,'' Frady said. ``Those range fires have not only 
destroyed the grazing lands that are privately owned, but also 
those federal lands that are grazing allotments. There's going to 
have to be a significant shift for many of those people in how they 
do their business on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BLM's Kolkman agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough situation for these ranchers. At the moment,  
they're staring at black,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also staring at black are the wildland animals that escaped the  
flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the fire is over, life doesn't go on,'' said Jim  
Jeffress, a biologist with the Nevada Division of Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``For decades and decades to come, the manifestations and  
impacts of those fires will be felt in the wildlife communities, 
from the mice on up to the big-game species.''

<HEADLINE> Father of Boxer Buster Douglas Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The father of former heavyweight champion  
Buster Douglas, himself a former amateur champion, has died of 
colon cancer at age 59. 
</P>
<P>
	William L. Douglas II, who also was a pro boxer, died Thursday  
at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas' record was 41-14-1 in his 13-year career, with 31  
knockouts. He was the Golden Gloves middleweight champion in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Buster Douglas won the undisputed heavyweight title in February  
1990 with a shocking knockout of then-unbeaten Mike Tyson in the 
10th round of a fight in Tokyo. Douglas went in to the fight as a 
42-1 underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost the title to Evander Holyfield in his next fight on a  
third-round knockout, and he didn't fight again for six years. At 
one point, he weighed around 400 pounds and was reported to be 
close to death from a diabetic coma. 
</P>
<P>
	Buster Douglas returned to the ring in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	William Douglas also is survived by another son, William; four  
grandchildren and a great-grandson. His wife, Lula Pearl Douglas, 
and sons Arthur and Robert, are deceased. 
</P>
<P>
	A private service will be conducted by the Gary Memorial Chapel  
funeral home of Bexley. Burial will be in Glen Rest Memorial 
Estates.

<HEADLINE> Austrians Say Neo-Nazism Is Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Prominent Austrians sought Friday to  
convince foreign governments that the country is not facing a wave 
of neo-Nazi sentiment after stunning electoral gains by a far 
right-wing party. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's president, Thomas Klestil, and a former president,  
Kurt Waldheim, said foreign criticism following a strong finish by 
the Freedom Party of Joerg Haider was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	Haider, meanwhile, began his own campaign to refurbish his image  
as an outspoken proponent of right-wing -- some critics would say 
neo-Nazi -- views. In an interview for broadcast by Israeli state 
television, Haider, son of a Nazi party member, said he was a 
``democrat who struggles against privilege, corruption and economic 
mismanagement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He invited Israeli critics to visit Austria -- including  
Carinthia state, which he governs -- to see that the country is an 
open society. Haider's electoral success has alarmed some 
neighboring countries and Israel because of comments he made years 
ago in praise of Adolf Hitler's ``decent employment policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said in a television interview broadcast Friday in  
Israel that officials there should keep out of the internal 
politics of his country. He responded to warnings by Foreign 
Minister David Levy that Israel will ``reassess'' its ties with 
Austria if the Freedom Party leader joins the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would recommend that the foreign minister deal with his own  
issues,'' Haider told Israel Television. ``I think that Israel 
especially has a lot of work to do in order to make peace with its 
neighbors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haider's triumph stunned Austria's staid political culture. As  
part of the damage-control campaign, Foreign Minister Wolfgang 
Schuessel plans to attend a European Union ministerial meeting 
Monday in Luxembourg, along with Levy. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuessel hopes to reassure Levy and others that Austria will  
not tolerate a revival of anti-Semitism, although the foreign 
ministry said no private meeting between the two foreign ministers 
was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The furor erupted after the Freedom Party, running on an  
anti-immigrant platform, received about a quarter of the votes in 
Sunday's national elections. With 250,000 absentee ballots still 
not tallied, Haider's party leads Schuessel's junior coalition 
partner, the conservative Austrian People's Party, in the race for 
second place. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Viktor Klima's Social Democrats were leading with the  
most votes, but the party suffered significant losses from the last 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	That has raised the possibility that the Freedom Party might end  
up in a new coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Klima said he rejects any claim ``that Austria is a right-wing,  
extremist country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klestil, meanwhile, was quoted as saying by Vienna newspapers  
Friday that, ``We Austrians are called upon to be vigilant against 
all forms of intolerance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waldheim, a former U.N. secretary-general, told the Austria  
Press Agency that the international uproar was ``entirely out of 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waldheim, however, has been barred from entering the United  
States since April 1987, after an investigation of his wartime 
activities as a German army lieutenant in the Balkans. U.S. law 
prohibits admission of any alien who participated in World War II 
persecution.

<HEADLINE> Continental, Delta Raise Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Continental Airlines and Delta Airlines have both  
increased excursion fares requiring advance purchase by up to $20 
per round trip. Separately, American Airlines announced Friday it 
will join United Airlines in cutting commissions for travel agents, 
which also could lead to additional costs for travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticket increases posted late Thursday by Houston-based  
Continental and matched Friday by Delta range generally from 3 to 7 
percent for a round trip ticket requiring seven, 14- or 21-day 
advance purchase. The increases don't apply to top-dollar business 
fares. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona-based America West Airlines also increased its fares,  
but it was unclear whether other large carriers would match 
Continental's move. Previous Continental-led fare hikes this year 
have collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated calls to Continental and America West were not  
returned. A Delta spokesman said the Atlanta-based carrier raised 
its fares ``to remain competitive'' with Continental. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Southwest Airlines does not plan a fare hike, said  
spokeswoman Linda Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
	United, the largest carrier, No. 2 American and Northwest said  
Friday they had not raised fares but declined to rule out 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel Buttrick, an analyst with Paine Webber, said other  
airlines want to raise fares, partly to cover the rising cost of 
jet fuel, but could find reason to hold back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only impediment I see (to an industry-wide fare increase)  
is a decision on the part of one or two other airlines to avoid 
simultaneously cutting commissions and raising fares,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, United Airlines cut the commission it will  
pay travel agents who sell its tickets from 8 percent to 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	American issued a statement saying it too was cutting the  
commissions and capping them at $50 per round trip ticket and $25 
for one-way tickets for domestic travel. American did not 
immediately return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Parsons, editor of Bestfares.com, said a commission cut and  
fare increase would amount to double-dipping by airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Travel agents will start charging a processing fee because  
they can't survive on 5 percent. The fare increase is like a double 
whammy for air travelers,'' Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association, said  
the commission cut is the airlines' response to customer demands 
for the lowest fares. 
</P>
<P>
	Stempler agreed that travel agents will start charging fees,  
``but the flip side is that people who weren't using travel agents 
were overpaying for something they weren't using.''

<HEADLINE> The Donald Eyes the White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump is very, very rich. Which doesn't  
mean that his talk can't be cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he announced that he'd formed an exploratory  
committee to determine his viability as a presidential candidate 
for the Reform Party -- and would like to have Oprah Winfrey as a 
running mate, although he hasn't discussed it with her. But in the 
past, the billionaire developer's done a lot of talking about a lot 
of things -- remember the United States Football League? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Trump has amassed a $1.6 billion fortune through savvy  
projects like the Grand Hyatt Hotel, Trump Tower and his Atlantic 
City casinos. But Trump occasionally has -- how to say this? -- made 
announcements that didn't amount to much. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many news-making projects exist only in his imagination,''  
read the headline on a November 1996 Trump article in the New York 
Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Take 1990, when Trump floated word that he might build a  
125-story tower -- the world's largest -- on the Los Angeles site of 
the old Ambassador Hotel. Simultaneously, city officials were 
knocking down Trump's plans for a similar edifice in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics howled that Trump was playing one city against the  
other. Trump was unmoved -- the massive building ``will only go to 
one,'' he promised. 
</P>
<P>
	It went to neither.  
</P>
<P>
	After a protracted legal battle, Trump sold his stake in the Los  
Angeles property without building anything. His Manhattan plans for 
a 150-story tower, announced in 1985, were wildly downscaled; 
construction on that West Side project continues today. Now absent 
the Television City office tower, the first of the apartment 
buildings in the complex are being occupied. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the Trump Organization announced plans for a possible  
Trump Tower Moscow. They're still waiting, comrade. Trump made 
similar comments about Trump Towers in Tokyo and Sao Paolo; none 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto an announced 1994 foray into Las Vegas. Five years later,  
Trump's casino holdings remain strictly in Atlantic City, N.J. 
Ditto a 1992 proposal for a high-tech theme park in the New Jersey 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics point to a common theme: publicity, spelled T-R-U-M-P.  
Trump creates headlines to feed a massive ego, they carp. And Trump 
certainly has enjoyed the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1991, for example, Trump stood outside a Manhattan  
courthouse waving a $10 million check and announcing that his 
divorce from wife Ivana was final. He made all the papers, but the 
divorce wasn't finalized until more than two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1989, Trump made an unsolicited takeover offer of $7  
billion for AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines. Eleven days 
after the bid created headlines, Trump withdrew it -- before it was 
ever formally presented to stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicity is always good, but candidate Trump would bring other  
things to the table. 
</P>
<P>
	He has experience with debt; he wrote ``Trump: The Art of the  
Comeback,'' a whole book about his return from a $975 million 
financial black hole. 
</P>
<P>
	He's quite the spin doctor; when a jury awarded the USFL just $1  
in its $1.3 billion lawsuit against the NFL, New Jersey Generals 
owner Trump called it ``a great moral victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump also had predicted a USFL-NFL super-duper bowl by 1990,  
perhaps played in the modestly named Trump Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, well.  
</P>
<P>
	While politicians and unfulfilled promises are not strange  
bedfellows, Trump has at least one more political drawback: his 
germ-phobia keeps him from shaking hands, much less kissing babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the curses of American society is the simple act of  
shaking hands,'' the potential politico wrote in his ``Comeback'' 
book. ``I happen to be a clean-hands freak.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Mailings Net Many Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``This may be the longest shot of my life,''  
former basketball star Bill Bradley writes to prospective 
contributors. ``But I've had some experience making long shots, and 
I know that this one is within my abilities -- as long as I have 
your help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people are giving Bradley that help -- so many, in  
fact, that he is raising $4 for every $1 he spends on direct mail 
in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	For $237,000 worth of mailings, he has raised more than $1  
million in campaign contributions. That's an unusually high success 
rate that helped him take in more money than Vice President Al Gore 
during the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates often lose money when they send out letters in search  
of contributions, considering it an investment in building a donor 
list they can use again and again. In presidential elections, such 
a list is doubly valuable because the government will match 
contributions of $250 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, candidates have to send out thousands of solicitations  
just to find a few donors; more than 95 percent of those who 
receive requests for donations simply throw the letter away. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why list building and list development and that fund  
raising is so expensive,'' fund-raising consultant Keith Davis 
said. ``The return is so low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley has defied the odds, according to the fund-raising  
figures released by his campaign. He has collected an estimated 
$6.7 million during the last three months, to $6.5 million for 
Gore, and has found more than 25,000 people willing to give to his 
campaign for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributors responded to letters like this one from Bradley,  
which included a veiled reference to Gore: 
</P>
<P>
	``I offer a life experience that reaches well beyond the  
corridors of Washington and the trappings of privilege. Voters see 
a candidate who left Washington by choice after 18 years, 
determined to work on the challenges facing our society, and to 
address them in a meaningful way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the $1 million in direct mail contributions, Bradley has  
raised $760,000 through his campaign Web site. Earlier this year, 
he got the Federal Election Commission's approval for donations 
made by credit card -- the only way someone can contribute through 
the Internet -- to be eligible for federal matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows there is a steadily growing level of grass-roots  
support for Bill Bradley,'' campaign spokesman Tony Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bradley is already asking his new friends to give again.  
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to people who already gave, he predicted the  
nomination in both parties may be wrapped up by March, a timetable 
he said he can accept. ``But I must have your financial help now,'' 
he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Court Renews Fundraising Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court reinstated  
false-statement charges Friday against a Thai businesswoman accused 
of funneling foreign contributions to the Democratic National 
Committee and other political committees. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
reinstated the charges against Pauline Kanchanalak and her 
sister-in-law and business associate, Duangnet ``Georgie'' 
Kronenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	They were indicted last year by the Justice Department's  
campaign finance task force. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are accused of using funds from foreign corporations and  
individuals -- including Kanchanalak and her husband, Jeb -- to make 
prohibited campaign contributions of at least $679,000 to the DNC 
and other U.S. political committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreigners are barred from giving what is known as ``hard''  
money intended for federal campaigns. Kanchanalak is a Thai 
citizen, while Kronenberg is a permanent resident alien and is 
entitled to make political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's appeals court ruling determined that citizens of  
foreign countries also are barred from giving ``soft'' money, which 
is money not intended for a particular federal campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanchanalak and Kronenberg were charged with one count of  
conspiracy to defraud the government by disguising the true source 
of the funds, plus multiple counts of causing the Democratic 
National Committee and other political committees to file false 
reports with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the false-statement charges except one count against  
Kronenberg were dismissed in two rulings late last year and early 
this year by U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman said prosecutors failed to show Kanchanalak and  
Kronenberg had a significant role in the submission of statements 
to the FEC by the Democratic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also said disclosure rules did not require political  
committees to reveal the original sources of ``soft'' money. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman based part of his ruling on an earlier decision that  
threw out much of the Justice Department's cases against another 
defendant in the foreign money probe, Maria Hsia. But a District of 
Columbia Circuit panel reversed that decision in May. 
</P>
<P>
	In reinstating all of the charges Friday, the appeals court said  
the decision in May required reinstatement of charges against 
Kanchanalak and Kronenberg related to hard-money donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The court added that a federal election reporting regulation  
requires reporting of the ``true sources'' of soft-money donations, 
and that the election law forbids foreign donations of soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an effort to enhance its ability to prohibit the illegal  
commingling of hard and soft money receipts, the FEC required 
identifying information for the donors of both to assist it in 
tracking the flow of funds between the two,'' wrote Judge Patricia 
Wald, a nominee of President Carter. She referred at one point to 
the defendants' ``apocalyptic reasoning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her opinion was joined by Judges Laurence H. Silberman, a  
President Reagan appointee, and David Tatel, named to the court by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanchanalak's lawyer did not immediately return a call seeking  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Give La Russa 2-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Tony La Russa will be minding the St. Louis  
Cardinals' dugout for at least another two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals announced Friday afternoon that the club has  
extended La Russa's contract through the 2001 season. The former 
Oakland A's and Chicago White Sox manager joined the Cardinals in 
1996. He's posted a 319-and-328 record with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased to announce that Tony will remain the  
Cardinals' manager into the next century,'' Cardinals general 
manager Walt Jocketty said. ``I know that Tony wants nothing more 
than to reward the Cardinals' fans for their unmatched support 
which has led to record attendance totals each of the past two 
seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, La Russa became the eleventh winningest manager of  
all time. He leads all active major league managers with 1,639 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals finished 11 games below .500 this year, 75-86,  
fourth place in the NL Central and 21 1/2 games behind first-place 
Houston. The team lost starting pitcher Matt Morris during spring 
training with an arm injury and another starter, Donovan Osborne, 
early in the season. Outfielder Eric Davis was lost for the season 
with an injury suffered making a diving catch to preserve rookie 
Jose Jiminez's no-hitter on June 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's last appearance in the post-season came in La Russa's  
first year in St. Louis. The Cardinals lost the 1996 NLCS to 
Atlanta in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Tony) won't be satisfied until he can get the Cardinals back  
to the post-season,'' Jocketty said.

<HEADLINE> CBS Show To Strand 16 Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cross MTV's ``Real World'' with ``Lord of the  
Flies'' and what do you get? 
</P>
<P>
	A new CBS game show that will strand 16 Americans on an  
uninhabited island in the South China Sea to fend for themselves 
among the pythons and other wild animals -- including each other. 
The last contestant on the island wins $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even the network is sure how the players on ``Survivor''  
will cooperate or compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a double-edged sword,'' CBS spokesman Michael Naidus said  
Friday. ``They need each other to survive, but they know only one 
can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen men and women, to be selected from applications filed  
through CBS's Web site through Nov. 16, will be filmed 
round-the-clock during as much as seven weeks on Pulau Tiga island 
off Malaysia's Borneo coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine ``Gilligan's Island'' where the stakes and the setting  
are genuine. 
</P>
<P>
	The players must work together to survive, but every three days  
they will hold secret ballots to expel a fellow contestant. When 
the group is whittled down to the final pair, those most recently 
kicked off the island will decide who ends up the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The criteria are up to the participants, said producer Mark  
Burnett. Those voted out early on will be returned home, while 
those who will be casting the final ballots will remain in 
Malaysia, keeping an eye on the contestants through videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	A Swedish version of the show has been on there for three years  
and is a smash ratings hit. Charlie Parsons, a veteran British TV 
producer who created the idea, sold the U.S. and Canadian rights to 
Burnett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine the chance to take seven weeks out of your life, all  
expenses paid, get a leave of absence from work,'' said Burnett. 
``It's like living a National Geographic experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a fishbowl.  
</P>
<P>
	Burnett called it fair to draw comparisons to ``Real World,''  
which puts young people's unguarded daily lives on camera, and to 
``Lord of the Flies,'' the 1954 William Golding novel about kids 
who survive a plane crash only to descend into barbarism on an 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	``While not survival on the edge of death, it's a very  
forbidding island,'' Burnett said. ``I'm sure there's going to be 
major conflicts, but I don't expect them to be hunting each other 
with spears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, there will be rules to bar serious misbehavior. Burnett  
said contestants in the Swedish version have tended to vote out the 
least sociable people. In that sense, it's a sort of 
survival-of-the-fittest -- and the nicest. 
</P>
<P>
	Fruit, fish and fresh water are abundant, Burnett said, and each  
contestant can bring one thing from the outside world, besides 
clothing and necessary medicine. On the Swedish series, contestants 
have picked such diverse items as a Bible, toothbrush and toilet 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone smart will bring a fishing line,'' Burnett suggested.  
</P>
<P>
	Medical specialists will be placed away from the group on the  
10-square-mile island in case of emergency, said CBS spokesman 
Chris Ender. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the contestants will have background checks, medical  
screenings and psychological evaluations. We will make sure 
everybody headed for Malaysia is ready for the experience,'' Ender 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-episode series will air next summer.  
</P>
<P>
	Neal Gabler, author of ``Life The Movie,'' said the program may  
seem outrageous but reflects the evolution of popular culture. 
People want to see real human behavior, not fictional 
entertainment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life has thrown up to us so many interesting narratives that  
fiction can't compete,'' Gabler said. ``How can anything in 
conventional entertainment compete with an O.J. Simpson or a Monica 
Lewinsky? We now want the real thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett had a much simpler explanation: ``People like to watch  
other people in uncomfortable situations.''

<HEADLINE> King Abdullah Carries Iraqi Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- King Abdullah of Jordan, in a weeklong U.S.  
visit, will ask for duty-free access to American markets and more 
weapons while backing Israeli-Arab peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was bringing a message from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein  
to President Clinton, but administration officals said they doubted 
it would be a serious overture. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah, stepping smoothly into the shoes of his late father,  
King Hussein, is projecting Jordan as a moderate Arab regime that 
is aligning itself with peace moves as beneficial to his kingdom 
and the region at large. 
</P>
<P>
	He was pressing his case for a bigger share of American markets  
with Commerce Secretary William Daley today and will see President 
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old king also hopes to get a promised $300 million  
financial aid package that Congress has so far refused to approve. 
The aid was promised to Jordan as part of last year's Wye River 
peace accord in exchange for Hussein's diplomatic efforts to 
promote an Israeli pullback on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional skepticism based on Jordan's support for Iraq in  
the Persian Gulf War diminished in a spirited campaign by his 
father to support U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East. The cut in new 
aid to Jordan more likely reflects widespread reservations with 
foreign aid, generally, on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a three-day weekend, the king intends to enjoy autumn in  
New England and attend the wedding of a private school classmate. 
His father also usually mixed business with pleasure on trips here. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking off for the United States, Abdullah told Jordanian  
reporters he was carrying a message from to Clinton from Saddam 
Hussein. He declined to provide details. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't comment on that, but I have a message to pass on,''  
Abdullah was quoted as saying by Jordanian newspapers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials doubted Iraq would make a serious offer  
to the United States through Abdullah. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said this week that  
the Iraqis regularly seek talks with U.S. officials but that the 
United States is not interested as long as Iraq remains in 
violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Arab newspaper Al-Hayat, the message promises  
major political reforms in Iraq, offers to stop threatening Israel, 
proposes unconditional talks with the United States and offers 
assurances Iraq will play an effective role in Middle East peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	On his last visit here, in July, the king pledged economic and  
bureaucratic reform at home as well as a drive against corruption. 
Since then, he has moved against the radical Palestinian Islamist 
group Hamas by ordering the arrest of local leaders.

<HEADLINE> Garner Interviews for Cubs Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Phil Garner, fired this season in Milwaukee,  
interviewed Friday for the Chicago Cubs' vacant managerial job. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner, ousted in August in the midst of Milwaukee's seventh  
straight losing season, met with Cubs President Andy MacPhail and 
general manager Ed Lynch for about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an open and honest exchange,'' Garner told ESPN Radio  
from O'Hare International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cubs' mystique is something that we all in baseball are  
amazed by. The fans are tremendous. One of the things you try to do 
is help the organization be a winner and that's a challenge. A 
challenge that looks like fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Riggleman was fired by the Cubs on Monday after five years.  
Chicago was 67-95 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner had a 563-617 record with the Brewers. He was hired in  
October 1991 with no previous managing experience, and was 
runner-up for the AL Manager of the Year award in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner was at least the second person to interview, joining Cubs  
bench coach and Hall of Famer Billy Williams, who met with MacPhail 
and Lynch on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Published reports say the Cubs have received permission from the  
Atlanta Braves to talk to hitting coach and former Colorado manager 
Don Baylor and will also interview Minnesota Twins third base coach 
Ron Gardenhire. Gardenhire was once a New York Mets teammate of 
Lynch and worked under MacPhail when he was GM in Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Trainer: Horses Make Me Look Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- James Bond is a trainer, not a jockey, who  
sounds like he's just along for the ride with Behrens. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a horse that makes you look good,'' Bond said of  
5-year-old Behrens, who can take another step toward Horse of the 
Year honors by winning the 1 1/4-mile Jockey Club Gold Cup on Sunday 
at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been a good horse and now he's matured into a  
great horse,'' Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrens won consecutive stakes before losing by a nose to the  
now-retired Victory Gallop in the Whitney Handicap in his last 
start Aug. 1 at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrens will face eight rivals in the $1 million Gold Cup, but  
the one getting the most attention is 3-year-old Lemon Drop Kid, 
winner of the Belmont Stakes and the Travers, who will be making 
his debut against older horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Another attraction on the card will be sensational 3-year-old  
filly Silverbulletday, a winner in eight of nine starts this year. 
Silverbulletday will be racing for the first time against older 
fillies and mares in the 1 1/8-mile Beldame. 
</P>
<P>
	She will face four rivals, two of them being 4-year-olds  
Beautiful Pleasure, winner of the Personal Ensign at Saratoga, and 
Catinca, winner of the Ruffian at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others Lemon Drop Kid will have to overcome are River Keen,  
winner of the Woodward at Belmont, and Almutawakel, winner of the 
Dubai World Cup and second in the Woodward. Two other 3-year-olds 
in the Gold Cup are Vision and Verse, second in both the Belmont 
Stakes and Travers, and Stephen Got Even, third in the Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-year-olds will carry 123 pounds, the others 126.  
</P>
<P>
	In the $500,000 Beldame, the 3-year-olds will carry 119 pounds,  
the rest 123. 
</P>
<P>
	In a third Grade I stakes, Finder's Fee, the Matron winner, will  
oppose four other 2-year-old fillies in the $400,000 Frizette over 
1 1-16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's features at Belmont were the 1 1-16-mile Champagne for  
2-year-olds and the 1 1/2-mile Turf Classic.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Admits Farm Stance Evolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLISLE, Iowa (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley conceded Friday  
that his views on farm issues have shifted over the years, and said 
he regrets voting for the bill that ended most longtime farm 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't have passed it until they put a safety net in  
place,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley used a pristine farm setting to spell out a plan that  
would give $5 billion in cash payments to farmers during sour 
economic times, and take as much as 42 million fragile acres out of 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to Vice President Al Gore, his rival for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, noted inconsistencies in Bradley's 
positions on farm issues. Questioned by reporters, Bradley conceded 
his shift and that he backed the Freedom to Farm Act ending most 
traditional subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we passed it, they said they'd put a safety net (in  
place),'' said Bradley. ``They didn't put a safety net on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I ended up supporting it, but it's something that I regret.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley argued that his proposals do more than return to  
subsidies for farmers, by targeting aid to small, family producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are fresh proposals, they are not going back to what  
was,'' he said. ``They are rethinking the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took some shots from Republicans, underscoring the increased  
attention his campaign is getting. 
</P>
<P>
	``From his support for crippling tax increases on rural  
Americans to his self-serving flip-flop on ethanol, Bill Bradley 
has shown he is no friend to family farmers,'' said Republican 
National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	As a senator from New Jersey, Bradley voted against the ethanol  
tax subsidy important to Iowans, but says he supports it now as a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, when I began this journey I didn't know  
a lot about agriculture,'' said Bradley, speaking to 40 people by 
an empty hog lot. ``I had no idea of what the farm economy was all 
about. My teachers have been the family farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley argued that taking certain acres out of production helps  
farmers economically by lowering the supply of grain and pushing up 
prices, but also helps the environment by reducing erosion.

<HEADLINE> Brooklyn Museum Lashes at Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The battle over a museum exhibit that the mayor  
calls vulgar art moved into a courtroom on Friday, with the museum 
calling the mayor's decision to pull its multimillion-dollar 
subsidy ``a First Amendment catastrophe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be up to U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon to decide  
whether the city can continue to withhold its subsidy to the 
Brooklyn Museum of Art that totals about $7.2 million annually. The 
museum sued for an injunction to keep the city funds flowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has lashed out at the exhibit, ``Sensation,'' which  
includes a portrait of the Virgin Mary decorated with elephant 
dung, mannequins with genitals as facial features and a glass tank 
featuring a fake cow's head and 20,000 live maggots -- 
</P>
<P>
	Museum attorney Floyd Abrams accused the city of trying to  
punish free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``The behavior of the city is a First Amendment catastrophe,''  
Abrams said. The city and Giuliani are attacking the museum ``for 
doing nothing more than exercising its constitutional rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution has nothing to do with it, city attorneys said.  
</P>
<P>
	They argued the museum broke its contract with the city, thereby  
creating grounds for eviction. Its lease requires the museum to 
educate school children and the general public. 
</P>
<P>
	``This exhibit, that has dung all over the Virgin Mary, is going  
over the line,'' city attorney Michael Hess said. ``That's not 
educating children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge delayed her decision of the museum's request for an  
injunction, saying she wanted to review more written arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 13,000 people paid to see the modern British works in  
the exhibit during its opening weekend in New York.

<HEADLINE> Comparison of Congress' HMO Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Differences between managed care bills approved by the House  
Thursday and the Senate in July: 
</P>
<P>
                           *WHO IS COVERED   	
</P>
<P>
	House: Covers all Americans with private health insurance.  
</P>
<P>
	Senate: Many provisions only apply to 48 million Americans who  
are in plans that are regulated only by federal law. This includes 
greater access to emergency rooms, specialists, medications and the 
right to choose a health plan that allows them to use doctors who 
are outside a defined network. 
</P>
<P>
                            *RIGHT TO SUE   	
</P>
<P>
	House: Lifts federal ban on lawsuits for Americans in health  
plans that fall under federal regulation. Injured patients could 
sue in state or federal courts for unlimited damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate: No new rights to sue.  
</P>
<P>
                  *OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS   	
</P>
<P>
	House: Allows women to see them without prior approval but not  
to designate them as primary care doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate: Similar, but only applies to federally regulated plans.  
</P>
<P>
                        *EMERGENCY ROOM CARE   	
</P>
<P>
	House: Requires payment for reasonable emergency room services  
without prior approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate: Similar, but only applies to federally regulated plans.  
</P>
<P>
                          *CLINICAL TRIALS   	
</P>
<P>
	House: Would have required health plans to pay routine health  
care costs associated with clinical trials. Excludes payments for 
trials funded by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate: Includes only cancer patients.  
</P>
<P>
                            *MASTECTOMY   	
</P>
<P>
	House: No provision.  
</P>
<P>
	Senate: Requires health plans pay for overnight hospital stays  
if doctor and patient want it. 
</P>
<P>
                         *CONTINUITY OF CARE   	
</P>
<P>
	House: Allows patients undergoing a course of treatment to stay  
with their doctors during a transition period, even if the doctor 
leaves the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate: Similar, but only applies to patients who are pregnant,  
terminally ill or institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
                            *TAX CHANGES   	
</P>
<P>
	Both allow people who are self-employed to deduct the cost of  
health insurance and create a new deduction for long-term care. 
Allow more medical savings accounts, which let people set aside 
money, tax-free, to pay for routine care if they buy a 
high-deductible insurance policy in case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
                             *APPEALS   	
</P>
<P>
	Both require health plans to allow patients to appeal denials to  
experts outside the plan. 
</P>
<P>
                      *INFORMATION DISCLOSURE   	
</P>
<P>
	Both require health insurance companies to disclose details  
about what they cover and how they operate.

<HEADLINE> Education Association Endorses Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's largest teachers' union endorsed  
Al Gore for president Friday, saying he ``understands what children 
need to start school ready to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement by the National Education Association was the  
second of its kind in three days for the vice president, who is 
running against former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley for the 
Democratic presidential nomination. On Tuesday, the American 
Federation of Teachers, the second-largest teachers union, 
announced its support for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president is still courting the endorsement of the  
AFL-CIO, the federation backed by 13 million labor members. Gore 
was once thought to be assured of the endorsement, but Bradley has 
been aggressive in seeking its backing and some of the federation's 
member organizations have questioned Gore's ability to win in a 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Outwardly optimistic but privately nervous that the odds of an  
AFL-CIO endorsement were no better than 50-50, Gore campaign 
chairman Tony Coelho asked House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt 
to use his labor ties on Gore's behalf, labor and political 
operatives said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt made several calls in the last week to union presidents  
asking them to support an early AFL-CIO endorsement, said the 
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO is holding its biennial convention next week in Los  
Angeles. On Thursday, President Clinton met with Teamsters 
President Jim Hoffa in New York, although he denied he was trying 
to spur support for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters are the largest union in the AFL-CIO, and Hoffa  
has been critical of an early endorsement and the administration's 
support for the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also won the endorsement Friday of the National Treasury  
Employees Union, representing some 155,000 federal workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore ``has been a leader on issues important to federal workers  
and their families,'' said the union president, Colleen M. Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
	In its endorsement, the 2.5-million-member NEA said it was  
backing Gore because of his support for full funding of Head Start, 
a preschool program for poor children, as well as for expanded 
preschool and after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The association also praised Gore for ``leading the charge'' for  
smaller class sizes and school reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore has earned our support,'' said NEA President Bob  
Chase. ``Time and again he has stood up for children and public 
education. Now it is time -- proudly and enthusiastically -- for us 
to stand with Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradley campaign said it was not surprised by the  
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was long expected,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric  
Hauser. ``We've gotten a lot of support from teachers. We're going 
to continue to talk about issues that are important to them and the 
rest of the country.''

<HEADLINE> GM Exec on Payroll After Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A General Motors marketing executive was kept on  
the payroll nearly two years after he pleaded guilty to defrauding 
a Little Caesars subsidiary, though he says he didn't tell GM about 
the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Rotondo, 38, left GM on Oct. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Court records show that Oakland County prosecutors charged  
Rotondo and his associate, former brother-in-law Adalgiso ``Nick'' 
Mancini, in February 1997 with four counts each of false pretenses. 
</P>
<P>
	They were accused of generating false purchase orders totaling  
$168,000 from Blue Line Distributing, a Farmington Hills company 
that delivers pizza dough and other supplies to Little Caesars 
franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotondo, GM's director of marketing operations, pleaded guilty  
in November 1997. He was sentenced to three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Terry Sullivan declined to say whether Rotondo  
resigned or was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't get into that,'' Sullivan told The Oakland Press for  
a Friday story. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which has an ethics policy, was unaware of the  
case, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure this matter is being taken very seriously. This is a  
very serious issue and we understand that,'' a senior GM official 
told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotondo said he decided that it was time to leave GM.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unfortunate situation that happened. I had tried to  
do the right thing by cooperating with the authorities and I made 
full restitution,'' said Rotondo, who acknowledged keeping GM in 
the dark about his legal difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	According to prosecutors, Mancini, who was a buyer for Blue  
Line, generated 11 phony purchase orders to buy kiosks from 
Pinnacle Production, a Bloomfield Hills company created by 
Rotondo's cousin but later turned over to Rotondo. 
</P>
<P>
	The kiosks were to be shipped to a third company. An audit of  
the Blue Line account showed that $168,000 had gone out for kiosks 
that never appeared.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Curbs Cellular Phone Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Drivers filling up at BP Amoco stations will be  
seeing a new symbol at the pumps: a cellular phone with a slash 
through it. 
</P>
<P>
	The message: No cell phone use.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a ban -- this is a precautionary warning,'' company  
spokeswoman Linda McCray said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a risk that electronic impulses could start a fire, and  
while that risk may be slight, the company doesn't want to take 
chances, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellular phone manufacturers have included warnings in owner's  
manuals for years indicating that under certain conditions, 
cellular phones could help generate sparks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Kelley, a spokesman for the National Petroleum Institute,  
there have been unverified reports of fires sparked by cellular 
phone use but no evidence that any occurred in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, ``prudence is probably the best policy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications  
Industry Association, went further. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence whatsoever that a wireless phone has ever  
caused ignition or explosion at a gas station anywhere in the 
world,'' he said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	London-based BP Amoco already has cellular phone warnings on its  
gasoline pumps in the United Kingdom and Australia. It plans to add 
them at its U.S. stations by the end of the year, and other oil 
companies, including Chevron and Exxon, have plans for similar 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In Finland, cellular phone use near gasoline pumps is banned.  
And the Chicago suburb of Cicero, Ill., recently passed a similar 
law believed to be the first of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Like no-smoking signs, BP Amoco's warnings will only apply to  
customers standing near the pumps. Those who disobey won't be asked 
to leave, McCray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Driver Jonathan McKnight, 41, of Bainbridge, Ohio, rolled his  
eyes when he was told about the warnings while he waited at BP 
station Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really know if there's much harm that can be caused,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton:N.Ireland Sides Like Drunks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- President Clinton was forced to apologize Friday  
after he remarked that the Northern Ireland peace process had 
stumbled because the two sides are ``like a couple of drunks'' who 
can't leave the bar. 
</P>
<P>
	The remark riled tempers in Belfast and hours afterward the  
White House issued a statement in Clinton's name acknowledging that 
the comment had been inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earlier today, in a discussion of the Irish peace process, I  
used a metaphor that was inappropriate,'' said Clinton in the 
statement. ``I want to express my regret for any offense my remark 
caused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It all began during a speech inaugurating the new U.S. Embassy  
building here in which Clinton spoke of a need to heal religious 
and ethnic differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent an enormous amount of time trying to help the people  
in the land of my forebears in Northern Ireland get over 600 years 
of religious fights,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And every time they make an agreement to do it,'' he  
continued, ``they're like a couple of drunks walking out of the bar 
for the last time. When they get to the swinging door, they turn 
around and go back in and say, 'I just can't quite get there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks drew a mixture of murmurs and laughter from the  
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	It also drew a sharp retort from across the Atlantic from the  
Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of Northern Ireland's most hard-line 
Protestant party, the Democratic Unionists. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a highly offensive and insulting remark to the people  
of Northern Ireland,'' said Paisley, whose party opposes the Good 
Friday peace accord, but is entitled to posts within the 
Protestant-Catholic administration that local politicians have been 
struggling for more than a year to form. 
</P>
<P>
	The major Catholic-supported party in Northern Ireland, the  
pacifist Social Democratic and Labor Party, said in a statement 
that Clinton's remarks were ``obviously off the cuff'' but 
``reflected the reality that the president, like so many of us, is 
justifiably frustrated with the slow pace of progress in 
implementing the Good Friday agreement in full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said in  
Washington that Clinton was expressing his frustration at all sides 
in the Northern Ireland dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the president didn't mean to cause offense to any  
group of people, but he is clearly frustrated that both sides can't 
seize this moment of peace and make progress in implementing the 
Good Friday accords,'' Leavy said. He said the peace process has 
been ``mired in issues for far too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in another flub, confused France with Quebec.  
</P>
<P>
	``More than a decade ago, I came to France with Hillary, our  
young daughter, and my mother-in-law, we celebrated the new year, 
we had a few wonderful days in Montreal, we drove to Chateau 
Montebello,'' he said. The official White House transcript 
corrected Clinton's slip, changing France to Canada.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Says Grain Glut Worsening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The stockpiles of grain that have kept  
commodity prices depressed for two years are growing, the 
government said Friday. That could mean another tough year for 
growers in 2000 and keep the cost of federal farm programs soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's bumper crops will push the corn surplus to nearly 2  
billion bushels -- more than 20 percent of the nation's total 
production -- and boost wheat stocks to 987 million bushels, the 
Agriculture Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's expected to knock 10 cents off the price farmers get per  
bushel of corn, dropping it to $1.85, and a nickel off the price of 
wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we've still got big production in the United States,  
big production around the world, and you're going to have to see 
some change in weather or in the farm program to reduce supply,'' 
said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities Inc. of West Des 
Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, the Senate is expected to send President Clinton an  
$8.7 billion package of emergency farm-income assistance and 
disaster relief, the second multibillion-dollar bailout package in 
as many years. 
</P>
<P>
	The way things stand, additional such assistance will likely be  
necessary in 2000, said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., 
who would like to change the farm program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concept of so-called emergency funding is going to start  
wearing thin with nonagricultural senators and congressman,'' he 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the latest aid package, direct government payments to  
farmers are expected to reach $21 billion this year, eclipsing the 
old record of $17 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Commodity prices collapsed in 1998 because of the financial  
crisis in Asia and Russia and strong crop production worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department expects farm exports -- down $10  
billion this year from their record of just under $60 billion in 
1996 -- to improve only slightly next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Government price supports are just high enough to encourage  
farmers to continue planting crops already in surplus, but the 
subsidies aren't enough to keep many producers in business without 
other sources of income, said Howard Doster, an agricultural 
economist at Purdue University. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we grow another big crop (next year) and the Asian economy  
stays the way it is, the conditions could stay the way they are. 
But I still have hope for next year,'' said Nathan Johnson, who 
grows corn and soybeans near Lowry, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Drought and flooding have taken their toll on some crops,  
especially soybeans and cotton in the East and South, but USDA 
increased its forecast of this year's corn crop by 1 percent from 
last month because of higher-than-expected yields in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The department lowered its forecast of the cotton crop by 6  
percent and reduced its estimate for soybeans by 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA said it expects soybean prices to be 20 cents a bushel  
higher than previously thought this year, reaching an average of $5 
a bushel, because of the decline in production. The government is 
not allowed to estimate cotton prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought started in the East and spread across portions of  
the Midwest and down across much of the South. It turned out to be 
a boon for some growers in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is expected to harvest 1.2 million pounds of apples  
this year, up 160,000 pounds from last year, because the drought 
reduced insect and disease problems and September rains came in 
time to increase the size of the fruit. Production also is up in 
Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern grape crops also are better this year because of the dry  
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, USDA says this year's orange crop will hit 12.1  
million tons, up 22 percent from last year when a freeze badly 
damaged California's production. Orange prices are unlikely to 
change much, however, because of low inventory and high demand for 
juice, said Andy LaVigne, chief executive officer of Florida Citrus 
Mutual.

	TEZIUTLAN, Mexico (AP) -- Soldiers and survivors, searching  
desperately for people buried alive when hillsides collapsed in 
southeastern Mexico after more than a week of relentless rain, 
pulled the bodies of at least 15 children from an elementary school 
that was buried during class. Calling it ``the tragedy of the 
decade,'' Zedillo promised government help for families who have

	Clinton Wants Test-Ban Vote Delayed

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed to the Senate today  
to delay acting on the nuclear test ban treaty, agreeing to put off 
the vote -- possibly until after the 2000 presidential election -- 
instead of facing defeat next week. Clinton said a vote rejecting 
the treaty would severely damage efforts to curb the spread of 
nuclear weapons. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said a vote 
on the treaty is still on track for next Tuesday or Wednesday but 
that he would listen to anything the president has to say.

<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A new comprehensive study of  
violence in Northern Ireland raises the death toll from the 
political struggle over the past three decades. The study, put 
together by four Belfast journalists, broadens the official 
definition of who is a victim, adding people who had fatal heart 
attacks after bombings or hearing about the slaying of a loved one, 
and also those who committed suicide in grief. In all, 3,377 people 
are identified as fatalities within Northern Ireland, 124 in 
England, 118 in the Irish Republic, and 18 in continental Europe.

	Lee Seeks End to Racial Profiling

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The acting head of the Justice Department's  
civil rights division called on the American Bar Association to 
help eradicate racial profiling by police departments and to 
support affirmative action in law school admissions. Bill Lann Lee 
decried the breakdown of trust between police and minority 
communities and traced much of it to the practice of racial 
profiling, the practice of stopping motorists solely on the basis 
of their race.

<HEADLINE> Colorado's Top Officials Feud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Lt. Gov. Joe Rogers and his boss, Gov.  
Bill Owens, work just 60 paces apart under the gold-domed Capitol. 
But they haven't spoken face-to-face in months. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute between Owens, a buttoned-down Texan, and Rogers, a  
lawyer who was Colorado's first black candidate for Congress, has 
had racial overtones. It includes accusations of improper spending, 
sniping over personnel policies and even a family feud. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, their bickering was awkward enough, but it mostly  
was kept inside the Statehouse. This week, it became painfully 
public, played out in newspapers and in court. The spat is even 
more embarrassing considering that both are Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sitting back and kind of chuckling now and kind of  
enjoying the fight,'' said Mike Feeley, the state Senate's 
Democratic leader. ``There's not much mileage to be gained for the 
Democrats, other than letting them look ridiculous, which they're 
doing quite well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, on Friday, staff members arranged an Owens-Rogers  
meeting for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try to find a way to work through this thing  
together,'' Rogers told The Associated Press on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens' staff director, Roy Palmer, said he hoped relations could  
be smoothed. ``We have had trouble having a conversation with the 
(Rogers) office. They have been angry for many months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Owens and Rogers reclaimed the Colorado governor's  
office after 24 years of Democratic control. Their election 
thrilled Republicans, who dominate the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	But there already had been problems. Rogers was humiliated  
during the campaign after Owens decided to send Rogers in his place 
to a debate with the Democrat gubernatorial candidate. The debate 
never went off. 
</P>
<P>
	This June, Rogers criticized Owens for scheduling a youth  
violence summit -- arranged after the Columbine High School 
shootings -- during the Juneteenth celebration, which commemorates 
the time Texas slaves learned of the Emancipation Proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was miffed he wasn't consulted about the timing and  
wanted Owens to apologize to the black community; Owens refused. 
Owens rode in the Juneteenth parade, but many black leaders were 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
	Then this week, even as Owens was insisting that he and Rogers  
have a ``professional and proper relationship,'' he announced that 
he has asked the state controller to investigate Rogers' use of 
state funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens' people point to $350 spent on gifts for Taiwanese  
officials who had paid for Rogers' trip to Taiwan; $291 in 
undocumented meal expenses during the trip when meals were free; 
$241 in telephone calls from Washington, D.C., on a hotel phone 
when Rogers had his state phone; and $600 for cheap cufflinks for 
gifts for office visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers denied wrongdoing, and his people say Owens is too  
authoritarian about budgeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens also questioned Rogers' recommendation that a staffer  
caught driving 103 mph -- with the lieutenant governor in the car -- 
not be ticketed. The governor's office suspended the staffer for a 
week without pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to it all, a member of Rogers' staff is suing Owens for  
denying her a paycheck because she refused to submit to a criminal 
background check Owens demands of all staff members. Latisha 
Kinslow claimed Owens' rules don't apply to Rogers' staffers. Ms. 
Kinslow has since been paid, and both sides think the lawsuit will 
be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, Owens' staff director, recently disclosed that Rogers  
asked the governor to put Rogers' brother on the state parole 
board. Owens balked, saying Tracy Rogers was unqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Tracy Rogers has turned on his brother, and in an  
e-mail sent to Owens and circulated by Owens' staff this week, 
Tracy said the lieutenant governor was disloyal and insensitive, 
even mentally disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers, who originally split over a campaign debt, have  
not spoken since May. The lieutenant governor is reluctant to 
discuss it, but said he thinks his rift with Owens can be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Republicans hope so. Owens and Rogers have three years  
left in their term. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not good for the party,'' said House Majority Leader Doug  
Dean. ``It's not good for the state.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Gives Bombing Figure 12 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A federal judge went well above sentencing  
guidelines today as he again gave Michael Fortier 12 years in 
prison for failing to notify authorities about plans for the 
Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Van Bebber said the bombing was  
``widespread and far more serious'' than was contemplated by the 
commission that set the federal sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier has already served a little more than four years in  
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fortier's first sentencing last year, Van Bebber started with  
first-degree murder guidelines and came up with a sentence of 17 1/2 
years, then took into account Fortier's cooperation with federal 
prosecutors. He wound up imposing a sentence of 12 years and a 
$200,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Van Bebber to  
start over with involuntary manslaughter guidelines, which put the 
baseline sentence at 51 months, or about what Fortier has already 
served. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Van Bebber noted the 168 deaths and the $80 million in  
damage that the April 1995 bombing caused. The judge noted that he 
could have come up with a sentence even greater than 12 years but 
said that would have appeared vindictive. 
</P>
<P>
	He did impose a lower fine, however: $75,000.  
</P>
<P>
	He issued his ruling after hearing arguments from defense  
attorneys, prosecutors and a law professor representing victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Michael McGuire, who unsuccessfully urged a  
sentence of time served, immediately filed an appeal. ``Might as 
well just get the ball rolling on the appeal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire said outside the courthouse that Fortier had been ``cast  
aside conveniently'' by the government and given no credit for his 
help with the cases against bomber Timothy McVeigh and 
co-conspirator Terry Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Sean Connelly said the sentence reflects  
the serious of the bombing. ``This case is extraordinary,'' he 
said. Although the government recommended a lighter sentence than 
the judge imposed, Connelly said the government would defend the 
judge's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twelve years sounds pretty good this time around,'' said  
Jannie Coverdale, who had not been happy last year when Van Bebber 
first sentenced Fortier. Ms. Coverdale lost two grandsons in the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I have to say is one day my son will be released and we'll  
be right there for him like we always have,'' said Fortier's 
mother, Irene. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, 30, has been in prison since pleading guilty in August  
1995 to failing to notify authorities of the plot to bomb the 
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	His sentencing was delayed nearly three years until after the  
federal trials of McVeigh and Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting Fortier's cooperation at the trials, he said, McGuire  
said, ``This man was the difference in both of those cases, your 
honor. This man has given a lot. I don't know if he'll be credited 
for it. He should be given credit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also took exception to a presentencing report by probation  
officer Daniel Muller that asked for a harsh sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like he's represented the facts accurately,''  
McGuire told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The government wanted a sentence in the range of 70 to 87  
months. The prosecutor said the government wasn't asking for more 
because of Fortier's cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Cassell, a law professor representing victims, said  
that ``only a substantial upward departure'' from the guideline 
could accommodate the magnitude of the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just punishment demands that the death of 168 people be  
reflected somewhere in the sentence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, survivors and relatives of victims of the bombing  
arrived under a steady rain to hear Van Bebber's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the original 12-year sentence, Tom Kight said, ``I  
think 144 months is pretty cheap for 168 lives.'' His stepdaughter 
died in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury in Denver convicted McVeigh on murder, weapons  
and conspiracy counts and recommended he die for his crimes. Judge 
Richard Matsch formally sentenced him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Another federal jury convicted Nichols of involuntary  
manslaughter and conspiracy. He is serving a life sentence for 
conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter. Matsch sentenced Nichols 
to life in prison. He faces a state trial on 160 counts of murder.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Flood Survivors Blame Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POZA RICA, Mexico (AP) -- Victims of massive flooding along  
Mexico's Gulf Coast blamed the government Friday for allowing 
houses to be built -- and sometimes even building them -- on 
riverbanks, swamps and marshes. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said the government had failed to build needed drainage  
projects, and accused rescue workers of arriving too late to save 
any lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Nature played a big role in this week's tragic flooding, which  
has killed at least 230 people in southeastern Mexico. A tropical 
depression in the Gulf dumped almost as much rain in four days as 
many states see in a year, and a waxing moon created high tides. 
</P>
<P>
	But victims said official incompetence was also a major factor.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a crime. Why did the government build on muddy land  
near the river?'' asked Irma Moreno Rodriguez, 48-year-old social 
worker who lived in Poza Rica, 125 miles northeast of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno bought a small house in a government low-income project  
two years ago. Her home, on the bank of the Cazones River, is now 
filled with several feet of mud. She and her three children are 
living at an improvised shelter at an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	President Ernesto Zedillo, who flew to the stricken area Friday,  
appealed for ``the understanding of the people, because we can't 
get there quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to make every effort,'' he said, ``and we're going  
to help families get their houses back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many victims said the houses should never have been there in  
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``The land was a swamp when (state-owned oil company) Pemex  
built our houses here,'' said Gloria Moreno Trueba, another Poza 
Rica resident. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, the local government filled in parts of the  
streambed and asked residents to contribute money for a 
flood-containment wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're glad we didn't give any money,'' Moreno Trueba said.  
``It wouldn't have stopped the river, and the water would have 
probably come in all at once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An environmental organization, the Group of 100, accused  
authorities of failing to build the drainage projects needed to 
avoid such flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	``The streets of towns and cities are in a truly disgraceful  
state,'' the group said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Downstream, where the Cazones River nears the Gulf, the problems  
were worse -- and the criticism was directed at rescue workers as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tecolutla, a resort town on a lip of land between the Cazones  
River and the Gulf, survivors said hotels tipped on their 
foundations, houses were washed away and bodies floated by on the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaking with sobs, Lauren Valverde Lechuga said rescue workers  
had not yet arrived -- two days after the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are fields for the helicopters to land on, and they  
haven't come,'' she said. ``There are children going hungry, and 
there's nobody to help us.''

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Reopens Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man who says he was sent to prison on phony  
cocaine charges will have his case reviewed, winning another day in 
court as the result of a widening scandal in which policemen 
allegedly framed and even shot innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Brian Q. Robbins ordered a new  
hearing of the evidence in the case of Esaw Booker. 
</P>
<P>
	Booker has maintained since his arrest in 1992 that he was  
innocent of selling $20 worth of cocaine, saying the drug was 
planted on him and that officers lied in court. 
</P>
<P>
	An officer who testified against him was Rafael Perez, a former  
Los Angeles Police Department narcotics agent. Perez, who was 
convicted of stealing $1 million worth of cocaine, is cooperating 
with officers investigating a police corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one would listen to me,'' said Booker, 54, who uses a  
walker since suffering a recent stroke. ``I'm happy to get an 
opportunity to get this all behind me. Five years I spent in prison 
for something I didn't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Javier Francisco Ovando was released from prison  
after Perez told investigators he helped frame Ovando on an assault 
charge after a fellow officer shot him in the head, paralyzing him 
from the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven officers have been relieved of duty with pay and one has  
been fired since the investigation began. 
</P>
<P>
	Booker's case is among the first of what prosecutors and defense  
attorneys say could be hundreds that will be reviewed as a result 
of the scandal.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Fire Mananger and GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The only constant about the Baltimore Orioles  
under owner Peter Angelos is an unwavering lack of continuity. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos fired manager Ray Miller and general manager Frank Wren  
on Thursday, forcing the once-proud franchise to essentially start 
from scratch in its bid to reach the World Series for the first 
time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Orioles begin spring training next season, they will  
have their fifth manager in seven years and their third GM in three 
years. Miller was fired after two straight losing seasons. Wren was 
dumped with two years left on a three-year contract he signed last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning with the dismissal of manager Johnny Oates in 1994,  
Angelos has fired either his manager or general manager after every 
season except 1996, when Baltimore advanced to the playoffs for the 
first time in 13 years. This is the second time he's canned both 
his manager and GM -- in 1995, he said farewell to manager Phil 
Regan and GM Roland Hemond. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe they ought to install a revolving door on the warehouse  
behind the baseball diamond at Camden Yards, where the players come 
and go almost as often as the front office personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Brown, Rafael Palmeiro, Roberto Alomar, Bobby Bonilla,  
Eric Davis and a host of other stars have worn the Orioles' orange 
and black before going elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller took over the team in November 1997 after Angelos forced  
the resignation of Davey Johnson, who twice took the Orioles to the 
AL championship series, but lost both times. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Miller, the team's former pitching coach, the Orioles went  
79-83 in 1998, then slumped to 78-84 this year despite a $78.5 
million opening-day payroll, third-highest in baseball behind the 
New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren was cited for several incidents in which he rubbed  
management the wrong way. The most notable offense came last month, 
when Wren ordered the team flight to Anaheim to leave on time after 
Cal Ripken called to say he would arrive late. Ripken had to 
scramble to make his own arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Orioles management cannot and will not abide having a  
general manager operate in such an unreasonable, authoritarian 
manner and treat anyone in this way, especially someone such as Cal 
who has done so much for the Orioles and for baseball,'' vice 
chairman and chief operating officer Joe Foss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren declined comment, saying he was in the process of  
negotiating a settlement. He replaced Pat Gillick last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren made several fine trades, getting starter Jason Johnson for  
Danny Clyburn and obtaining a handful of good pitching prospects 
for Juan Guzman and Harold Baines. But he also put together a 
bullpen consisting of Seattle Mariners rejects Heathcliff Slocumb, 
Mike Fetters and Mike Timlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullpen had 20 blown saves by the All-Star break, leaving  
Baltimore with a 36-51 record and nothing to play for but third 
place in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 54, did not return phone calls Thursday. But during the  
final weekend of the regular season he cited poor pitching for the 
team's lack of success and compared himself to several fine 
managers who also struggled this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you bring a reliever in and he blows a save, you look  
bad. If he does well, you're a brilliant tactician,'' he said. 
``Did Jimmy Leyland all of a sudden get stupid in Colorado this 
year? Did Davey Johnson get dumb when he hit the west coast? Is 
last year's manager of the year, Jim Riggleman, stupid or did his 
club get old on him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Miller, Angelos lauded his contributions to the  
1997 team as a pitching coach. But 1998 and 1999 were another 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad for Ray,'' Orioles shortstop Mike Bordick said.  
``He obviously wasn't the one throwing the ball or hitting the 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Milwaukee Brewers manager Phil Garner is considered the  
leading candidate to replace Miller. Garner was in the midst of his 
seventh straight losing season when he was fired by the Brewers in 
August, but he didn't have much talent to work with for the 
low-budget Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Trebelhorn, the Orioles' director of player development and  
former manager of the Brewers and Chicago Cubs, also is a 
possibility. So is former Orioles star Don Baylor, who managed the 
Rockies from 1993-98, and Riggleman, fired by the Chicago Cubs on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time that Miller failed to field a winner as  
a major league manager. He went 50-50 with the Minnesota Twins in 
the second half of the 1985 season and was fired in September 1986, 
with the team struggling at 59-70. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles had a club-record .279 batting average and set a  
franchise record with 1,572 hits, but Baltimore lost 24 games when 
it scored six runs or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a good year, and things happen after you don't  
produce the way you're expected to,'' infielder Jeff Reboulet said. 
``It's tough to blame one person for everything going on, but the 
finger usually ends up pointing at the manager. It's part of the 
game.''

	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Ron Harper could join the Los  
Angeles Lakers before the regular season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hoping to get something done before the end of training  
camp,'' general manager Mitch Kupchak said Friday. ``We have spoken 
to (his) representatives on a consistent basis and continue to have 
a dialogue. Right now, he has some personal obligations he has to 
tend to. Additional week or two of rest will probably help as well. 
He really isn't missing anything he doesn't know already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, a starting point guard on the Chicago Bulls'  
championship teams, is still contemplating retirement or joining 
his old coach, Phil Jackson, on the Lakers' roster. 
</P>
<P>
	He would provide the Lakers' backcourt some much needed  
experience in the triangle offense, but is still recovering from 
surgery he had on his knee two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Lakers granted rookie Melvin Levett's request to  
be released. 
</P>
<P>
	Levett, an honorable mention All-America in 1998 with the  
University of Cincinnati, was acquired from the Detroit Pistons 
after the 1999 NBA draft in exchange for disgruntled guard Derek 
Harper. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he does not feel his team is ready for it, Jackson also  
held a 5-on-5 scrimmage in their night practice to see exactly 
where his players stand with the new offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have only six practices in and we have to be patient,''  
said Jackson. ``They are not ready. It takes getting physically 
getting ready and mentally getting ready. But, we had a combination 
of guys playing together and move some combinations out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to get better is to get out there on the court,''  
said veteran forward A.C. Green. ``We may not necessarily be ready, 
but it will be a good marker for where we are.''

<HEADLINE> Shaky Ride Yields $2.2M in Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A jury awarded $2.22 million Thursday to 13  
people traumatized by severe plane turbulence. The plaintiffs 
included the sister of filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who found the 
plane ride more frightening than her brother's movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``My brother has spent his life scaring me; but they were  
games,'' Nancy Spielberg said after the jury in U.S. District Court 
in Manhattan returned its verdict. ``I would really rather feel 
fear on Dolby sound with popcorn than by a real-life, near-death 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She called the verdict a slap on the wrist for American  
Airlines, which had admitted liability but contested the amount 
which should be awarded for the turbulence aboard the June 26, 
1995, Los Angeles-to-New York flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really need more like a punch in the face,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark Slitt, a spokesman for the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline,  
said he was disappointed by the size of the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not studied it in detail,'' he said, saying the  
airline would weigh its legal options when it did so. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury ended four hours of deliberations by awarding  
individual damages ranging from $150,000 to $215,000 for the 28 
seconds of turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
	Most damages were for emotional trauma after lawyers for the  
plaintiffs took the unique legal position that fear of death was so 
damaging that it deserved a large award usually given to those with 
physical injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real message is that it's not inconsequential when you  
scare people and they think they're going to die,'' said James P. 
Kreindler, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, who were among 101 people 
on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Kreindler said the airline could have avoided the turbulence by  
steering around a storm and should have illuminated a seat belt 
sign to warn passengers about the possibility of rough weather 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Miriam Lewinger, a 74-year-old New Rochelle woman who was  
awarded $150,000, said she was ``absolutely delighted'' by the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``This seems like a fair reward. Nothing could really reward us  
for the pain and suffering and emotional strain,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it's over. I'm hoping that all the airlines get the  
message,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified during the trial that she is still haunted by the  
screams, despite counseling she had received. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded $160,000 to Ms. Spielberg of Riverdale, N.Y.  
Her two daughters, ages 6 and 2 during the turbulence, were awarded 
a total of $375,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Spielberg testified during the one-week trial that the  
turbulence tossed her against the ceiling just after she had begun 
playing a card game with her 6-year-old daughter, Jessica. 
</P>
<P>
	She said people flew over seats and into aisles and the plane  
made a groaning noise before it nosedived as a chorus of screams 
and cries filled the fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I knew at this point -- it wasn't a matter of thinking -- I  
just knew that we were going to die,'' she said. ``Nobody was calm. 
Everybody thought we were dying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turbulence hit while Flight 58 was over Minnesota. It made  
an emergency landing in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Hospitals To Pay $7.9M Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The family of a cancer patient given a lethal  
dose of chemotherapy has agreed to a $7.9 million settlement with 
the University of Chicago Hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Gargano, a 41-year-old postal worker with testicular  
cancer, died in 1995, two weeks after he was given four times the 
recommended dose of a medication. He had been given a 95 percent 
chance of survival, but the medication caused kidney failure and 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Schaffner, the family's attorney, said a doctor's order  
was transcribed incorrectly and the pharmacy dispensed the wrong 
dose for four straight days. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one doctor, two pharmacists and four nurses failed to  
detect the error, despite hospital policy that calls for 
chemotherapy doses to be verified, court records show. The mistake 
was discovered by a nurse newly assigned to Gargano. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials, who announced the settlement Thursday,  
said new policies have been adopted to prevent such errors.

<HEADLINE> NHL Won't Suspend Devils' Brodeur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The NHL decided Friday not to  
suspend New Jersey Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur for a slashing 
penalty that resulted in his ejection from Thursday's game against 
the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL executive vice president Colin Campbell reviewed the  
incident Friday and made the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The matter is closed,'' NHL spokesman Frank Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
	Brodeur will be eligible to play Saturday night against the  
Tampa Bay Lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Brodeur was ejected in the first period of the Penguins' 7-5 win  
for whacking Pittsburgh forward Matthew Barnaby in the back of the 
knees with a two-hand swipe of his stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Paul Stewart gave the mild-mannered Brodeur, one of the  
NHL's top stickhandlers among goalies, a match penalty for intent 
to injure. The penalty does not carry an automatic suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Brodeur didn't deny he meant to hit Barnaby, but ``not to injure  
him, that's for sure, and I don't think I did,'' the seven-year 
veteran said after being ejected for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnaby said the hit was painful, and added that Brodeur might  
have been frustrated after giving up three goals to Aleksey 
Morozov.

<HEADLINE> Chase Manhattan Moving N.Y. Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City's largest corporate employer,  
Chase Manhattan Corporation, is moving 10 percent of its jobs -- 
about 3,500 positions -- to Florida, Texas and Massachusetts, the 
company has told its workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next year, the company will move two entire ``back  
office'' units, from entry-level positions to senior managers, 
Chase spokesman Ken Herz said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	By relocating its workers, the bank will cut its costs  
significantly, Herz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he would not estimate the savings, Herz said they are so  
great that the city wouldn't have been able to match them. As a 
result, Chase didn't approach the city for financial or logistical 
help to keep the jobs in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaries, real estate costs, taxes, telecommunications charges  
and utilities costs are all lower in Tampa, Fla., and Dallas, where 
most of the jobs are to be moved, he said. Some jobs would also be 
moved to Lowell, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the businesses leaving New York transfers money for  
companies, and the other involves tracking and processing stock and 
bond trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine said the city was sorry to see the  
jobs go, but added that the company had promised to keep its 
headquarters in the city and would expand its other operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The substantial exodus of jobs from the city is indicative of a  
trend begun in the late 1980s, when many Wall Street firms moved 
their record-keeping and data processing jobs to New Jersey and 
Florida. Since then, technological advances and mergers have 
prompted banks to cut the number of employees in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988 Chase received $235 million from the city when it agreed  
to move many back office employees to Brooklyn rather than New 
Jersey. Some of the 6,000 Chase jobs in Brooklyn are to be moved, 
though Herz said Chase planned to relocate other business units to 
fill those spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	While Chase said it would offer to relocate many of the  
employees whose jobs are being moved, some may be reluctant to 
leave New York because of family or other reasons. Also, the 
unusually good chances of finding work in the city could keep some 
from moving, corporate consultants said. The city's unemployment 
rate is 6.9 percent, down from about 10 percent in early 1997.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate was unchanged  
at 4.2 percent in September, the lowest rate in nearly three 
decades, even though the number of payroll jobs actually fell last 
month as Hurricane Floyd cut into hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that September's rate  
matched August's rate at 4.2 percent, a 29-year low. The nation's 
jobless rate has been below 4.4 percent since March. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers cut payroll jobs in September by 8,000, the first  
decline since January 1996 when a winter blizzard disrupted hiring 
plans. The Labor Department said that while the growth in payroll 
jobs would have been extremely weak in September compared with the 
robust gains reported for most of this year, the hurricane cut 
growth by 50,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expected companies to add 220,000 jobs. In August,  
businesses added 103,000 jobs to their payrolls, less than what the 
government previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the weak job growth, wage pressures accelerated in  
September. Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation 
pressures, grew by 0.5 percent to $13.37 in September, much sharper 
than the 0.2 percent increase in August. 
</P>
<P>
	While strong wage growth is a good development for workers,  
economists and members of the Federal Reserve worry that it could 
be a recipe for sparking inflation. Their fear: employers foraging 
for qualified workers woo them with higher wages and benefits, 
costs likely to drive up consumer prices if not constrained by 
other forces. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Fed policy-makers decided not to raise interest  
rates for now but, expressing concerns that the tight labor market 
could lead to inflation down the road, they left open the 
possibility of a third rate increase later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have been volatile in the last month over  
concerns about the prospects for higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, another 21,000 manufacturing jobs were lost, but  
government analysts noted that the average monthly decline in 
manufacturing slowed to 15,000 per month from June through 
September, less than half the 36,000 monthly average in the first 
six months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. manufacturers have seen foreign demand for their products  
rebound somewhat from a global financial crisis which began in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The service sector, normally the driving force of job creation  
in the United States, suffered a decline of 9,000 in September, 
reflecting a drop of 49,000 jobs at retail businesses. Government 
analysts said that job loss was particularly heavy where businesses 
were forced to close because of Hurricane Floyd, which raked the 
East Coast in September. 
</P>
<P>
	But even without the hurricane, there was widespread weakness as  
department stores cut 17,000 jobs,the fifth consecutive monthly 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a drop of 23,000 government jobs in  
September,while business services added only 39,000 jobs, well 
below their average monthly gain of 126,000.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate remained at a  
29-year low of 4.2 percent in September, even though total jobs 
fell for the first time in more than three years as Hurricane Floyd 
played havoc with business hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the impact of the storm that raked the East Coast,  
businesses cut payroll jobs in September by 8,000, the Labor 
Department said Friday. That was the first decline since January 
1996 when a winter blizzard disrupted hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without the storm's effects, the growth in September's  
payroll jobs would have been small compared with brisk gains for 
much of the year. The department estimated employers would have 
added 50,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said, ``Our nation's economy,  
obviously from this report, remains solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many analysts had expected companies to add 220,000 jobs  
last month. In August, employers added 103,000, somewhat less than 
the government previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hurricane Floyd huffed and puffed and blew a lot of jobs away  
in September,'' said KeyCorp economist Ken Mayland. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists viewed the weaker-than-expected job growth as a  
possible sign that the economy may be slowing and, thus, could 
reduce pressure on the Federal Reserve and Chairman Alan Greenspan 
to raise interest rates at the next policy meeting in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The report sent mixed signals to Wall Street. There was relief  
over the decline in job growth but concern that rising wages could 
mean inflation was picking up momentum. The Dow Jones industrial 
average closed 112.71 points higher at 10,649.76 as investors 
turned their focus toward the positive earnings news expected next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,  
grew by a bigger-than-expected 0.5 percent to $13.37 in September 
compared with the 0.2 percent increase in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed is on the hot seat now,'' said Bill Cheney, chief  
economist for John Hancock. ``Weak employment growth but higher 
hourly earnings point Greenspan and the Fed in two different 
directions. Either the economy is slowing down and the Fed needs to 
sit tight or inflation is starting to take off and another tap on 
the brakes may be necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some economists said September's wage-growth jump may be a  
fluke, caused by the storm, which reduced weekly hours worked. 
``Whenever hours contract sharply, hourly wages tend to jump but 
that effect does not persist,'' said Merrill Lynch's chief 
economist Bruce Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Fed will just sort of set this report aside, mark  
time and wait for the next one,'' said Robert Dederick, economic 
consultant to The Northern Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong wage growth is a good development for workers, but  
economists and members of the Federal Reserve worry that it could 
spark inflation. Their fear: Employers seeking qualified workers 
woo them with higher wages and benefits, costs likely to drive up 
consumer prices if not constrained by other forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed policy-makers on Tuesday decided not to raise interest rates  
for now. But expressing concerns that the tight labor market could 
lead to inflation down the road, they left open the possibility of 
a third rate increase later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, manufacturers, who have seen demand for their  
products rebound somewhat from a global financial crisis that began 
in 1997, lost an additional 21,000 jobs. Even the service sector, 
normally the driving force of job creation, suffered a decline of 
9,000 jobs last month, reflecting a drop of 49,000 jobs at retail 
businesses. Job loss was particularly heavy where businesses were 
forced to close because of the hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane -- along with a drought -- took a bite out of the  
nation's soybean and cotton crops. The Agriculture Department on 
Friday lowered its forecast of this year's cotton crop by 6 percent 
to 16.4 million bales and reduced its estimate for soybeans by 3 
percent to 2.7 billion bushels. The government expects soybean 
prices to go up, but didn't estimate the impact on cotton prices.

<HEADLINE> Voice Mail on Net Coming Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Voice mail on the Internet? E-mail over the  
phone? 
</P>
<P>
	Both are emerging, as the line separating phones and computers  
continues to blur. New products and services will let callers leave 
messages as e-mail attachments or check e-mail by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think voice is going to be the next wave of the Internet,''  
said Judy Radlinsky, spokeswoman for General Magic, which featured 
both services at the Internet World conference that ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jfax.com and eFax.com are among the other companies offering  
voice e-mail. Some of the services have been available for a few 
months; others were introduced at the show this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers use a special number to leave a voice message, and it  
pops up as an e-mail. Recipients can listen to messages from the 
computer or by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawback: they need separate numbers.  
</P>
<P>
	Regular voice mail services offered by phone companies  
automatically transfer unanswered or busy calls to the voice mail 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	With Internet-based services, callers must make a second call,  
or recipients must subscribe to a call-forwarding service from the 
phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Jfax and eFax also offer services that translate faxes to  
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is you're a moving target,'' said Josh Mailman, an  
eFax product demonstrator. ``The easier you can be found, capture 
and get your information, the better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet World, a five-day conference sponsored by publishers of  
Internet World magazine, brings together Internet companies ranging 
from Microsoft Corp. to the smallest startups. The show is now in 
its seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's offerings largely targeted other Internet companies,  
but a handful of products were designed specifically for consumers 
or business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancestry.com Inc., for instance, offers databases with 400  
million names to help people trace their family roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Handspring Inc. and Palm Computing Inc. also showed off their  
latest handheld organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service had a presence as well, handing out  
brochures on electronic filing of tax returns and giving away 
CD-ROMs featuring forms and publications for tax year 1998. No 
matter that returns were due April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Several services targeted the growing e-commerce business. Some  
help companies set up online retail operations. Others offer 
digital cash systems that let buyers shop from different merchants 
without having to enter a credit card number each time.

<HEADLINE> Barrels Leak Radiation in N. Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A small amount of radiation leaked from barrels at  
a disposal center for contaminated materials, officials said today, 
just a week after Japan's worst-ever nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of radiation released was far below the level set by  
law as safe, said Shuetsu Shimaya, an official with Japan Nuclear 
Fuel, the company that discovered the leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaks follow a nuclear accident at a uranium reprocessing  
plant outside Tokyo that exposed 49 people to radiation and 
heightened already rising fears in Japan about lax safety standards 
at nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Shimaya said the leaks, at a disposal center in Rokkasho, 360  
miles northeast of Tokyo, were discovered during an inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	The barrels contained radioactive material from a Tokyo Electric  
Power Co. nuclear power plant in Fukushima prefecture (state). One 
barrel was found leaking on Sept. 28 and the second one was 
discovered Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure came as authorities were mounting inspections of  
the nation's nuclear facilities to check on safety standards and 
prevent further accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation into last week's accident, in Tokaimura, 70  
miles northeast of Tokyo, found that operator JCO Co. regularly 
skipped crucial security steps and ordered employees to cut corners 
to save time. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears about the Tokaimura plant are causing more suffering for  
residents by driving down prices for farm goods produced there and 
prompting a rash of cancellations at the region's tourist hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for sweet potatoes, green onions, carrots and other  
vegetables fell nearly 30 percent after the accident, local 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourist industry is also hurting. While Tokaimura has few  
sightseers, hotels closer to nearby beaches, mountains and lush 
parklands are losing money. 
</P>
<P>
	September and early October are not busy times for the area, but  
hotels and inns might feel the real pain later in the autumn, when 
tourists usually come to bathe in hot springs and admire the 
mountain foliage, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're worried about what's going to happen in the fall  
season,'' said Nobuko Yamakoshi of Ibaraki prefecture's tourist 
section. ``People in the area surrounding the plant, of course, are 
not doing well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at the fuel reprocessing plant inadvertently started an  
uncontrolled nuclear reaction last week, releasing radioactivity 
into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of those exposed were hospitalized and people living close  
to the plant were evacuated, while others were told to stay inside. 
An order to farmers not to harvest their crops was in force for 
three days, and radioactive materials have reportedly been found in 
soil outside the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Though government officials say the area is now safe, serious  
doubts remain among residents, who are still flooding health 
centers to get checked for radioactivity exposure. Many are 
reportedly suffering from post-traumatic stress. 
</P>
<P>
	A high school in the town conducted a health survey of its  
nearly 700 students today after rising complaints of diarrhea and 
headaches, Kyodo News service reported. School officials could not 
be reached this evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation into the accident has focused on slipshod  
practices by the operator of the plant, JCO Co. Reports say the 
government is likely to revoke JCO's operating license. 
</P>
<P>
	A former JCO president, Toshiki Takagi, quit his job today at  
the government-affiliated Metal Mining Agency of Japan to express 
symbolic remorse, an agency official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media reported today that JCO's parent company,  
Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., planned to get out of the nuclear fuel 
business.

<HEADLINE> Waco Probe Stalls in Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans are losing their  
zeal for fresh hearings into the 1993 Waco siege, the initial 
urgency dampened by internal bickering and concerns about the GOP's 
credibility in another White House investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that we will see any compelling need'' for  
hearings, House Majority Leader Dick Armey told reporters Thursday, 
expressing confidence in independent prosecutor John Danforth. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a basic attitude among the leadership guys ... to be  
parient,'' said Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Only last month, party leaders seized on new revelations about  
the government's use of force against the Branch Davidians, seeking 
in-depth congressional hearings and Attorney General Janet Reno's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, where Democrats only need to pick up six seats to  
win control in next year's election, some Republicans grew nervous 
that another investigation of the Clinton administration might 
backfire with voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's Waco fatigue,'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., a  
member of the House panel investigating Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	He prefers postponing hearings until spring. ``There's a feeling  
that the political risk may be higher than the political gain of 
pursuing this subject at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is more enthusiasm in the Senate for new investigations of  
Reno's department. But the focus on Waco has been diluted by other 
complaints against Justice -- such as its investigation of Chinese 
espionage charges -- and muddied by Republican infighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, Rep. Dan  
Burton, has promised to move aggressively with hearings. His 
investigators expect to receive more than a million Waco-related 
documents from the Justice and Defense departments within a week in 
response to a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, R-Ind., did not respond to a request for comment  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelations that sparked the furor include the FBI's  
admission that its agents fired potentially flammable tear gas 
canisters at the compound April 19, 1993, which the agency long 
denied. The FBI says the canisters, launched hours before the start 
of the fire that consumed the compound, bounced harmlessly off the 
roof of a nearby bunker and did not contribute to that fire. About 
80 Davidians died that day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News quoted a now retired Army colonel in  
today's editions as saying he heard Davidian leader David Koresh 
give the order to set the fires through bug transmissions on 
speakers in the FBI Waco command center's monitoring room. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Rodney L. Rawlings, who retired from the Army in 1997, told  
the Dallas newspaper that he heard Koresh's order and then the 
sound of gunshots within five minutes after the FBI began its 
assault on the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it. Anyone who says you couldn't at the time is being  
less than truthful,'' said Rawlings, explaining he was in an 
adjacent room in the FBI command center at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials have said transmissions from eavesdropping devices  
inside the Davidians' compound were too garbled to allow agents to 
hear the sect's discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Only later, after the fire and the tapes were enhanced, did the  
FBI learn that the Davidians were spreading fuel and preparing to 
set a fire, they testified before congressional committees. Had FBI 
leaders heard that people in the compound were preparing a fire, 
they would have stopped the assault, they testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy FBI Director John Collingwood would not comment on  
Rawlings' account. ``We have appropriately relinquished all of 
these issues to Senator Danforth and are confident he will get to 
the bottom of this,'' he told the Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 9, the day after Reno announced Danforth's appointment,  
Armey said he wanted the House probe to be more sweeping than the 
independent prosecutor's: ``I want to know it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., agreed that  
congressional investigators should ``do it in the broadest possible 
way.'' He said the revelations made him doubt the conclusion that 
the Branch Davidians, and not the FBI, started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Senate Republicans have been feuding among  
themselves over the investigation's scope and proper venue. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, wanted  
his panel to handle it. Instead, Lott last month announced a task 
force led by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a Judiciary Committee 
member, that would investigate the espionage charges as a first 
priority. Waco would be secondary, along with charges of Democratic 
campaign fund-raising abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch has made another pitch to take over the investigation. In  
an Oct. 5 letter to Specter obtained by The Associated Press, Hatch 
said the probe would have more credibility if it were done by a 
Judiciary Committee panel with the Democrats' participation.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Finish Narrowly Mixed / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices finished narrowly mixed Friday as  
the September employment report flashed conflicting signals for the 
fixed-income market -- a decline in jobs but an unexpectedly strong 
rise in wages. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3-16  
point, or $1.87 1/2 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, edged up to 6.19 percent from 6.18 
percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But prices of short-term Treasury securities were up 1-32 point  
while intermediate maturities were steady, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond markets held an abbreviated trading session to give traders  
a head start on the Columbus Day weekend, and the government's 
unemployment report dominated trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported the nation's unemployment rate  
remained at 4.2 percent in September, the lowest level in 29 years, 
but that total jobs fell by 8,000 for the first decline in more 
than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without the impact of Hurricane Floyd, job growth in  
September would have been a relatively small 50,000, the government 
estimated. Many analysts had expected companies to add 220,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists saw the job data as a sign the economy may be  
slowing, a development that could reduce pressure on the Federal 
Reserve to raise interest rates in an attempt to stop a resurgence 
of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But others were bothered by an unexpectedly strong 0.5 percent  
rise in average hourly earnings, interpreting it as a sign 
inflation may be accelerating. The Fed is watching inflation trends 
closely and indicated this week it is inclined to push rates higher 
on signs of rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott Platt, director of economic research for Donaldson  
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities, said long-term bond prices rallied in 
immediate reaction to the decline in jobs but reversed course on 
concerns about the wage figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raised the nervous expectation in a lot of people's minds  
that the Fed will make a move'' to boost rates at its November 
meeting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of inflation seems to be there. There is a tight  
labor market too,'' Platt said. He expects a quarter percentage 
point rise in the federal funds rate in November. The federal funds 
rate is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the federal funds rate held steady at 5.31 percent,  
the same as late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.79 percent as the  
discount lost 0.03 percentage point from Thursday to 4.67 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.09 percent, as the discount slipped 0.02 
percentage point to 4.89 percent. One-year yields were 5.29 percent 
as the discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 5.03 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 111 7-32 from 111 9-32 late 
Thursday. The average yield to maturity held at 5.95 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond markets will be closed Monday in observance of the federal  
holiday, although stock markets will be open.

<HEADLINE> Rules on Cable Ownership Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government added flexibility today to its  
restrictions on the number of cable customers a single company can 
serve, hoping to hasten the roll-out of high-speed Internet 
connections and a new generation of telephone services to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission decision also gives AT&AMP;T  
more options for how to complete its proposed $58 billion purchase 
of MediaOne, a deal that would create the nation's largest cable TV 
company and provider of high-speed cable Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC slightly loosened its 30 percent cap limiting a  
company's share of total cable households. The commission also more 
narrowly defined what interests from a limited partnership would 
count against a company toward this audience limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Those changes will help cable companies who want to offer  
high-speed Internet access and local phone service, but who say 
they need to grow in order to do so, the commission said. But the 
rules will also prevent cable companies from having too much 
control in their core business -- television programming. 
</P>
<P>
	``If cable companies want to enter into arrangements with each  
other to pursue new competitive ventures, like local phone service 
and high-speed Internet access, that's no threat to competition,'' 
said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. ``It could be a boon for 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted 5-0 to adopt the rules, with two  
commissioners dissenting in part. 
</P>
<P>
	After the vote, Kennard said the commission's decision is in  
line with his ``passion to get high-speed Internet access into 
every home in America as soon as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The original rules -- called for by a 1992 communications law --  
were developed primarily to prevent a cable company from having too 
much control over programming and to ensure diversity in what 
people can watch. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that cable companies are beginning to offer high-speed  
Internet access and local phone service over their pipes, the FCC 
wants to help them enter these markets more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing the rise of competitors to cable like  
direct-broadcast satellite, the FCC voted to apply the 30 percent 
limit to a wider market. That in effect would enable a single 
company to control up to nearly 37 percent of cable subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 66 million cable subscribers nationwide, according to  
the FCC. The multichannel video market -- which more broadly 
includes cable and its competitors -- has 80 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, which have been challenged in court, won't be  
enforced pending a decision. After that, companies will have six 
months to come into compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies, like AT&AMP;T, could benefit from some of the  
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the FCC's actions, AT&AMP;T may have more leeway of how  
to complete its planned purchase of MediaOne without losing 
possessions. The rules give AT&AMP;T room to make its case that certain 
interests should not count toward the subscriber limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the FCC has to do is take current conditions in the  
market into account in developing a rule that clearly relates to 
the statutory purpose of protecting video programmers,'' said Mark 
Rosenblum, vice president of law for AT&AMP;T Corp. ``We don't think 
that logical and sensible ownership rules should impede our 
transaction with MediaOne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers groups disagree and fear a few players will end up  
controlling the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only takes a small stake in a broadly held company to  
influence its decisions on programming,'' said Gene Kimmelman, 
co-director of Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the possibility of cable companies getting into the  
local phone market is not an adequate tradeoff for reducing 
diversity of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is anybody who wants to deliver telephone or Internet  
services over cable can do it without owning the systems,'' said 
Andrew Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project. ``It's 
blackmail.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Mulls Fortier's Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Michael Fortier's sentencing judge said  
today that he is considering giving Fortier more than the four 
years he has already served for failing to notify authorities about 
the plans for the Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Van Bebber is presiding over a  
resentencing hearing ordered by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals. The court said Van Bebber used wrong guidelines when he 
sentenced Fortier to 12 years in prison and a $200,000 fine last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Van Bebber should have used guidelines for  
involuntary manslaughter instead of first-degree murder. The 
manslaughter guidelines call for 51 months in prison; Fortier has 
already served around 50 months. 
</P>
<P>
	But a sentencing brief filed on behalf of bombing victims says  
the judge can impose a longer sentence than the manslaughter 
guidelines call for because of the extraordinary nature of the 
case, and the judge indicated he was learning toward such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am contemplating an upward departure in this case,'' Van  
Bebber said at the start of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Michael McGuire, who is seeking to have Fortier  
sentenced to time served, objected to a harsher sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, 30, has been in prison since pleading guilty in August  
1995 to failing to notify authorities of the plot to bomb the 
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and other charges. The April 19, 
1995, blast killed 168 people and injured hundreds of other. 
</P>
<P>
	His sentencing was delayed nearly three years until after the  
federal trials of bomber Timothy McVeigh and co-conspirator Terry 
Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire took exception to a presentencing report by probation  
officer Daniel Muller that asks for a harsher sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like he's represented the facts accurately,''  
McGuire told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire also asked the judge to reconsider the fine imposed  
against Fortier. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Fortier received a fine, I want the court to know that  
he is not able to pay a fine,'' McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Connelly, assistant U.S attorney, said the government  
wanted a sentence in the range of 70 to 87 months. He said the 
government isn't asking for more than that because of Fortier's 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Cassell, a law professor representing victims, said  
that ``only a substantial upward departure'' can accommodate the 
magnitude of the bombing. He suggested the judge reinstate the 
sentence of 12 years and a $200,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just punishment demands that the death of 168 people be  
reflected somewhere in the sentence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, survivors and relatives of victims as well as of  
Fortier arrived under a steady rain to hear Van Bebber's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think 144 months is pretty cheap for 168 lives,'' said Tom  
Kight, whose stepdaughter Frankie Merrell died in the blast. ``I 
don't know what is a fair sentence for 168 lives. It's never going 
to be enough, OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier's attorneys maintain that his cooperation with  
government prosecutors who made Fortier their star witness at the 
trials of McVeigh and Nichols qualify him to be released 
immediately for time served. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury in Denver convicted McVeigh on murder, weapons  
and conspiracy counts and recommended he die for his crimes. Judge 
Richard Matsch formally sentenced him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Another federal jury convicted Nichols of involuntary  
manslaughter and conspiracy. He is serving a life sentence for 
conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter. Matsch sentenced Nichols 
to life in prison. He faces a state trial on 160 counts of murder.

<HEADLINE> Calif., Texas Nix Countdown Clocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Postal officials thought it was a benign little  
promotional item: digital clocks counting down the days, hours, 
minutes and seconds until the new millennium in offices around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't anticipate that the clocks -- with their big red  
numbers -- would remind customers of how long they had spent waiting 
in line -- and of their own mortality. 
</P>
<P>
	``The customers said it made them feel more time-conscious. It  
made them feel hurried, like their lives are going too fast,'' said 
Jackie Beall, postmaster in nearby Colleyville. ``Some customers 
said, 'Y2K is coming anyway, why are you putting this stress on 
us?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The clocks, part of a nationwide campaign, are coming down in  
dozens of North Texas offices and in several Northern California 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent customer surveys found satisfaction levels decreasing for  
some Texas offices, so Postal Service workers started informally 
polling customers on what they liked and disliked about the 
stations. They learned that the clock distressed several customers, 
said Stephen Seewoester, a spokesman the Postal Service's Fort 
Worth region. 
</P>
<P>
	Some customers complained that the clocks made the wait seem  
longer or made them feel older, said Sam Bolen, public affairs 
manager for the Postal Service's Southwest area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 40,000 post offices nationwide,'' Bolen said. ``Try as  
we might to please everyone, there's always going to be something 
that offends some people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Wald, Postal Service spokesman for the Oakland, Calif.,  
district, said five clocks were removed from offices because of 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers felt ``the clock was a reminder that (doomsday) was  
coming. And we didn't see any compelling reason why the clock had 
to stay up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Why only in Texas and California? Are people's lives more  
harried? Does death and doom haunt them more than those in other 
parts of the nation? 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't begin to speculate,'' said Bolen. ``Talk to  
psychiatrists about it.''

<HEADLINE> Elvis Presley Home for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KILLEEN, Texas (AP) -- It's a house fit for a King.  
</P>
<P>
	The home Elvis Presley had while he was a soldier at Fort Hood  
is for sale again on the Internet auction site eBay. The auction 
closes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	One prospective buyer already has matched the minimum bid of  
$200,000, said the home's owner, M.J. Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Craig said two previous auctions closed with high bids of  
$126,100 and $75,000 -- not enough to part with the one-story, 
three-bedroom brick home she's lived in since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Presley was stationed at Fort Hood when he was 23. He lived in  
the home for 25 weeks, said Deborah Garrell, Ms. Craig's daughter. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> India Techno-Savvy Pol Wins Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's most techno-savvy politician is  
a poor farmer's son who loves his laptop, has been feted by Bill 
Gates, hates red tape -- and won a landslide election victory in his 
home province. 
</P>
<P>
	Nara Chandrababu Naidu, 49, has endeared himself to India's  
businessmen, especially technology companies, with his vision to 
transform Andhra Pradesh, one of India's poorest states, into a 
high-tech hub where far-flung districts are wired by high-speed 
data links. 
</P>
<P>
	Naidu has made sweeping reforms to loosen the bureaucracy's  
tight control on the state government, lured big infrastructure 
projects, introduced a paperless administration to cut red tape and 
encouraged innovative development programs. 
</P>
<P>
	When the World Bank cut off aid to India in May 1998 after New  
Delhi's multiple nuclear tests, it still gave Naidu's state a $560 
million loan, impressed by his plans for health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp. chose the state capital, Hyderabad, for its  
first software development center outside of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has provided a velocity to the information technology  
revolution in the country,'' said Dewang Mehta, executive director 
of the National Association of Software and Service Companies. 
</P>
<P>
	All this helps explain why Naidu's Telugu Desam Party won 29  
seats of the 42 that represent Andhra Pradesh in the national 
parliament, according to nearly complete election tallies Friday. 
His party also won 180 seats in the 294-seat state assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	With 29 seats, Naidu's party is the second-largest member in  
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's disparate 22-party coalition 
-- and the only group with enough power to wreak the alliance by 
walking out. 
</P>
<P>
	That's unlikely, political analysts say. In fact, Naidu is  
Vajpayee's biggest guarantee that the coalition will be one of the 
strongest in years. 
</P>
<P>
	``His commitment is solid,'' said Ajay Mehra, a political  
analyst at the independent Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. 
``I don't think he will play the spoil sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No other Indian politician operates quite like Naidu.  
</P>
<P>
	Like the CEO of a multinational corporation, he clicks on his  
laptop at presentations, confidently answers tricky economic 
questions and points out the advantages of investing in his state 
with the help of statistics tables beamed on huge screens.

<HEADLINE> No Replacement Parts for State Farm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- State Farm, the nation's largest auto  
insurer, suspended its use of generic replacement parts after a 
jury awarded $456 million to policyholders in a class-action 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought to try to dispel some of this confusion or concern  
it would be best to temporarily suspend use of `aftermarket' crash 
parts,'' State Farm spokesman Dave Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury on Monday found that State Farm's use of aftermarket  
parts breached the insurer's contract to restore vehicles to their 
pre-accident condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Such parts resemble brand-name replacement parts but are made  
without access to automakers' factory specifications. Critics say 
they do not provide the same level of fit, finish, corrosion 
resistance and, in some cases, safety, as regular replacement 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge is considering a second count of the lawsuit: whether  
State Farm committed fraud by not telling consumers what sort of 
parts it was requiring body shops to use. A ruling on that question 
could come today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurst said the company's announcement Thursday was not related  
to the impending ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm won't charge its policyholders extra and their  
premiums won't be increased, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 percent of parts used in State Farm repairs have been  
from aftermarket manufacturers, the insurer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk Hansen, a spokesman for the trade group Alliance of  
American Insurers, said he expected other companies would follow 
State Farm's lead.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Licensing Employee Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Federal prosecutors charged an employee of a  
drivers licensing station with bribery Friday, the 17th person to 
be charged in a yearlong investigation of corruption in the 
secretary of state's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said a confidential informant claimed to have seen  
Donna Carter, 46, of Norridge, take payoffs when they both worked 
at the state's Elk Grove Village commercial drivers licensing 
facility in 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George Ryan was secretary of state at the time. He has said  
he knows nothing about wrongdoing while he was head of the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Carter also was tape recorded taking $500 from  
an undercover postal inspector on Aug. 4. They said she admitted 
taking payoffs from the owner of a driving school and from a 
driving instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last week, the investigation had focused on two licensing  
facilities -- McCook and Melrose Park. The new charges signal an 
expansion of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 drivers illegally obtained licenses from 1991 to  
1998, U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar has said. The drivers were told 
the answers to test questions, illegally coached and in some cases 
were given previously filled out forms.

<HEADLINE> Blast Voice Mail Called 'Phone Spam' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It used to be that Michael Kagan would empty his  
voice mailbox before leaving work, and it would stay that way until 
the following morning. But times -- and technology -- have changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, when the portfolio manager for the $1.8 billion Salomon  
Brothers Fund arrives at the office, he has to spend a half-hour 
catching up on the deluge of prerecorded messages sent to his voice 
mail overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Known in the industry as ``voice blasts,'' these automated calls  
are intended to stand out from the 3-foot-high stack of mail, 70 
telephone calls, 150 e-mails and ``staggering'' number of faxes 
Kagan receives on a daily basis. In reality, ``it simply adds to 
the information overload that I already had,'' Kagan says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voice blast,'' or blast voice mail, has become the favored  
technology among research analysts in the past two years because it 
allows them to send recorded messages about company earnings or 
undervalued stocks -- simultaneously -- to an unlimited number of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Widely used in the 1980s by debt collection agencies as a way to  
remind people about late payments, recorded telephone messages 
today are being used for a variety of purposes. Professional sports 
organizations are calling thousands of season ticket holders at 
once, schools are improving communication with parents and 
disaster-prone regions are planning emergency warning systems. But 
some consider blast voice mail a nuisance and, when it arrives 
unsolicited, an invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just, like, phone spam,'' says Jason Catlett, president  
of the Green Brook, N.J.-based Junkbusters Corp., using the slang 
word to describe unwanted e-mail. A former database analyst for 
AT&AMP;T, Catlett started Junkbusters in 1996 to help consumers defend 
themselves against telephone marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, blast voice mails are typically sent during the  
middle of the night, when nobody is around to answer the call and 
say ``no thanks'' or hang up upon hearing the familiar pause that 
precedes a recorded message. In fact, some blast voice mail systems 
will disconnect if a live person answers and try again later. 
</P>
<P>
	Blast voice mail is a huge time saver for Ed Spehar, a vice  
president of equity research at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in New York who 
regularly uses it. But Spehar conceded there is an intrusive 
element to this new tool and that there is a potential for abuse if 
relied on too frequently. He says he tries to use it ``very 
judiciously'' and limits his recordings to 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, fund managers say poorly developed blast voice mails that  
ramble on are just as common. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody is calling me about a small company that I don't  
have in my portfolio, then it's a waste of my time,'' Kagan says. 
On the other hand, he adds, if the message is relevant -- and 
concise -- ``I actually prefer voice mails to taking telephone calls 
because it's more efficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's that efficiency that has blast voice mails echoing far  
beyond Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Educators at Stonewall Jackson High School in Manassas, Va., say  
it is the cornerstone of their ``Bridge Project,'' which aims to 
improve communication with parents. Principal Steve Constantino, 
for instance, uses blast voice mail to congratulate the parents of 
students whose grade-point averages have improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Stonewall science teachers use it to inform parents  
about television programs related to class discussions that 
children should be encouraged to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the kids hate it,'' Constantino says. ``That's how I  
know it's working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Boulder, Colo., two companies are developing an early-warning  
voice mail system for Boulder County that would alert residents 
should Boulder Creek experience a major flood. The $60,000 software 
should be able to isolate lists of telephone numbers for specific 
geographical boundaries and send detailed evacuation instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies involved in the project believes blast voice mail  
will be especially effective if disaster strikes in the middle of 
the night. ``People don't have the TV on, they don't have the radio 
on, and if we could just call them and say 'Hey, take shelter,' I 
think lives could be saved,'' said Steven Crane, chief executive of 
Indianapolis-based Hanover Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Using blast voice mails to help children at school or save  
people from disaster is one thing, but when used for unsolicited 
advertising, it is often considered intrusive, not to mention 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, when Dick Clark left messages on the answering  
machines of residents in Washington, D.C. and Detroit to promote 
the American Music Awards on ABC, a front-page story in The 
Washington Post described the entertainer's pitch as a ``telephonic 
assault'' on the public's ear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't have the impact we were hoping,'' said Paul Shefrin,  
a publicist for Dick Clark Productions, who admits he would like to 
block such calls on his own telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Telephone Consumers Protection Act, passed by Congress in  
1991, prohibits recorded advertisements from being sent to 
residential phones without prior consent, while allowing blast 
voice mail of the variety used by institutional investors, schools 
and emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being abused by some, blast voice mail has far-reaching  
potential for non-intrusive commercial uses, says Richard Lamme, 
CEO of Wayne, N.J.-based Client Instant Access, which provides 
blast voice mail services to Wall Street firms for about $2 per 
call. From realtors wishing to reach clients in a timely way to 
manufacturers needing to deliver the same message to a long list of 
distributors, Lamme insists blast voice mail can be effective if 
the sender and receiver are partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a relationship seems to exist in Fairbanks, Alaska, where  
the Lily of the Valley Church of God in Christ uses an inexpensive 
voice mail system to call its 120 members about upcoming events. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get a message notifying you of a special meeting,''  
Deacon Don Thomas says, ``I think that makes people feel pretty 
good, that they are important enough that somebody would take the 
time to leave them a message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas says he has had to resist the temptation to overuse the  
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, we want to compel people to come to Christ, but at the  
same time we don't want to intrude on people. I think there's a big 
difference,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Fires Leave Nevada Devastated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Nevada's most widespread wildland fire season  
on record left a legacy of devastation the size of the state of 
Delaware, threatening the lives of surviving animals and the 
livelihood of scores of ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Nevadans are worried more about seeds than smoke. Among the  
top priorities is to replant the barren ground with native grasses 
and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most extensive rangeland reseeding effort ever  
undertaken in Nevada -- and maybe anywhere,'' said Gene Kolkman. The 
Ely district manager for the federal Bureau of Land Management is 
coordinating that part of a statewide emergency action plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difficulties we face from this disaster are enormous.''  
</P>
<P>
	A rash of thunderstorms in early August and then again in the  
middle of the month sparked fires that burned 2,468 square miles of 
grass, brush and trees, primarily in the northeastern part of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 major fires blackened areas ranging from a few  
hundred acres to the Poker Brown fire southwest of Winnemucca, 
which covered 243,281 acres -- more than 380 square miles. By 
contrast, the District of Columbia encompasses 69 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those years that will stick out in your mind  
because of the kind of activity we've had, the acreage burned,'' 
Nevada Division of Forestry spokesman Steve Frady said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frady has seen nothing like this year, even after spending  
nearly 25 years fighting fires in Nevada. The 777,116 acres in 1996 
isn't half of this year's 1.58 million acres -- one-third of the 
total acreage burned in the nation. Wildlife division statistics 
make this the worst year in more than one-half century. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 20 miles east of Reno, Ed DePaoli looks at ashes blanketing  
what once was a grassland range. 
</P>
<P>
	``We normally would run between 200 to 300 cattle on this range  
during the late year,'' DePaoli said. ``I think we can move things 
around a bit to get by. It's our winter range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DePaoli said reseeding by the Bureau of Land Management and  
others is going to be a huge effort, since in some allotments 
nearly 90 percent was burned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough,'' DePaoli said.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 3 million pounds of grass seed are on order for fall  
planting. Sagebrush and other desert shrubs will have to wait for 
spring. Reseeding is expected to take at least three years and cost 
$50 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, new grass will replace cheat grass that found its  
way into Nevada around the turn of the century as inexpensive 
filler in packing crates. Its seed scattered into the air and 
thrived in the arid ground of the high desert, crowding out more 
beneficial plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheat grass provides sparse pasture for spring grazing, then  
quickly turns brown and lifeless in early summer -- tinder for the 
first bolt of lightning or careless camper. And since it grows 
faster than sagebrush or more nutritional grasses, it thwarts their 
recovery by competing for scant nutrients and water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over time, cheat grass can dominate a landscape,'' said  
Sherman Swanson, extension range specialist for the University of 
Nevada College of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Frady said because of the fires, some ranchers might have to  
scale back or stop operations altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the range fires we've had, we've had the livelihood of  
families affected,'' Frady said. ``Those range fires have not only 
destroyed the grazing lands that are privately owned, but also 
those federal lands that are grazing allotments. There's going to 
have to be a significant shift for many of those people in how they 
do their business on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BLM's Kolkman agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough situation for these ranchers. At the moment,  
they're staring at black,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also staring at black are the wildland animals that escaped the  
flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the fire is over, life doesn't go on,'' said Jim  
Jeffress, a biologist with the Nevada Division of Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``For decades and decades to come, the manifestations and  
impacts of those fires will be felt in the wildlife communities, 
from the mice on up to the big-game species.''

<HEADLINE> IBM Cutting Up to 1,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Up to 1,000 jobs are being cut in IBM's personal  
computer division in hopes of turning around a business that 
pioneered the industry, but lost nearly $1 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 5 percent to 10 percent reduction in the unit's  
10,000-person staff will be in marketing. IBM plans to consolidate 
different brands -- including Aptiva PCs, ThinkPad laptops and 
Netfinity computer servers -- under one marketing umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which employs 291,000 people overall, said an undetermined  
number of people will be laid off, though some affected employees 
will be offered jobs in other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees were notified Wednesday about the cuts, which will be  
completed by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company lost about $150 million in the second quarter in the  
unit, which sells PCs to both consumers and businesses. Fierce 
price wars have sharply reduced profits at major computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM has been struggling to repair its so-called Personal Systems  
Group for several years, and some analysts have even suggested that 
IBM should stop selling personal computers. Last summer, IBM 
replaced the head of its consumer PC division with Michael Braun, 
but Braun's role is unclear now that IBM has folded the unit with 
the operation that sells PCs to businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to do better, and we know it. That's the reason behind  
these actions,'' IBM spokeswoman Trink Guarino said today. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM plans to release its third-quarter financial results Oct.  
20. The company is making an aggressive effort to emphasize its 
faster-growing businesses, which include selling computer services 
to large corporations and selling software. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of IBM slid 2.5 percent Friday, falling $2.87 1/2 to $113.50  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Mount Union Approaches Win Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Oklahoma teams that set an NCAA record  
with 47 straight victories aren't worried that Mount Union is one 
victory away from matching the feat. If fact, they want to see the 
streak continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of those Sooners teams who were contacted this  
week wished good luck to Mount Union in Saturday's game against 
Heidelberg at Columbian High School Stadium in Tiffin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they know everybody's gunning for them, but if they  
play as hard while the streak continues as they did to get to this 
point, there's no telling how far they'll go,'' said Ken Northcutt 
of Bethany, Okla., a lineman with the Sooners from 1955 to 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can give this Mount Union team one piece of advice, it's  
this: Go win this game for yourselves. Don't win it for the school, 
don't win it for the fans, don't win it for the school, but win it 
for yourselves,'' said Joseph Oujesky, also a lineman on those same 
three Oklahoma teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll never forget this accomplishment and you'll realize  
just how significant it was the older you get,'' said Oujesky, an 
executive with the Winn-Dixie supermarket chain in Fort Worth, 
Texas. He officiated football games for 40 years and now is an 
observer of officials for Conference USA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen this team play on television in the Division III  
championship game and they've got a lot to be proud of,'' he said. 
``I hope they do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they win Saturday, the three-time defending Division III  
champions can surpass Oklahoma's mark at home against Otterbein. 
What may have been the biggest scare in their last 46 games came 
last Saturday as they held on for a 57-51 victory over John Carroll 
in three overtimes. 
</P>
<P>
	No one else has come within 10 games of the Oklahoma record in  
the four decades since it was set, and it's understandable that the 
Purple Raiders might be feeling some pressure. But the former 
Sooners said they didn't think that much about the importance of 
what they were doing at the time they were doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a wonderful time for all of us,'' said Jerry Thompson,  
who is in the oil and gas business in Denver and later coached at 
Oklahoma and the St. Louis Cardinals with Bud Wilkinson, head coach 
of the Sooners during the record-setting period from 1953 to 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was a sophomore lineman when Notre Dame ended the  
streak with a 7-0 victory at Owen Field in Norman, Okla. ``We 
expected to win and we had a lot of fun, and I bet the Mount Union 
players are having a lot of fun, too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a certain amount of pressure, but when you're young,  
you don't think about it that much,'' said Jakie Sandefer of 
Houston, who's also involved in the petroleum industry and was a 
starting junior halfback in 1957. ``Now I look back and realize 
that, good gosh, what we did was almost impossible. But we did 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling the end of the streak, Sandefer said, ``There was  
total devastation in the stadium. People didn't move for a long 
time after the game, and neither did we. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'll never forget coach Wilkinson's words after the game.  
He told us, `I want to congratulate you. This is a record that will 
never be broken by a major college team. The only ones who never 
lose are the ones who never play.' 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, he's been right. And even if Mount Union breaks the  
record, they play at a different level than we did, so his 
prediction will remain correct. But what Mount Union's doing is 
still a magnificent accomplishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually the streak will end, and Dr. Robert Morford, a  
Lawton, Okla., dentist who was a sophomore tackle in 1957, said 
when that happens, the details of the first defeat will be 
remembered longer than most of the victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning 47 is good, but losing one is what stands out,'' he  
said. ``So I hope these guys win the 47th and 48th and keep going. 
It's no fun to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once they were beaten, the Sooners didn't let it affect the rest  
of their season. ``Coach Wilkinson didn't practice on Sunday, but 
after Notre Dame, the players went out and practiced on their 
own,'' Morford said. ``We wanted to go out and get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Thompson recalled, ``We didn't lose any more games that year  
and lost once the next year. So we got over it pretty quickly and 
we've benefited from it ever since.''

<HEADLINE> Twins Keep Radke, but Not Cordova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Twins exercised their $3.5  
million option on ace Brad Radke on Friday and also said good-bye 
to Marty Cordova, whose career has nose-dived after earning AL 
Rookie of the Year honors in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordova and infielder Brent Gates chose to become free agents  
rather than accept outright assignments to Triple-A Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins had twice placed Cordova waivers this season but no  
team was willing to take on his salary of $3 million this season 
and $4 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Radke, 26, was 12-14 with a 3.75 ERA for the Twins, who were  
ordered by owner Carl Pohlad to slash payroll to $16.8 million this 
season and finished last in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
	Pohlad agreed Thursday to sell the team to sports investors Glen  
Taylor and Robert Naegele Jr. for $120 million, contingent on a new 
outdoor stadium in St. Paul being approved by voters and lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins could have declined Radke's 2000 option and paid a  
$300,000 buyout. But he is one of precious few stars on a team that 
played 18 rookies this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Radke agreed in March 1997 to a $4.3 million, three-year  
contract, including the buyout. Friday's move makes it a $7.5 
million, four-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Radke, who was third in the AL with just 1.8 walks per nine  
innings, had four complete games, walked 44 and struck out 121 in 
33 starts for the Twins. He led the staff in wins and innings 
pitched (218 1-3) and he had the fourth-best ERA in the American 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	Radke is 44-38 over the last three seasons with a 3.96 ERA, 13  
complete games, 135 walks and 441 strikeouts in 100 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordova, 30, hit .285 with 14 homers and 70 RBIs in 124 games  
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting .277 with 24 homers, 84 RBIs and 20 stolen bases  
as a rookie, Cordova hit .309 with 16 homers and 111 RBIs in 1996 
and appeared headed for stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	But a foot injury plagued him during 1997 and '98, when he hit  
.246 with 15 homers and 51 RBIs and .253 with 10 homers and 69 
RBIs, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he became a 30-year-old on a team of twentysomethings and  
watched rookie outfielders Jacque Jones, Chad Allen and Torii 
Hunter get more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, 29, batted .255 with three homers and 38 RBIs this  
season. He signed as a free agent before the 1998 season and had 
six homers and 80 RBIs in two years.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Students To Get Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Cincinnati-based Procter &AMP; Gamble is  
among several Western companies providing computers and Internet 
access to thousands of Romanian children, the Education Ministry 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really need this help,'' Education Minister Andrei Marga  
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble will donate 100 computers, IBM will maintain  
the computers and the multinational group Mobifon will provide free 
Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 schools in cities and rural areas will be given 1,000  
computers, said Norica Iordache, one of the program's organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Save the Children foundation will verify the pupils have access  
to the computers. Over the years, foreign aid to impoverished 
Romanian institutions has fallen into the wrong hands or been 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanian children rarely have access to modern technology in  
this impoverished East European country, where there is one 
computer for 174 children.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher To Return This Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FIORANO, Italy (AP) -- Changing his mind after three days of  
practice, Michael Schumacher will compete in the last two Formula 
One events of the year, his first races since he broke his leg in a 
July crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael saw there had been a big improvement in his physical  
condition and therefore he has decided to take part in the two 
final and very important races of the season,'' Ferrari said today, 
referring to the Grand Prix races in Malaysia, Oct 17., and Japan, 
Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time world champion had said he would not compete in  
those events because he didn't think he was ready following his 
accident at the British Grand Prix. He has been test driving for 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Schumacher completed 58 laps at the Fiorano circuit  
where he broke an unofficial track record set by Ferrari's second 
driver Eddie Irvine, Italian sports dailies reported, citing track 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
	In changing his mind, Schumacher wanted to ``give the maximum  
support to Ferrari in the fight for the championships and to 
fulfill the wishes of the team and all the fans,'' the automaker 
said.

<HEADLINE> Reds Release Johnson and Wohlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds released catcher Brian  
Johnson and declined to pick up the option of hard-luck pitcher 
Mark Wohlers on Friday. The club also outrighted right-handers Rick 
Greene and Keith Glauber and outfielder Kerry Robinson to Triple-A 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds did pick up the club option on right-hander Stan  
Belinda, who was 3-1 with a 5.27 ERA and two saves in 29 relief 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson hit .231 with five home runs and 18 RBIs in 45 games  
this season after signing with the Reds as a free agent. He was on 
the disabled list from mid-June until the end of July while 
recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers was 0-0 with an 18.00 ERA in five appearances with  
Atlanta and the Reds. He was acquired from the Braves on April 16 
for right-hander John Hudek and a salary consideration, but spent 
most of the season on the disabled list because of an anxiety 
disorder and an elbow injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers had reconstructive surgery on the ulnar collateral  
ligament in his right elbow in July.

<HEADLINE> Cable Ownership Rules Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators eased rules Friday on the  
number of cable customers a single company can serve, hoping to 
hasten the roll-out of high-speed Internet connections and a new 
generation of telephone services to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission decision also reduces to  
some extent the obstacles that AT&AMP;T faces in completing its 
proposed $58 billion purchase of MediaOne, a deal that would create 
the nation's largest cable TV company and provider of high-speed 
cable Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC slightly loosened its 30 percent cap limiting a  
company's share of total cable households. It also more narrowly 
defined what interests from a limited partnership would count 
against a company toward this audience limit. That change could 
help AT&AMP;T make its case before the commission in seeking merger 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised rules are intended to address significant industry  
developments in recent years; namely, cable companies starting to 
offer high-speed Internet access and local phone service. FCC 
officials say the changes adopted Friday will enable cable 
companies to grow so they can compete in these new markets -- part 
of the vision of a 1996 telecommunications law. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the rules should prevent cable companies from  
exerting too much control in their core business of television 
programming, said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	``If cable companies want to enter into arrangements with each  
other to pursue new competitive ventures, like local phone service 
and high-speed Internet access, that's no threat to competition,'' 
Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the vote, Kennard said the commission's decision was in  
line with his ``passion to get high-speed Internet access into 
every home in America as soon as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing the rise of competitors to cable such as  
direct-broadcast satellite, the FCC voted to apply the 30 percent 
limit to a wider market. That would enable a single cable company 
to control up to 36.7 percent of subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, there are 66 million cable subscribers and 80  
million subscribers in the multichannel video market, which more 
broadly includes cable and its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T says the rule revisions will help it stay under the limit,  
even with its purchase of MediaOne, which would also give it a 25 
percent stake in cable systems owned by Time Warner Inc. The FCC's 
modified rules may not count this ownership stake against AT&AMP;T, if 
the company can show it is not involved in the video programming 
activities of Time Warner's cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T believes it can convince the FCC of this, so it won't have  
to shed assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are really very encouraged that the strategy we laid out  
can be accomplished,'' said C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and 
chief executive of AT&AMP;T. He said the company is still on track to 
complete the deal by the first quarter of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this very much adds to the certainty of that  
transaction completing,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the FCC decision helps AT&AMP;T's case, but the  
company could still have to make some changes to comply with the 
federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got some relief but not enough for the merger to go  
through without significant restructuring or divestiture,'' said 
Scott Cleland, director of Legg Mason's Precursor Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules won't be enforced until a court challenge to them is  
settled. If the decision is in the FCC's favor, companies will have 
six months to come into compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups accused the FCC of creating loopholes to ease  
the merger's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've given AT&AMP;T a road map on how to control cable systems  
serving 55 percent of consumers,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director 
of Consumers Union.

<HEADLINE> Death Spurs Town To Teach Tolerance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A banner hanging from the University of  
Wyoming Student Union billows gently in the fall breeze. Its 
message, set between green circles on a yellow background: 
``Remember Matthew Shepard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was just over a year ago that Shepard, a gay college  
freshman, was beaten and left to die on the freezing prairie. Since 
then, the town has kept Shepard in mind in its search for ways to 
foster greater tolerance of gays. 
</P>
<P>
	Public schools have changed their conflict-resolution classes to  
focus more on preventing bullying, and in particular harassment of 
homosexuals. At the University of Wyoming, where Shepard was 
studying political science, education students are learning how to 
teach tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our faculty were really appalled, had trouble  
believing it could happen here, and some went into denial,'' said 
Charles Head, superintendent of Laramie schools. ``But they 
recognized that it did happen here and we had to address that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged ringleader in the Oct. 7, 1998, attack on Shepard  
goes on trial for murder on Monday, which also happens to be 
National Coming Out Day and the beginning of Gay Awareness Week. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron McKinney, 22, could get the death penalty if convicted.  
His alleged accomplice, Russell Henderson, 22, pleaded guilty and 
is serving a life sentence for his role in the murder. He has been 
subpoenaed to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, 21, was lured from a bar -- allegedly because he was gay  
-- driven out of town, robbed of $20, tied to a fence, 
pistol-whipped into a coma and left to die. A bicyclist who found 
him nearly hidden in the sagebrush 18 hours later at first thought 
the slight, 5-foot-2 Shepard was a scarecrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Laramie's 26,000 residents felt the town was unfairly  
portrayed as a rural, homophobic outpost. But they were also 
troubled by the fact that McKinney and Henderson were homegrown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of doubt if sexual orientation was being addressed to  
any real degree prior to this tragedy, and I'm reasonably certain 
that it is being addressed as we speak,'' Head said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the university, President Philip Dubois asked trustees to  
make certain that every campus policy statement bans discrimination 
based on sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	The school also plans to raise $1.5 million to endow the Matthew  
Shepard Chair of Civil Liberties. A benefit concert by Elton John 
in June brought in $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on Shepard was one of six hate crimes in last year in  
Wyoming, which is nicknamed the Equality State. The others -- three 
against blacks, one against a person of Asian descent and one 
against a Jew -- were not fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's still basically underreported because it's  
undernoticed,'' said Wyoming Attorney General Gay Woodhouse. ``I 
don't know that officers still are in the mindset to ask the 
questions about whether or not this could be related to race or 
age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, she held a seminar last spring in which 70 law  
enforcement officers from around the state were shown how to 
recognize signs of hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Shepard attack, President Clinton called for improved  
national hate-crime legislation, and some places have expanded such 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wyoming's Legislature, however, seven hate-crime bills have  
failed. Opponents complained that gays and other protected groups 
would get special treatment and argued that existing laws are 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Shepard's murder led some gays to move away or become  
more fearful, others have felt freer to express their sexuality, 
said Joe Corrigan of Cheyenne, who founded United Gays and Lesbians 
of Wyoming in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely saw a lot of people coming farther out of the  
closet, becoming more active, saying, `I have laid low long enough 
-- I am not going to lay low any longer,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As McKinney goes on trial next week, the gay community will be  
watching closely. Prosecutors and McKinney's lawyers have declined 
to comment on their strategy, citing a gag order. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is that this particular murder has really struck a  
chord and deeply touched so many people -- gay and straight alike,'' 
said Cathy Renna, spokeswoman for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance 
Against Defamation. ``It seems like there's a desire just to know 
what happened and out of that, try to make some sense out of such a 
senseless tragedy.''

<HEADLINE> Mormon Fund Raising Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It's a natural fight: liberal San Francisco  
politicians versus the Mormon church in the debate over whether to 
recognize gay marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	City supervisors this week asked the IRS to investigate whether  
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is breaking federal 
law by drumming up support for a March 2000 ballot measure that 
would prevent the state from recognizing same-sex unions performed 
outside California. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS rules prohibit religious organizations from engaging in  
``substantial'' political activity without endangering their 
tax-exempt status -- a requirement that recently forced the 
Christian Coalition to split into two. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have a fair and honest debate,'' Supervisor Mark  
Leno said. ``We can't do that if large sums of tax deductible 
dollars have involved themselves in a political campaign and 
completely overrun the entire ballot process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nonsense,'' Michael Otterson, a spokesman for the Mormon  
church, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mormons are not the only religious group supporting the  
initiative, and the tax laws apply equally to all of them, Otterson 
said. He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS cannot comment on whether the agency agreed to  
investigate the Mormon church, said Larry Wright, an agency 
spokesman in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Many religious conservatives fear that if gay marriages are  
allowed in one state, others would have to recognize their 
validity. Twenty-nine states have banned gay marriage. By law, 
California only issues marriage licenses to heterosexual couples. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mormon church mounted similar campaigns last year in Hawaii  
and Alaska, helping pass measures banning gays and lesbians from 
marrying there. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, the Christian Coalition created a separate  
political action committee to endorse candidates and collect 
political contributions in an effort to keep tax-exempt status for 
its core ``voter education'' functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the IRS revoked the tax-exempt status of a  
church in New York state that ran newspaper ads against President 
Clinton in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In regards to the ballot initiative, three polls earlier this  
year showed more Californians would vote for the measure than 
against it. Gay rights advocates expect to spend $10 million in an 
uphill battle to urge Californians to change their minds.

<HEADLINE> Ford, UAW Get Back to Bargaining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Facing a midnight strike deadline, Ford Motor Co.  
and the United Auto Workers resumed negotiations this morning over 
a new contract for about 100,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargaining went back to work about 8 a.m. EDT, Ford spokesman Ed  
Miller said. He said late Thursday that the company was ``real 
optimistic'' a tentative deal could be reached before the union-set 
midnight deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very hopeful that we're going to reach a settlement,''  
Miller said. ``There aren't any issues we can't resolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW's setting of a deadline at Ford could signal trouble  
over Ford's plan to spin off or sell its parts unit, Visteon. UAW 
leaders have been vigorously opposed to a spinoff of Visteon, which 
has about 23,500 UAW members, saying it could lead to pay cuts, 
plant closures and fewer union jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Labor Day parade in Detroit, many marchers carried  
signs depicting Visteon as ``the alien within'' Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The disagreements are a change for Ford, which has emphasized  
its close relations with the union for several years. The last time 
the UAW held a national strike against the company was 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ford talks continued as workers at General Motors Corp. and  
its former parts unit voted on new contracts. The four-year deals 
provide raises of 3 percent a year, a $1,350 signing bonus and 
improvements in pensions and work rules. They also allow workers at 
Delphi Automotive Systems to transfer back to GM when openings 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW is expected to announce the results of the ratification  
votes early next week.

<HEADLINE> US Presses Japan on Auto Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unhappy with lagging sales of Americans cars  
and auto parts in Japan, the Clinton administration is pressuring 
Japan to move more aggressively to reduce regulations the United 
States blames for making the problem worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first seven months of this year, America's deficit  
with Japan just in autos and auto parts climbed to a record annual 
rate of $38 billion despite a 1995 trade agreement with Japan that 
was supposed to narrow the deficit by increasing U.S. sales in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries discussed the situation during talks Wednesday  
and Thursday in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. trade official told reporters Friday that the  
administration viewed the widening deficit as ``very troubling.'' 
The official spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	While both sides agreed Japan's weak economy was a factor in the  
growing trade gap, the U.S. official said the administration felt 
that now that Japan's economy was beginning to improve, the 
government needed to take ``concrete measures'' to reverse the 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is pushing Japan to adopt a number of  
deregulatory measures that it believes will spur sales of U.S. auto 
parts at repair shops by cutting government red tape. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released in June, the administration said sales of  
U.S.-made cars in Japan had dropped 35 percent in 1998 and exports 
of U.S.-made auto parts were down 7.4 percent, the first decline in 
parts sales since the 1995 agreement took effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 auto deal was negotiated for the administration by  
former U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. Agreement was 
achieved only after the United States threatened to ban sales of 
Japanese luxury cars in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the two countries fell to arguing over the details  
before the ink dried, with the Japanese maintaining they never 
promised to meet numerical targets for increased sales of autos and 
parts or for the expansion of dealerships in Japan carrying U.S. 
autos. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. side said there was no discussion at the Vancouver  
meeting over renewal of the 1995 agreement, which is due to expire 
at the end of next year.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in US Embassy Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man whose house was allegedly a bomb factory  
was arrested in connection with last year's deadly U.S. Embassy 
blasts in Kenya and Tanzania and was brought to the United States 
for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect -- Khalfan Khamis Mohamed -- was scheduled to appear  
before a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan at midday, according to 
a statement today by U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest arrest brought to nine the number of people in  
custody in connection with the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	White heads a team that is investigating and prosecuting the  
bombings which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, on Aug. 
7, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed, 24, allegedly rented a house in his native Tanzania  
which was used as a bomb factory. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cape Town, South Africa, police spokesman Capt. Rod Beer said  
the FBI arrested Mohamed at the city's airport in the early hours 
of Thursday morning as he was about to be deported for being in the 
country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cape Argus newspaper in Cape Town reported that a search has  
been launched for accomplices in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, had no comment.

<P>
	Seventeen people have been indicted in the case. Eight of them  
are in custody in the United States and one overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest remained fugitives, including Saudi radical Osama bin  
Laden. Bin Laden is accused of masterminding the attack, and is on 
the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List. A $5 million reward has been offered 
for his capture. 
</P>

	The bombs went off almost simultaneously. The victims in  
Nairobi, Kenya, numbered 213, including 12 Americans. Eleven

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Eyes Racial Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The acting head of the Justice Department's  
civil rights division called on a conference of lawyers Friday to 
help eradicate racial profiling by police departments and to 
support affirmative action in law school admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lann Lee decried the breakdown of trust between police and  
minority communities and traced much of it to the practice of 
racial profiling, the practice of stopping motorists solely on the 
basis of their race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a situation in this country with a black attorney  
telling his son who goes out at night not to be afraid of the 
gangbangers but to be afraid of the police,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grandmothers who used to call police when they saw  
something from their windows have stopped doing that. There's a 
drying-up of trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said the civil rights division is taking action in many  
states to obtain consent decrees from police departments willing to 
eliminate racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited New Jersey, where the state attorney general's office  
has acknowledged that state police use racial profiles in decisions 
to stop motorists for questioning. Currently, he said, a consent 
decree is being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said the use of race to identify motorists is not only wrong  
but ``it's not efficient law enforcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He praised the cities of San Diego and San Jose for initiating  
their own programs to eliminate racial profiling and said that the 
Justice Department has 25 cases under investigation while it is 
prosecuting 15 others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our enforcement program is as strong as it has ever been,''  
Lee said. ``But I can tell you everything we're doing is not 
enough. It takes efforts by you as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, the keynote speaker at an American Bar Association  
conference on race and ethnicity in the justice system, also 
focused on affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	Without consideration of race in law school admissions, he said,  
blacks and Hispanics would represent only 2 percent of those 
admitted and this would diminish the number of minority judges 
available to an increasingly diverse population. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is that affirmative action programs and diversity  
have an important place in our society,'' he said. ``Society has 
changed. Business opportunities are given to accommodate the real 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has held the post since December 1997. President Clinton  
used his recess appointment powers to put him in office on an 
acting basis after it became clear the Senate Judiciary Committee 
would not send his nomination forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics argued that his long association with the NAACP Legal  
Defense and Educational Fund and his support for affirmative action 
programs made him unfit for the post. Clinton renewed his push to 
get Lee confirmed earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Up, Grain Down on Forecast / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices fell and soybean futures  
prices were higher in trading Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, 
as the market reacted to the latest U.S. Agriculture Department 
crop production report. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices soared at the start of trading on news  
the USDA placed the 1999-2000 soybean crop at 2.9 billion bushels. 
That is 82 million bushels lower than the September estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures reached $5.06 a bushel, a three-month high, at  
one point in trading before falling back as profit-taking set in. 
Weighing on the market was concern about the soybean harvest, which 
is progressing briskly because of the ideal weather in the Midwest 
crop region. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices fell on the USDA data, released before the  
start of trading Friday, which placed the corn crop at 9.4 billion 
bushels, an 86 million bushel increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Also weighing on corn futures was the estimated size of China's  
corn crop. It was placed at 128 million metric tons, which could 
allow China to increase its corn exports at the expense of U.S. 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices fell after the USDA reported wheat stocks  
totaled 987 million bushels, an increase of 87 million bushels. 
World wheat stocks totaled 128.1 million metric tons, a nearly 4 
million metric ton increase from September. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was 4 cents lower at $2.54 3/4 a  
bushel; December corn was 4 3/4 cents lower at $1.98 1/2 a bushel; 
December oats were 1 cent lower at $1.08 3/4 a bushel; November 
soybeans were 2 1/4 cents higher at $4.91 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and hog futures prices were lower in trading on the  
Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle were .18 cent lower 69.82 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle were .22 cent lower at 82.80 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs were .45 cent lower at 45.30 a pound; February 
feeder cattle were .37 cent lower at 63.85 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Expected To Play Game 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- AL batting champion Nomar Garciaparra sat out  
Boston's workout Friday to rest his ailing wrist but was expected 
to play in Game 3 Saturday in an effort to save the Red Sox from 
elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, missing today's workout is no big deal,'' he said after  
his teammates took part in about an hour of light stretching and 
throwing at Fenway Park. ``I'll go out there tomorrow and see how 
it feels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said he had no doubt that  
Garciaparra would play Saturday, when the Indians could sweep the 
best-of-5 division series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until I hear anything different, that's my whole mental  
approach,'' Williams said. ``I think he feels that way, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, who led the league with a .357 average, bruised his  
right wrist on Sept. 25 when Baltimore's Al Reyes hit him with a 
pitch. It didn't hurt him in the playoff opener, won by Cleveland 
3-2. He went 2-for-3 with a homer and double and scored both runs. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an 11-1 loss in Game 2 on Thursday, Garciaparra was  
0-for-3 with a strikeout and two groundouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he talked to Garciaparra when he got to the  
ballpark Friday and told him there was no point in aggravating his 
condition during practice. In fact, Williams said he would have 
given the whole team the day off if it hadn't been required to be 
there for the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just took a precautionary approach,'' Williams said. ``It  
wouldn't have proven anything for him to work out today. ... It's 
been bothering him. So we just gave him the day off and we look 
forward to him having the opportunity to play tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Red Sox are to survive, they will need him. With first  
baseman Mike Stanley (5-for-7) and second baseman Jose Offerman 
(2-for-6), Garciaparra has been one of the few productive Red Sox 
hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he still had confidence in his hitters, and he  
attributed the problem to the fact that Cleveland's Game 1 starter, 
Bartolo Colon, throws 100 mph, and Game 2 starter Charles Nagy has 
been one of baseball's most consistent pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always feel like the guy with the ball in his hand has the  
advantage,'' Williams said. ``But we have good hitters in our 
lineup. We could break out just as easily as they did yesterday. We 
have that kind of team, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive slump has revived questions about Boston's  
decision to let former AL MVP Mo Vaughn leave as a free agent in 
the offseason. While he was with the Red Sox, Vaughn was their best 
hitter while also serving as a fiery leader who could rally his 
teammates from deficits like the one they now face. 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams dismissed the suggestion.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need a Speaker of the House,'' he said. ``We need  
baseball players. And that's what we've got here.''

	Clinton Asks To Delay Test Ban Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed to the Senate today  
to delay acting on the nuclear test ban treaty, saying a 
sure-to-fail vote would severely damage efforts to curb the spread 
of nuclear weapons. Clinton made one new concession to critics of 
the treaty -- he agreed the treaty vote could be put off beyond the 
2000 presidential election. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
said a vote on the treaty is still on track for next Tuesday or 
Wednesday but that he would listen to anything the president has to 
say.

	Arrest Made in US Embassy Bombings  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge today ordered Khalfan Khamis Mohamed,  
the latest suspect arrested in the attacks on two U.S. embassies in 
East Africa, held without bail under tight security. Mohamed was 
labeled a flight risk and a danger to the community. Mohamed's 
house allegedly was used as a bomb factory in the deadly attacks. 
He was arrested yesterday in South Africa and brought to the United 
States for trial. U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand told 
Mohamed's lawyer to quickly find experts in death penalty 
litigation in the event the government chooses a death penalty 
prosecution.

group headed by Osama bin Laden and removing Palestinian and 
Chilean groups, and Cambodia's Khmer Rouge. Al-Qaida, which the 
State Department says is headed by bin Laden, was added for its 
alleged role in plots to kill the pope and bomb U.S. airliners as 
well as the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

	$1.2B Award in State Farm Lawsuit  
</P>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- A damage award to State Farm auto insurance  
customers swelled to nearly $1.2 billion after a judge ruled that 
the nation's largest auto insurer committed fraud by its use of 
questionable auto-body repair parts. Today's $730 million award of 
actual and punitive damages came on top of a jury's $456 million 
verdict. The initial award was already believed to be the largest 
ever against an insurer. At issue is the use of ``aftermarket'' 
auto parts, which are modeled on those made by the manufacturer but 
made without access to factory specifications.

<HEADLINE> Chase Manhattan Moving N.Y. Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City's largest corporate employer,  
Chase Manhattan Corporation, is moving 10 percent of its jobs -- 
about 3,500 positions -- to Florida, Texas and Massachusetts, the 
company has told its workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next year, the company will move two entire ``back  
office'' units, from entry-level positions to senior managers, 
Chase spokesman Ken Herz said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	By relocating its workers, the bank will cut its costs  
significantly, Herz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he would not estimate the savings, Herz said they are so  
great that the city wouldn't have been able to match them. As a 
result, Chase didn't approach the city for financial or logistical 
help to keep the jobs in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaries, real estate costs, taxes, telecommunications charges  
and utilities costs are all lower in Tampa, Fla., and Dallas, where 
most of the jobs are to be moved, he said. Some jobs would also be 
moved to Lowell, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the businesses leaving New York transfers money for  
companies, and the other involves tracking and processing stock and 
bond trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine said the city was sorry to see the  
jobs go, but added that the company had promised to keep its 
headquarters in the city and would expand its other operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The substantial exodus of jobs from the city is indicative of a  
trend begun in the late 1980s, when many Wall Street firms moved 
their record-keeping and data processing jobs to New Jersey and 
Florida. Since then, technological advances and mergers have 
prompted banks to cut the number of employees in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988 Chase received $235 million from the city when it agreed  
to move many back office employees to Brooklyn rather than New 
Jersey. Some of the 6,000 Chase jobs in Brooklyn are to be moved, 
though Herz said Chase planned to relocate other business units to 
fill those spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	While Chase said it would offer to relocate many of the  
employees whose jobs are being moved, some may be reluctant to 
leave New York because of family or other reasons. Also, the 
unusually good chances of finding work in the city could keep some 
from moving, corporate consultants said. The city's unemployment 
rate is 6.9 percent, down from about 10 percent in early 1997.

<HEADLINE> NLRB Rules on Organizing Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Non-union employees working in so-called  
closed shops can be required to pay fees used for union organizing 
activities, a divided National Labor Relations Board has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unions are able to negotiate higher wages for the employees  
they represent when the employees of employers in the same 
competitive market are organized, and unions are less able to do so 
when they are not organized,'' said the board in a written opinion 
issued Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thus, represented employees, whether or not they are members  
of the union that represents them, benefit ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO has long pushed for such a change, said the labor  
federation's general counsel, Jon Hiatt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position has been that organizing does have a very direct  
relationship to collective bargaining and therefore it should 
properly be seen as a chargeable expenditure,'' said Hiatt. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a union has organized all the supermarkets in a given  
city they are going to be in a much better position to bargain good 
benefits and wages for their workers than if they only organized 
one supermarket in that city,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NLRB's 4-1 ruling came in a dispute over union fees charged  
to supermarket workers and meat cutters who withdrew from the 
United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which  
opposes compulsory union dues, said it will challenge the board's 
ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clinton NLRB has turned its back on America's working men  
and women, who will now be fired if they decline to finance big 
labor's empire building,'' said Stefan Gleason, vice president of 
the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of labor contracts require workers who choose not to  
join the unions representing them to pay fees similar to what union 
members pay in dues. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a 1988 ruling the Supreme Court said that unions may  
not use money from nonunion workers for any purposes other than 
collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1988 case, 20 employees of AT&AMP;T in Maryland sued the  
Communications Workers of America, contending they should have the 
right to withhold a portion of their non-member fees to avoid 
subsidizing union political goals they didn't agree with. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case before the NLRB, supermarket and meat processing  
workers in Michigan, Colorado and California who quit the food 
workers union in 1989 complained they continued to be charged 
non-member fees that helped pay for union organizing activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The NLRB, which acts as an out-of-court referee of  
labor-management disputes, ruled they should have to pay, saying 
recruiting new members indirectly bolsters a union's bargaining 
clout to the benefit of members and non-members alike. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Robert Brame III, a dissenting board member, said the  
majority's opinion contradicted past rulings in which the Supreme 
Court has even more specifically addressed this question.

<HEADLINE> Nature Cuts Soybean, Cotton Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The one-two punch of drought and then  
Hurricane Floyd has taken its toll on the nation's soybean and 
cotton crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department today lowered its forecast of this  
year's cotton crop by 6 percent from last month to 16.4 million 
bales, and reduced its estimate for soybeans by 3 percent to 2.7 
billion bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, which experienced severe flooding in Floyd's  
wake, lost significant amounts of both soybeans and cotton in 
addition to 30,000 acres of corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee also lost soybean production  
because of the drought, and cotton crops are down in Missouri, 
Tennessee and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA said it expects soybean prices to be 20 cents a bushel  
higher than previously thought this year, reaching an average of $5 
a bushel, because of the decline in production. The government is 
not allowed to estimate cotton prices. 
</P>
<P>
	However, supplies of corn and wheat continue to grow, meaning  
there is little hope for farmers that prices for those commodities 
will rebound anytime soon. USDA lowered its price estimate for corn 
by 10 cents a bushel and 5 cents for wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we've still got big production in the United States,  
big production around the world, and you're going to have to see 
some change in weather or in the farm program to reduce supply,'' 
said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities Inc. of West Des 
Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is expected to finish work next week on a $8.7 billion  
bailout of the farm economy, the second such package in as many 
years, and additional aid is likely to be necessary in 2000, said 
Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress will be right back in the same set of problems next  
year trying to put together some emergency package,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA increased its forecast of this year's corn crop by 1  
percent although the acreage that is being harvested has been 
reduced because of the flooding in North Carolina. Nationally, corn 
yields are slightly better than previously expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought started in the East and spread across portions of  
the Midwest and down across much of the South. It actually turned 
out to be a boon for some growers in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is expected to harvest 1.2 million pounds of apples  
this year, up 160,000 pounds from last year, because the drought 
reduced insect and disease problems and then September rains came 
in time to increase the size of the fruit. Production also is up in 
Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is a distant second in apple production to Washington,  
whose production is down sharply this year because of a cool, wet 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern grape crops also are better this year because of the dry  
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, USDA says this year's orange crop will hit 12.1  
million tons, up 22 percent from last year when a freeze badly 
damaged California's production.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Deploy 10 More Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will equip a second regiment of its  
strategic missile forces with the new Topol-M ballistic missile 
before the end of the year, a top military official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Defense Minister Col. Gen. Alexander Kosovan said 10 of  
the missiles will be deployed in late December, the Interfax news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The government says the recently developed Topol-M will form the  
backbone of its nuclear forces for years to come. The small, rugged 
missile can be fired from a mobile launch pad, which means they 
would be hard to detect and therefore more likely to survive a 
first strike in a nuclear confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia already has 10 Topol-M missiles in service. Those were  
deployed last December.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Prices Plummet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil prices plummeted Friday, capping a 16 percent slide  
this week on futures markets, as President Clinton said he is 
considering selling oil from strategic reserves and as a perception 
grew that OPEC members are starting to exceed production limits. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC's ability to stick to its quotas had helped lift crude oil  
futures to a 33-month high of $25.12 last week on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, more than doubling from February's low of 
$11.26. But with a drop of $1.55 Friday, light, sweet crude for 
November delivery closed at $20.90 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, the release of U.S. Agriculture Department's  
crop production report pushed grain futures prices lower and 
soybean futures prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	A lack of confidence in the ability of members of the  
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain their 
production-reduction agreement caused another day of losses for 
crude oil futures, sending prices to a two-month low. 
</P>
<P>
	Various surveys estimate that September oil output ranged from  
26.17 million barrels a day to 26.41 million barrels a day, 
according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC has a daily production target, excluding Iraq, of 22.97  
million barrels a day. OPEC nations produced 23.5 million barrels a 
day, with Iraq adding 2.7 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports that Iraq may be making another diplomatic effort to  
ease sanctions imposed after the Persian Gulf War also caused a 
ripple in the market, according to analyst Bill O'Grady of AG 
Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Grady noted that technical factors fueled Friday's selloff as  
oil fell below price levels viewed as important signposts. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the selloff were remarks Clinton in Ottawa during a  
joint news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien 
that the president is considering selling oil from the U.S. 
strategic petroleum reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should look at the reserves, and the question of  
whether, if we released some oil from it for sale, if we could 
moderate the price some,'' Clinton said. He said no decision had 
been reached yet ``because I haven't been given a recommendation 
yet about whether we could have any appreciable impact on the 
Americans that are most disproportionately affected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., last month sent a letter  
to the White House and the Department of Energy asking them to sell 
the oil to blunt the effect of OPEC's cutback in production. 
</P>
<P>
	However, O'Grady noted that with the market retreating, it would  
be unwise to tap into petroleum reserves at current price levels. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the drop in crude, November heating oil tumbled  
3.74 cents Friday to close at 53.72 cents a gallon on the Nymex; 
November unleaded gasoline was 3.61 cents lower at 59.15 cents a 
gallon and November natural gas was 5 cents higher at $2.692 per 
1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	North Sea Brent crude oil plunged $1.38 to close at $20.70 a  
barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain futures prices fell and soybean futures prices were higher  
on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices soared at the start of trading on news  
the USDA placed the 1999-2000 soybean crop at 2.9 billion bushels. 
That is 82 million bushels lower than the September estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures reached $5.06 a bushel, a three-month high, at  
one point in trading before falling back as profit-taking set in. 
Weighing on the market was concern about the soybean harvest, which 
is progressing briskly because of the ideal weather in the Midwest 
crop region. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices fell on the USDA data, released before the  
start of trading Friday, which placed the corn crop at 9.4 billion 
bushels, an 86 million bushel increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Also weighing on corn futures was the estimated size of China's  
corn crop. It was placed at 128 million metric tons, which could 
allow China to increase its corn exports at the expense of U.S. 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices fell after the USDA reported wheat stocks  
totaled 987 million bushels, an increase of 87 million bushels. 
World wheat stocks totaled 128.1 million metric tons, a nearly 4 
million metric ton increase from September. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was 4 cents lower at $2.54 3/4 a  
bushel; December corn was 4 3/4 cents lower at $1.98 1/2 a bushel; 
December oats were 1 cent lower at $1.08 3/4 a bushel; November 
soybeans were 2 1/4 cents higher at $4.91 1/2 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Pianist Talks About NYC Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's all about form for concert pianist Maurizio  
Pollini. 
</P>
<P>
	The famed 57-year-old Italian pianist, often praised for his  
elegant playing, was at Weill Recital Hall Tuesday night to talk 
about ``Perspectives: Maurizio Pollini,'' his concert series at 
Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The pieces, many of which will be performed by Pollini, are  
dedicated to composers of the last half of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many groundbreaking masterpieces that used musical forms  
of the past, composers from the 14th century onwards based their 
music on new forms, Pollini said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pianist will play Beethoven, Schoenberg and Stockhausen at  
the first Perspectives concert this Sunday.

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Young To Sit Out Rams Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young, still bothered by  
post-concussion symptoms, won't play Sunday at St. Louis and Jeff 
Garcia will make his second straight start at quarterback for the 
San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to sit him down,'' coach Steve Mariucci said  
Friday after the team's final practice before leaving for St. 
Louis. ``Let's rest him. I think it's the appropriate thing to do. 
Hopefully, he'll feel great next week. I visited with Steve before 
practice and we both agreed that's the right plan right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young will be among the 49ers' inactive players on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, who led the 49ers to a 24-22 win over Tennessee while  
making his first NFL start last week, will be backed up by Steve 
Stenstrom. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Barnes was re-signed by the 49ers on Friday to serve as the  
emergency quarterback. Barnes was also with the team last week 
before being released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Young sustained his third concussion in four years two weeks ago  
when blitzing cornerback Aeneas Williams leveled him during San 
Francisco's 24-10 win at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time league MVP was out for several moments and he  
admitted Wednesday that he still was feeling the after-effects of 
the blow, including periodic headaches, grogginess and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Young did take part in some limited work at practices this week  
but it became increasingly apparent he needed more time to heal, 
even to Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't get the work done that I needed to get done but  
it's getting better every day,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Young canceled a scheduled appointment Friday with his  
neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg of the Stanford Medical School. He 
said he will now see Stienberg on Monday and he remains optimistic 
that he'll be able to return for the Oct. 17 home game against 
Carolina.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea's Economy Expected To Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea's economy has stopped  
shrinking and is expected to grow slightly in 1999 for the first 
time in 10 years, a South Korean government report said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the growth this year may be short-lived, because it depends  
heavily on outside food and fertilizer aid, which in turn helped 
increase agricultural production, said the report by the 
Unification Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential of the North's economy has been significantly  
weakened because of years of contraction,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea rarely releases economic figures but has admitted  
its economy is in trouble. South Korea compiles annual estimates on 
North Korea's economy with data obtained from the North's trading 
partners and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report earlier this year, South Korea's central bank  
estimated that the North's economy contracted by 1.1 percent in 
1998. That contraction was smaller than the 6.8 percent drop 
recorded in 1997, 3.7 percent in 1996 and 4.6 percent in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea's economy began shrinking in 1990 when the country  
lost most of its former trade partners with the collapse of 
communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It has been 
largely dependent on outside aid to feed its people since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the reclusive communist state have reported  
witnessing numerous signs of a ruined economy. Most factories 
remain idle. A large number of North Koreans have reportedly died 
of starvation. 
</P>
<P>
	But North Korean officials now publicly claim that their economy  
has rebounded. In an interview with Chinese media last summer, 
North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun said 6,000 factories 
have resumed operation after years of shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Korean Unification Ministry's report said the  
turnaround of the North Korean economy is mainly due to increased 
agricultural production and construction activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. World Food Program reported in June that North Korea's  
fall harvest this year was expected to increase by 8.6 percent, but 
the country will still be short of food. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to say that the North's economy has entered a  
stage of full recovery. Continued outside aid is necessary for 
sustained growth,'' the report said.

<HEADLINE> State Farm Damages Swell to $1.2B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- A damage award to State Farm auto insurance  
customers swelled to nearly $1.2 billion Friday after a judge ruled 
that the nation's largest auto insurer committed fraud by its use 
of generic replacement parts in auto-body repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's $730 million award of actual and punitive damages came  
on top of a jury's $456 million verdict Monday in the same 
class-action lawsuit. The initial award was already believed to be 
the largest ever against an insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the use of ``aftermarket'' auto parts -- modeled on  
those made by the manufacturer but made without access to factory 
specifications -- to repair the cars of State Farm policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say aftermarket parts are not as good as those made for  
automakers. The lawsuit accused State Farm executives of concealing 
that information while flooding customers with brochures promoting 
the parts as a high-quality, low-cost alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury's award to 4.7 million State Farm policyholders was  
based on a claim that the insurer breached its contract with 
customers by failing to restore their cars to their pre-accident 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Judge John Speroni of Williamson County Circuit Court  
ruled separately that State Farm violated Illinois consumer fraud 
law by using substandard parts and concealing that fact from 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Current and former policyholders who could have claims against  
the company would get an average of $100 each under the 
breach-of-contract judgment. It was unclear how many plaintiffs are 
affected by the consumer fraud judgment, or what their average 
share would be. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm chairman and CEO Edward B. Rust Jr. promised an  
appeal of both verdicts and said the company was ``astonished'' by 
Friday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Rust said the consumer-fraud finding was particularly troubling,  
declaring that State Farm abides by regulations on use of 
aftermarket parts in every state where it does business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's been decided that by abiding by those regulations we  
have violated the law,'' he said at a news conference at the 
company's headquarters in Bloomington. ``That just doesn't make 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The award approved by Speroni is $130 million in actual damages  
and $600 million in punitive damages. The plaintiffs had sought 
nearly $4 billion in actual and punitive damages, but their 
attorneys said they were satisfied with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we have State Farm's attention,'' said Trish  
Littleton, an attorney for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts said the verdicts could increase insurance  
premiums and the cost of auto-body repairs if allowed to stand. The 
insurance industry offered scathing criticism of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is not a good day for anybody but a handful of  
plaintiff lawyers and major stockholders in the three major car 
companies,'' said Kirk Hansen, director of claims for the Alliance 
of American Insurers, a trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said State Farm violated its trust with policyholders  
by deliberately adopting a ``misleading term'' -- ``quality 
replacement parts'' -- to refer to aftermarket parts. 
</P>
<P>
	But he declined to issue an injunction sought by the plaintiffs  
to order State Farm to better notify customers of the use of 
aftermarket parts, saying they could bring a lawsuit if the company 
continues to violate the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the plaintiffs' case against State Farm centered on  
internal memos questioning the parts' quality. 
</P>
<P>
	According to materials provided to State Farm policyholders,  
aftermarket parts used by the company are certified by an 
independent testing agency, meet high quality standards and meet 
the company's contractual obligation to restore a car to its 
pre-accident condition using parts of ``like kind and quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in a 1997 memo introduced as evidence, a State Farm  
executive wrote, ``We may well say it is like kind and quality, but 
the bottom line is that it is not the same.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Give La Russa 2-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Manager Tony La Russa signed a two-year  
contract extension through the 2001 season today with the St. Louis 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa joined the Cardinals in 1996, and has posted a 319-328  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased to announce that Tony will remain the  
Cardinals' manager into the next century,'' general manager Walt 
Jocketty said. ``I know that Tony wants nothing more than to reward 
the Cardinals' fans for their unmatched support which has led to 
record attendance totals each of the past two seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, La Russa became the 11th winningest manager of all  
time. He leads all active major league managers with 1,639 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals finished 11 games below .500 this year at 75-86,  
in fourth place in the NL Central and 21 1/2 games behind first-place 
Houston, despite a major league-leading 65 home runs by Mark 
McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost starting pitcher Matt Morris during spring training  
with an arm injury and another starter, Donovan Osborne, early in 
the season. Outfielder Eric Davis was lost for the season with an 
injury while making a diving catch to preserve rookie Jose 
Jiminez's no-hitter June 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's last appearance in the postseason came in La Russa's  
first year in St. Louis. The Cardinals lost the 1996 NL 
Championship Series to Atlanta in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Tony) won't be satisfied until he can get the Cardinals back  
to the postseason,'' Jocketty said.

<HEADLINE> UAW, Ford talk As Deadline Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- With a battle line drawn, the United Auto  
Workers continued negotiations Friday with Ford Motor Co. as a 
midnight strike deadline approached. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word on any progress shortly before 10:30 p.m.,  
when the two sides still were bargaining 90 minutes before the 
union-set deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hopeful we can reach a settlement by the deadline,''  
Ford spokesman Nick Sharkey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ford and the UAW have worked long hours this week trying to  
reach an agreement on a new contract for about 100,000 hourly 
workers. But there has been no round-the-clock bargaining yet -- a 
traditional sign a deal is close. 
</P>
<P>
	President Stephen P. Yokich told union members in a taped  
message earlier this week that Ford was being ``stubborn'' about 
accepting contracts agreed to by General Motors Corp. and 
DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	During negotiations in 1993 and 1996, the UAW found Ford's  
proposal best and settled with it first -- setting the pattern for 
the other two companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to work and maybe before the company can  
really make a big mistake, they'll understand that they're not 
first this time, but third,'' Yokich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW and Ford have enjoyed good relations for about 20 years,  
avoiding strikes like the one in Flint last year that shut down 
much of General Motors' production. Thanks in part to bulked-up 
production at Ford's truck and sport utility vehicle plants, the 
company made $6.6 billion in 1998; the average worker's profit 
sharing payment was $6,100. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, UAW officials have said they were opposed to  
Ford's plans to spin off or sell its parts unit, which employs 
23,500 UAW workers. Union leaders have said a separate Visteon 
Automotive Systems could cut pay and jobs, even close plants to 
compete against other parts companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-year contracts negotiated with DaimlerChrysler, GM and  
GM's former parts operations included promises from the companies 
that they would not spin off, sell or close any division or factory 
-- a clause that could be causing problems for Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts also included 3 percent raises each year, a $1,350  
signing bonus and improved pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the UAW also negotiated some terms with GM and Delphi  
Automotive Systems that experts say could apply to Ford and 
Visteon. The contract for Delphi workers mirrors GM's deal; it also 
allows Delphi employees to transfer back to GM and retire by Jan. 1 
with a GM pension. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Delphi workers are expected to complete voting on the new  
contract by next week.

<HEADLINE> Chase Manhattan Moving N.Y. Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City's largest corporate employer,  
Chase Manhattan Corporation, is moving 10 percent of its jobs -- 
about 3,500 positions -- to Florida, Texas and Massachusetts, the 
company has told its workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next year, the company will move two entire ``back  
office'' units, from entry-level positions to senior managers, 
Chase spokesman Ken Herz said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	By relocating its workers, the bank will cut its costs  
significantly, Herz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he would not estimate the savings, Herz said they are so  
great that the city wouldn't have been able to match them. As a 
result, Chase didn't approach the city for financial or logistical 
help to keep the jobs in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaries, real estate costs, taxes, telecommunications charges  
and utilities costs are all lower in Tampa, Fla., and Dallas, where 
most of the jobs are to be moved, he said. Some jobs would also be 
moved to Lowell, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the businesses leaving New York transfers money for  
companies, and the other involves tracking and processing stock and 
bond trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine said the city was sorry to see the  
jobs go, but added that the company had promised to keep its 
headquarters in the city and would expand its other operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The substantial exodus of jobs from the city is indicative of a  
trend begun in the late 1980s, when many Wall Street firms moved 
their record-keeping and data processing jobs to New Jersey and 
Florida. Since then, technological advances and mergers have 
prompted banks to cut the number of employees in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988 Chase received $235 million from the city when it agreed  
to move many back office employees to Brooklyn rather than New 
Jersey. Some of the 6,000 Chase jobs in Brooklyn are to be moved, 
though Herz said Chase planned to relocate other business units to 
fill those spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	While Chase said it would offer to relocate many of the  
employees whose jobs are being moved, some may be reluctant to 
leave New York because of family or other reasons. Also, the 
unusually good chances of finding work in the city could keep some 
from moving, corporate consultants said. The city's unemployment 
rate is 6.9 percent, down from about 10 percent in early 1997.

<HEADLINE> Kramer To Start at QB for Chargers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Chargers' feeble offense is in  
the hands of Erik Kramer, at least for one game. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer will start at quarterback in place of injured Jim  
Harbaugh in Sunday's road game against the Detroit Lions, coach 
Mike Riley said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh suffered two cracked ribs and a bruised throwing elbow  
in the first quarter of last Sunday's 21-14 win over the Kansas 
City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer came in and threw two touchdown passes, but the defense  
saved the victory by intercepting Elvis Grbac four times, two of 
them setting up scores. San Diego gained only 132 yards and is 
ranked 29th in offense in the 31-team NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only will the Chargers be facing one of their former  
coaches, Bobby Ross, but Kramer will be facing the team he was with 
from 1990-93. The Chargers and Lions are both 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh is capable of playing but Riley would prefer that he  
spend the time mending. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no sense playing Jim if he's not 100 percent,'' Riley  
said. ``We have faith in Erik. I think it's a great situation for 
us, having a guy like Erik Kramer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers are looking pretty smart for signing Kramer the  
night before training camp started, two days after his sudden 
release from the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh has had a history of injuries and Ryan Leaf, benched  
midway through last year, aggravated a shoulder injury 20 minutes 
into the first training camp practice and had surgery. He won't be 
ready to play until late October. Even the emergency quarterback, 
wide receiver Mikhael Ricks, will probably miss this game with a 
neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always happy to get on the field,'' said Kramer, who  
missed the last half of 1998 after undergoing surgery on his left 
knee and right shoulder. His last start was Oct. 25 at Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long road,'' said Kramer, who admitted in training  
camp that he was still rusty from the shoulder surgery. ``I'm just 
excited to have an opportunity to be on a team with a chance to 
play. I've come back healthy. It took a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's up to him to do something with the offense. The  
Chargers' running game has been bottled up because the team can't 
pass. Last week, Kramer's 11-yard TD pass to Chris Penn -- one of 
several former Bears with the Chargers -- was the only completion to 
a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could double that, we'd be in a groove,'' Riley joked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think our running game is there, but it's not very good  
right now because we can't do anything else,'' Riley said. ``We try 
to run, we get 2.3 yards. If we were throwing the ball and had some 
balance going, had a tempo going, we'd be running the ball OK. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we have to be consistent with it, scare people a little  
bit. Otherwise, it's all like pulling teeth. It's all really 
hard.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Pushing for START II Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia wants to move ahead on ratification of the  
START II nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States, but 
remains reluctant to revise an agreement on missile defense, 
President Boris Yeltsin said in a letter Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter to Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Yeltsin  
said Russia was making ``considerable efforts'' for the prompt 
ratification of START II, which has been stalled in the Russian 
parliament, according to presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin. 
</P>
<P>
	START II, ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, would halve the  
U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to between 3,000 warheads and 
3,500 warheads each. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kremlin has urged parliament's lower house to consider START  
II as a priority, but Communists and other hard-liners say the 
treaty endangers Russia's security. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin told Obuchi that the Russian government also was eager  
to negotiate on deeper cuts under a proposed START III treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Russia is still opposed to modifying the 1972  
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which bans the construction of a 
system to defend against ballistic missile attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin agreed to discuss ABM modifications sought by the United  
States, but still has not indicated that Russia will consent to any 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has said any changes could start a new arms race, while  
Washington claims a national missile defense system would be 
designed to shoot down a few missiles launched by a rogue nation. 
It argues the system would not work against the kind of massive 
attack that Russia is capable of launching. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian leader also praised Russian-Japanese relations,  
particularly in trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian-Japanese relations have improved in the last few years,  
but are still soured by a dispute over the Kuril Islands. Russia 
seized the Kurils from Japan at the end of World War II, but both 
countries still claim the islands.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in US Embassy Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Another man has been arrested in  
connection with the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania last year that killed 224 people, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can confirm that an individual was arrested in connection  
with the embassy bombings and the FBI was involved'' in making the 
arrest, police spokesman Capt. Rod Beer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beer said he did not know where the man was being held or any  
more details. The arrest brought to nine the number of people in 
custody in connection with the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities scheduled a news conference for later today in  
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cape Argus newspaper reported today that a Tanzanian man was  
arrested, and that authorities were searching for accomplices. The 
Argus quoted immigration official Jurie de Wet as saying the 
arrests stemmed from information about requests for asylum and 
temporary residence in Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen people have been indicted in the case. Eight of those  
are in custody, but the rest remained fugitives, including Saudi 
radical Osama bin Laden. It was not immediately known if the arrest 
announced today stemmed from the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden, who is accused of masterminding the attack, is on the  
FBI's 10 Most Wanted List. A $5 million reward has been offered for 
his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombs went off almost simultaneously on Aug. 7, 1998 at U.S.  
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Senate Taking Up Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is plunging into debate on a  
vote-short treaty calling for a global ban on nuclear testing, 
ignoring a last-minute plea from the Clinton administration for a 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a national security tragedy if the world's  
greatest deliberative body killed a treaty that our nation has 
sought for 40 years by failing properly to deliberate on and 
appreciate its merits,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite her blunt words, delivered Thursday to the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, and an appeal by President Clinton to 
``do what's right for America,'' the Senate was poised to begin two 
days of debate on the pact today. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Democrats and some Republicans continued to press for a  
delay. 
</P>
<P>
	But Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., indicated a final vote  
was still planned on the treaty as early as Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on track to start debate,'' Lott spokesman John  
Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty needs 67 votes to be ratified, or a two-thirds  
majority, if all 100 senators vote. But it has generated scant 
Republican support and even supporters concede they could be 15-20 
votes short. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Republicans who often side with the administration  
on international matters have joined in opposing the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The treaty is flawed with an ineffective verification regime  
and a practically nonexistent enforcement process,'' said Sen. Dick 
Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee 
and former vice chairman of the Senate Arms Control Observer Group. 
</P>
<P>
	In an article published today in The New York Times, French  
President Jacques Chirac, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and 
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder urged the Senate to approve the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decisions we take now will help determine, for generations  
to come, the safety of the world we bequeath to our children,'' 
they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to ratify the treaty, the three leaders warned, ``will  
be a failure in our struggle against proliferation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, in her Senate testimony, noted that presidents have  
been seeking some form of a nuclear test ban since President 
Eisenhower in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	She said ``the leadership ought to find a way to give the treaty  
the careful consideration it deserves at a later date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,  
said if Clinton wants to call off the vote, he must request the 
treaty be withdrawn from consideration until after next year's 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has languished before the Senate for two years. But  
the Foreign Relations Committee held its first hearing on the pact 
just Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rush to a vote, orchestrated by Lott and Helms, angered  
Senate Democrats. And it put them in the awkward position of now 
seeking a delay on the treaty they have long advocated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anyone in this chamber seriously believe we can give the  
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty the consideration it deserves in the 
amount of time that has been set aside to debate it?'' said Sen. 
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, Clinton invoked ``moral responsibility'' in  
seeking to reverse the tide running against the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``future generations won't forgive us if we fail that  
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was not trying to ``beat up'' Republican  
opponents but was asking that ``we do what is in the national 
interest. Let's just do what's right for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate votes on and rejects the treaty next week, it  
would be the first time an arms control pact was turned down on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	However, President Carter withdrew an arms reduction treaty --  
SALT I -- from the Senate in 1980 after the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan made the treaty's rejection likely.

<HEADLINE> Chase Manhattan Moving N.Y. Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City's largest corporate employer,  
Chase Manhattan Corporation, is moving 10 percent of its jobs -- 
about 3,500 positions -- to Florida, Texas and Massachusetts, the 
company has told its workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next year, the company will move two entire ``back  
office'' units, from entry-level positions to senior managers, 
Chase spokesman Ken Herz said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	By relocating its workers, the bank will cut its costs  
significantly, Herz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he would not estimate the savings, Herz said they are so  
great that the city wouldn't have been able to match them. As a 
result, Chase didn't approach the city for financial or logistical 
help to keep the jobs in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaries, real estate costs, taxes, telecommunications charges  
and utilities costs are all lower in Tampa, Fla., and Dallas, where 
most of the jobs are to be moved, he said. Some jobs would also be 
moved to Lowell, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the businesses leaving New York transfers money for  
companies, and the other involves tracking and processing stock and 
bond trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine said the city was sorry to see the  
jobs go, but added that the company had promised to keep its 
headquarters in the city and would expand its other operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The substantial exodus of jobs from the city is indicative of a  
trend begun in the late 1980s, when many Wall Street firms moved 
their record-keeping and data processing jobs to New Jersey and 
Florida. Since then, technological advances and mergers have 
prompted banks to cut the number of employees in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988 Chase received $235 million from the city when it agreed  
to move many back office employees to Brooklyn rather than New 
Jersey. Some of the 6,000 Chase jobs in Brooklyn are to be moved, 
though Herz said Chase planned to relocate other business units to 
fill those spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	While Chase said it would offer to relocate many of the  
employees whose jobs are being moved, some may be reluctant to 
leave New York because of family or other reasons. Also, the 
unusually good chances of finding work in the city could keep some 
from moving, corporate consultants said. The city's unemployment 
rate is 6.9 percent, down from about 10 percent in early 1997.

<HEADLINE> Agreement Reached on Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans agreed to give President  
Clinton billions of dollars more for housing, space and 
environmental programs as the two sides resolved one of their many 
spending battles. 
</P>
<P>
	After two days of behind-the-scenes negotiating that included  
White House budget chief Jack Lew, House-Senate bargainers shook 
hands on the fiscal 2000 spending bill Thursday night. Its price 
tag is expected to surpass $97 billion, and it includes $2.5 
billion for victims of Hurricane Floyd and other disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	With only four of the 13 annual spending bills signed into law  
so far, the deal still leaves major disputes -- and veto threats -- 
hanging over many of the measures. Fiscal 2000 began last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The housing-veterans bill was one of those Clinton had  
threatened to veto, but lawmakers from both parties said it would 
easily pass Congress and get the president's signature. Because the 
final package exceeded the House version of the bill by at least $5 
billion, Democrats were declaring victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a miracle,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, senior  
Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased,'' said Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White  
House budget office. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were claiming victory, too, because the extra  
spending was paid for with items that will count as savings. 
</P>
<P>
	These included delaying $4.2 billion in housing spending until  
fiscal 2001; declaring the $2.5 billion in disaster aid a budget 
``emergency'' that does not count against spending limits; and 
using more than $900 million in unused housing funds that 
administration officials said they found. 
</P>
<P>
	``It follows our plan in making sure it doesn't spend a dime of  
the Social Security surplus and we stay within the balanced 
budget,'' said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The House originally cut $900 million from Clinton's $13.6  
billion request for NASA. The agreement provides $13.7 billion, and 
adds $45 million to his $3.9 billion proposal for the National 
Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would provide $19 billion for veterans' health care,  
$1.7 billion more than Clinton sought. 
</P>
<P>
	It also contains $344 million for 60,000 new rental housing  
vouchers for low-income families. Clinton wanted 100,000 vouchers 
and the House had provided none. 
</P>
<P>
	And the bill continues until next Sept. 1 a controversial  
``Community Builders'' program in HUD that separated its service 
and enforcement functions. Republicans had sought to kill the 
program, complaining, along with the agency's own inspector 
general, that it was wasteful and too politicized. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also adds hundreds of millions of dollars to  
House-approved levels for environmental programs; reverses House 
votes to eliminate the Selective Service and the national service 
Americorps program; and restores money cut from community 
development and other Clinton initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	In a slap at Vice President Al Gore, Republicans won language  
delaying the launch of the Triana satellite until January 2001, 
just as he leaves office, and requiring that the National Academy 
of Science verify the scientific validity of the project. The 
satellite is designed to send live pictures of the Earth back home 
for Internet viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Senate approved, 73-24, a $324 billion measure  
financing labor, health and education programs. It is among nine of 
13 annual spending bills for fiscal 2000 yet to be signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Clinton renewed his promise to veto the bill  
because it ``woefully shortchanges America's children'' and would 
provide less than he wanted for public health and other social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is a catalog of missed opportunities and misguided  
priorities,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Gives Bombing Figure 12 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Going well above sentencing guidelines, a  
federal judge resentenced Michael Fortier to 12 years in prison 
today for failing to notify authorities about plans for the 
Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier has already served a little more than four years in  
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Van Bebber issued his ruling after  
hearing arguments from defense attorneys, prosecutors and a law 
professor representing victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the resentencing  
because it said Van Bebber used wrong guidelines when he sentenced 
Fortier last year to 12 years in prison and a $200,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Van Bebber should have used guidelines for  
involuntary manslaughter instead of first-degree murder. The 
manslaughter guidelines call for 51 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of today's hearing, Van Bebber told Fortier he was  
contemplating a harsher sentence than the manslaughter guidelines 
call for.

<HEADLINE> Woman To Testify in Gingrich Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A judge ruled Thursday that a congressional aide  
linked romantically with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich must 
testify in his divorce case. 
</P>
<P>
	Callista Bisek had tried to block the subpoena that called for  
her to be deposed by lawyers for Gingrich's wife, Marianne. 
District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge found her 
arguments ``without merit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bisek argued that her constitutional right to privacy would  
be violated by allowing Mrs. Gingrich's attorneys ``to rummage 
through every aspect'' of her personal life. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bisek also said she should not be required to testify about  
her relationship with Gingrich under the constitutional prohibition 
against self-incrimination, since adultery is a crime in the 
District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, 56, separated from his wife of 18 years in May and  
filed for divorce in July. Since then, lawyers for Mrs. Gingrich 
have attempted to probe his finances, business dealings and his 
relationship with Ms. Bisek. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the former Speaker released a temporary financial  
agreement he and his wife signed last month that pays each about 
$10,000 a month. The agreement gives Mrs. Gingrich the couple's 
house in Marietta, Ga., and Gingrich their Washington apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial agreement was submitted as part of a motion  
Gingrich filed a day earlier asking a judge to force his wife to 
turn over money he says she's hoarding.

<HEADLINE> Dole Endorsed by Phoenix Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, the latest Republican  
presidential candidate to ignore Arizona Sen. John McCain's claim 
on his home state, won the endorsement of Phoenix's mayor Friday 
and declared no interest on being on anyone else's ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't even talk to me about No. 2,'' Dole said. ``I'm running  
for president and I'm in it to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza said he is backing Dole because he  
respects her integrity and her accomplishments when she was labor 
secretary, transportation secretary and president of the American 
Red Cross. He is to lead Dole's Arizona campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know many of the candidates and my candidate is Elizabeth  
Dole,'' Rimsza said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's husband has been calling supporters of Texas Gov. George  
W. Bush and asking them to help her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who have talked to former Sen. Bob Dole say they have been  
asked whether Bush would view her candidacy as hostile if she 
continued into the primary season -- a statement interpreted by some 
Bush backers as a veiled inquiry into her viability as a vice 
presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush supporters, with the knowledge of the governor's  
presidential campaign, have told the former senator that Bush would 
not be troubled by her campaign's continuing through Iowa and New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no evidence that the ex-senator was discussing a  
possible exit from the campaign, but some Dole advisers believe his 
calls may have prompted the rash of speculation over the past week 
that she was leaving the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole herself asserted, ``We're in the race, we're running  
hard,'' after a $200-a-person fund-raising event. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole noted Arizona's election of five women to statewide office,  
including governor. ``Certainly with the history of the 'Fab Five' 
we're going to continue to make history,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An associate close to Bob Dole characterized the phone calls as  
that of a longtime Republican reaching out to his vast network of 
friends in the party to ask them to give money to his wife's 
campaign. The associate spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's Arizona visit Friday was her fourth. She is one of three  
out-of-state Republican hopefuls to make high-profile stops in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Publishing mogul Steve Forbes, who won the Arizona primary in  
1996, campaigned in Tucson, Mesa and Phoenix last month. Bush 
picked up the endorsement of Arizona Gov. Jane Hull during his 
recent visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona State University pollster Bruce Merrill said McCain may  
not have to worry about challenges from Dole and Forbes in the 
campaign for the state's Feb. 22 primary, but that he is vulnerable 
to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he comes in and wins, it really is putting a silver stake  
in McCain's heart,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican consultant Ed Mahe said the candidates may be trying  
to weaken McCain by forcing him to spend money at home. At the same 
time, they want to be in a position to pick up the state if he 
falters. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he welcomes the challengers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident we'll have our vote out,'' he said. ``We'll do  
just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad George W. is going to spend millions in Arizona. It's  
wonderful for our economy.''

<HEADLINE> Leafs Sign Yushkevich, Trade Cote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Maple Leafs signed defenseman Dimitri  
Yushkevich to a multiyear deal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on their roster, the Leafs then traded veteran  
defenseman Sylvain Cote to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for a 
second-round pick in the 2001 entry draft and another conditional 
draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Yushkevich, a restricted free agent, missed all  
of training camp and the Leafs' first three regular season games 
before finally reaching an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-year veteran had six goals and 22 assists in 78 games  
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Cote was acquired in March 1998 from Washington  
in exchange for defenseman Jeff Brown. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Enron May Unload Portland GE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Enron Corp., which may consider  
recently-acquired Portland General Electric as a white elephant, 
still has to come up with a real one. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Enron bought PGE for $3.2 billion and in the  
giddiness of the moment promised to donate an elephant to Oregon 
Zoo. Although the chief executive of the Houston-based company has 
publicly pondered unloading PGE because it not providing the 
investment return it expected, Enron is still on the hook for one 
elephant. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding the pachyderm wasn't easy. But after two years, Enron  
has found an orphaned elephant that needs a new home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless something happens out of the ordinary, it should go  
through, regardless of where Enron and PGE are,'' said Elaine 
Donaldson, an Enron spokeswoman in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cost wasn't really an issue, it was more identifying the right  
elephant,'' said Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-year-old elephant is in Malaysia and the zoo recently  
received rare permission from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to 
bring it to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	It is illegal to buy or sell the elephant, so Malaysia would  
likely loan Chendra permanently to the zoo. The zoo, in turn, would 
provide expertise to Malaysia, perhaps offering training in 
elephant husbandry or help in tracking orangutans. 
</P>
<P>
	The intricacies of the elephant deal raise eyebrows even among  
the most hardened veterans of the utility-merger game. 
</P>
<P>
	ScottishPower, which received permission Wednesday from the  
Oregon Public Utility Commission to acquire PacifiCorp, has 
refrained from promising elephants, said spokeswoman Rachel 
Sherrard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good grief, no. We're pragmatic Scots, you know that,''  
Sherrard said. ``I thought you were going to say, 'Would you adopt 
this elephant?' ''

<HEADLINE> Southern Calif. Adopts Smog Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DIAMOND BAR, Calif. (AP) -- Under pressure from a federal judge,  
Southern California air quality regulators on Friday adopted what 
they described as the nation's toughest restrictions on 
ozone-depleting emissions from cleaning solvents. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by the South Coast Air Quality Management District  
board followed a ruling in August by U.S. District Judge Harry Hupp 
that the agency had to toughen the limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Solvents are used by scores of businesses to, among other  
things, flush paint guns, degrease auto tools, manufacture medical 
products, and clean aerospace equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemicals are problematic because they contain compounds  
that deplete the ozone, said Bill Kelly, an agency spokesman. The 
new standards, to be implemented in two steps in 2001 and 2005, 
will ultimately cut 15 tons of emissions into Southern California's 
air each day. He said the standards are the toughest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional agency had submitted a 1994 air quality plan to the  
federal government, but then pulled 32 items from its list of 
smog-reducing strategies, saying emission levels and technology 
plans had changed. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the Los Angeles-based Coalition for Clean Air sued  
the agency and demanded that it put back those items. The judge 
agreed. His draft decision, released Aug. 27, is expected to be 
finalized soon, said Sam Atwood, an agency spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from companies and trade groups told the board  
Friday that they support the plan, especially after the agency 
agreed to evaluate whether the companies have access to products 
that help them meet the tighter limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Katy Wolf, executive director of Santa Monica-based Institute  
for Research and Technical Assistance, said some companies are 
already adopting the 2001 and 2005 requirements.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $2.22M for Turbulence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A jury has awarded $2.22 million to 13 American  
Airlines passengers who suffered approximately 30 seconds worth of 
severe turbulence during a 1995 flight. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of one, none of the plaintiffs suffered  
lasting physical injuries. But the jury on Thursday agreed with 
their unique legal position that fear of death resulting from the 
incident was so damaging it deserved a large award usually given to 
those with physical injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real message is that it's not inconsequential when you  
scare people and they think they're going to die,'' said James P. 
Kreindler, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, who was among 101 people on 
the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines had admitted liability but contested the  
amount that should be awarded for the turbulence aboard the June 
26, 1995, Los Angeles-to-New York flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Slitt, a spokesman for the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline,  
said he was disappointed by the size of the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not studied it in detail,'' he said, adding that the  
airline would weigh its legal options after doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Kreindler said the airline could have avoided the turbulence by  
steering around a storm and should have illuminated a seat belt 
sign to warn passengers about the possibility of rough weather 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Miriam Lewinger, a 74-year-old woman who was awarded $150,000,  
testified during the trial that she is still haunted by the 
screams, despite counseling she had received. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept hearing those kids, those children, seeing them running  
back and forth in the aisles,'' Ms. Lewinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The turbulence hit while Flight 58 was over Minnesota. It made  
an emergency landing in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the plaintiffs' was Nancy Spielberg, the sister of  
filmmaker Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Spielberg's share came to $160,000. Her two daughters, ages  
6 and 2 during the turbulence, were awarded a total of $375,000. 
</P>
<P>
	She called the verdict a slap on the wrist for American  
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really need more like a punch in the face,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Fires Leave Nevada Devastated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Nevada's most widespread wildland fire season  
on record left a legacy of devastation the size of the state of 
Delaware, threatening the lives of surviving animals and the 
livelihood of scores of ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Nevadans are worried more about seeds than smoke. Among the  
top priorities is to replant the barren ground with native grasses 
and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most extensive rangeland reseeding effort ever  
undertaken in Nevada -- and maybe anywhere,'' said Gene Kolkman. The 
Ely district manager for the federal Bureau of Land Management is 
coordinating that part of a statewide emergency action plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difficulties we face from this disaster are enormous.''  
</P>
<P>
	A rash of thunderstorms in early August and then again in the  
middle of the month sparked fires that burned 2,468 square miles of 
grass, brush and trees, primarily in the northeastern part of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 major fires blackened areas ranging from a few  
hundred acres to the Poker Brown fire southwest of Winnemucca, 
which covered 243,281 acres -- more than 380 square miles. By 
contrast, the District of Columbia encompasses 69 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those years that will stick out in your mind  
because of the kind of activity we've had, the acreage burned,'' 
Nevada Division of Forestry spokesman Steve Frady said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frady has seen nothing like this year, even after spending  
nearly 25 years fighting fires in Nevada. The 777,116 acres in 1996 
isn't half of this year's 1.58 million acres -- one-third of the 
total acreage burned in the nation. Wildlife division statistics 
make this the worst year in more than one-half century. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 20 miles east of Reno, Ed DePaoli looks at ashes blanketing  
what once was a grassland range. 
</P>
<P>
	``We normally would run between 200 to 300 cattle on this range  
during the late year,'' DePaoli said. ``I think we can move things 
around a bit to get by. It's our winter range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DePaoli said reseeding by the Bureau of Land Management and  
others is going to be a huge effort, since in some allotments 
nearly 90 percent was burned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough,'' DePaoli said.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 3 million pounds of grass seed are on order for fall  
planting. Sagebrush and other desert shrubs will have to wait for 
spring. Reseeding is expected to take at least three years and cost 
$50 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, new grass will replace cheat grass that found its  
way into Nevada around the turn of the century as inexpensive 
filler in packing crates. Its seed scattered into the air and 
thrived in the arid ground of the high desert, crowding out more 
beneficial plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheat grass provides sparse pasture for spring grazing, then  
quickly turns brown and lifeless in early summer -- tinder for the 
first bolt of lightning or careless camper. And since it grows 
faster than sagebrush or more nutritional grasses, it thwarts their 
recovery by competing for scant nutrients and water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over time, cheat grass can dominate a landscape,'' said  
Sherman Swanson, extension range specialist for the University of 
Nevada College of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Frady said because of the fires, some ranchers might have to  
scale back or stop operations altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the range fires we've had, we've had the livelihood of  
families affected,'' Frady said. ``Those range fires have not only 
destroyed the grazing lands that are privately owned, but also 
those federal lands that are grazing allotments. There's going to 
have to be a significant shift for many of those people in how they 
do their business on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BLM's Kolkman agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough situation for these ranchers. At the moment,  
they're staring at black,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also staring at black are the wildland animals that escaped the  
flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the fire is over, life doesn't go on,'' said Jim  
Jeffress, a biologist with the Nevada Division of Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``For decades and decades to come, the manifestations and  
impacts of those fires will be felt in the wildlife communities, 
from the mice on up to the big-game species.''

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Wants Onex Offer Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Air Canada sent a letter to shareholders Friday  
asking them to vote against the $772 million cash and stock bid 
from Onex Corp. and American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada also asked its investors to ratify a poison pill  
defense, which would discourage hostile takeovers by making them 
prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline sent the letter after Onex won court permission to  
call a shareholder meeting and force a vote on its offer of $5.31 a 
share for the Montreal-based airline. The meeting is set for Nov. 
8. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Air Canada continued to claim that the price  
``doesn't reflect the true value and superior prospects of Air 
Canada,'' and ``appears to have been structured to significantly 
benefit the interests of'' American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	It's widely expected that a counter bid will be made before the  
meeting, probably by a consortium of Air Canada airline partners 
and financial groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it is confident that its shareholders will  
confirm the board's conclusion that the Onex-American Airlines 
offer is ``unacceptable.'' It said ``the board and management are 
absolutely focused on delivering superior value and the right 
outcome for all stakeholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Air Canada is continuing legal challenges on two  
fronts. It claims the Onex bid breaks the 10 percent ceiling 
imposed on single shareholders and that the federal Competition 
Bureau has been excluded from the matter.

<HEADLINE> Moseley-Braun Nominated As Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton has nominated former Sen. Carol  
Moseley-Braun as ambassador to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun, an Illinois Democrat who was the first black  
woman to serve in the U.S. Senate, had been under discussion for 
months as a potential nominee. The nomination, announced Friday, 
requires Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun she said last month that she was thrilled at the  
prospect. She did not return phone messages on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House first raised the ambassadorship with her in  
December, shortly after she lost her bid for re-election to Peter 
Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald used his personal fortune to attack Moseley-Braun on  
several controversies that had surrounded her during her term. She 
was heavily criticized for a 1996 visit to a Nigerian dictator and 
never-proven allegations that she used 1993 campaign funds to pay 
for personal luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving office, she has spent time on the lecture circuit  
and worked part-time for the Clinton administration's push to use 
more federal dollars to rebuild public school buildings. The 
$56-an-hour job for the Education Department involves giving 
speeches to boost the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun was the lead supporter in Congress of a bill to  
provide $22 billion to build and modernize 5,000 schools nationwide 
over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	She also served in the Illinois General Assembly and as Cook  
County recorder of deeds. She has degrees from the University of 
Illinois and the University of Chicago Law School.

<HEADLINE> Two More Positve Pan Am Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Two more weightlifters from the Pan  
American Games have lost medals and pushed the total of positive 
drug tests from last summer's event to 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the final two tests were released to Pan Am chief  
executive officer Don MacKenzie at a wrap-up meeting in Mexico last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Both weightlifters -- silver medalist M. Sanchez Sanchez of Cuba  
and bronze medalist Edries Gonzalez of Puerto Rico -- competed in 
the 105-kilogram category, said vice president of sport Mike Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said Cristian Escalante of Chile will now be awarded the  
silver medal and Plaiter Reyes of the Dominican Republic will get 
the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't know for which drugs Sanchez and Gonzalez had tested  
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	There were several high-profile doping cases during the Games,  
including Canadian roller hockey goalie Steve Vezina, whose 
positive test for the anabolic steroid nandrolone cost his team its 
gold medal, and men's high jump world record-holder Javier 
Sotomayor of Cuba, who tested positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominican high jumper Juana Rosario Arrendel was stripped of her  
gold medal after testing positive for the steroid stanozolol. Two 
other Cuban weightlifters and two Mexican baseball players also 
tested positive for nandrolone, and one Mexican ballplayer was 
given a positive result after refusing to submit to a drug test.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Give La Russa 2-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Despite a losing record in his four seasons as  
St. Louis manager, the Cardinals signed Tony La Russa to a two-year 
contract extension Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, which keeps La Russa in St. Louis through the 2001  
season, had been expected since spring training. It was finalized 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa said he was flattered at least three other major league  
teams asked the Cardinals about his availability this week. But in 
the end he decided St. Louis was where he belonged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the fact there's still some respect around, but I  
didn't pay a lot of attention to it because the respect you want to 
earn is with your ballclub, the organization and the fans,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty said La Russa has earned  
that respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in his heart and mind he knew that this was the right  
spot and that he could make a difference,'' Jocketty said. ``But 
sometimes we all need a pat on the back and push in the right 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa won the NL Central title in his first season in St.  
Louis in 1996, and had the Cardinals within one game of the World 
Series. But after blowing a 3-1 lead to the Braves in the NL 
championship series, the Cardinals have not finished higher than 
third place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals (75-86) finished in fourth place this season, 21 1/2  
games behind Houston. They are 319-328 overall under La Russa, who 
has the backing of star Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, he's the most well-prepared manager in the game,''  
McGwire said last week. ``He gets his players to play, and we've 
had a lot of things happen this year that weren't expected, and 
this is where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jocketty agreed that La Russa should not receive the entire  
blame for the team's recent struggles. Pitching injuries have 
hampered the team the last two years. This season the Cardinals 
lost two starters early and then their bullpen, expected to be a 
strength, collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fact that we haven't won lately is always pointed  
toward the manager,'' Jocketty said. ``I think, again, it boils 
down to the personnel. If a general doesn't have the right arsenal 
to go war, he's not going to win the battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jocketty said he intends to try to upgrade the pitching staff  
for next season. He has already offered pitcher Darren Oliver (9-9) 
a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a couple of positions we could improve on, but it  
all boils down to pitching staff,'' Jocketty said. ``If we are able 
to put the right players in place for Tony, he's the right guy to 
guide this club into the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa said the team could win next season if the pieces fall  
into place, but it will more likely be more successful in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of teams looking for exactly what we're looking  
for, and there's only a few of those around,'' La Russa said. ``I 
don't know how many miracles you can expect Walt to produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa is the 11th winningest manager in history and lead all  
active managers with 1,639 wins. He won a division title with the 
Chicago White Sox in 1983 and four division championships with 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the Athletics to the World Series from 1988-90, winning  
it all in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Try To Avoid Yankees Sweep  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Facing elimination against the New York  
Yankees with cold bats and dwindling confidence is not the place to 
be in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, the Texas Rangers are doing it again.  
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight year, Texas returned to The Ballpark  
down two games in a best-of-5 AL divisional series wondering how to 
kickstart an offense that mustered one run in two games at Yankee 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	New York will try putting Texas out of its misery Saturday night  
with Roger Clemens pitching before family and friends in his home 
state. Esteban Loiaza, the last Ranger to beat the Yankees, will 
make his postseason debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fun being in this situation,'' Texas outfielder  
Roberto Kelly said. ``I think we've got to get things going early 
so we can get our confidence back. As the innings go by, we don't 
want to think `Here we go again.' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at it, it's like last year all over again. But  
what can we do? We've got to just go out and play the game. I don't 
think anyone in this locker room doubts that we can score runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers led the majors with a .293 average and scored 945  
runs, second only to Cleveland. Six players hit 20 home runs, four 
had 100 RBIs and four scored 100 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a fifth-inning homer by Juan Gonzalez in a 3-1 loss Thursday  
night is the only Texas run this series. It ended the Rangers' 
25-inning playoff scoring drought against New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last season when Texas was completely futile at the  
plate, the Rangers have had their chances. But they failed to score 
twice with two on and none out in Game 2 and wasted two 
opportunities with two one and one out in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, it just drains you,'' DH Rafael Palmeiro said. ``You  
have a chance to break open the game, the hit doesn't come and you 
tell yourself, `Here we go again.' Which is the last thing you want 
to do. You want to stay positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a big inning, we need to hit everyone in an inning. A  
fun inning like that would loosen everyone up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To break out of their funk, the Rangers have tried players-only  
meetings and one-on-one chat sessions. Reliever Tim Crabtree 
unveiled another tension-breaker Friday by passing out goofy 
looking jungle hats with the words ``Straight Bangin'' embroidered 
in Rangers red across the front. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like the rally hats aren't working right now, so  
maybe these new hats will change that,'' said Crabtree, who had 
actually ordered them several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Mike Morgan started the phrase and others picked up on  
it. Crabtree said it means ``pretty much anything and everything, 
from hitters whacking the ball to a pitcher making good pitches in 
good situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, the Yankees have been doing lots of straight  
bangin. Starters Orlando Hernandez and Andy Pettitte have pitched 
deep into the games and Bernie Williams and Ricky Ledee have 
provided the clutch hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is getting on Texas for not scoring runs, but  
they're playing a pretty good team and facing a pretty tough 
pitching staff,'' Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez said. ``I 
think it's more of a matter of us playing well than them choking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York wasn't as dominant this season as in 1998, but a  
victory Saturday would put this year's club on the same postseason 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens forced a trade from Toronto to the Yankees for that  
purpose. Having won five Cy Youngs and all sorts of personal glory, 
he's still seeking the ultimate thrill of winning a World Series 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's what we play for,'' said Clemens, who would've been  
traded to Texas had the Yankees not trumped their offer to the Blue 
Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Clemens clinch this series, it would help make up for a  
poor season by his standards. He was 14-10 with a career-high 4.60 
ERA, including going 1-1 with a 4.96 ERA against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers scored five runs off him in two innings the last  
time he pitched here, but Clemens went on the disabled list after 
that start with a hamstring problem. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Clemens will be fighting too much health. Clemens  
last pitched Sept. 30, and extended rest tends to make power 
pitchers like himself lose command. The emotions surrounding the 
game also could throw him off stride. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've prepared well enough so I won't be too alive in  
the strike zone,'' he said. ``I expect to have a little extra 
emotion early. Hopefully I'll be able to channel that in a good 
direction.''

<HEADLINE> Self Possessed Wins Kentucky Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Finally in the winner's circle at the  
Kentucky Futurity, trainer Ron Gurfein recalled the four failures 
that preceded Self Possessed's triumph in the third leg of the 
harness racing triple crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had four favorites go down. One got scratched, the other  
got interfered with, one got locked in and I forgot what the other 
one was,'' Gurfein said. ``It hasn't been a good race for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His luck turned Friday, thanks to a gritty performance by Self  
Possessed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-year-old colt staked his claim to harness racing horse of  
the year honors with a dominating win, sweeping both heats of the 
Futurity at The Red Mile and tying the stakes record with a 1:52 
3-5 in the second heat. 
</P>
<P>
	In the winner's circle, Gurfein and driver Mike Lachance  
re-enacted the kiss they exchanged after Self Possessed won the 
Hambletonian in August in a world-record time of 1:51 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of that impressive performance, some had questioned  
Self Possessed after he came up short in last month's World 
Trotting Derby at the Illinois State Fair. There, he lost two of 
three heats to Enjoy Lavec, including the final raceoff by a head. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody said well, `He's got a chink in his armor, he can't  
go two heats,''' said Art Zubrod, manager of Self Possessed's 
majority owner, Brittany Farms. 
</P>
<P>
	The favorite in a field of 10 that started the Futurity, Self  
Possessed took the first-heat lead just past the half-mile, 
overtaking Angus Hall. He pulled away to win by four lengths over 
Enjoy Lavec, with Angus Hall third, two lengths farther back. 
</P>
<P>
	That set up a second heat in which the rest of the field -- minus  
Angus Hall, scratched for health reasons -- set a torrid pace off 
the start, hoping Self Possessed would wilt. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't, surging outside to take the lead on the backstretch  
and reaching the half-mile in :54 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought there was going to be maybe one (other horse) that  
was going to take a shot out of the gate at the most, but not the 
way it happened,'' said Lachance, who won his second Futurity. 
``That was a brutal half a mile, a half in 54. You've got to be a 
great horse to stand something like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows that Lexington, when you have to go the first  
half fast, you walk home,'' Lachance added. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Self Possessed pushed his lead to five lengths at the  
three-quarter pole, then held off a late charge by Enjoy Lavec, who 
finished two lengths behind. Davanti was third, seven lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
	By winning both heats, Self Possessed avoided a final raceoff.  
</P>
<P>
	The colt paid $2.80 to win and $2.20 to place and show in the  
first heat. In the second heat, he paid $3.00 to win, $2.40 to 
place and $2.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he won the Hambletonian and Futurity, Self Possessed  
skipped the trotting triple crown's middle leg, the Yonkers Trot. 
Super Bowl remains the last horse to sweep the series, in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurfein said he had no regrets about skipping Yonkers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a very bad racetrack, it's a half-mile and I  
didn't want to compromise the rest of the year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed is scheduled to race once more, in the Oct. 29  
Breeders' Crown at Mohawk Raceway in Ontario, Canada, then will 
retire to stud. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's win was Self Possessed's 12th in 21 lifetime starts.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Will Fine Sprewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The New York Knicks have decided to fine  
the missing Latrell Sprewell, who stayed absent from training camp 
Friday with no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will hold its final practice in Charleston on Saturday  
morning before returning to New York, and it now appears Sprewell 
will miss the entire camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Saturday that Sprewell had driven  
across the country from Oakland, Calif., stopping in Milwaukee, and 
checked back into the hotel in Westchester County, N.Y. where he 
lived last season. A Knicks spokeswoman could not confirm the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, you have to take disciplinary action,'' said  
general manager Scott Layden, who would not disclose the exact 
amount of the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks can fine Sprewell $2,500 for his first two missed  
practices and $5,000 for every missed practice thereafter. If the 
team fines him the maximum for every missed practice since 
Wednesday, Sprewell will be out $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discipline is an important part of any team, and obviously  
it's a real important part of this team,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy 
said. ``It's not about anybody making an example of anybody, it's 
about doing the right things, doing what you're supposed to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want to do more than anything is get it resolved so we  
can get on with the season,'' he said. ``I don't want to be talking 
about this every day for a long period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was excused from the first two days of camp so he could  
attend to the close of a civil trial in California stemming from a 
traffic accident he admittedly caused. Sprewell's agent, Robert 
Gist, last told the team that Sprewell would arrive by Wednesday 
night or Thursday morning, but there has been no sign of Sprewell -- 
or any word from him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he doesn't have communication either,'' Layden said of  
Gist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Gist finally called again late Friday. Layden did  
not immediately return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell is entering the final season of his contract and will  
earn $9 million this season. The Knicks are eager to begin 
negotiating an extension, which makes Sprewell's unexplained 
absence all the more mysterious. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden said Sprewell's absence was not a holdout.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know he'll be here,'' said Marcus Camby, one of Sprewell's  
closest friends on the team. ``If something was really wrong, he 
definitely would have called me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other training camp news, third-string point guard Rick  
Brunson missed Friday's practices with a broken toe and forward 
Ivano Newbill sat out with a sprained ankle.

<HEADLINE> Ohio St. Coach Gets Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State football coach John Cooper  
agreed to a contract extension through the 2004 season Friday that 
will pay him at least $1.1 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper also is eligible for $175,000 a year in academic  
performance bonuses and $172,000 annually in team performance 
bonuses, the school said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very gratifying to know that I'll be able to finish my  
coaching career here at Ohio State,'' Cooper said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 62-year-old Cooper will make a base salary of $200,000.  
Money that Ohio State receives from radio, television, Nike and 
camps raises the total package to $1.1 million per year. He has 
been working under a contract signed in 1995 that earned him about 
$750,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have challenged for a national championship two out of the  
last three years and I want to keep the coaching team together that 
has done that,'' athletics director Andy Geiger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other college coaches thought to earn at least $1 million  
include Florida's Steve Spurrier, Penn State's Joe Paterno, Rick 
Neuheisel at Washington and R.C. Slocum at Texas A&AMP;M. This week, 
Florida State's Bobby Bowden agreed to a deal that will pay him 
$1.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper's new agreement is retroactive to March 1 and effective  
until Feb. 29, 2004. After March 1, 2002, Cooper and Ohio State 
agree to renegotiate the existing contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper, in his 12th year at Ohio State, is the second-winningest  
coach in Ohio State history with a 100-35-4 record. The Buckeyes 
have finished second in the country two of the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State is 3-2 this season and ranked No. 21 in the country.

<HEADLINE> JAMA Set To Name New Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The dean of Johns Hopkins University School of  
Medicine appears to be the leading candidate to become the new 
editor of the American Medical Association's influential journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources speaking on condition of anonymity said Thursday  
that they had learned Dr. Catherine D. DeAngelis would be named 
editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, 
succeeding Dr. George Lundberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg's firing in January provoked a controversy over the  
journal's editorial independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA refused to confirm that DeAngelis was the pick. The AMA  
had been scheduled to introduce the journal's new editor at a news 
conference today in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	DeAngelis is the editor of the Archives of Pediatrics and  
Adolescent Medicine, published by the AMA, as well as a member of 
JAMA's editorial board. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached Thursday at her office at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore,  
where she is dean of academic affairs and faculty, she declined to 
confirm her selection. 
</P>
<P>
	JAMA has been run by interim co-editors since Lundberg's firing.  
He was dismissed after publishing in JAMA a survey of college 
students' sexual attitudes that coincided with President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	AMA executive vice president Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson felt  
Lundberg inappropriately injected the organization into a political 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg, who took a job as editor in chief for an online  
medical information site, was highly critical of the AMA after his 
firing, saying he had to battle AMA leaders, members and lobbyists 
to retain editorial independence of his publication. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA has since created a board to serve as a buffer between  
the editor in chief and the organization's management.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks To Delay Test Ban Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed to the Senate on  
Friday to delay acting on the nuclear test ban treaty, saying a 
sure-to-fail vote would severely damage efforts to curb the spread 
of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats, meanwhile, worked on a plan to force  
postponement of next week's vote if Republican leaders decline 
Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said a vote on the treaty  
is still on track for next Tuesday or Wednesday but that he would 
listen to anything the president has to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he's moving in the right direction,'' Lott said after  
Clinton made one new concession to critics: agreeing the treaty 
vote could be put off beyond the 2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to do what's right for America, take it out of the  
politics,'' Clinton said. ``This is not going to be a huge issue 
next year in the election one way or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have asked them to put it off because we don't have the  
votes,'' added Clinton bluntly, speaking with reporters in Ottawa 
where he was meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lott spokesman, John Czwartacki, later said that Clinton's  
Ottawa remarks still did not appear to meet all of Lott's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed  
Services Committee and an opponent of the treaty, welcomed 
Clinton's specific request for a delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said the president and the Senate leadership must share  
in the responsibility if the treaty vote is put off. ``I see him 
moving in that direction, each day another step,'' Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms,  
R-N.C., later suggested Clinton's comments fell far short of what 
was needed. ``I will object, along with many of my Republican 
colleagues, to any effort to put off next weeks' vote,'' Helms said 
in a Senate speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments occurred as the GOP-led Senate opened debate on  
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would impose a blanket 
international ban on all nuclear test explosions. Supporters 
estimate they are 15 to 20 votes short of the two-thirds majority 
needed for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the march toward a vote ``pigheaded,'' Senate Minority  
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters Democrats may invoke a 
seldom-used parliamentary procedure that would force the Senate out 
of its treaty-considering mode and block further action on the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move, forcing the Senate to give attention to legislation  
instead of treaties, would require only a 51-vote majority, rather 
than the two-thirds majority -- or 67 votes -- needed to ratify a 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said he believed he could win enough Republican support  
for the move to prevail, since some influential Republicans who 
oppose the treaty have been among those calling for a delay. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a former majority leader,  
would make the motion if Lott would not agree to a postponement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do we have to do it next week?'' Byrd asked in a floor  
speech arguing for a delay. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican leaders warned that such a procedural move would  
be a violation of Senate customs -- in which the majority leader 
makes calendar-related decisions -- and could backfire on Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only the majority leader should make that motion. And if we  
don't get an agreement, we would oppose that move,'' Lott said in a 
brief interview. 
</P>
<P>
	While appealing for a delay, Clinton at first seemed to reject  
Republican demands for a letter asking him to put off consideration 
of the agreement until 2001, after the presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	``This treaty was never treated seriously,'' Clinton charged.  
``They want me to give them a letter to cover the political 
decision they have made? ... I don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But White House press secretary Joe Lockhart was quick to soften  
the statement, saying ``his intention was not to rule out sending a 
letter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Senate debate, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, one of  
only two Republicans to openly support the treaty, called it one of 
the most significant international agreements of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Specter added, ``I do not expect it to be ratified. The  
picture is clear that there are not enough senators to provide the 
two-thirds constitutional margin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, key U.S. allies called on the Senate to approve the  
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	In an article published Friday in The New York Times, French  
President Jacques Chirac, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and 
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder urged the Senate to approve the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decisions we take now will help determine, for generations  
to come, the safety of the world we bequeath to our children,'' 
they wrote. Failure to ratify the treaty, the three leaders said, 
``will be a failure in our struggle against proliferation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in Canada, with Clinton at his side, Chretien said all  
nations have a stake in the test-ban treaty. ``There's a lot of 
other nations that have to live with the consequences'' of what the 
United States does, the prime minister said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our allies in Europe, they are lobbying today saying what the  
Senate is doing is nuts, it is wrong,'' said Daschle, the Senate 
Democrat leader. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lott told the Senate: ``The facts argue against this treaty.  
This treaty is flawed and should not be ratified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has been signed by 154 nations, including the United  
States, but ratified by only 48.

<HEADLINE> Russia Batters Chechnya Killing 32 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian tanks and artillery battered  
Chechnya on Friday after an air attack on a village caught people 
by surprise during midday prayers, reportedly killing dozens. 
</P>
<P>
	In Elistanzhi, a village in the mountains near Chechnya's  
southern border, the streets were filled with sobbing Friday as 
villagers collected body parts of the victims of the Russian air 
attack, eyewitnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Villagers said Russian planes attacked Elistanzhi, 30 miles  
southeast of Grozny, on Thursday during midday Muslim prayers and 
kept up the bombardment for more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Village administrator Ismail Dagayev told The Associated Press  
that 32 people were killed -- including an entire family of eight -- 
60 others injured and 200 houses destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military on Friday declined to comment on the  
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has said its attacks on Chechnya are aimed solely at  
Islamic militants who twice invaded the neighboring republic of 
Dagestan this summer and who are blamed for a series of September 
apartment explosions in Russia that killed 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chechen officials charge that hundreds of civilians have  
been killed, and Elistanzhi residents echoed the complaints, saying 
the village never housed militants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just live here, growing potatoes, corn and tobacco,'' said  
village mullah Yusup Khadzhi. 
</P>
<P>
	The air attack came after 40 people were reportedly killed  
Tuesday when a Russian tank fired on a bus crowded with men, women 
and children trying to flee Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	The sounds of heavy shelling were heard Friday near the villages  
of Bamut and Arshty along Chechnya's western border with Ingushetia 
as Russian forces established positions inside the rebel republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia says it wants a security zone around Chechnya to keep  
militants from infiltrating neighboring regions. Russian troops 
occupy the northern third of the republic, which is relatively flat 
and has open ground, and have not crossed into the woods and 
mountains south of the Terek River. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian commander in Chechnya, Col. Gen. Viktor Kazaktsev,  
told The Associated Press that troops ``definitely plan'' to cross 
the Terek, but he declined to say when. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1994-96 war in Chechnya, outnumbered Chechen fighters  
fought the vast Russian army to a humiliating standstill in 
devastating street battles in Grozny and guerrilla actions in the 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia says its losses in the latest fighting have been  
relatively light. Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, deputy chief of the 
Russian general staff, said Friday that 20 to 30 soldiers have been 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of the war in 1996 left Chechnya technically still part  
of Russia, but effectively independent. Chechens elected a 
president and parliament in 1997. The Kremlin now refuses to regard 
the Chechen government as legitimate and instead recognizes a newly 
organized Chechen State Council, formed by Russian authorities and 
members of a largely pro-Russian Chechen parliament that was 
elected in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the council, Malik Saidullayev, claimed at a Friday  
news conference in Moscow that his body would prevail over the 
government of Chechen President Aslen Maskhadov. 
</P>
<P>
	``All parents, mothers, fathers will follow us; all the people  
who have children and who want these children to have a happy 
future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets of the capital, Grozny, which had been nearly  
deserted earlier in the week, were busy Friday with residents 
shopping for food and discussing Moscow's formation of a 
government-in-exile for Chechnya. Many saw the council as a puppet 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov, in comments published Friday in Russia's Kommersant  
newspaper, said another full-scale war in Chechnya would again 
result ``in Russia's shame and defeat'' and he urged Moscow to seek 
a peaceful solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has informed the United States it has violated an  
international conventional arms agreement by sending more armored 
equipment to southern Russia in its battle against Chechen rebels 
than the accord permits. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe agreement limits the  
number of tanks, artillery pieces, aircraft and other non-nuclear 
arms in Europe, with specific ceilings for particular regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the refugee flow from Chechnya to neighboring  
Ingushetia has topped 133,000, but food, tents and other vital 
supplies are still lacking, according to the territory's leader, 
President Ruslan Aushev. Thousands more have fled to other regions.

<HEADLINE> Judge Mulls Fortier's Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Michael Fortier's sentencing judge said  
today that he is considering giving Fortier more than the four 
years he has already served for failing to notify authorities about 
the plans for the Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Van Bebber is presiding over a  
resentencing hearing ordered by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals. The court said Van Bebber used wrong guidelines when he 
sentenced Fortier to 12 years in prison and a $200,000 fine last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Van Bebber should have used guidelines for  
involuntary manslaughter instead of first-degree murder. The 
manslaughter guidelines call for 51 months in prison; Fortier has 
already served around 50 months. 
</P>
<P>
	But a sentencing brief filed on behalf of bombing victims says  
the judge can impose a longer sentence than the manslaughter 
guidelines call for because of the extraordinary nature of the 
case, and the judge indicated he was learning toward such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am contemplating an upward departure in this case,'' Van  
Bebber said at the start of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Michael McGuire, who is seeking to have Fortier  
sentenced to time served, objected to a harsher sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, 30, has been in prison since pleading guilty in August  
1995 to failing to notify authorities of the plot to bomb the 
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and other charges. The April 19, 
1995, blast killed 168 people and injured hundreds of other. 
</P>
<P>
	His sentencing was delayed nearly three years until after the  
federal trials of bomber Timothy McVeigh and co-conspirator Terry 
Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire took exception to a presentencing report by probation  
officer Daniel Muller that asks for a harsher sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like he's represented the facts accurately,''  
McGuire told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire also asked the judge to reconsider the fine imposed  
against Fortier. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Fortier received a fine, I want the court to know that  
he is not able to pay a fine,'' McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Connelly, assistant U.S attorney, said the government  
wanted a sentence in the range of 70 to 87 months. He said the 
government isn't asking for more than that because of Fortier's 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Cassell, a law professor representing victims, said  
that ``only a substantial upward departure'' can accommodate the 
magnitude of the bombing. He suggested the judge reinstate the 
sentence of 12 years and a $200,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just punishment demands that the death of 168 people be  
reflected somewhere in the sentence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, survivors and relatives of victims as well as of  
Fortier arrived under a steady rain to hear Van Bebber's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think 144 months is pretty cheap for 168 lives,'' said Tom  
Kight, whose stepdaughter Frankie Merrell died in the blast. ``I 
don't know what is a fair sentence for 168 lives. It's never going 
to be enough, OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier's attorneys maintain that his cooperation with  
government prosecutors who made Fortier their star witness at the 
trials of McVeigh and Nichols qualify him to be released 
immediately for time served. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury in Denver convicted McVeigh on murder, weapons  
and conspiracy counts and recommended he die for his crimes. Judge 
Richard Matsch formally sentenced him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Another federal jury convicted Nichols of involuntary  
manslaughter and conspiracy. He is serving a life sentence for 
conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter. Matsch sentenced Nichols 
to life in prison. He faces a state trial on 160 counts of murder.

<HEADLINE> Game 3 Slither's Away for Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This is not how the Arizona Diamondbacks won the  
National League West Division. 
</P>
<P>
	For a team so aware of fundamentals that the shortstop and  
second baseman back up the mound in case of overthrows back to the 
pitcher, the Diamondbacks came apart at the seams Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was a 9-2 blowout by the New York Mets that put  
Arizona one loss away from elimination in the NL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	There were three errors and eight walks as Arizona played like  
an expansion team, which, of course, is what the second-year team 
was supposed to be this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won 100 games, 101 now,'' manager Buck Showalter said on  
the eve of Game 3. ``Nothing's going to happen to make me feel 
different about this club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, plenty did.  
</P>
<P>
	Starter Omar Daal helped New York to its first run with a couple  
of walks in the second inning. Then shortstop Andy Fox's overthrow 
on an attempted double play allowed another Mets run in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Daal kicked a ball into foul territory, helping create a  
bases-loaded jam for himself in the fourth. Then Tony Womack kicked 
a ball around in right field, compounding the damage in a six-run 
Mets sixth that included three more walks. 
</P>
<P>
	All in all, not pretty.  
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Mets were perfect on defense including a  
sparkling play by shortstop Rey Ordonez on Matt Williams leading 
off the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	When Showalter's team got in trouble in the sixth, he went to  
the bullpen for left-hander Dan Plesac to face the Mets left-handed 
hitters. The move made sense. Plesac has been poison on left-handed 
batters this season, limiting them to a .186 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
	So, of course, lefties John Olerud and Darryl Hamilton both  
reached him for two-run singles that broke the game wide open. 
</P>
<P>
	It was typical on a night when almost nothing went right for  
Showalter and the Diamondbacks.

<HEADLINE> Rules Limiting Cable Ownership Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move that could impact how consumers will  
get high-speed Internet connections and a new generation of 
telephone service, the government is reconsidering rules that 
restrict the number of cable customers a single company can serve. 
</P>
<P>
	Any decision by the Federal Communications Commission also is  
expected to impact AT&AMP;T's proposed $58 billion purchase of 
MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC is considering changes to its cap limiting a company's  
share of total cable households at 30 percent. Those rules -- 
required by a 1992 communications law -- were developed primarily to 
prevent a cable company from having too much control over 
programming and to ensure diversity in what people can watch. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that cable companies are beginning to offer high-speed  
Internet access and local phone service over their pipes, the FCC 
faces new challenges. Cable companies say they need to grow so they 
can compete in these new markets and are pushing for more leeway in 
this area. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission wants to see that happen, but also has to balance  
this with trying to ensure there is not too much concentration in 
cable TV programming, agency officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise of competitors to cable may prompt the FCC to apply the  
30 percent limit to a wider market. That would enable cable 
companies to control a larger number of customers without running 
afoul of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 66 million cable subscribers nationwide, according to  
the FCC. The multichannel video market -- which more broadly 
includes cable and its competitors -- has 80 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies, like AT&AMP;T, stand to gain if federal regulators  
relax the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the existing rules, AT&AMP;T's recent takeover of  
Tele-Communications Inc. brings the company close to or slightly 
above the 30 percent limit, according to FCC officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission currently is not enforcing the rules, which face  
challenges in court. But once it begins to hold companies to the 
limit, they will have two months to come under compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's plan to purchase MediaOne -- a deal which would create the  
nation's largest cable TV company and provider of high-speed cable 
Internet services -- would put it above the current limits. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for that is because AT&AMP;T would acquire MediaOne's 25  
percent stake in cable systems owned by Time Warner Inc. Under the 
FCC's existing rules, any stake over 5 percent counts as if the 
whole system is owned by that company. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T says it's ownership in Time Warner would not give it any  
control over programming, and therefore, should not go toward its 
cable audience limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the FCC has to do is take current conditions in the  
market into account in developing a rule that clearly relates to 
the statutory purpose of protecting video programmers,'' said Mark 
Rosenblum, vice president of law for AT&AMP;T Corp. ``We don't think 
that logical and sensible ownership rules should impede our 
transaction with MediaOne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers groups disagree and fear a few players will end up  
controlling the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only takes a small stake in a broadly held company to  
influence its decisions on programming,'' said Gene Kimmelman, 
co-director of Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the possibility of cable companies getting into the  
local phone market is not an adequate tradeoff for reducing 
diversity of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is anybody who wants to deliver telephone or Internet  
services over cable can do it without owning the systems,'' said 
Andrew Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project. ``It's 
blackmail.''

<HEADLINE> Ginsberg Items Offered at Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A ``glorious mess'' of Beat Generation poet  
Allen Ginsberg's belongings went on the auction block Thursday, 
including writings, photos with his Beat friends, even the beloved 
harmonium he played at many of his poetry readings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sotheby's auction titled ``Allen Ginsberg and Friends''  
offered photos of Ginsberg, nude with his longtime companion, poet 
Peter Orlovsky, and clothed with Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac and 
William Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	The bearded, balding Ginsberg's blend of drug-inspired visions,  
hedonistic sex and gut-wrenching autobiography first emerged during 
the 1950s. He became the poet laureate of the Beat Generation and 
later was a guru to hippies, coining the term ``flower power'' 
during the mid-60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Letters written by Neal Cassady, the first great love of  
Ginsberg's life and the inspiration for the main character in 
Kerouac's classic ``On the Road,'' sold for $28,750. 
</P>
<P>
	An old friend of Ginsberg's who would not give his name spent  
$12,650 for the harmonium -- a small organ -- the poet played at 
readings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsberg ``loved his life. He loved his friends. He loved these  
possessions and took every opportunity to enjoy them all,'' said 
Bill Morgan, the archivist for the poet's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	A first edition of his 1956 epic poem ``Howl'' sold for $16,100.  
The work, which dealt with his homosexuality and communist 
upbringing, was purchased by his German translator, Heiner Bastian. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsberg's apartment was ``organized chaos'' where everything  
was shared ``in that joy of 'show-and-tell' that Allen 
personified,'' said Morgan. ``It was a damn mess, it was a glorious 
damn mess!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsberg, who had been suffering from liver cancer, died April  
5, 1997 of a heart attack at 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsberg's heirs -- his brother's children and Orlovsky -- will  
benefit from the sale, which brought in a total of about $674,000. 
All prices include a 15 percent Sotheby's commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of souvenirs from Ginsberg's life were on the block --  
from paintings and near-pornography to his traditional Indian 
clothes and Buddhist meditation mats and beads. 
</P>
<P>
	Bastian, who bid by phone, also paid $17,250 for a well-known  
photograph of Kerouac smoking on a Manhattan fire escape, taken by 
Ginsberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest bid of the sale was $40,250, for a set of collages  
resembling doodles by Jean Michel Basquiat, a former graffiti 
artist who sometimes sketched alongside Ginsberg. Basquiat died in 
1988 of a drug overdose at age 27.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Hawke As Comptroller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Thursday confirmed John D. Hawke  
Jr. to be comptroller of the currency, a post from which he will 
regulate nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton initially nominated Hawke, a former Treasury  
Department official, to the job in July 1998. But his confirmation 
was blocked for months by Democrats led by Sen. Paul Sarbanes of 
Maryland, who argued that Hawke hadn't been a strong enough 
consumer advocate in his prior job. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, Clinton announced a one-year ``recess''  
appointment of Hawke to the job, using a constitutional power that 
lets the president temporarily make such appointments while 
Congress is not in session. He resubmitted the nomination in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate used a voice vote to affirm Hawke to what will be a  
five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawke had been undersecretary for domestic finance at the  
Treasury Department since June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	As comptroller, he plays a key role in maintaining financial  
market stability and oversees some 2,600 banks nationwide. The 
office is part of the Treasury Department.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Needs Breather, not Penn State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- What Iowa needs on its football schedule  
right now is another Northern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, what the Hawkeyes are getting is Penn State, which just  
beat Michigan State, 49-3. With Iowa at 1-3 and struggling on 
offense, this is not what the doctor would prescribe as a cure. 
</P>
<P>
	But like it or not, the No. 2 Nittany Lions visit Kinnick  
Stadium on Saturday. First-year Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz -- a Penn 
State fan while growing up in Pittsburgh -- is trying to take in all 
in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	``My experience is you really can't concern yourself a heck of a  
lot about your opponent,'' Ferentz said. ``Obviously, you've got to 
study, you've got to plan and those types of things. 
</P>
<P>
	``But over the long haul, you worry about your performance and  
how you conduct your business and what you do on a day-to-day 
basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferentz's main concern is trying to generate some offense. The  
Hawkeyes are averaging just 211 yards and 11 points a game, and 
other than a 24-0 victory over Northern Illinois, they haven't 
scored more than one touchdown in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa got on the board in last week's loss at No. 11 Michigan  
State only because Tim Dodge's 86-yard kickoff return put the 
Hawkeyes close enough to kick a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	So why is Penn State coach Joe Paterno worried? First off,  
Paterno is always fretting about something. And second, he doesn't 
like surprises and wants his team to be ready for anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, such as Iowa, they are very young in key spots  
and you never know when they are going to mature and all of a 
sudden rise up and play really well,'' he said. ``We are going out 
to a tough stadium to play in. If Iowa has some success, this will 
be a tough environment for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly was a wild environment that last time Penn State  
played at Iowa in 1995. A Penn State helmet was stolen and fans 
pelted the field with beer cans, a full whiskey bottle, 
marshmallows and a frozen chicken. There was even a pig's head on 
the field afterwards, although no one reported actually seeing it 
fly out of the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard all about the pig's head,'' Penn State linebacker  
LaVar Arrington said. ``We've heard it's pretty wild playing out 
there. A pig's head -- that's abstract. You expect some confetti or 
some Coke cans. But I've never heard of a pig's head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State (5-0, 1-0) should be able to handle whatever is  
thrown its way Saturday. The Nittany Lions have won close games 
with Pittsburgh and Miami and blowouts with Akron and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a great football team,'' Ferentz said. ``There are  
no weak spots out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Ferentz, the game is just one more of those interesting  
twists in life. In high school, his dream had always been to play 
for Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was THE place at that time,'' he said. ``But I had a  
couple of problems: I was small and I was slow. They weren't 
looking for guys like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferentz ended up playing at Connecticut instead. But his wife,  
Mary, is the sister of former Penn State player Kevin Hart and his 
father-in-law played high school football with Paterno. And yes, 
Paterno was coaching Penn State back when Ferentz wanted to play 
there. Now, he's going to coach against Joe Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really given it thought in terms of, `Geez, I'm on  
the field with him,''' Ferentz said. ``I probably won't think of it 
that way. I'm more worried about those 11 guys they've got inside 
the lines.''

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Deaths of 3 Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINDSBORG, Kan. (AP) -- A man was arrested in the killings of his  
three children during an attack that also left his wife bloodied 
and screaming for help, authorities and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Jones, 47, was charged with three counts of first-degree  
murder and one of aggravated assault. He was under guard at a 
hospital Thursday where he underwent surgery to repair a gash on 
his throat. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities would not discuss details of the case or how the  
Jones children were killed. Neighbors identified two of the 
children as Christopher, 7, and Joshua, 5. The third was a 
2-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Jones' wife, Cathy, ran out of the family's home  
drenched in blood Wednesday night crying for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Jack White said she screamed, ``He is after me.''  
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Jones, 34, had a gash on her head, a cut on her hand and  
stab wounds to her chest, neighbors said. She was hospitalized in 
Lindsborg in fair condition Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities found the children's bodies inside the home.  
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Julie Harding said the father was unemployed and on  
most days could be seen walking the children to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we are sitting in our home, our lives going normally, and  
their lives are ripped apart,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsborg, a town of 4,000, is about 100 miles southwest of  
Topeka.

<HEADLINE> Subway Series Not Ideal for NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While New Yorkers are pulling for a Subway Series that would  
send the city into a frenzy, one team from the Big Apple would be 
plenty for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	If either the Yankees or Mets make the World Series, most of the  
city will watch anyway. If both teams make it, however, some fans 
around the country are faced with a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	Which team to root for? Against?  
</P>
<P>
	For NBC, a Subway Series eliminates a second market from another  
region. 
</P>
<P>
	``In New York, it would be beyond words,'' said NBC's Bob  
Costas. ``But in truth, this is a different time than the '40s or 
'50s when the Brooklyn Dodgers were more of a national team. ... I 
don't think a New York series would be a big deal in Iowa. The idea 
that the whole country would be buzzing I don't think would be 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While ratings in New York would certainly improve for the first  
Subway Series in 43 years, the numbers probably wouldn't jump 
enough to make up the difference for the lack of a second home-team 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever marginal increase you get in New York from having  
both teams is not as significant as you might think,'' said NBC 
spokesman Ed Markey. 
</P>
<P>
	Equally as important as the teams that make the World Series is  
the level of competitiveness. Last year's series between the San 
Diego Padres and Yankees had a low 14.1 rating even though it had a 
representative from each side of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because it was a sweep for the Yankees.  
</P>
<P>
	Even the 1997 World Series between Florida and Cleveland, two  
fairly low-profile teams, had a 16.8 rating on NBC. That's because 
it went down to a seventh game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it goes seven games, it's going to get a great rating no  
matter who makes it,'' Markey said. 
</P>
<P>
	An all-New York finale wouldn't have much impact on advertisers,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for the city, but I don't think it would boost  
numbers nationally,'' said Steve Grubbs, a media buyer at BBDO 
advertising agency. ``The ad inventory has nearly all been bought, 
anyway. So it wouldn't make much of a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two advertising buyers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
NBC was getting $350,000 to $400,000 for each 30-second commercial. 
Fox received about $300,000 per spot last year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STILL FUMING:* Golfers aren't second-guessed and criticized  
nearly as much as other professional athletes, but when opinionated 
NBC analyst Johnny Miller let his feelings be known during the 
Ryder Cup last month, the Americans showed how thin-skinned they 
really are. 
</P>
<P>
	``It mystifies me that he's supposed to be a reporter or an  
analyst, and he becomes a critic,'' said Justin Leonard's Ryder Cup 
teammate, Davis Love III, who said he might tell NBC he won't talk 
to them if Miller keeps it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller had said Leonard should stay home and watch on TV after  
struggling through the first day and a half of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Johnny, he's not out interviewing players anyway,'' said  
Paul Azinger. ``I don't think Johnny hurt his credibility. I think 
players have always had funny feelings about Johnny, but the 
general public loves him.''

	 *JAIL TALK:* Bryant Gumbel doesn't have much sympathy for Denny

<P>
	Gumbel was the first to interview the last 30-game winner on  
television since McLain returned to prison, where he is serving an 
eight-year sentence for a pension-fund swindle. The interview is 
part of HBO's ``Real Sports,'' which debuts Tuesday at 10 p.m. EDT.

	``He got very emotional at times,'' Gumbel said. ``Denny's an

done way too much in his life for that. He's basically convinced 
himself that he's never done anything wrong. It's really 
frightening.''

<HEADLINE> Document Implies U.S. Role in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. intelligence may have played an  
``unfortunate part'' in the death of an American journalist at the 
hands of Chilean security forces in the days following a 1973 
military coup in Chile, according to a declassified State 
Department document released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The journalist, Charles Horman, was taken from his home about a  
week after the Sept. 11, 1973, coup and transported to a stadium, 
where suspected leftists were taken in the chaotic aftermath of the 
coup. 
</P>
<P>
	The document released to his widow, Joyce Horman of New York  
City, said that at best, the U.S. intelligence community's role in 
Horman's death ``was limited to providing or confirming information 
that helped motivate his murder by the government of Chile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At worst, U.S. intelligence was aware the government of Chile  
saw Horman in a rather serious light and U.S. officials did nothing 
to discourage the logical outcome of the government of Chile's 
paranoia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His widow received the two-page document today from the National  
Security Archive, a research group at George Washington University. 
It was written Aug. 25, 1976, by the head of the State Department's 
office of Chilean affairs, Rudy Fimbres, R.S. Driscoll and W.V. 
Robertson, two other State Department officials who were not 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Horman was the subject of a 1982 movie, ``Missing,'' which  
suggested American complicity in his death and drew vigorous 
objections from State Department officials, including then 
Nathaniel Davis, then the U.S. ambassador to Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case remains bothersome,'' the State Department document  
said. ``The connotations for the executive (branch) are not good. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Hill (Congress), academic community, the press and the  
Horman family, the intimations are of negligence on our part, or 
worse, complicity in Horman's death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The document made available to Mrs. Horman is part of a larger  
release planned today of government documents related to the 1973 
coup in Chile. The release came just hours after a British 
magistrate in London ruled that former Chilean dictator Augusto 
Pinochet be extradited to Spain to stand trial on charges of 
torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Garces, a Spanish lawyer who appeared with Mrs. Horman at a  
news conference, said he received the news from London with ``great 
satisfaction'' and that the verdict proves that dictators ``can't 
find refuge in any part of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet and his military officers overthrew Salvador Allende, a  
Marxist who had been chosen to lead Chile in a democratic election 
-- an election that caused the Nixon administration to fear that 
Chile could become a communist foothold in South America. 
</P>
<P>
	After Pinochet was arrested in London last October, President  
Clinton issued an order requiring government agencies to declassify 
U.S. documents relating to human rights abuses, terrorism and other 
acts of political violence in Chile between 1968 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 6,000 records were released in June. Today's release was  
to include about 350 documents from the State Department, 160 from 
the CIA, 115 from the National Archives, 430 from the FBI and 60 
from the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Kornbluh, senior analyst at the National Security Archive,  
a research group at George Washington University that gave the 
document to Mrs. Horman, criticized today's release of an estimated 
1,100 government documents, saying it excludes information about 
the CIA's own secret operations in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	``We adamantly believe that all U.S. records regarding the  
planning and actual efforts to block, undermine and overthrow the 
Allende government, which include kidnapping, coup plotting and 
other acts of political violence between 1970 to 1973'' should be 
released, Kornbluh wrote Monday in a letter to the National 
Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Kissinger, then Nixon's national security adviser, had  
insisted the United States had no direct involvement in the coup. 
</P>
<P>
	CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said the CIA is cooperating with  
the declassification project and will be searching files related to 
its own operations in Chile, including covert activities, and 
declassifying some of them in time for a third release of documents 
planned for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said  
those criticizing the CIA should wait until all documents are 
released before accusing the government of keeping certain 
information under wraps. ``The CIA is going to look at the 
operations files,'' Leavy said. ``There will be more coming out 
down the road.''

<HEADLINE> Indians' Starters Are No Joke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Dave Burba has Rodney Dangerfield's routine down  
pat, and the Indians pitcher will sometimes break into his 
impersonation of the disheveled comedian in the middle of 
Cleveland's clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	If Dangerfield had been watching the first two games of the AL  
division series between Cleveland and Boston he might say, ``I tell 
ya', the Indians pitching staff, they don't get no respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't think we have any pitching,'' Burba said Friday  
following the Indians' workout at Fenway Park. ``Throughout the 
year, that's all we heard. 'Cleveland doesn't have enough pitching 
to go anywhere. They'll never win with those guys.' Well, to me, 
you don't win 97 games without some kind of pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or the first two games in this series.  
</P>
<P>
	Burba, who rescued the Indians pitching out of the bullpen in  
last year's playoffs, will start Game 3 on Saturday against 
Boston's Ramon Martinez. Burba has a tough act to follow if the 
Indians intend to sweep the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartolo Colon and Charles Nagy have had consecutive strong  
starts for the Indians so far, but their performances have been 
overshadowed by Pedro Martinez's injury in Game 1 and Cleveland's 
10-run blowout in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	It figures. The Indians get some great pitching and nobody  
bothers to notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys have ripped our pitchers all year long,'' Indians  
catcher Sandy Alomar said. ``It's always been like that in 
Cleveland. Just because we score a lot of runs, people don't think 
we have any pitching. You don't get to the World Series twice in 
five years if you don't have good pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good. Not great. That has been the rap on the Indians' pitching  
staff all year. Without a clear-cut No. 1 starter among them, 
Cleveland's pitchers have become an easy target. 
</P>
<P>
	But few teams in baseball have the balance of Cleveland's  
starting rotation, or its bullpen depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a rotation of Cone, Clemens, Hernandez and  
Pettitte or Glavine, Maddux, Smoltz and Millwood,'' manager Mike 
Hargrove said. ``But our guys are good, solid pitchers. Charles 
Nagy won what, 17 games? Bartolo Colon won 18. Dave Burba won 15. 
That's three guys right there that are as good as anyone else has 
got. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a team with a dominant characteristic like we do  
with our offense, some of the parts of the puzzle will get 
overlooked. And that's what has happened with our pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston was supposed to have the advantage in this series because  
of its pitching. More specifically, because of the great Pedro 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has been Cleveland's pitching which has been dominant.  
</P>
<P>
	Colon and Nagy combined to hold the Red Sox to three runs and 10  
hits in 15 innings in the first two games, and Boston is batting 
just .188. Only Mike Stanley (five hits), Nomar Garciaparra (three) 
and Jose Offerman (three) have done anything against Cleveland. The 
rest of the Red Sox are 2-for-41. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the postseason has justified the Indians' decision not  
to trade for another starting pitcher to get them deeper into 
October. Curt Schilling, David Wells and Chuck Finley were among 
the pitchers rumored to be on their way to the Indians at some 
point in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a Randy Johnson on our staff,'' Burba said. ``And  
no Pedro. I guess we don't have a quote bonafide No. 1 starter. But 
I'd rather have our pitching staff than anybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burba said all the negative talk directed at the Indians'  
starters has motivated the group to shut down offenses and shut up 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of drives you,'' he said. ``You just want to go out  
there and prove that we have a good pitching staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians' clubhouse clown, Burba often uses his sense of  
humor to battle pregame nerves. Even on days he starts, he'll be 
his usual cut-up self until about an hour before gametime when he 
gets serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, he can now laugh about his major league debut,  
pitching for Seattle at Fenway Park in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can remember was that my legs were shaking so  
hard I didn't think I was going to be able to throw a baseball,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He's nervous again, but not afraid as he tries to put the  
Indians in their third straight ALCS. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have to go out and pitch like it's any other game,'' he  
said. ``I know it's important, but I have to stay focused. I can't 
have my mojo messed up.''

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Jersey Goes for $20,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A testicular cancer survivor has become the  
new owner of the yellow jersey Lance Armstrong won as Tour de 
France champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaine Rollins of Denver won Armstrong's jersey with a bid of  
$20,500 in an Internet auction that lasted 22 days, the same 
duration as the famous race. The auction benefitted the Lance 
Armstrong Foundation, which is dedicated to fighting urological 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rollins, 32, was diagnosed with testicular cancer in April 1998  
and recovered after surgery and chemotherapy one month later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was interested in the jersey because I was inspired by  
Lance's recovery and attempt to rejoin cycling after what he had 
been through,'' Rollins said. ``I am exited now to have a piece of 
one of the most inspiring sporting achievements of my time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 27, learned in 1996 that he had testicular cancer,  
which spread to his bones and brain. He underwent aggressive 
chemotherapy and three operations, and in February 1997 was 
cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Armstrong became the second American to win the Tour de  
France.

<HEADLINE> QBs At Center of Florida Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Quarterbacks always play a big role in  
the Miami-Florida State rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	That won't change Saturday, especially with the loss of No. 1  
Florida State's top two receivers, Heisman Trophy hopeful Peter 
Warrick and speedster Laveranues Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was indefinitely suspended following his arrest Thursday  
on charges he and Coles, who was kicked off the team, were allowed 
to underpay for clothes at a department store by about $391. They 
were arrested and charged with grand theft and could face up to 
five years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither player will be available for Saturday's game against the  
19th-ranked Hurricanes, leaving quarterback Chris Weinke to guide 
the Seminoles without his two of his best weapons. Meanwhile, Kenny 
Kelly, leading the 19th-ranked Hurricanes against one of the 
toughest defenses in the nation, will try to help Miami rebound 
from two straight losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The two quarterbacks will be key to their team's success. But  
that should be expected from this series, which as often as not in 
the past two decades has been key to deciding the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Heisman Trophy winners Charlie Ward of Florida State and Miami's  
Gino Torretta and Vinnie Testaverde all took their teams to 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Some other big names -- Jim Kelly, Bernie Kosar and Steve Walsh  
from Miami and Danny Kanell, Brad Johnson and Casey Weldon of 
Florida State -- have also been involved. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Weinke will be trying to take the Seminoles to a  
fifth straight victory in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly reminds Florida State coach Bobby Bowden of North  
Carolina's Ron Curry. Both are sophomores and very athletic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes his inexperience shows up,'' Bowden said. ``But he  
can hurt in a lot of different ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 195-pound Kelly has completed 52 of 98 passes for  
683 yards and five touchdowns, but has been intercepted eight 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kelly is in his first season as a starter, Weinke is  
midway through his second -- successfully coming back from a 
season-ending back injury last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He has completed 61.7 percent of his passes for 1,295 yards and  
11 touchdowns in Florida State's five victories. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's game at Miami, Weinke completed 17 of 32 passes  
for 316 yards and two touchdowns, with Warrick catching seven for 
190 yards, including a 62-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke, 27, has always had a tendency to look for Warrick first,  
but now he will have to count on less experienced receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks like he is playing with more maturity,'' Miami coach  
Butch Davis said. ``He is throwing with a lot more confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Ron Dugans, averaging 18.5 yards on 14 catches, is the  
most experienced receiver left. Senior Germaine Stringer and junior 
Marvin Minnis also will help replace Warrick. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Robert Morgan takes over for Coles, with backup help  
from freshmen Talman Gardner and Anquan Boldin. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden is convinced his team will be ready regardless of the  
week-long distraction surrounding Coles and Warrick. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids are really into it and playing well,'' Bowden said.  
``They are focused on Miami.''

<HEADLINE> JAMA Set To Name New Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A vice dean of Johns Hopkins University School of  
Medicine appears to be the leading candidate to become the new 
editor of the American Medical Association's influential journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources close to JAMA, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Thursday that they had learned Dr. Catherine D. DeAngelis 
would be named editor of the Journal of the American Medical 
Association, succeeding Dr. George Lundberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg's firing in January provoked a controversy over the  
journal's editorial independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA refused to confirm that DeAngelis was the pick. The AMA  
had been scheduled to introduce the journal's new editor at a news 
conference today in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	DeAngelis is the editor of the Archives of Pediatrics and  
Adolescent Medicine, published by the AMA, as well as a member of 
JAMA's editorial board. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached Thursday at her office at Johns Hopkins' medical school,  
where she is vice dean for academic affairs and faculty, she 
declined to confirm her selection. 
</P>
<P>
	JAMA has been run by interim co-editors since Lundberg's firing.  
He was dismissed after publishing in JAMA a survey of college 
students' sexual attitudes that coincided with President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	AMA executive vice president Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson felt  
Lundberg inappropriately injected the organization into a political 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg, who took a job as editor in chief for an online  
medical information site, was highly critical of the AMA after his 
firing, saying he had to battle AMA leaders, members and lobbyists 
to retain editorial independence of his publication. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA has since created a board to serve as a buffer between  
the editor in chief and the organization's management.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Premier Seeks Bigger Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi wants a planned extra  
budget for the current fiscal year to total at least $93 billion, 
Japan's top government spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said the prime minister has  
asked members of his cabinet to begin planning the stimulus 
package, which must be approved by Parliament in November. Approval 
is likely. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Ministry had proposed a day earlier that the  
government spend an extra $51 billion by the end of the fiscal year 
on March 31, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the proposal drew protests from politicians in Japan's  
three-party ruling coalition, who said the amount was too small to 
maintain the nation's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The $93 billion package suggested by Obuchi would likely include  
$32 billion for public work projects, Aoki said. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplementary stimulus package would follow a first extra  
budget of about $5 billion approved in July as a way to create 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese economy is just emerging from its worst downturn in  
decades, and the government has begun a massive spending campaign 
to keep the economy moving and get people to consume more.

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate plunged into debate on a global  
nuclear test-ban treaty today and Democrats immediately served 
notice they will move to put off a vote indefinitely rather than 
face near-certain defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the march toward a vote ``pigheaded,'' Senate Minority  
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters today that negotiations 
were continuing with Republican leaders in hopes of postponing the 
vote now scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Should they fail, Democrats will make use of a seldom-used  
parliamentary procedure that would force the Senate out of it's 
treaty-considering mode and block further action on the treaty, 
Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would require only a 51-vote majority, rather than  
the two-thirds majority -- or 67 votes -- needed to ratify a treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said he believed he could win enough Republican support  
for the move to prevail, since some influential Republicans who 
oppose the treaty have been among those calling for a delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that U.S. allies in Europe were condemning the Senate for  
moving toward expected rejection of the treaty, Daschle said, ``We 
ought to get real about how we debate something of this import. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our allies ... think we're nuts,'' Daschle said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, senators debated the merits of the Comprehensive Test  
Ban Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, one of only two Republicans  
who have indicated they support the pact, told colleagues the 
treaty was one of the most important international agreements of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not expect it to be ratified,'' Specter said. ``The  
picture is clear that there are not enough senators to provide the 
two-thirds constitutional margin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., an opponent, said the treaty ``will  
prevent us from making our weapons as safe as they can be and it 
will not stop proliferation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the administration appealed for a delay. Secretary  
of State Madeleine Albright said rejection of the treaty ``would be 
a national security tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But despite her blunt words to the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, and an appeal by President Clinton to ``do what's right 
for America,'' the Senate went ahead with debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., indicated a final vote is  
still planned on the treaty as early as Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty needs 67 votes to be ratified, or a two-thirds  
majority, if all 100 senators vote. But it has generated scant 
Republican support and even supporters concede they could be 15-20 
votes short. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Republicans who often side with the administration  
on international matters have joined in opposing the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The treaty is flawed with an ineffective verification regime  
and a practically nonexistent enforcement process,'' said Sen. Dick 
Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee 
and former vice chairman of the Senate Arms Control Observer Group. 
</P>
<P>
	In an article published today in The New York Times, French  
President Jacques Chirac, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and 
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder urged the Senate to approve the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decisions we take now will help determine, for generations  
to come, the safety of the world we bequeath to our children,'' 
they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to ratify the treaty, the three leaders warned, ``will  
be a failure in our struggle against proliferation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, in her Senate testimony, noted that presidents have  
been seeking some form of a nuclear test ban since President 
Eisenhower in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	She said ``the leadership ought to find a way to give the treaty  
the careful consideration it deserves at a later date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,  
said if Clinton wants to call off the vote, he must request the 
treaty be withdrawn from consideration until after next year's 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has languished before the Senate for two years. But  
the Foreign Relations Committee held its first hearing on the pact 
just Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rush to a vote, orchestrated by Lott and Helms, angered  
Senate Democrats. And it put them in the awkward position of now 
seeking a delay on the treaty they have long advocated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anyone in this chamber seriously believe we can give the  
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty the consideration it deserves in the 
amount of time that has been set aside to debate it?'' said Sen. 
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, Clinton invoked ``moral responsibility'' in  
seeking to reverse the tide running against the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``future generations won't forgive us if we fail that  
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was not trying to ``beat up'' Republican  
opponents but was asking that ``we do what is in the national 
interest. Let's just do what's right for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate votes on and rejects the treaty next week, it  
would be the first time an arms control pact was turned down on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	However, President Carter withdrew an arms reduction treaty --  
SALT I -- from the Senate in 1980 after the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan made the treaty's rejection likely.

<HEADLINE> Self-Destructing E-mail Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In the future, e-mail may bear the  
following warning: This message will self-destruct in five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, maybe it won't disappear THAT fast. But a startup  
high-tech firm, Disappearing Inc., has developed a way to put 
time-bombs in e-mail messages, ensuring that they are readable only 
as long as the sender wants them to be. 
</P>
<P>
	That means gooey love messages sent on company time, defamatory  
gossip or top-secret documents won't be able to be easily traced, 
as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Encrypted e-mail is as good as disappeared,'' said Kevin  
Werback, managing editor of high-tech newsletter Release 1.0. ``The 
National Security Agency might be able to crack it with a 
supercomputer, but you couldn't read it, and that's good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of people presume e-mail is secure.  
</P>
<P>
	But in terms of privacy, e-mail is ``a lot more like a post card  
than it ever has been like a letter,'' said Kerry C. Stackpole, the 
president and CEO of the Electronic Messaging Association, a trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Once e-mail is created, it is virtually impossible to erase from  
computers, and experts can reconstruct even deleted messages. Such 
work helped nab Oliver North in the Iran-Contra affair, which saw 
profits of arms sales to Iran funneled to Nicaraguan guerillas. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system, which should be available early next year,  
encrypts each message with an electronic key, also held by the 
receiver. The sender can decide how long the key will work -- 
anywhere from a few seconds to years. After that, the key 
self-destructs and the message becomes unreadable. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, however, only works if both the sender and the  
recipient want the message to disappear. Send harassing e-mail, and 
the recipient could easily print the message or copy it to another 
file before the key self-destructs, Werbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappearing Inc. co-founder Dave Marvit says he came up with  
the idea after listening to speakers at a conference describe all 
the things one should not say in e-mail.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Apologizes for Irish Comment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Acknowledging a gaffe, President Clinton  
apologized. He said he didn't mean to offend anyone by comparing 
the troubled peace process in Northern Ireland to a ``couple of 
drunks'' who can't leave a bar. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of Northern Ireland's most  
hard-line Protestant party, the Democratic Unionists, called 
Clinton's metaphor an insult to the people of Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, appearing at the inauguration of the U.S. Embassy  
building here on Friday, described how he had spent ``enormous 
amounts of time'' to get the people of Northern Ireland to ``get 
over 600 years of religious fights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he added:  
</P>
<P>
	``And every time they make an agreement to do it,'' he  
continued, ``they're like a couple of drunks walking out of the bar 
for the last time. When they get to the swinging door, they turn 
around and go back in and say, 'I just can't quite get there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The critical reaction from across the Atlantic was swift,  
forcing the White House to issue a statement in the president's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earlier today, in a discussion of the Irish peace process, I  
used a metaphor that was inappropriate,'' said Clinton in the 
statement. ``I want to express my regret for any offense my remark 
caused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The major Catholic-supported party in Northern Ireland, the  
pacifist Social Democratic and Labor Party, called the remark 
``obviously off the cuff'' and said it ``reflected the reality that 
the president, like so many of us, is justifiably frustrated with 
the slow pace of progress in implementing the Good Friday agreement 
in full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paisley, whose party opposes the Good Friday peace accord, but  
is entitled to posts within the Protestant-Catholic administration 
that local politicians have been trying to create, was less 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a highly offensive and insulting remark to the people  
of Northern Ireland,'' Paisley declared 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said in  
Washington that Clinton was expressing his frustration at all sides 
in the Northern Ireland dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the president didn't mean to cause offense to any  
group of people, but he is clearly frustrated that both sides can't 
seize this moment of peace and make progress in implementing the 
Good Friday accords,'' Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the peace process has been ``mired in issues for  
far too long.''

<HEADLINE> Twins Keep Radke, but Not Cordova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Twins exercised their $3.5  
million option on ace Brad Radke on Friday and also said good-bye 
to Marty Cordova, whose career has nose-dived after earning AL 
Rookie of the Year honors in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordova and infielder Brent Gates chose to become free agents  
rather than accept outright assignments to Triple-A Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins had twice placed Cordova waivers this season but no  
team was willing to take on his salary of $3 million this season 
and $4 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Radke, 26, was 12-14 with a 3.75 ERA for the Twins, who were  
ordered by owner Carl Pohlad to slash payroll to $16.8 million this 
season and finished last in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
	Pohlad agreed Thursday to sell the team to sports investors Glen  
Taylor and Robert Naegele Jr. for $120 million, contingent on a new 
outdoor stadium in St. Paul being approved by voters and lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins could have declined Radke's 2000 option and paid a  
$300,000 buyout. But he is one of precious few stars on a team that 
played 18 rookies this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Radke agreed in March 1997 to a $4.3 million, three-year  
contract, including the buyout. Friday's move makes it a $7.5 
million, four-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Radke, who was third in the AL with just 1.8 walks per nine  
innings, had four complete games, walked 44 and struck out 121 in 
33 starts for the Twins. He led the staff in wins and innings 
pitched (218 1-3) and he had the fourth-best ERA in the American 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	Radke is 44-38 over the last three seasons with a 3.96 ERA, 13  
complete games, 135 walks and 441 strikeouts in 100 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordova, 30, hit .285 with 14 homers and 70 RBIs in 124 games  
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting .277 with 24 homers, 84 RBIs and 20 stolen bases  
as a rookie, Cordova hit .309 with 16 homers and 111 RBIs in 1996 
and appeared headed for stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	But a foot injury plagued him during 1997 and '98, when he hit  
.246 with 15 homers and 51 RBIs and .253 with 10 homers and 69 
RBIs, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he became a 30-year-old on a team of twentysomethings and  
watched rookie outfielders Jacque Jones, Chad Allen and Torii 
Hunter get more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, 29, batted .255 with three homers and 38 RBIs this  
season. He signed as a free agent before the 1998 season and had 
six homers and 80 RBIs in two years.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo's benchmark stock index closed lower Friday  
on profit-taking following six consecutive sessions of gains. The 
dollar traded lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 74.37  
points, or 0.41 percent, to end the day at 18,062.18. The average 
closed up 240.13 points, or 1.34 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar was trading at 107.72 yen, down 0.20 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but above its level of 107.49 yen late 
Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices opened lower on profit-taking and a report in the  
Nihon Keizai economic daily that the three-party ruling coalition 
agreed to call on the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too much pressure on the BOJ is not necessarily good,'' said  
Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ has come under intense pressure for a monetary easing as  
the yen has surged against the dollar in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese currency has strengthened largely on optimism that  
the economy is recovering from its worst slump in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese authorities fear, however, that too strong a yen could  
hurt that recovery by making Japanese products more expensive 
overseas, thus damaging the earnings of exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Players expected the market to remain cautious ahead of a  
central bank policy board meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down  
51.29, or 0.5 percent, at 10,537.05 on Thursday as investors took 
profits and awaited Friday's release of U.S. jobless figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 5.79 points, or 0.38 percent, to finish at 
1,530.83. The TOPIX closed up 12.51 points, or 0.83 percent, the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar fell as traders awaited the Bank  
of Japan meeting next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's decline followed comments by Japanese Prime  
Minister Keizo Obuchi and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that an 
extra budget planned for later this fiscal year will probably 
exceed $92 billion, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government spending is expected to help support Japan's  
nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 115.34 yen at  
mid-afternoon, down from 115.38 yen late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7600 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.7350 percent. Its 
price fell 0.21 points to 99.48.

<HEADLINE> Court Renews Fundraising Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court reinstated  
false-statement charges Friday against a Thai businesswoman accused 
of funneling foreign contributions to the Democratic National 
Committee and other political committees. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
reinstated the charges against Pauline Kanchanalak and her 
sister-in-law and business associate, Duangnet ``Georgie'' 
Kronenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	They were indicted last year by the Justice Department's  
campaign finance task force. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are accused of using funds from foreign corporations and  
individuals -- including Kanchanalak and her husband, Jeb -- to make 
prohibited campaign contributions of at least $679,000 to the DNC 
and other U.S. political committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreigners are barred from giving what is known as ``hard''  
money intended for federal campaigns. Kanchanalak is a Thai 
citizen, while Kronenberg is a permanent resident alien and is 
entitled to make political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's appeals court ruling determined that citizens of  
foreign countries also are barred from giving ``soft'' money, which 
is money not intended for a particular federal campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanchanalak and Kronenberg were charged with one count of  
conspiracy to defraud the government by disguising the true source 
of the funds, plus multiple counts of causing the Democratic 
National Committee and other political committees to file false 
reports with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the false-statement charges except one count against  
Kronenberg were dismissed in two rulings late last year and early 
this year by U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman said prosecutors failed to show Kanchanalak and  
Kronenberg had a significant role in the submission of statements 
to the FEC by the Democratic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also said disclosure rules did not require political  
committees to reveal the original sources of ``soft'' money. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman based part of his ruling on an earlier decision that  
threw out much of the Justice Department's cases against another 
defendant in the foreign money probe, Maria Hsia. But a District of 
Columbia Circuit panel reversed that decision in May. 
</P>
<P>
	In reinstating all of the charges Friday, the appeals court said  
the decision in May required reinstatement of charges against 
Kanchanalak and Kronenberg related to hard-money donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The court added that a federal election reporting regulation  
requires reporting of the ``true sources'' of soft-money donations, 
and that the election law forbids foreign donations of soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an effort to enhance its ability to prohibit the illegal  
commingling of hard and soft money receipts, the FEC required 
identifying information for the donors of both to assist it in 
tracking the flow of funds between the two,'' wrote Judge Patricia 
Wald, a nominee of President Carter. She referred at one point to 
the defendants' ``apocalyptic reasoning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her opinion was joined by Judges Laurence H. Silberman, a  
President Reagan appointee, and David Tatel, named to the court by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanchanalak's lawyer did not immediately return a call seeking  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Sharks Off to Best Start Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Granted, the season is young. Still, the  
San Jose Sharks are off to a special start. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mike Ricci scored his second goal of the game, in overtime  
Thursday night, the Sharks not only beat the Edmonton Oilers 3-2 
but extended their season-opening run to three straight wins, the 
team's strongest start in their eight-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to chase teams all year, we want teams to chase  
us,'' said San Jose right wing Owen Nolan, who has scored at least 
one goal in each of the first three games and has five overall 
after collecting only 19 all last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a stronger team now. The majority of the guys were here  
last year and know the system. This win is a great builder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose has been a more offensive team so far this season while  
getting strong play in goal from Mike Vernon and Steve Shields. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricci, meanwhile, was the eighth player to score this season for  
the Sharks, who have outscored the opposition 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose's power play, which struggled last season, also has  
been much more effective. The Sharks have converted seven of 21 
power-play chances, including two Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what you want,'' said Sharks defenseman Gary Suter,  
healthy again after missing virtually all last season with a torn 
triceps tendon. ``A good power play is going to win a lot of 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest victory illustrated that point.  
</P>
<P>
	Ricci's game-winner came on a power-play goal, San Jose's second  
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take advantage of others' mistakes,'' Ricci said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks skated with the man advantage throughout the extra  
period after Josef Beranek drew a five-minute major and game 
misconduct for checking rookie defenseman Brad Stuart from behind 
into the boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing with confidence,'' Edmonton coach Kevin Lowe  
said. ``Talent-wise, they are a little more skilled than they 
started last season. And that has translated into some early 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan in particular and the Sharks as a whole have benefited  
from the re-signing of playmaking center Vincent Damphousse. A late 
season acquisition from Montreal last year, Damphousse returned to 
San Jose rather than pursue other free agency offers and he has 
helped convert the Sharks' once-sputtering offense into a 
productive unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Wing Jeff Friesen and center Patrick Marleau also have benefited  
from the presence of the veteran Damphousse, who has at least one 
assist in each of the first three games and six overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen a player like Vinny since Igor Larionov was  
here,'' Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said. ``He's a better 
player than I ever thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks, who never have finished a season above .500, have a  
chance to complete their opening four-game homestand with a perfect 
record Saturday night. However, they'll be facing the defending 
Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars.

<HEADLINE> Harnischfeger May Sell Beloit Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Harnischfeger Industries Inc. is considering  
selling its Beloit Corp. unit, which manufactures equipment used in 
papermaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnischfeger, of suburban St. Francis, has received some  
interest in all or part of Beloit, the company said Friday in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnischfeger, the world's largest producer of mining equipment,  
owns 80 percent of the Beloit Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnischfeger's announcement came about four months after it  
filed for financial reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Beloit announced plans to close its manufacturing  
operations in Beloit and Rockton, Ill., cutting 350 jobs. The 
company cited a soft Asian market and poor demand for its 
papermaking equipment as reasons for the cuts that are expected to 
be completed by Jan. 31, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Beloit sales have fallen to $830 million last year from nearly  
$1.3 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline at Beloit Corp. has been a factor in 115-year-old  
Harnischfeger's mounting losses, which reached $90.7 million in the 
first six months of fiscal 1999, just before the company filed for 
bankruptcy.

	Prosecutors told jurors that Mrs. Bush fabricated illnesses in  
her daughter, Jennifer, now 12, in an attempt to gain attention and 
sympathy for herself. Psychiatrists call the phenomenon Munchausen 
syndrome by proxy, but the judge didn't allow prosecutors to use 
the specific term. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense told the jury that the daughter was chronically ill  
with a rare gastrointestinal disorder and was not properly treated 
by the medical profession. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the state started investigating in April 1996,  
Jennifer had been hospitalized 200 times and had undergone about 40 
operations, including removal of her gall bladder, appendix and a 
portion of her intestines. 
</P>
<P>
	She hasn't been hospitalized since she was taken from her  
mother. Her family has not been allowed to visit since May. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer's father, Craig Bush, emotionally leapt to Mrs. Bush's  
defense after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's innocent. There hasn't been justice served,'' Bush said.  
``They've broken up a beautiful family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Robert Buschel criticized the jury and blasted  
the medical basis laid out in the legal proceeding. He called the 
concept of Munchausen syndrome by proxy ``voodoo psychology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But juror Steve Jordan noted the large amount of evidence  
presented in the three-month trial, including the child's medical 
history and testimony from doctors and nurses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just one thing after another,'' Jordan said. ``It was  
just building block on top of building block, and there was really 
no way to refute it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Mrs. Bush nor her daughter Jennifer was called as a  
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Mrs. Bush did everything she could to keep her  
daughter Jennifer sick, even altering her medicine to exacerbate 
her symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing is set for Nov. 12.

<HEADLINE> Nev. Citizen Group Calls Off Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A federal judge has blocked a citizens' group  
from rebuilding a remote mountain road, a project that state and 
local officials feared might lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge David Hagen issued a temporary restraining  
order Thursday night barring state Assemblyman John Carpenter's 
plan to lead up to 1,000 people with pickaxes and shovels to the 
road near the Jarbidge River this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Only hours after vowing to defy the order, Carpenter said Friday  
that he would comply. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not defy the order,'' the Republican from Elko said.  
``We will not break the law. The work party has been canceled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities contend the road is on federal land and said  
the order was necessary to protect the southernmost population of 
bull trout in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute involves a 1 1/2-mile section of road that leads to a  
campground and outhouse in the Humboldt Toiyabe-National Forest. 
Elko County and the federal government have been odds since a flood 
washed the road out in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service decided not to rebuild the road after the  
flood because eroding soil could foul the river and threaten the 
bull trout, now protected under the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general asked Elko County officials to help  
stop what was feared could become a rebellion in the remote 
historic mining town. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said only that he would help keep the peace.

<HEADLINE> JAMA Set To Name New Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A vice dean of Johns Hopkins University School of  
Medicine appears to be the leading candidate to become the new 
editor of the American Medical Association's influential journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources close to JAMA, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Thursday that they had learned Dr. Catherine D. DeAngelis 
would be named editor of the Journal of the American Medical 
Association, succeeding Dr. George Lundberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg's firing in January provoked a controversy over the  
journal's editorial independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA refused to confirm that DeAngelis was the pick. The AMA  
had been scheduled to introduce the journal's new editor at a news 
conference today in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	DeAngelis is the editor of the Archives of Pediatrics and  
Adolescent Medicine, published by the AMA, as well as a member of 
JAMA's editorial board. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached Thursday at her office at Johns Hopkins' medical school,  
where she is vice dean for academic affairs and faculty, she 
declined to confirm her selection. 
</P>
<P>
	JAMA has been run by interim co-editors since Lundberg's firing.  
He was dismissed after publishing in JAMA a survey of college 
students' sexual attitudes that coincided with President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	AMA executive vice president Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson felt  
Lundberg inappropriately injected the organization into a political 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg, who took a job as editor in chief for an online  
medical information site, was highly critical of the AMA after his 
firing, saying he had to battle AMA leaders, members and lobbyists 
to retain editorial independence of his publication. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA has since created a board to serve as a buffer between  
the editor in chief and the organization's management.

	Gandhi May Face Erosion of Power  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- After years of decline, the Congress  
party pinned its hopes on Sonia Gandhi to help it return to power, 
hoping to draw strength from the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty -- instead, it 
suffered its worst drubbing at the polls. Although Mrs. Gandhi 
easily won both seats she contested, her party lost parliamentary 
elections to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's alliance. ``We 
accept unhesitatingly the verdict of the people,'' Mrs. Gandhi said 
in a statement carried by the Press Trust of India news agency. 
``The results call for introspection, frank assessment and 
determined action. We will attend to this in the coming days.''

	Mexico Tries To Account for Dead  
</P>
<P>
	TEZIUTLAN, Mexico (AP) -- Now that rains have given way to gray  
skies in most of the Mexico's flooded region, officials are trying 
to get a full accounting of the dead. They say 166 are confirmed 
dead here in Puebla state alone and the toll is expected rise. 
Mudslides killed 22 in Chiconcuautla villages, 22 more in 
Camocuautla and uncounted others in dozens of obscure towns, where 
roads were washed away by the storms, frustrating rescue efforts. 
Right now, Mexican officials say the total dead is at least 218.

	London Train Crash Victims Mourned  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Laying flowers and saying prayers, a few dozen  
mourners transformed a mass of twisted metal, charred human remains 
and scattered belongings into a memorial yesterday at the site of a 
massive train collision. They sobbed and hugged each other in a 
quiet, heartwrenching display of grief. In the commuter town of 
Reading, dozens of people waited for police to confirm the loss of 
a loved one still missing from Tuesday's crash. A bouquet lay in 
the town center with a note attached: ``Daddy come home I love you 
Clare.''

	Democrats Hail HMO Bill's Passage  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proclaiming a big victory on patients' rights,  
House Democrats celebrated passage of a sweeping bill meant to rein 
in HMOs, while acknowledging that it could be difficult to get the 
Senate to go along. The bipartisan measure was approved yesterday 
by a wide margin, 275-151, giving House Democrats virtually 
everything they wanted, including a patient's right to sue, but 
setting up potentially contentious negotiations with the Senate, 
which passed a considerably more modest version earlier this year. 
All sides agreed that the politically charged battle to give 
patients more leverage against HMOs was far from over.

	Pinochet Ruling Due in London  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- After nearly a year in custody for Augusto  
Pinochet and four major court decisions, the latest ruling in the 
case against the former dictator may still not be the final word on 
whether he can immediately return home or must face trial in Spain. 
A London magistrate is due to rule today on whether the 83-year-old 
general should be extradited to Spain to stand trial on torture 
charges, in a case that has sparked strong emotions in Britain and 
Chile. Both sides, however, can launch appeals, which means that no 
matter how Deputy Chief Magistrate Ronald Bartle rules, Pinochet 
will likely remain under house arrest in London for a while longer.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal agencies responsible for approving  
genetically engineered crops and biotech foods insist they can 
prevent products from getting to market that could be dangerous to 
consumers or the environment. ``We're very confident about the 
assurances that are put forward,'' said James Maryanski, 
biotechnology coordinator for the Food and Drug Administration's 
food safety office. Jane Anderson, an EPA official, told the Senate 
Agriculture Committee yesterday that the government's regulatory 
system ``is based on the most rigorous scientific information

environment and public health.''

Casino against April Fowler, a veteran of one pro fight. Laila 
promised that her infectious smile, which lit up a room full of 
microphones and cameras, would soon disappear. ``When you see me 
tomorrow, you're going to see a whole 'nother look,'' she promised. 
``Right now, I have cameras in my face and I'm a very charming 
person. That other side of me is showing, but tomorrow is going to 
be a whole 'nother story.'' The 27-year-old Fowler was not 
impressed.

<HEADLINE> Sentences Upheld in Gandhi Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The Supreme Court rejected an appeal  
today by three Tamil men and a woman sentenced to die for the 
assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, a domestic 
news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Gandhi was blown up by a suicide bomber who strapped explosives  
to her waist and mingled with crowds in the southern town of 
Sriperumbudur during a campaign rally for the 1991 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 ruling, the court confirmed the death sentences of S.  
Nalini, T. Suthendraraja, V. Sriharan and G. Perarivalan, who were 
among 26 defendants sentenced to death last year after a six-year 
trial in a special court in the southern city of Madras, the Press 
Trust of India reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court has set aside the death sentences for the  
other 22 defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The three judges concurred on the death penalty for the three  
men, but one judge wanted to commute Ms. Nalini's death sentence to 
life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	The four now have the option of appealing to President K.R.  
Narayanan. If he refuses to commute their sentences, they will be 
hanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court had agreed to review their appeal two days  
before their schedule execution date of June 9. 
</P>
<P>
	A government commission of inquiry pointed to a conspiracy by  
Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels in the assassination. The trial court 
upheld that view. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the Tamil Tigers, Velupillai Prabhakaran, has been  
indicted in the case, but he has eluded arrest in the jungles of 
northern Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Mailings Net Many Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley is raising about $4 for every $1  
he spends on direct mail, an unusually high success rate that has 
helped him take in more money than Vice President Al Gore during 
the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has spent $237,000 on mailings that brought in $1.05  
million in campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Many candidates often lose money when they send out letters in  
search of contributions, considering it an investment in building a 
donor list that they can use again and again. In presidential 
elections, such a list is doubly valuable because the government 
will match contributions of $250 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, candidates have to send out thousands of solicitations  
just to find a few donors; more than 95 percent of those who 
receive requests for donations simply throw the letter away. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why list building and list development and that fund  
raising is so expensive,'' fund-raising consultant Keith Davis 
said. ``The return is so low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley has defied the odds, according to the fund-raising  
figures released by his campaign. He has raised an estimated $6.7 
million during the last three months to $6.5 million for Gore and 
has found more than 25,000 people willing to give to his campaign 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributors responded to letters like this one: ``While the  
pundits and pollsters see my race as an uphill climb, countless 
Democrats and other voters refuse to see this contest decided 
before they've had a chance to speak. If you are among them, then I 
urge you to join me in fighting for a vision of leadership that can 
carry our values, and our party, to victory in November 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A supporter of overhauling the campaign finance laws, Bradley  
noted in his fund-raising letters that he is not accepting 
political action committee contributions. In fact, neither is Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the $1 million in direct mail contributions, Bradley has  
raised another $760,000 through his campaign web site. Bradley 
successfully asked the Federal Election Commission earlier this 
year to allow donations made by credit card -- the only way someone 
can contribute through the Internet -- to be eligible for federal 
matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows there is a steadily growing level of grassroots  
support for Bill Bradley,'' campaign spokesman Tony Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bradley is already asking his new friends to give again.  
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to people who already gave, Bradley predicted the  
nomination in both parties may be wrapped up by March, a timetable 
he said he can accept. ``But I must have your financial help now,'' 
he wrote.''

<HEADLINE> Cornell Gets $100 Million Gift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- An anonymous donor is giving Cornell  
University $100 million to build new residence halls and student 
commons. 
</P>
<P>
	The gift matches the largest single gift in the Ivy League  
school's history and is the 23rd donation of $100 million or more 
given to an American college, according to the Chronicle of Higher 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
	The pledge is expected to cover about half the cost of new  
housing planned on Cornell's West Campus. The university also has 
set aside $65 million to build two new dormitories on its North 
Campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``This extraordinary commitment will play a major role in our  
goal to make Cornell the best research university for undergraduate 
education in the world,'' Cornell President Hunter R. Rawlings said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Sanford I. Weill, co-chairman of Citigroup Inc., and  
his wife, Joan, pledged $100 million to support Cornell's medical 
school in New York.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises 'United Canada' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Tending neighborly relations, President Clinton  
dedicated a new embassy, agreed on exchanging military technology 
and went golfing with Canada's prime minister Friday. He met 
briefly with Quebec's separatist premier but said the United States 
values ``a strong and united Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Full of praise for his hosts on his one-day visit, Clinton said,  
``We look to you. We learn from you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the technology agreement, Clinton and Prime Minister  
Jean Chretien talked about trade, nuclear proliferation and 
peacekeeping in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	At the dedication of the embassy -- a rectangular  
glass-and-chrome structure adjacent to Parliament and Canada's 
national museum of art -- Clinton warmed the crowd with a few words 
in French. 
</P>
<P>
	``Je suis chez moi au Canada,'' he said, meaning ``I am at home  
in Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Clinton and Chretien headed to a new ski resort in  
Quebec's Mont Treblant area, about 90 miles north of Montreal, for 
a conference on federalism -- and an afternoon of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	At the federalism conference, Clinton spent about 15 minutes  
privately with Quebec's premier, Lucien Bouchard. An administration 
official said they had ``a friendly, informal chat'' in which the 
subject of sovereignty in Quebec never came up. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's speech at the conference was laced with strong  
defenses of federalism. He said it is better for nations to work 
out problems with unhappy segments of their societies than to allow 
those factions to break away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where there are dissatisfied groups in sections of countries,  
we should be looking for ways to satisfy anxieties and legitimate 
complaint without disintegration, I believe,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not make direct reference to Quebec, a French-speaking  
province of 7 million that is frustrated with the Canadian federal 
system and, in 1995, came close to voting to split away. Bouchard's 
government, dedicated to independence, was re-elected less than a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Clinton cited East Timor as an example, saying that  
region now faces tremendous difficulties because it broke away from 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does that mean they were wrong? No. Under the circumstances  
they faced, they probably made the only decision they could have,'' 
Clinton said. ``But wouldn't it have been better if they could have 
found their religious, their cultural, their ethnic and their 
economic footing in genuine self-government in the framework of a 
larger entity, which would also have supported them economically?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he heaped praise on Chretien's administration, saying the  
diversity reflected in Canada's culture and government was a 
tribute to ``what democracy must be about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the United States, we have valued our relationship with a  
strong and united Canada,'' Clinton said. ``We look to you. We 
learn from you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president paid his fifth visit to Canada at the invitation  
of Chretien, who said he wanted Clinton to address the federalism 
conference because he has been both a national and a state leader. 
It was the 23rd time Clinton and Chretien have met since Clinton 
took office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quebec issue did not come up during their latest discussion,  
Clinton told reporters after their meeting, and Chretien broke off 
questions on the subject with a curt ``Thank you. Next?'' Clinton 
went on to say U.S. policy is unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense technology agreement preserves license-free access  
to defense and aerospace technology, and allows for easier exchange 
of technical data. It seeks to allay U.S. concern over the 
potential export of American defense secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always important, when you have a problem, to find a  
solution,'' Chretien said. ``And we found a solution. That's all.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The nation's biggest mutual fund firm is extending  
its retail trading hours, allowing online investors to buy and sell 
securities long after the market's closing bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston-based Fidelity Investments will extend hours for online  
trading from 4:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., starting early next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes just days after Charles Schwab, one of Fidelity's  
biggest competitors in the discount online brokerage industry, 
announced similar plans. Taken together, the two announcements 
represent a significant increase in the potential number of 
after-hours traders. 
</P>
<P>
	``After-hours trading is a service that is of great interest to  
our involved, active traders,'' said Tracey Curvey, executive vice 
president of Fidelity's online brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity will allow investors to place limit orders -- to buy  
stocks at or below a set price -- for Nasdaq securities, and for a 
limited number of New York Stock Exchange securities. Clients must 
buy minimum round lots of 100 shares.

<HEADLINE> Voice Mail on Net Coming Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Voice mail on the Internet? E-mail over the  
phone? 
</P>
<P>
	Both are emerging, as the line separating phones and computers  
continues to blur. New products and services will let callers leave 
messages as e-mail attachments or check e-mail by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think voice is going to be the next wave of the Internet,''  
said Judy Radlinsky, spokeswoman for General Magic, which featured 
both services at the Internet World conference that ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jfax.com and eFax.com are among the other companies offering  
voice e-mail. Some of the services have been available for a few 
months; others were introduced at the show this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers use a special number to leave a voice message, and it  
pops up as an e-mail. Recipients can listen to messages from the 
computer or by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawback: they need separate numbers.  
</P>
<P>
	Regular voice mail services offered by phone companies  
automatically transfer unanswered or busy calls to the voice mail 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	With Internet-based services, callers must make a second call,  
or recipients must subscribe to a call-forwarding service from the 
phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Jfax and eFax also offer services that translate faxes to  
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is you're a moving target,'' said Josh Mailman, an  
eFax product demonstrator. ``The easier you can be found, capture 
and get your information, the better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet World, a five-day conference sponsored by publishers of  
Internet World magazine, brings together Internet companies ranging 
from Microsoft Corp. to the smallest startups. The show is now in 
its seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's offerings largely targeted other Internet companies,  
but a handful of products were designed specifically for consumers 
or business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancestry.com Inc., for instance, offers databases with 400  
million names to help people trace their family roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Handspring Inc. and Palm Computing Inc. also showed off their  
latest handheld organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service had a presence as well, handing out  
brochures on electronic filing of tax returns and giving away 
CD-ROMs featuring forms and publications for tax year 1998. No 
matter that returns were due April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Several services targeted the growing e-commerce business. Some  
help companies set up online retail operations. Others offer 
digital cash systems that let buyers shop from different merchants 
without having to enter a credit card number each time.

<HEADLINE> Mets 9, Diamondbacks 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets lost Mike Piazza long before  
the first pitch. That was about the only thing that went wrong for 
them Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets overcame the absence of their cleanup hitter, with John  
Olerud driving in three runs and keying a big sixth inning for a 
9-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks and a 2-1 lead in the NL 
division series. 
</P>
<P>
	With Piazza's banged-up left thumb in a cast -- it's not broken,  
but his status for the rest of playoffs is uncertain -- the Mets 
managed to win without their All-Star catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Reed, pitching to backup Todd Pratt, worked six strong  
innings. After Olerud and Darryl Hamilton hit two-run singles in 
the sixth, the Mets' bullpen and a loud crowd of 56,180 closed out 
the first postseason game at Shea Stadium since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, New York gets its chance to advance to the next round  
Saturday afternoon in Game 4. Al Leiter, who pitched a shutout in 
the wild-card playoff against Cincinnati, starts for the Mets 
against Brian Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Rickey Henderson had three hits, including an RBI single, and  
stole his sixth base of the series for the Mets. Benny Agbayani, 
batting cleanup for the first time in his major league career, 
added two hits and Pratt drew two walks and scored a run. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner Ward had a two-run, pinch-hit homer for the Diamondbacks,  
but little else went right for them. Arizona hurt itself by making 
three errors and issuing six walks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Plesac, who began his major league career in 1986, made his  
first postseason appearance and it was a disaster. Brought on to 
retire left-handed hitters -- they batted .186 against him this year 
-- he gave up the game-breaking singles to Olerud and Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Daal beat Reed twice in the regular season, but could not  
duplicate that success. 
</P>
<P>
	Agbayani led off the second with a single and a two-out walk to  
Pratt -- ``I'm no Mike,'' he said before the game, referring to 
Piazza's 40 home runs and 124 RBIs -- set up an RBI single by Rey 
Ordonez. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets made it 3-0 in the third on Olerud's RBI single and a  
run-scoring grounder by Robin Ventura. Arizona had a chance to turn 
an inning-ending double play on Ventura's ball, but shortstop Andy 
Fox overthrew Daal covering first base. Daal pounded his hand on 
the dirt as the ball sailed out of play. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward batted for Daal and homered in the fifth. That was the lone  
mistake by Reed, who allowed four hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud struck out with the bases loaded to end the fourth, then  
the Mets put it away in the sixth against Darren Holmes and Plesac. 
Walks to Pratt and pinch-hitter Bobby Bonilla set up Henderson's 
RBI single, and Plesac allowed run-scoring hits by Olerud, Roger 
Cedeno and Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Plesac pitched 822 games in regular-season play before  
making the postseason. Mets reliever John Franco and Plesac ranked 
1-2 among active players without postseason appearances. ... 
Ordonez, who closed the regular season with a major league-record 
100 straight errorless games by a shortstop, made the play of the 
night. Skidding into the hole, the Gold Glover grabbed Matt 
Williams' grounder and threw him out leading off the sixth. ... 
Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax watched from a box near the Mets' 
first-base dugout. In the last couple of years, he has offered 
pitching tips to Leiter. ... Reed threw a wild pitch in the first. 
It was just his third wild pitch in 837 innings in the majors. ... 
The Diamondbacks swept a three-game series at Shea in late May. ... 
A conductor on the No. 7 subway train made this announcement: 
``Next stop, Shea Stadium, home of the 1999 world champion Mets.'' 
... In the previous postseason action at Shea, Kirk Gibson homered 
as Los Angeles beat the Mets 7-4 in Game 5 of the NLCS on Oct. 10, 
1988. Lenny Dykstra homered for New York. Orel Hershiser, who 
played for those Dodgers, pitched the ninth inning Friday night for 
the Mets.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Climb: Dow Ends Up 112.71 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks overcame a volatile start to the session  
Friday and closed sharply higher as investors shrugged off worries 
about inflation and turned their focus to positive earnings news 
expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average gained 112.71 at 10,649.76. The  
blue-chip index rose 376.76 this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 rose 18.38 to 1,336.02, and the Nasdaq composite index 
gained 25.87 to close at 2,886.57. 
</P>
<P>
	All three indexes had their best weekly gains since the week  
ending July 2, when the Dow climbed 586.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Falling oil prices and some bargain hunting helped feed the  
market's gains. In addition, investors were anticipating strong 
earnings reports when companies begin releasing third-quarter 
results next week. 
</P>
<P>
	These factors helped lift stocks from an early morning slump  
caused by uncertainty over the government's employment report, and 
whether it indicated that inflation was accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market had to make a decision whether they thought the  
jobs report was going to push the Federal Reserve over the edge'' 
and decide to raise interest rates again, said Hugh Johnson, chief 
investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The answer was no, and that helped get the market going  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were confused by the employment report because it gave  
mixed signals. On one hand, the Labor Department reported employers 
cut their payrolls by 8,000 jobs in September, the first drop since 
January 1996. Analysts had expected companies to add 220,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline was mostly attributed to Hurricane Floyd, which cut  
into hiring at companies along the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the decline in jobs, wages rose in September.  
Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, grew 
by 0.5 percent to $13.37 in September, much sharper than the 0.2 
percent increase in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors liked the decline in job growth but were concerned  
that the rising wages could mean inflation is picking up momentum 
and may prompt the Fed to boost rates for the third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market reacted to the upside and the downside of the jobs  
report,'' Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Wachovia 
Securities in Charlotte, N.C. ``There is a lot of uncertainty in 
the market and this report just shows the nervous atmosphere that 
is out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also noted that there was a meaningful change this week  
in what stocks investors were buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of technology and Internet shares, which have led the  
market in recent months, there was lots of buying of big names in 
other sectors, namely consumer, drug and transportation stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we are seeing a rapid rotation in the market,''  
said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The small-cap stocks, however, lagged behind the broader market.  
That was reflected in the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, 
which fell 0.40 to 427.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson led the Dow higher, climbing 4 1/2 to 98 3/4. Other  
gainers included American Express, up 3 3/16 at 149 11/16; 
Wal-Mart, up 4 1/16 at 55 3/8; and General Electric, up 2 7/8 at 124 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox was one of the biggest losers in the market, falling 10 1/2  
to 32 1/4 after the copier maker warned third-quarter earnings would 
be lower than analyst expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	A slump in oil prices hurt oil company stocks, including  
Atlantic Richfield, down 3 13/32 to 85 9/16, and Royal Dutch Shell, 
down 1 3/16 at 57 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a by a narrow margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.08 billion 
shares vs. 974.86 million on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.42 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was flat, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1 percent, 
and France's AC-40 fell 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Elvis Presley Home for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KILLEEN, Texas (AP) -- It's a house fit for a King.  
</P>
<P>
	The home Elvis Presley had while he was a soldier at Fort Hood  
is for sale again on the Internet auction site eBay. The auction 
closes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	One prospective buyer already has matched the minimum bid of  
$200,000, said the home's owner, M.J. Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Craig said two previous auctions closed with high bids of  
$126,100 and $75,000 -- not enough to part with the one-story, 
three-bedroom brick home she's lived in since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Presley was stationed at Fort Hood when he was 23. He lived in  
the home for 25 weeks, said Deborah Garrell, Ms. Craig's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Garrell said Presley's parents also lived there for a time.

<HEADLINE> FSU Moves Forward Without Warrick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The loss of wide receivers Peter  
Warrick and Laveranues Coles, both arrested in a department store 
theft scam, will not change Florida State's game plan for Miami 
Saturday, but it will mean a new focus for the top-ranked 
Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost a lot of firepower,'' coach Bobby Bowden said. ``Now  
we find out if we have a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy, Warrick was  
indefinitely suspended and Coles kicked off the team because he had 
a record of prior legal and academic trouble. Warrick will miss at 
least the game against No. 19 Miami and possibly the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was Florida State's offensive leader, averaging 15.5  
yards every time he touched the ball during his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Those touches this year included 36 catches for 508 yards and  
seven touchdowns -- four receiving, two running and one on a punt 
return. He also has passed for a touchdown and ranks 12th 
nationally with 16.2 yards per punt return. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take more than one player to replace him. Little-used  
Germaine Stringer, along with Marvin Minnis, who missed the season 
opener because of an injury, will share time at Warrick's flanker 
position. Cornerback Reggie Durden will get more action returning 
punts, a duty he shared with Warrick. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was the team's fastest player, clocked at 4.2 seconds in  
the 40-yard dash. He had 12 catches this season for 179 yards and 
one touchdown after being suspended in the opener for missing a 
final exam during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Morgan will replace Coles at split end. Florida State  
substitutes often at nearly every position and has several 
experienced backups at receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for a new star to be born,'' quarterback Chris  
Weinke said. ``We're not changing our game plan. We're not changing 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, maybe one thing, Bowden said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't run the reverse pass,'' he said, referring to a play  
that has Warrick, a former high school quarterback, throwing the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests of Warrick and Coles have overshadowed an intense  
rivalry between Florida State (5-0) and Miami (2-2), smarting from 
identical 27-23 losses to No. 2 Penn State and No. 16 East 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden once lamented that the words ``he played Miami'' would be  
carved on his tombstone because losses to the Hurricanes might have 
cost him at least one national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles, however, have had the better of the rivalry in  
recent years, winning four straight from the Hurricanes. Florida 
State also will be trying to extend a 44-game unbeaten streak at 
Doak Campbell Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The last home loss was to Miami in 1991. It was the the famous  
``wide right'' game the Hurricanes won 17-16 when Seminoles walk-on 
Gerry Thomas missed a 34-yard field goal by inches with 25 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Butch Davis plans no changes because of the absences  
of Warrick and Coles, saying he was sure Florida State had capable 
replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his players, however, were disappointed Warrick and  
Coles would not be playing. Tight end Bubba Franks said he wished 
they would be in the lineup ``so nobody will have any excuses when 
we win.''

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Disney Might Be High Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- As Hong Kong seeks a Disney theme park, the  
government is considering giving it a high-tech focus, with lasers, 
robotics and computer applications, all in line with the 
territory's plans to boost its technology sector, a newspaper 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Building the park as a showcase of technology will fit Hong Kong  
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's hopes to turn the territory into 
the technology capital of Asia, the South China Morning Post 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper quoted unnamed government sources as emphasizing that  
the park can be a showcase for technological breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	The government announced in March it had been in talks with  
Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., but both sides have been 
tightlipped about the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Ip, the Secretary for Economic Services, the department  
in charge of the talks, reiterated to reporters Friday that the 
government will make an announcement on the project by the end of 
the month but he would not be drawn on what it might be. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney executives in Hong Kong did not immediately return phone  
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post also said immigration officials were working on new  
one-day visas for tourists from mainland China to visit the park. 
Security Bureau spokeswoman Martha Lo declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The government in July approved a zoning plan to permit the  
Disney park on a remote corner of the outlying island of Lantau.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Divorcing Second Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The wife of pop superstar Michael Jackson  
filed for divorce today, ending a nearly three-year marriage that 
produced two children. 
</P>
<P>
	Papers filed on behalf of Deborah Rowe Jackson in Los Angeles  
County Superior Court cited irreconcilable differences. It said the 
couple had been separated since July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The divorce petition said both parties reached a confidential  
agreement regarding property and debts. They did not indicate 
whether a custody agreement had been reached for the couple's 
children, 2-year-old Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. and 1-year-old 
Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson and his wife ``mutually agreed to end their marriage,''  
spokesman Howard J. Rubenstein said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael and Debbie remain friends, and they ask that the  
public respect their desire not to further comment or speculate 
upon the reasons for their decision,'' his statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone call from New York, he declined to provide other  
details and said neither Jackson nor his wife would be making any 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubenstein said he didn't know the whereabouts of the  
multiplatinum-selling singer, whose hits include ``Thriller'' and 
``Billie Jean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the attorneys representing Jackson and Ms. Rowe were  
not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Jackson said: ``Debbie and I love each other for  
all the things you'll never see on stage or in pictures. ... I fell 
for the beautiful, unpretentious, giving person that she is, and 
she fell for me just being me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Jackson told a London tabloid newspaper, The Mirror:  
``I love my wife, and we have a happy marriage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 41, married Ms. Rowe, a nurse in his plastic surgeon's  
office, on Nov. 15, 1996, the same year he and Lisa Marie Presley, 
daughter of Elvis Presley, ended their two-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Jackson won a lawsuit claiming he violated a settlement  
stemming from accusations that he molested a 13-year-old boy. An 
arbitrator entered a judgment in favor of Jackson in a suit filed 
by the boy's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson reached an out-of-court settlement of a molestation  
lawsuit in 1994. But the father filed another suit in 1996, 
claiming that his reputation and his son's were harmed when Jackson 
called the allegation ``lies, lies, lies, lies'' in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations against Jackson were investigated by authorities  
in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties, but Jackson was not 
charged with any crime.

<HEADLINE> Museum Battle Shifts to Courthouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's decision to pull a  
multimillion-dollar subsidy for a Brooklyn museum because of an 
exhibit he found offensive ``is a First Amendment catastrophe,'' a 
museum lawyer charged today. 
</P>
<P>
	During a federal court hearing, attorney Floyd Abrams compared  
the city's response to the controversial ``Sensation'' exhibit to a 
book burning. He said threats to cut off financing and evict the 
Brooklyn Museum of Art from a city-owned building were ``a form of 
destruction of free expression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is no less evil than burning a painting,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the city, Leonard Koerner, denied it was  
suppressing free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not stopping the exhibit,'' he said. ``We are stopping  
the funding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The museum has asked U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon to grant  
an injunction barring the city from withholding $7.2 million in 
annual financing. At the close of the hearing, Gershon said she 
wanted to see more written arguments before ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit of contemporary British art, which opened last  
weekend, includes a painting of the Virgin Mary decorated with 
elephant dung; another of a serial child-killer whose face is 
formed with hundreds of children's handprints; and a bisected pig 
floating in formaldehyde. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers filed earlier this week, museum director Arnold  
Lehman asserted that city officials were briefed months ago about 
what the museum was planning but that no objections were raised. 
</P>
<P>
	But Giuliani claims officials were misled about the content.  
Last month, after the Republican mayor labeled the Virgin Mary 
painting and other works ``sick stuff'' and ``Catholic-bashing,'' 
the city sued in state court to evict the museum from a site it has 
held for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
	A brief filed Thursday by City Council Speaker Peter Vallone,  
Public Advocate Mark Green and other local Democrats argues that 
Giuliani, a Republican, violated the Constitution and the City 
Charter by withholding funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Far worse than an offensive painting or exhibit is a mayor  
trying to bully people into silence,'' Green said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union, the Metropolitan Museum of  
Art and other cultural institutions have opposed Giuliani in 
similar papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute could have political ramifications. Giuliani is  
weighing a run for the U.S. Senate next year, and first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton is considering running as the Democratic 
candidate. She has said she does not approve of the art exhibit but 
opposes cutting off funds.

<HEADLINE> Xerox Warns of Earnings Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Shares of Xerox Corp. plunged more than  
25 percent today after the information services company warned its 
third-quarter earnings would fall because of increased pressure 
from competitors and lower productivity from its sales force. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of  
Xerox were down $11 to $31.75. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Xerox said it expects a 10 percent to 12 percent  
drop in earnings per share from 53 cents in the same period a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had been expecting Xerox to earn 58 cents a share for  
the three-month period ending Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales productivity was affected by the continued realignment of  
its sales force, Xerox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox announced in April that it was reorganizing its  
14,000-person sales force in a push to boost sales of ``bundled'' 
services to corporate customers, integrating fax machines, 
printers, copiers and PC software. The company said it planned to 
move its sales force away from geographical coverage toward 
coverage of specific industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox said third-quarter results were also hurt by economic  
weakness in Brazil, which was forced to devalue its currency 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was also weaker than anticipated both in the United  
States and Europe, particularly in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to announce third quarter results on Oct. 18.

<HEADLINE> Subway Series Not Ideal for NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While New Yorkers are pulling for a Subway Series that would  
send the city into a frenzy, one team from the Big Apple would be 
plenty for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	If either the Yankees or Mets make the World Series, most of the  
city will watch anyway. If both teams make it, however, some fans 
around the country are faced with a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	Which team to root for? Against?  
</P>
<P>
	For NBC, a Subway Series eliminates a second market from another  
region. 
</P>
<P>
	``In New York, it would be beyond words,'' said NBC's Bob  
Costas. ``But in truth, this is a different time than the '40s or 
'50s when the Brooklyn Dodgers were more of a national team. ... I 
don't think a New York series would be a big deal in Iowa. The idea 
that the whole country would be buzzing I don't think would be 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While ratings in New York would certainly improve for the first  
Subway Series in 43 years, the numbers probably wouldn't jump 
enough to make up the difference for the lack of a second home-team 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever marginal increase you get in New York from having  
both teams is not as significant as you might think,'' said NBC 
spokesman Ed Markey. 
</P>
<P>
	Equally as important as the teams that make the World Series is  
the level of competitiveness. Last year's series between the San 
Diego Padres and Yankees had a low 14.1 rating even though it had a 
representative from each side of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because it was a sweep for the Yankees.  
</P>
<P>
	Even the 1997 World Series between Florida and Cleveland, two  
fairly low-profile teams, had a 16.8 rating on NBC. That's because 
it went down to a seventh game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it goes seven games, it's going to get a great rating no  
matter who makes it,'' Markey said. 
</P>
<P>
	An all-New York finale wouldn't have much impact on advertisers,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for the city, but I don't think it would boost  
numbers nationally,'' said Steve Grubbs, a media buyer at BBDO 
advertising agency. ``The ad inventory has nearly all been bought, 
anyway. So it wouldn't make much of a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two advertising buyers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
NBC was getting $350,000 to $400,000 for each 30-second commercial. 
Fox received about $300,000 per spot last year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STILL FUMING:* Golfers aren't second-guessed and criticized  
nearly as much as other professional athletes, but when opinionated 
NBC analyst Johnny Miller let his feelings be known during the 
Ryder Cup last month, the Americans showed how thin-skinned they 
really are. 
</P>
<P>
	``It mystifies me that he's supposed to be a reporter or an  
analyst, and he becomes a critic,'' said Justin Leonard's Ryder Cup 
teammate, Davis Love III, who said he might tell NBC he won't talk 
to them if Miller keeps it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller had said Leonard should stay home and watch on TV after  
struggling through the first day and a half of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Johnny, he's not out interviewing players anyway,'' said  
Paul Azinger. ``I don't think Johnny hurt his credibility. I think 
players have always had funny feelings about Johnny, but the 
general public loves him.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JAIL TALK:* Bryant Gumbel doesn't have much sympathy for Denny  
McLain. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel was the first to interview the last 30-game winner on  
television since McLain returned to prison, where he is serving an 
eight-year sentence for a pension-fund swindle. The interview is 
part of HBO's ``Real Sports,'' which debuts Tuesday at 10 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got very emotional at times,'' Gumbel said. ``Denny's an  
interesting guy. I hate to say people should pity him because he's 
done way too much in his life for that. He's basically convinced 
himself that he's never done anything wrong. It's really 
frightening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel also talked to McLain's ex-wife and daughter, who have  
not visited him in prison in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he has done to his wife is really sad,'' Gumbel said.  
``His baseball pension money has been garnisheed by the government. 
When she sells the house, the money will go to the government. 
She's living day by day and really has no money. Denny has just 
left everyone in his wake out to lunch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TUBE BITS:* CBS analyst Brent Jones, who roomed with Steve  
Young for 10 years when they played together in San Francisco, 
isn't sure whether Young will retire. ``He's taken this much more 
serious than he has in the past with concussions.'' ... Brandi 
Chastain's debut as correspondent of the nationally syndicated 
``More Than a Game'' program, with CNN-SI's Fred Hickman, will be 
Nov. 5-7. ... ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' posted a national 
rating of a 14.0/24, 26 percent higher than last year, and the show 
is up 13 percent overall in the first four weeks since the start 
time was switched back to 9 p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE> Co. Settles Soc. Security Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A businessman has agreed to pay an $845,000  
fine to settle charges his company mailed millions of households a 
$15 offer for services that the Social Security Administration 
provides for free. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrin Gleeman, president of Federal Record Service Corp.,  
agreed to pay $195,000 of the fine within 30 days and the rest in 
deductions from his and his wife's earnings for the next decade, 
Social Security officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gleeman also agreed to dissolve his company.  
</P>
<P>
	``This case sends a clear message to the direct mail industry:  
bilking consumers under Social Security's good name will not be 
tolerated,'' said Social Security's acting inspector general, James 
G. Huse Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Gleeman's attorney, Kerry Lawrence, said the settlement was not  
an admission of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Federal Record Service and its president, Darrin Gleeman,  
continue to maintain that the business was 100 percent legitimate 
and aboveboard,'' Lawrence said. ``But based on the government's 
actions in court and the anticipated expenses in fighting the case, 
Federal Record Service determined it was in their best interest to 
put the matter behind them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the government's lawsuit, filed in May, Federal  
Record Service sent letters to newlyweds or families with new 
babies. In the letters, the company offered, for a $15 fee, to help 
obtain a new Social Security number and card for a newborn or an 
updated card for a bride who changed her name. 
</P>
<P>
	Forms for both purposes can be obtained for free at local Social  
Security offices or by calling a toll-free government number. So 
the company would simply mail out the appropriate free form and 
pocket the $15, government investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged scam operated for several years out of offices in  
New York, also using a mailing address in Washington, D.C. A 
related Florida company of the same name and its operator, listed 
in the lawsuit as Jay Seinfeld, were not part of the settlement and 
still face mail fraud charges.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jackson To Divorce Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After three years of marriage and two  
children, Michael Jackson and his second wife filed for divorce 
today, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple ``mutually agreed to end their marriage,'' Howard J.  
Rubenstein said. ``Michael and Debbie remain friends, and they ask 
that the public respect their desire not to further comment or 
speculate upon the reasons for their decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to provide other details. Neither Jackson, 41, nor  
his wife, Debbie Rowe Jackson, would be making any statements, he 
said. Divorce papers were filed today in Los Angeles County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson married his wife, who was a nurse for one of his  
doctors, in November 1996, the same year he and Lisa Marie Presley, 
daughter of Elvis Presley, ended their two-year marriage. Mrs. 
Jackson was seven months pregnant when they wed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Jackson said: ``Debbie and I love each other for  
all the things you'll never see on stage or in pictures. ... I fell 
for the beautiful, unpretentious, giving person that she is, and 
she fell for me just being me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple have two children: Paris Michael Katherine, born in  
April 1998, and Prince, born in February 1997.

<HEADLINE> French Group Eyes Tobacco Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France's stock market watchdog agency confirmed  
Friday it is looking into the share activity of the French tobacco 
group Seita in advance of the announcement that it was merging with 
the Spanish tobacco company Tabacalera. 
</P>
<P>
	Seita shares climbed earlier this week, shortly before the  
company announced late Tuesday it was merging with Tabacalera. 
</P>
<P>
	Seita and Tabacalera said they would each hold a 50 percent  
stake in a new company to be called Altadis, which would be the 
world's fourth-largest publicly held tobacco group. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement by the Operations Commission of the Bourse  
brings to at least three the number of companies whose shares have 
been put under scrutiny in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in the supermarket group Promodes also spiked higher in  
the days ahead of its announcement of a merger with fellow French 
retailer Carrefour. 
</P>
<P>
	And shares in Sita, a French waste management company, rose  
ahead of a decision in August by parent company Suez Lyonnaise des 
Eaux to launch a bid for the 29 percent stake it didn't already own 
in the firm. 
</P>
<P>
	A commission spokesman could give no further details of the  
decision to place Seita shares under surveillance, which allows for 
continued trading.

<HEADLINE> NFL Players Allegedly Bilked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Several NFL players apparently were victims  
of a high-roller accused by federal investigators of bilking 
investors for at least $31 million, the Austin American-Statesman 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents believe the players, including three members of the  
Arizona Cardinals and one Cleveland Browns player, contributed to a 
$5.5 million investment wired to Brian Russell Stearns by Los 
Angeles sports agent Robert Caron. 
</P>
<P>
	Stearns, 29, was arrested at his $2.2 million Lake Austin home  
last month. The FBI seized the house, two jets worth more than $10 
million, a $2 million helicopter and $800,000 in vehicles, plus 
undisclosed amounts of money in bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	According to investigators, Stearns conned a Georgia man for  
$3.3 million, a New York man for $26 million, and might have conned 
more than $4 million from about 100 residents of Brady, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in New York this week indicted Stearns on a  
charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Stearns, who has 
maintained his innocence through an attorney, remains in Bastrop 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	In court documents unsealed Thursday, Cardinals players Eric  
Swann, Johnny McWilliams and Larry Centers, who now plays for the 
Washington Redskins, all invested money with Stearns. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals wide receiver Chad Carpenter, who was propositioned to  
join the investor group, told Internal Revenue Service 
investigators that Browns offensive lineman Lomas Brown invested 
$300,000 to $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported that FBI agents believe the players gave  
Stearns the money through Caron. 
</P>
<P>
	Caron told the Statesman he knew Stearns but had nothing to do  
with the investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think right now would be a good time to comment,'' he  
said. ``It is a surprise to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stearns has been accused of selling bogus securities to people  
he lured by saying he was a ``master investor'' who knew the 
secrets to overseas markets that could bring a 40 percent return 
every 35 days.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Forest Protections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is expected next week to  
direct that about 40 million acres of federal forest be protected 
from development, assuring that two-thirds of America's remaining 
wild forests stay in pristine condition for generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the most significant land preservation efforts  
undertaken since the beginning of the century,'' said Michael 
Francis of Wilderness Society, a leading conservation advocacy 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	While details of the plan were still being worked out, the  
strategy would include a broad environmental review aimed at 
barring construction of roads in the 40 million acres of 
undeveloped forces, said sources who have followed development of 
the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was expected to announce the new initiative during a  
trip next Wednesday to George Washington National Forest in 
Virginia. White House officials declined Friday comment on the 
plan, which was first reported in the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The areas the administration wants to protect are spread across  
the nation's 192 million acres of federal forests from the Southern 
Appalachians to the Chugach National Forest in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is extremely encouraging,'' said Ken Rait of the Heritage  
Forests Campaign. ``This could be Bill Clinton's segue to the same 
pedestal occupied by Teddy Roosevelt as a historic conservation 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The primary aim of the president's initiative will be to block  
future construction of timber roads in the forests, which now are 
roadless. Such a ban will keep remote forest areas out of the reach 
of loggers, miners and developers as well as protect against 
erosion and other environmental harm, environmentalists said. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, about 60 million acres of the 192 million acres of  
federal forests are considered wild, or undeveloped. The rest of 
the acreage, governed by the U.S. Forest Service, is host to a wide 
range of activities, including logging, camping, skiing, mining and 
off-road-vehicle riding. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration in February imposed an 18-month moratorium on  
road building in 33 million acres of roadless forests. 
Environmentalists faulted that plan, saying it exempted too many 
forests, especially in the Northwest and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	While many of the details of the new plan could not be learned  
Friday, it was expected to expand the protection to about 40 
million acres. It was unclear whether the plan would include any of 
the 9 million acres of roadless areas in the huge Tongass National 
Forest -- the nation's largest forest -- in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	It also was unclear whether about 10 million acres of roadless  
areas on smaller parcels of forests -- those parcels that are 5,000 
acres or less -- will be part of Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	A timber industry spokesman criticized the expected move, saying  
it will increase the risk of forest fires and insect infestation in 
dozens of forests and force the continued use of logging imports 
that keep Americans out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not that surprised -- they've been trying to get us out  
of the national forests for some time,'' said Michael Klein of the 
American Forest and Paper Association.

<HEADLINE> Braves Bounce Back Against Astros  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Top that, Tom Glavine.  
</P>
<P>
	After one of the best-pitched games in postseason history, the  
Atlanta Braves arrived at the Astrodome on Thursday very much alive 
against Houston in the best-of-5 opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Glavine, the starter in Game 3 against Astros ace Mike  
Hampton, faces the unenviable task of following up Kevin Millwood's 
series-tying one-hitter in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even going to try'' to duplicate that performance,  
Glavine said after a light, 1 1/2-hour workout. ``I just want the same 
result, a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros will have their best pitcher on the mound. Hampton  
was an NL-leading 22-4 during the regular season, putting him among 
the favorites to win his first Cy Young award. 
</P>
<P>
	But one gets the feeling he would gladly trade his chance at the  
Cy Young for a victory that would put his team in a commanding 
position to win a postseason series for the first time. Game 4 is 
Saturday, also at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	If a fifth game is needed, it would be Sunday at Turner Field.  
</P>
<P>
	``In this game, all the awards and accolades don't mean a lot,''  
Hampton said. ``What means something is for the guys around you to 
have confidence that you can do the job. It's been a great year for 
me, but I've got a lot of confidence in them, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Killer B's -- Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Derek Bell --  
will be reunited for the Astros in Game 3, although a more 
appropriate nickname might be the Killer Z's the way they've 
snoozed through the postseason. Biggio has a career average of 
.125, Bagwell .121 and Bell .069. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bell had a disappointing, injury-plagued season,  
forcing him to the bench for most of the last month and the first 
two games of the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	But manager Larry Dierker plans to insert Bell in right field --  
the third different player to start at that position against the 
Braves -- and also put Matt Mieske in left. They provide two more 
right-handed bats against the left-handed Glavine, who had won his 
last eight decisions against the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good feeling to be back in there,'' said Bell, who hit  
only .236 with 12 homers in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves swept the Astros in the opening round of the playoffs  
two years ago, finishing off the series in Houston. This time, the 
Astros seized the home-field advantage by winning Game 1 in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to be 1-1 instead of 0-2,'' Bell said. ``We can  
relax and have fun. The pressure is on them. We've got the next two 
games at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine will surely give up more hits than Millwood, but the  
Braves have the right pitcher on the mound under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing his first eight career decisions to the Astros,  
Glavine hasn't lost in his last 10 trips to the mound, going 8-0 
with a 1.30 ERA. His last loss against Houston came on June 25, 
1991, by a score of 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a comfort zone here,'' Glavine said, gazing around the  
spacious Astrodome. ``Also, their lineup hasn't changed a whole lot 
over the course of the last few years. I know these guys and I know 
what I'm trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, career records are much like mutual funds -- past  
performance is no guarantee of future success. The Astros proved 
that in Game 1 by beating Greg Maddux, who had a 19-9 career record 
against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at Maddux's numbers,'' Bell said. ``But we won the first  
game. In the playoffs, you can throw all that out the window. It 
comes down to who's ahead in the ninth inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Killer B's are trying to break their 3-year-old  
playoff slump, Atlanta's MVP candidate, Chipper Jones, would like 
to see a few good pitchers after carrying his team offensively in 
the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was 1-for-5 in the first two games, walking three times  
and twice making outs while swinging anxiously at 3-0 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, I would swing the bat on 3-0,'' he said. ``But in  
these kind of situations, where every at-bat is under the 
microscope, it's hard to be patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones will try to break out against his offseason hunting buddy,  
having forged a relationship with Hampton when both were high 
school stars in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two or three years, they have met in south Georgia  
for a deer-hunting trip, ``just two rednecks who are never too far 
from their roots,'' Jones said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a real mutual respect for each other,'' he said. ``But  
I'm sure at about 3 or 4 o'clock tomorrow, that friendship will be 
put on hold for a few hours.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Stands Firm on Cuba Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful George W. Bush  
harshly criticized Cuban President Fidel Castro's communist regime 
Friday and said the U.S. embargo should stand until the island is 
free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Castro's day is coming,'' the Texas governor told a packed  
ballroom at Florida's Republican Party convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Castro a ``revolutionary relic at war with time and at  
war with his own people,'' he reiterated his stance that sanctions 
against the regime must remain until freedom of speech, the press 
and religion comes to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure, he added, should not be eased ``until the  
persecuted are set free and the exiled are welcomed home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also promised to rebuild morale in the U.S. military, which  
he said is at an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our greatest export to the world has been, is, and always will  
be the incredible freedom we understand in America,'' he said. 
``This freedom must be spread throughout all the Americas. This 
freedom is meant for all our neighbors. This freedom is meant for 
Cuba.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, leading in national Republican polls, is a heavy favorite  
in Florida, where brother Jeb is governor and chairman of his 
campaign for the March 14 state primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Republicans milling around the convention were  
wearing buttons, hats or T-shirts declaring support for the Texas 
governor. Still, Bush remembered how high his father, President 
George Bush, was riding in polls right after the Persian Gulf War 
and how far he fell before losing the 1992 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeb and I suffered through one of the worst years of our  
life,'' Bush said before his speech. ``We saw a great man go from 
92 to the 30s so I take nothing for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Republican party tried to play down the importance of  
the presidential race at the convention -- which the other GOP 
candidates avoided. Party officials instead cast the event as a 
chance to trade ideas and celebrate Republican control of the 
state's government for the first time in a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he supported his brother's position against oil  
drilling off the Florida coast.

<HEADLINE> Sharks Off to Best Start Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Granted, the season is young. Still, the  
San Jose Sharks are off to a special start. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mike Ricci scored his second goal of the game, in overtime  
Thursday night, the Sharks not only beat the Edmonton Oilers 3-2 
but extended their season-opening run to three straight wins, the 
team's strongest start in their eight-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to chase teams all year, we want teams to chase  
us,'' said San Jose right wing Owen Nolan, who has scored at least 
one goal in each of the first three games and has five overall 
after collecting only 19 all last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a stronger team now. The majority of the guys were here  
last year and know the system. This win is a great builder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose has been a more offensive team so far this season while  
getting strong play in goal from Mike Vernon and Steve Shields. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricci, meanwhile, was the eighth player to score this season for  
the Sharks, who have outscored the opposition 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose's power play, which struggled last season, also has  
been much more effective. The Sharks have converted seven of 21 
power-play chances, including two Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what you want,'' said Sharks defenseman Gary Suter,  
healthy again after missing virtually all last season with a torn 
triceps tendon. ``A good power play is going to win a lot of 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest victory illustrated that point.  
</P>
<P>
	Ricci's game-winner came on a power-play goal, San Jose's second  
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take advantage of others' mistakes,'' Ricci said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks skated with the man advantage throughout the extra  
period after Josef Beranek drew a five-minute major and game 
misconduct for checking rookie defenseman Brad Stuart from behind 
into the boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing with confidence,'' Edmonton coach Kevin Lowe  
said. ``Talent-wise, they are a little more skilled than they 
started last season. And that has translated into some early 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan in particular and the Sharks as a whole have benefited  
from the re-signing of playmaking center Vincent Damphousse. A late 
season acquisition from Montreal last year, Damphousse returned to 
San Jose rather than pursue other free agency offers and he has 
helped convert the Sharks' once-sputtering offense into a 
productive unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Wing Jeff Friesen and center Patrick Marleau also have benefited  
from the presence of the veteran Damphousse, who has at least one 
assist in each of the first three games and six overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen a player like Vinny since Igor Larionov was  
here,'' Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said. ``He's a better 
player than I ever thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks, who never have finished a season above .500, have a  
chance to complete their opening four-game homestand with a perfect 
record Saturday night. However, they'll be facing the defending 
Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars.

<HEADLINE> UAW, Ford talk As Deadline Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- With a battle line drawn, the United Auto  
Workers continued negotiations Friday with Ford Motor Co. as a 
midnight strike deadline approached. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word Friday afternoon on any progress, as both  
sides remained tightlipped about the status of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ford and the UAW have worked long hours this week trying to  
reach an agreement on a new contract for about 100,000 hourly 
workers. But there has been no round-the-clock bargaining yet -- a 
traditional sign a deal is close. 
</P>
<P>
	President Stephen P. Yokich told union members in a taped  
message earlier this week that Ford was being ``stubborn'' about 
accepting contracts agreed to by General Motors Corp. and 
DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	During negotiations in 1993 and 1996, the UAW found Ford's  
proposal best and settled with it first -- setting the pattern for 
the other two companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to work and maybe before the company can  
really make a big mistake, they'll understand that they're not 
first this time, but third,'' Yokich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW and Ford have enjoyed good relations for about 20 years,  
avoiding strikes like the one in Flint last year that shut down 
much of General Motors' production. Thanks in part to bulked-up 
production at Ford's truck and sport utility vehicle plants, the 
company made $6.6 billion in 1998; the average worker's profit 
sharing payment was $6,100. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, UAW officials have said they were opposed to  
Ford's plans to spin off or sell its parts unit, which employs 
23,500 UAW workers. Union leaders have said a separate Visteon 
Automotive Systems could cut pay and jobs, even close plants to 
compete against other parts companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-year contracts negotiated with DaimlerChrysler, GM and  
GM's former parts operations included promises from the companies 
that they would not spin off, sell or close any division or factory 
-- a clause that could be causing problems for Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts also included 3 percent raises each year, a $1,350  
signing bonus and improved pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the UAW also negotiated some terms with GM and Delphi  
Automotive Systems that experts say could apply to Ford and 
Visteon. The contract for Delphi workers mirrors GM's deal; it also 
allows Delphi employees to transfer back to GM and retire by Jan. 1 
with a GM pension. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Delphi workers are expected to complete voting on the new  
contract by next week.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Fired Over Racist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Three doctors were barred from working at a  
hospital and fired from a radiology practice for making racist 
remarks that were caught on a hospital tape-recorder that they 
thought was shut off. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments were recorded by a medical transcriber, Barbara  
Jewel Hopson, who sued the doctors, the Atlanta Medical Center, a 
radiology contractor and a transcription company. Ms. Hopson, who 
is black, alleged she was fired after she complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Bisese, Dr. Kenneth Brinn and a third doctor whose name  
was not released were fired Tuesday by the radiology contractor. A 
fourth doctor named in the lawsuit was cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Jim Lathren, the medical center's chief executive, said  
the doctors would no longer work at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors were dictating notes about a patient Aug. 5. The  
comments came after they apparently thought the tape-recorder was 
shut off, and were heard Ms. Hopson, who was hired by the hospital 
to transcribe the notes. 
</P>
<P>
	One doctor used a racial epithet to refer to blacks, and the  
others made disparaging comments. The doctors either did not return 
calls seeking comment or referred questions to lawyers who did not 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hopson said she was fired after she complained to the  
doctors and the hospital two weeks after she first raised the issue 
with Peachtree Associates, the transcription company. The company 
said she was transferred to another hospital after Atlanta Medical 
Center requested the switch. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, which seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive  
damages, was pending.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Johns Arrested for DUI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles pitcher Doug Johns was  
arrested Friday on a charge of driving under the influence of 
marijuana after blocking morning traffic at an Interstate highway 
toll plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest was the second for Johns on drug charges since April.  
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Johns was arrested around 9:40 a.m. near the  
Francis Scott Key Bridge toll plaza on Interstate 695, southeast of 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns pulled up to the toll plaza and told an attendant he  
didn't have the dollar toll, according to Maryland Transportation 
Authority spokeswoman Lori Vidil. The attendant asked Johns to pull 
over and wait for an officer to give him a form that would allow 
him to pay the fee later. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns pulled over, Vidil said, but stopped before pulling clear  
of all of the lanes of traffic. He was blocking traffic when an 
officer approached, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer told Johns to move out of the roadway. He complied,  
but the officer noticed the smell of alcohol and asked Johns to 
submit to a field sobriety test, Vidil said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns refused the request, as well as a similar request from  
another officer. He was then arrested and given a breath-alcohol 
exam, which came up negative for alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	A police drug recognition expert evaluated Johns and said he  
appeared to be under the influence of cannabis, the active 
ingredient in marijuana, Vidil said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns also refused a blood test, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	After several hours in custody, Johns was released to the  
custody of his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Authority police charged him with driving under  
the influence and with obstructing free passage of the roadway. He 
faces a 120-day suspension of his drivers license and a $40 fine. 
Johns signed a statement of charges, but it doesn't acknowledge 
that he was driving under the influence, Vidil said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns was arrested last April, hours after the Orioles' opening  
game of the 1999 season, after allegedly running a red light in 
Baltimore. In that incident, he was charged with marijuana 
possession, driving while intoxicated and failure to obey a traffic 
signal. He is awaiting a court hearing on those charges.

<HEADLINE> Astros Miss Key Chances To Score </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Astros manager Larry Dierker was testy. Reliever  
Jay Powell was heartbroken. Tony Eusebio couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the range of emotions after Houston couldn't score with  
the bases loaded and no outs in the 10th inning Friday and went on 
to lose 5-3 to the Atlanta Braves in the 12th on Brian Jordan's 
two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
	While the game was lost in the 12th inning, the Astros should  
have ended it in the 10th when former Houston reliever Russ 
Springer loaded the bases on a walk to Jeff Bagwell, a single by 
Ken Caminiti and a bunt hit by Stan Javier. 
</P>
<P>
	With Game 2 starter Jose Lima pounding a bat in the dugout,  
Braves closer John Rocker came on and got out of the jam. 
</P>
<P>
	With the infield in, Carl Everett hit a dribbler to first base  
and Ryan Klesko forced Bagwell at the plate for the first out. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the play of the game. Eusebio hit a screamer up the  
middle, but shortstop Walt Weiss dived to his left, made an 
incredible stop and threw out Caminiti at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way he should have made that play,'' Eusebio said.  
``He made a heck of a play. When I saw the ball go past the 
pitcher, I thought it was a hit for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Gutierrez then struck out to end the threat for the  
Astros, who squandered plenty of other chances, leaving 12 runners 
in all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't just the 10th inning,'' Dierker said. ``We had a  
million opportunities. It was, you know, you can't keep going out 
there and scoring nothing inning after inning after inning. How 
many innings went by where we only had to score one run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty weak.''  
</P>
<P>
	Given an extended life by Weiss and Rocker in the 10th, the  
Braves won the game in the 12th. With two outs and runners at 
second and third, Dierker had Powell pitch to Jordan, who had 
earlier hit a three-run homer and is hitting .500 with seven RBIs 
in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought about that,'' Dierker snapped sarcastically  
when asked if he considered walking Jordan. ``I really wish he'd 
have hit a home run. He sticks his bat out and rolls it down the 
first base line. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm a pitcher I want him to hit a really tough pitch. It  
was a tough pitch but I guess it didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Powell said he and Eusebio thought they had a good plan for  
pitching to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an idea of trying to get ahead of him,'' Powell said.  
``We wanted to get it down to where he'd strike at the last pitch 
or it was a ball. The pitch just came back across the plate and he 
hit it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very frustrating. ... I hate to lose like this. If I'd  
done my job, we'd still be out there playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eusebio disagreed with his manager's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of surprised,'' the catcher said. ``I saw the sign  
from Dierker. I was looking at the manager. If it was me, I would 
have walked him. But Dierker is the kind of manager who doesn't 
like to give walks.''

<HEADLINE> SBC, Ameritech Complete Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- SBC Communications said Friday it has officially  
completed its $74 billion purchase of Ameritech, a merger of Baby 
Bells that creates the nation's largest local phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, cleared by federal regulators two days earlier, cuts  
the number of regional Bell monopolies to four, down from the 
original seven created by the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T. SBC had already 
acquired one of the original seven, Pacific Telesis, while another, 
Nynex, was acquired by Bell Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The new SBC provides local phone service in most of the  
Southwest, Midwest and California with 59 million access lines. It 
also becomes the nation's third largest wireless company with 10.1 
million domestic subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, SBC may not remain the biggest local phone company for  
long. The FCC is still reviewing Bell Atlantic's proposed deal with 
GTE. If allowed to combine, those two companies would trump SBC as 
the nation's largest local phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC adopted several conditions to ensure the SBC-Ameritech  
deal would serve the public interest. The new SBC must enter 30 new 
markets within 30 months to compete with established local phone 
companies. SBC is also required to provide deep discounts on key 
pieces of its local access lines to rivals who want to lease them.

<HEADLINE> Florida State Penalizes Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick admitted what he did was  
wrong after the Heisman Trophy hopeful and a Florida State teammate 
were arrested on charges of stealing clothing from a department 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was indefinitely suspended, and Laveranues Coles, who  
was on probation because of past legal and academic difficulties, 
was kicked off the team. Both players are wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	They were arrested Thursday and released without bond on felony  
charges of grand theft. They were accused of paying only $21.40 for 
clothing worth $412.38 on Sept. 29. A Dillard's clerk who rang up 
the deep discount also was charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said he did not get a chance to  
meet with Coles, but talked privately with Warrick. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very remorseful,'' Bowden said. ``I said, `Pete, do you  
realize you were wrong?' And he said `Yes, I realize I was wrong.' 
That's the main thing. He knows that he broke a rule, and if you 
break a rule, this is the consequences that you get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden, however, said he did not feel betrayed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know boys are boys, and some of them seem to find adversity  
more than others,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, nicknamed ``Trouble'' by his grandmother, is one of those  
people. He was charged last year with hitting his stepmother 
outside her home. He was suspended for last year's opener against 
Texas A&AMP;M and later served 150 hours of community service for the 
misdemeanor battery charge. He also was suspended for this year's 
opener for academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles' eligibility for the 1999 season was in limbo for more  
than two months while school officials made sure he took no money 
from a sports agent to attend a party in Houston. Coles reimbursed 
a girlfriend for an airplane ticket and apologized to teammates 
before being reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Florida State Athletics Director Dave Hart  
described Warrick as a ``good citizen'' although, he too, had a 
prior run-in with the law. Disorderly conduct and resisting arrest 
charges against Warrick last year over an altercation in the 
parking lot of a Tampa fast-food restaurant eventually were 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest put Warrick's Heisman Trophy hopes in jeopardy, but  
William J. Dockery, president of the Downtown Athletic Club in New 
York, which awards the Heisman, said Warrick remains eligible for 
the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If any candidate is convicted of a felony, he would no longer  
be eligible to receive the Heisman Trophy,'' Dockery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said Warrick's only hope of returning for the rest of his  
senior season might be to get the charge reduced to a misdemeanor. 
School rules prohibit an athlete facing a felony from playing until 
the case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``A misdemeanor puts it in our hands,'' Bowden said.  
</P>
<P>
	An off-duty police officer saw and taped Coles purchasing two  
bags of clothing, one right after another, on video surveillance 
equipment. Police said Coles handed the first bag to Warrick. 
Neither bag contained enough merchandise -- $300 -- to make the 
charge a felony. However, Assistant State Attorney Warren Goodman 
said the purchases were considered a single transaction so the 
amounts were totaled. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick will be allowed to practice with the team, but was not  
there Thursday. Quarterback Chris Weinke said the players have not 
been distracted from their game Saturday against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``My focus has been on the game, will be on the game and will  
continue to be on the game for the next few days,'' Weinke said. 
``That stuff is out of our hands. We can't control it. We can 
control what we do on the field.''

<HEADLINE> Genentech Shares Tumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. (AP) -- Genentech Inc. shares tumbled  
Friday after disclosing its controlling shareholder, Roche Holdings 
Inc., plans to sell a 15.6 percent stake in the biotechnology firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuitcal maker which controls about 83  
percent of Genentech, plans to sell about 22 million Genentech 
shares on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading, Genentech shares were down $15.06 1/4 a share, or 8.7  
percent, to $157.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	At that price, the 22 million Genentech shares would be worth  
about $3.47 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech, which makes growth hormones and treatments for  
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and cystic fibrosis, made the disclosure 
about Roche's plans as it reported Thursday a 6 percent rise in 
earnings before charges for the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zurich, Roche Holding confirmed Friday it will sell up to 22  
million shares of Genentech and issue a $1 billion, zero-coupon 
bond exchangeable into another 5.5 million of Genentech shares. 
</P>
<P>
	It would still have about a 65 percent stake in Genentech after  
the planned sales.

<HEADLINE> NYC Cracks Down on Double Parking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city where everything goes is fast becoming  
a place where anything can get you a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani issued an edict to crack down on  
jaywalking -- something taught to city kids at birth. Then a dog 
owner was cited for throwing a birthday party for his dog in a park 
without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after years of looking the other way, police are writing  
tickets for something as New York as a bagel and lox -- double 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's next? We'll have to eat our bagels a certain way?''  
complained Terrence Catalano on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mayor is trying too hard to fix things that aren't  
broken,'' the 40-year-old investment analyst said. ``I know crime 
is down but I have to believe there's still a criminal element out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To put things in perspective for out-of-towners, New Yorkers  
excel at three things: walking faster than any other two-legged 
creature, jaywalking and double parking. 
</P>
<P>
	Only speed walking remains legal, at least for now. The  
crackdown on the other two habits, says Giuliani, is simple: 
They're illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean Giuliani doesn't succumb to bad habits  
himself sometimes. The mayor has admitted he jaywalks ``as a matter 
of habit and instinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police have eased up on the jaywalking tickets. But they  
declared all-out war this week on double parking; orange and white 
parking tickets are blanketing the city like New Year's Eve 
confetti in Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents long used to double parking in a city with a mere  
30,000 legal curbside parking spaces for hundreds of thousands of 
cars say their rights are being violated. 
</P>
<P>
	Rights? You betcha, says Maureen Godwin, 65, a lifelong  
Manhattan resident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone double parks here because there's so few parking  
spaces, and cops have always looked the other way,'' Mrs. Godwin 
said as she waited in her double parked car for her husband to come 
out of a store. ``My parents double parked, I double park, my kids 
double park. Where are we supposed to park?'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's your problem, the cops say. Police Commissioner Howard  
Safir stands firm when it comes to ``Operation Move Along.'' Fines 
range from $55 to $280. 
</P>
<P>
	New Yorkers planning on taking refuge in a park cannot let their  
guard down there, either, thanks to a rule barring more than 20 
people to gather in a park without a $25 permit. 
</P>
<P>
	That news has led to some whining. Especially in the case of  
Byron -- a Labrador retriever mix whose third birthday party came to 
a screeching halt in August when a parks enforcement officer 
ticketed his owner. There were more than 20 people wolfing down 
cake; it never occurred to Brian Thibeault that he needed a permit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone was on a leash and everyone was well-behaved,'' said  
Thibeault, who was presumably speaking of the dogs. ``There was no 
barking. There was no music, no noise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case, which came to light Thursday, was dropped after the  
Daily News called the city Parks Department. Parks Commissioner 
Henry Stern said the permit rule is generally used to control very 
large, organized events like concerts and theatrical performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it seems the only thing New Yorkers can hold onto is their  
gazelle-like gait. Residents don't plan on giving up that right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giuliani would have to reprogram all of us to turn off that  
fast walking switch,'' said Carmen Ordonez of Brooklyn, as she 
walked -- with lightning speed -- to lunch.

	$730M Award in State Farm Lawsuit  
</P>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- A judge awarded $730 million to State Farm  
policyholders in a class-action lawsuit over its use of 
questionable auto-body repair parts, adding to a $456 million jury 
award already believed to be the largest ever against an insurance 
company. The award includes $130 million in punitive damages on 
policyholders' claims that the nation's largest auto insurer 
deliberately deceived customers about the quality of ``aftermarket 
parts'' it requires body shops to use in repairs.

	Unemployment Rate Unchanged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate was unchanged  
at 4.2 percent in September, the lowest rate in nearly three 
decades, even though the number of payroll jobs actually fell last 
month as Hurricane Floyd cut into hiring. The Labor Department 
reported today that September's rate matched August's rate. The 
nation's jobless rate has been below 4.4 percent since March. 
Employers cut payroll jobs in September by 8,000.

	Xerox Warns of Earnings Shortfall  
</P>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Shares of Xerox Corp. plunged today after  
the information services company warned its third-quarter earnings 
would fall because of increased pressure from competitors and lower 
productivity from its sales force. Xerox said it expects a 10 
percent to 12 percent drop in earnings per share from 53 cents in 
the same period a year ago. Analysts had been expecting Xerox to 
earn 58 cents a share for the three-month period ending Sept. 30. 
Sales productivity was affected by the continued realignment of its 
sales force, Xerox said. The company's stock fell 10 1/4 to 32 1/2.

Exchange have postponed for a second time plans to extend the 
operation of their stock quote tickers to accommodate after-hours 
traders. The tickers provide the stock price information that 
scrolls across the bottom of television screens and is distributed 
to millions of investors via the Internet. Nasdaq today set a new 
target date of Oct. 25, subject to approval by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. A NYSE spokesman said the exchange hasn't set 
a date and is awaiting SEC approval of the plan.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM is cutting up to 10 percent of its personal  
computer workforce, or up to 1,000 workers, in a cost-cutting 
effort to turn around the division, which lost nearly $1 billion 
last year. The 5 percent to 10 percent reduction in the 
10,000-person staff will mostly hit marketing employees as the 
company consolidates its staff for different brands -- including 
Aptiva PCs, ThinkPad laptops and Netfinity computer servers -- under 
one marketing umbrella. IBM, which employs 291,000 people overall, 
does not expect any layoffs and said it will offer affected 
employees jobs in other divisions. IBM stock was down 3 at 113 3/8.

from Onex Corp. and American Airlines. Air Canada also asked its 
investors to ratify a poison pill defense, which would discourage 
hostile takeovers by making them prohibitively expensive. The

Roche Holdings Inc., plans to sell a 15.6 percent stake in the 
biotechnology firm. Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical maker which 
controls about 83 percent of Genentech, plans to sell about 22 
million Genentech shares on the open market. Genentech, which makes 
growth hormones and treatments for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 
cystic fibrosis, made the disclosure about Roche's plans as it 
reported yesterday a 6 percent rise in earnings before charges for 
the third quarter. Genentech stock was down 17 5/16 at 155 1/2.

	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike, the world's largest manufacturer of  
athletic shoes, disclosed the domestic and overseas factories where 
its college-licensed products are made after student activists 
fighting sweatshop conditions demanded disclosure. Beaverton-based 
Nike disclosed the factory sites yesterday on its Web site, 
www.nikebiz.com, listing addresses where shoes and clothing are

Wanless' departure was part of wider boardroom shakeup that was a 
direct response to the Scottish bank's $34.4 billion bid, launched 
last month. Sir David Rowland, currently NatWest chairman, will 
take on the additional role of group chief executive, the company

<HEADLINE> Fidelity Extends Trading Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The nation's biggest mutual fund firm is extending  
its retail trading hours, allowing online investors to buy and sell 
securities long after the market's closing bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston-based Fidelity Investments will extend hours for online  
trading from 4:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., starting early next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes just days after Charles Schwab, one of Fidelity's  
biggest competitors in the discount online brokerage industry, 
announced similar plans. Taken together, the two announcements 
represent a significant increase in the potential number of 
after-hours traders. 
</P>
<P>
	``After-hours trading is a service that is of great interest to  
our involved, active traders,'' said Tracey Curvey, executive vice 
president of Fidelity's online brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity will allow investors to place limit orders -- to buy  
stocks at or below a set price -- for Nasdaq securities, and for a 
limited number of New York Stock Exchange securities. Clients must 
buy minimum round lots of 100 shares.

<HEADLINE> Bin Laden Org. on Terrorism List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to stop the flow of money and arms to  
terrorists, the State Department renewed a legal ban on any support 
for 27 foreign terrorist organizations Friday and added a group 
headed by Osama bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the department removed Palestinian and Chilean  
organizations from its formal terrorism list, citing good behavior, 
and also dropped Cambodia's notorious Khmer Rouge, which the 
department said ``no longer exists as a viable terrorist 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright added to the list  
al-Qaida, which the State Department says is headed by bin Laden 
and is responsible for plots to kill the pope and bomb U.S. 
airliners as well as the August 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in 
Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have no place in civilized affairs,'' said Albright,  
speaking of all 28 organizations now on the list, which bars their 
members from the United States, makes it illegal to contribute 
money or other assistance to them and requires U.S. financial 
institutions to freeze their assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The decisions are made under a 1996 law aimed at stopping U.S.  
fund raising and other support for terrorist groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have a legal basis to move against them,'' said Michael  
Sheehan, chief counterterrorism coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan acknowledged the impact may be mostly symbolic in some  
cases. Al-Qaida, for example, gets little funding from within the 
United States, but he said the legal designation helps to cut off 
its support elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as a Tanzanian pleaded innocent in New  
York on Friday to participation in the East African embassy 
bombings. Khalfan Khamis Mohamed was arrested Thursday in South 
Africa and became the ninth man held in New York in the embassy 
bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire businessman believed to be living  
in Afghanistan, is on the FBI's list of 10 most-wanted criminals, 
and the State Department has offered a $5 million reward for his 
arrest. He and his sympathizers deny that he is a terrorist 
mastermind. He led anti-Soviet fighters in Afghanistan, and U.S. 
officials say he now directs al-Qaida, with up to 1,000 Arab 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Removed from the list of terrorist organizations because they  
have committed no recent terrorist acts were the Manuel Rodriguez 
Patriotic Front Dissidents of Chile and the Democratic Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian group is a radical Marxist organization that has  
carried out attacks against Israel but recently dropped its policy 
of armed struggle and its opposition to peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan said its political statements are important, ``but  
really ... we look at the facts based on the statute of whether an 
organization is involved in terrorist activity over the past two 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the DFLP nor the Manuel Rodriguez group had plotted or  
conducted terrorist activity since the list was last reviewed in 
1997, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian group remains under some U.S. restrictions,  
however, including a prohibition of financial transactions, because 
it is still covered by a 1995 presidential order aimed at terrorist 
groups that threaten Mideast peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Khmer Rouge of Cambodia was dropped because, the State  
Department said, it disbanded last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambodia, however, still struggles with efforts to prosecute  
agents of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime, which two decades ago 
conducted a reign of terror in which at least 1.7 million 
Cambodians died. Earlier this month, survivors expressed fears that 
leaders would never be brought to justice. Some former Khmer Rouge 
members have threatened to retaliate if trials are held. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan said listing the Khmer Rouge became a ``moot issue,''  
but he added, ``That doesn't let these people off the hook. Not at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Activities of organizations on and off the list are constantly  
reviewed, including the Irish Republican Army and its offshoots, 
none of which are now on the list, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A group must be redesignated every two years or restrictions  
against it lapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizations may appeal decisions to U.S. courts. Last month,  
the U.S. Court of Appeals refused such appeals by two groups: the 
Mujahedeen Khalq, which opposes the regime in Iran, and the Tamil 
Tigers of Sri Lanka. Both are on the new list.

<HEADLINE> Clemens To Pitch in Home State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The main reason Roger Clemens considered  
playing for the Houston Astros or Texas Rangers was to try and 
fulfill his World Series dream in front of his family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he ended up with the New York Yankees, Clemens will  
still share part of his postseason with those closest to him when 
he starts Game 3 of the AL division series Saturday night against 
Texas at The Ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching in New York, I might not have had the opportunity for  
a lot of my siblings to see it live. As we speak, they're en 
route,'' Clemens said Friday afternoon. ``I've also got some 
college teammates who are going to be in the area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' first postseason start in four years comes with the  
Yankees one victory from reaching the ALCS. A strong outing, even 
against a struggling Rangers lineup, would begin to make up for a 
rocky regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was 14-10 with a 4.60 ERA -- unimpressive numbers for a  
guy who won the previous two AL Cy Young Awards. He was 1-1 with a 
4.96 ERA against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger Clemens has a presence about him when he walks on the  
field,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates said. ``Any time Roger takes 
the mound there's that possibility of an outstanding game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros and Rangers tried getting Clemens from the Blue Jays  
this past offseason. Texas came closest, only to have the Yankees 
make a better offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens said he wanted to go to the defending World Series  
champions all along because they were a good bet to do it again and 
he wanted to help. 
</P>
<P>
	While that angered some fans in his home state, Clemens still  
has plenty of supporters here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of my roots are back at the University of Texas, so I  
have a lot of well-wishers and people coming from Austin, Houston 
and so on,'' he said. ``It's going to be special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement for this start has been building since manager  
Joe Torre set his postseason rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept getting messages throughout the week about this is what  
we've all been waiting for, go out there and get 'em. It's neat to 
hear those,'' Clemens said. 
</P>
<P>
	A World Series championship is the only thing missing from  
Clemens' impressive career resume. He's won five Cy Youngs and 
pitched in the postseason in 1986, '88, '90 and '95. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've pretty much accomplished just about anything you would  
want to accomplish in 16 years of doing this,'' he said. ``You sit 
there selfishly saying that, but that's the only way you can look 
at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens hasn't pitched in nine days, which could be a problem.  
Sometimes too much rest makes him lose command. That can especially 
work against him in an emotional game like this one. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the most intense people I've ever coached,''  
Yankees pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre said. ``When his juices get 
flowing, sometimes it's difficult to control them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens seemed pretty relaxed Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Having heard that Torre called him ``a shirt-and-tie guy'' in  
contrast to the guy he was traded for, David Wells, Clemens wore a 
yellow tie under his Yankees windbreaker, then pulled it out early 
in his news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``How does that look?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Clemens will be making his 10th postseason start. He's 1-2 with  
a 3.88 ERA. He hasn't won since his second outing, 13 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Donating $40,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STONEHAM, Maine (AP) -- Stephen King's charity is donating  
$40,000 to help buy a new ambulance for a rescue service that came 
to the novelist's aid this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just the latest in a string of high-priced thank yous the  
horror writer has sent since he was hit by a van as he walked along 
a rural road near his home in Lovell. 
</P>
<P>
	King earlier announced he would give $100,000 each to Central  
Maine Medical Center and Northern Cumberland Memorial Hospital in 
Bridgton -- the two hospitals where he was treated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stoneham Rescue Service, the first to reach King, has been  
struggling to raise money for a new ambulance for nearly a year.

Friday after it was disclosed that its controlling shareholder, 
Roche Holdings Inc., plans to sell a 15.6 percent stake in the 
biotechnology firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuitcal maker which controls about 83  
percent of Genentech, plans to sell about 22 million Genentech 
shares on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading, Genentech shares were down $16.75 a share, or  
9.7 percent, to $156.06 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	At that price, the 22 million Genentech shares would be worth  
about $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech, which makes growth hormones and treatments for  
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and cystic fibrosis, made the disclosure 
about Roche's plans as it reported Thursday a 6 percent rise in 
earnings before charges for the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zurich, Roche Holding confirmed Friday it will sell up to 22  
million shares of Genentech and issue a $1 billion, zero-coupon 
bond exchangeable into another 5.5 million of Genentech shares. 
</P>
<P>
	It would still have about a 65 percent stake in Genentech after  
the planned sales.

<HEADLINE> King Abdullah Carries Iraqi Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- King Abdullah of Jordan, in a weeklong U.S.  
visit, will ask for duty-free access to American markets and more 
weapons while backing Israeli-Arab peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was bringing a message from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein  
to President Clinton, but administration officals said they doubted 
it would be a serious overture. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah, stepping smoothly into the shoes of his late father,  
King Hussein, is projecting Jordan as a moderate Arab regime that 
is aligning itself with peace moves as beneficial to his kingdom 
and the region at large. 
</P>
<P>
	He was pressing his case for a bigger share of American markets  
with Commerce Secretary William Daley today and will see President 
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old king also hopes to get a promised $300 million  
financial aid package that Congress has so far refused to approve. 
The aid was promised to Jordan as part of last year's Wye River 
peace accord in exchange for Hussein's diplomatic efforts to 
promote an Israeli pullback on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional skepticism based on Jordan's support for Iraq in  
the Persian Gulf War diminished in a spirited campaign by his 
father to support U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East. The cut in new 
aid to Jordan more likely reflects widespread reservations with 
foreign aid, generally, on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a three-day weekend, the king intends to enjoy autumn in  
New England and attend the wedding of a private school classmate. 
His father also usually mixed business with pleasure on trips here. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking off for the United States, Abdullah told Jordanian  
reporters he was carrying a message from to Clinton from Saddam 
Hussein. He declined to provide details. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't comment on that, but I have a message to pass on,''  
Abdullah was quoted as saying by Jordanian newspapers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials doubted Iraq would make a serious offer  
to the United States through Abdullah. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said this week that  
the Iraqis regularly seek talks with U.S. officials but that the 
United States is not interested as long as Iraq remains in 
violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Arab newspaper Al-Hayat, the message promises  
major political reforms in Iraq, offers to stop threatening Israel, 
proposes unconditional talks with the United States and offers 
assurances Iraq will play an effective role in Middle East peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	On his last visit here, in July, the king pledged economic and  
bureaucratic reform at home as well as a drive against corruption. 
Since then, he has moved against the radical Palestinian Islamist 
group Hamas by ordering the arrest of local leaders.

<HEADLINE> Panel Recommends Zoloft for Stress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The widely used antidepressant Zoloft also  
should be approved for treating posttraumatic stress syndrome, a 
federal advisory panel said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But panelists cautioned the drug so far seems to help only  
women, not men, with the anxiety disorder, which can result after a 
life-threatening or otherwise traumatic experience such as combat, 
rape, assault or a natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of posttraumatic stress include flashbacks, nightmares,  
persistently avoiding reminders of the event, survivor guilt, 
insomnia and depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Many psychiatrists have long prescribed antidepressants along  
with psychological therapy to treat posttraumatic stress. But if 
the Food and Drug Administration specifically approves Zoloft's 
use, manufacturer Pfizer Inc. will be allowed to advertise the drug 
for such treatment, potentially widening sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoloft already treats depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder  
and panic disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer conducted four clinical trials of Zoloft to treat  
posttraumatic stress. In two of the studies, Zoloft failed to work 
any better than the placebo, while it alleviated symptoms better 
than the placebo in another two studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Consequently, FDA's scientific advisory panel voted 6-2, with  
one abstention, that Zoloft's new use should be approved. The FDA 
is not bound by its advisers' recommendations but typically follows 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the drug's effectiveness was almost exclusively found  
in women, the FDA said. One study in which Zoloft failed, in fact, 
was a study of male combat veterans. The FDA's advisers said this 
gender effect must be noted on Zoloft's label if the drug is sold 
for posttraumatic stress.

</P>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Sir De Villiers Graaff, who led  
South Africa's opposition United Party for 27 years, died Monday 
after a short illness. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Graaff was a soldier and lawyer before he turned to politics. He  
became a member of Parliament in 1948, the year the United Party 
was ousted from government by the conservative National Party, 
which imposed the formal system of apartheid and held power until 
the first all-race elections in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Graaff, who inherited his title from his father, Sir David  
Pieter de Villiers Graaff, took over leadership of the United Party 
in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the opposition to the governments of three apartheid  
presidents, Hans Strijdom, Hendrik Verwoerd and John Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	Graaff retired in 1977 to farm and write his autobiography.

</P>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Stewart Haas, an award-winning  
journalist and retired professor, died Wednesday after a brief 
illness. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Haas retired in December from his position as associate  
professor of mass communication at Winthrop University in Rock 
Hill, a position he had held since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent most of his professional career working at newspapers  
in Iowa. After graduating from Kansas State University, Haas was 
hired in 1957 as a city reporter for The Courier in Waterloo, Iowa. 
He later worked for The Courier as farm editor, assistant state 
editor, state editor and associate editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Haas served as editor of the Cedar Falls (Iowa) Record in the  
late 1960s after it was purchased by The Courier. He then returned 
to The Courier in 1975 as managing editor, becoming editor in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	At Winthrop, Haas was selected for an American Press Institute  
fellowship at The Seattle Times and conducted journalism workshops 
in Botswana and Zimbabwe. He often spent his summers as a writing 
coach for members of the South Carolina Press Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Haas worked on the editorial staff of the  
International Herald Tribune in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Haas is survived by his wife, Sally Willson Haas; two daughters;  
his sister; four stepchildren; and four grandchildren.

	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Andrew John Hope Jr., a prominent tribal  
leader in Alaska, died in a car crash Wednesday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope served as director of community development with the state  
Department of Community and Regional Affairs, president of the 
Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indians of Alaska, and Grand 
Camp president of the Alaska Native Brotherhood in 1962 and 1963.

<P>
	JACKSON, Wyo. (AP) -- Paul Petzoldt, a mountaineer who founded  
the National Outdoor Leadership School that has trained thousands 
worldwide in outdoor safety and ethics, died Wednesday of prostate 
cancer. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Petzoldt, who climbed ranges around the world, is credited with  
establishing many guiding and climbing protocols in North America. 
For example, some signals that climbers shout to one another as 
they ascend cliffs were developed by him. 
</P>
<P>
	Petzoldt made an early ascent of the 13,772-foot-high Grand  
Teton in 1924 when he was only 16. He made his last ascent of the 
Grand Teton 60 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965 he established the National Outdoor Leadership School in  
Lander, about 120 miles southeast of Jackson. It has branch 
campuses in Alaska and eight other locations around the world. 
Nearly 50,000 students have attended the school in 35 years.

	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Howard C. Raether, known to colleagues as ``Mr.  
Funeral Service'' during his years as executive director of the 
National Funeral Directors Association, died Wednesday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Raether frequently appeared on radio and television in the 1960s  
to defend the industry from criticism leveled by British author 
Jessica Mitford in the 1963 book ``The American Way of Death,'' 
which portrayed funeral directors as using questionable practices 
and taking unfair advantage of grieving survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	He also represented the industry during hearings and debate in  
the early 1980s when the Federal Trade Commission developed rules 
governing price disclosures of funeral goods and services.

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Shmuel Schnitzer, the founder and former editor  
of the daily Maariv, died Wednesday at his desk in the newspaper 
office after finishing an article. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnitzer was among a group of journalists who started Maariv,  
an afternoon newspaper, in 1948. He served as the paper's editor 
from 1980-82 and was known for his sharply worded editorials and 
commentaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The article he finished just before his death was meant for  
Friday's weekend edition. The paper printed it Thursday instead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Schnitzer argued against allowing the  
publication of the memoirs of Adolf Eichmann, who, as Hitler's 
deputy directed the murder of six million Jews during World War II. 
Eichmann, who wrote the document while in an Israeli prison, was 
executed after being convicted of war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichmann's survivors have demanded that Israel turn over the  
memoirs, held under lock and key by Israeli officials. Schnitzer 
argued that if they are made public, the memoirs could be used by 
neo-Nazis to justify or excuse the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnitzer is survived by his wife, and two sons.

</P>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Dimitri Tsafendas, who  
assassinated South African Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd in 1966, 
died Thursday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsafendas was a parliamentary messenger when he stabbed Verwoerd  
to death in parliament in Cape Town on Sept. 6, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	The assassin claimed that a giant ``tapeworm'' in his stomach  
had forced him to kill Verwoerd, who was widely considered the 
architect of apartheid. Ruled insane, Tsafendas was imprisoned and 
later sent to a mental institution. 
</P>
<P>
	It was never clearly established if Tsafendas, the son of a  
Greek father and Mozambican mother, targeted Verwoerd for 
institutionalizing the system of white rule in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	During the decades that Tsafendas was incarcerated, apartheid  
was strengthened, with the country's white rulers crushing attempts 
by the African National Congress and other groups to overthrow it. 
The system finally collapsed with the nation's first all-race 
elections in 1994.

Chicago Bears' 1963 NFL championship team, died Thursday after 
battling prostate cancer. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitsell played collegiately at Indiana. He was with the Bears  
from 1961-66 and was a member of the 1963 team that beat the New 
York Giants 14-10 for the title. He later played with the New 
Orleans Saints from 1967-69.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in US Embassy Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Another man has been arrested in  
connection with the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania last year that killed 224 people, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can confirm that an individual was arrested in connection  
with the embassy bombings and the FBI was involved'' in making the 
arrest, police spokesman Capt. Rod Beer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beer said he did not know where the man was being held or any  
more details. The arrest brought to nine the number of people in 
custody in connection with the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities scheduled a news conference for later today in  
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cape Argus newspaper reported today that a Tanzanian man was  
arrested, and that authorities were searching for accomplices. The 
Argus quoted immigration official Jurie de Wet as saying the 
arrests stemmed from information about requests for asylum and 
temporary residence in Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen people have been indicted in the case. Eight of those  
are in custody, but the rest remained fugitives, including Saudi 
radical Osama bin Laden. It was not immediately known if the arrest 
announced today stemmed from the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden, who is accused of masterminding the attack, is on the  
FBI's 10 Most Wanted List. A $5 million reward has been offered for 
his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombs went off almost simultaneously on Aug. 7, 1998 at U.S.  
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carl Fletcher scored in the 60th minute  
Friday night to give Canada a 2-1 victory over El Salvador in the 
CONCACAF Gold Cup qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first game of the doubleheader, Johny Descolines' second  
goal of the tournament gave Haiti a 1-0 victory over Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Canada and Haiti lead the four-team group with four  
points apiece, while Cuba and El Salvador each have one. The top 
two teams from the round-robin tournament qualify for February's 
CONCACAF Gold Cup, the North American championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gold Cup ends Sunday with Canada playing Haiti and El  
Salvador facing Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher broke a 1-1 tie when he took a pass from Marc Bircham  
15 yards from the goal line, dribbled toward the edge of the 
18-yard penalty area and fired a shot inside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlo Corazzin gave Canada a 1-0 lead in the 10th minute, but  
Raul Diaz Arce tied the score with a penalty kick in the 47th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	El Salvador played with 10 men over the final 52 minutes after  
playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos was ejected for thrusting his cleats 
toward Fletcher's midsection. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Cienfuegos did not make contact, referee Armando  
Archundia issued a red card. Cienfuegos, who plays for Major League 
Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy, shares the MLS lead in assists with 
17. 
</P>
<P>
	Descolines scored in the 75th minute when he outmaneuvered Cuban  
sweeper Tobio Mora after taking a pass and kicked a 15-yard shot 
into the upper right corner of the net.

<HEADLINE> Limon Brilliant in Dance Premiere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Limon Dance Company took brilliant looks  
forward and back on its opening night with the New York premiere of 
``The Plain Sense of Things'' and the 50th anniversary performance 
of Jose Limon's masterpiece, ``The Moor's Pavane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a reception before Tuesday's opening at the Joyce Theater,  
the company presented dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov with a photo of 
Limon dancing his solo ``Chaconne,'' framed with a piece of his 
costume. 
</P>
<P>
	Baryshnikov has been performing ``Chaconne'' in his tours with  
the White Oak Project. Marge Champion made the presentation, citing 
Baryshnikov for ``attracting a new audience to modern dance, 
raising consciousness about our art form and bringing greater 
visibility to the work of Jose Limon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican-born Limon was a magnetic dancer and a passionate  
choreographer who came to the United States with his parents at age 
7 in 1915. After he saw his first dance concert, he entered the 
dance school of Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman, and performed 
in their company for 10 years until 1940. After serving in the Army 
in World War II, he formed his own company, which had its first 
performance on Broadway in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Limon choreographed to show emotions and man's fate. He remained  
committed to high tragedy, drawn from history and literature, and 
had no interest in the trend to movement for movement's sake that 
entered modern dance in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla Maxwell, who danced in the Limon Company before his death  
in 1972, has been artistic director since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Limon's work, ``The Plain Sense of Things,'' places the dancers  
in a community. No matter how they twirl, reach, lift each other in 
partnering or stand measured distances from one another, they 
convey a sense that they are part of a group. The dance was 
inspired by the paintings of Edward Hopper. 
</P>
<P>
	The sense of an outsider is especially strong in the third  
section of four, titled ``Singing Beyond What You Can Hear.'' Nina 
Watt seemed lost and pensive, sad not to be included in the trio of 
Mary Ford, Carla Maxwell and Carlos Orta, but she is no happier 
when they do include her and fearfully runs away from them. 
</P>
<P>
	Music for the dance was a recording of Philip Glass' ``The  
Saxophone Quartet.'' The work is melodic with minimalist 
underpinnings. David Ferri's lighting put a spotlight on some 
dancers, kept some in shadow while three footlights made huge 
shadows on the back wall. The dance had its premiere in July in San 
Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Moor's Pavane,'' which followed, was first performed on  
Aug. 17, 1949, at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn., 
with Limon as the Moor. Program notes say Limon didn't so much 
intend to depict ``Othello'' but an Everyman, his treacherous 
friend and their wives. 
</P>
<P>
	His choreography is rich with nuance, and the cast on Tuesday  
brought it out tellingly. The Moor was danced by Carlos Orta. 
Bradon McDonald was the friend. Roxane D'Orleans Juste, danced the 
Moor's wife as a loving innocent. And instead of the put-upon wife 
the friend's wife can be, Carla Maxwell portrayed her as a woman 
who sees a chance for power. 
</P>
<P>
	A sextet performed the music by Purcell.  
</P>
<P>
	The evening ended with Limon's ``The Winged.''  
</P>
<P>
	The company will dance at the Joyce Theater through Oct. 17. It  
will perform Antony Tudor's 1937 ``Dark Elegies'' Oct. 12, 14, 16 
and 17. The company is the first modern-dance company to perform a 
Tudor ballet.
