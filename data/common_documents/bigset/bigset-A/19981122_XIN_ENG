<P>
OTTAWA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian immigration officials
have barred about 1,000 known or suspected Russian mobsters and
Asian underworld members from entering the country over the last
four years, the National Post newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Canada Immigration's Organized Crime Division has developed a
databank containing names and aliases of 7,000 suspected
criminals, and their family members.
</P>
<P>
To keep out the unwanted, officials act on a little-known
section of the Immigration Act that allows them to deny a person's
entry into Canada if they have "reasonable grounds" to suspect
that the applicants are connected to crimes.
</P>
<P>
Canadian police point out that organized crime is already a big
social problem in Canada costing the country more than one billion
Canadian dollars (0.65 billion U.S. dollars) a year in fraud and
theft alone.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 immigrants enter Canada each year.

<HEADLINE> Drug Combination for Hepatitis C Proves Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. doctors said that a
combination of two virus-fighting drugs has proved considerably
more effective against chronic hepatitis C infections than the
standard single medicine, said the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
In the United States nearly 4 million people are believed to
have hepatitis C, with about 10,000 deaths from the disease each
year. The virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease.
</P>
<P>
For the time being interferon is the only treatment.
Typically only 15 percent to 20 percent of patients who get
interferon are rid of all signs of the virus, and most will
eventually relapse.

<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom government
took a cautious stance Saturday over Iraq's latest clash with the
United Nations weapons inspection team, noting it was awaiting
reaction from the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said the government was waiting for
more detailed comments from the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
over Iraq's objections to providing documents to the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"We will reserve any substantive comment until then," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The British position echoed again that of the United States.
President Bill Clinton said Saturday that he wanted to make sure
of the facts and that it was important not to overreact.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United Kingdom and the United States called off
air strikes against Baghdad after Iraq withdrew its decision not
to cooperate with the inspectors who were seeking to disarm its
chemical, biological and ballistic weapons.
</P>
<P>
But both Washington and London have pledged to strike Iraq
without warning if Baghdad stops again its cooperation with the
U.N. inspectors.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Meeting Begins in Nepal to Conclude Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) group started here Saturday its
third meeting to conclude the third round of trade negotiations
under the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA).
</P>
<P>
At its three-day meeting at the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat, the Inter-Governmental Group (IGG) on Trade
Liberalization will also review progress in the trade flows of
products covered under the first two rounds of talks under the
SAPTA in addition to bilateral and multilateral trade
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The first two rounds of talks have offered 2,228 items of
products for preferential entry among the SAARC member countries
-- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The third round, which should have ended in January this year,
will give deeper preferential tariff concessions and remove
discriminatory practices and non-tariff barriers on products being
actively traded or are likely to be trade among the SAARC member
countries.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Secretariat said in a press release that the IGG
meeting will review the implementation of earlier recommendations
made at its first two meetings held in July 1997 and January 1998
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the meeting will discuss matters of particular
interest to the least developed countries in the SAARC region --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal, and will make
recommendations for future course of action, the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC was formed in December 1985 to promote economic and
social development in the region.
</P>
<P>
It originally decided to establish a South Asian Free Trade
Area by the year 2001, but at their 10th summit in July this year,
the SAARC leaders deferred indefinitely the deadline.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Peace, stability and a new
multipolar order in the world to a great extent depend on the
level of cooperation between Moscow and Beijing, Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with Xinhua on the eve of a visit by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Russia, Ivanov said both
countries are experiencing a stage of great reforms oriented to
tapping the economic potentials and further increasing material
benefits for the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The coming summit will be the first unofficial meeting between
Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Jiang Zemin, which allows them in a
trustful atmosphere to discuss important issues of bilateral
cooperation, to exchange views on the developing tendency of
international politics, and to calibrate their positions on the
most important international issues, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister noted that before the visit Russia and
China have successfully completed demarcation on their common
border. Now they are taking confidence-building measures and
military transparency along the border, which set a good example
of successful resolution of delicate and complicated problems for
the world community.
</P>
<P>
Satisfied with the development of the Russian-Chinese
relations, Ivanov said that meetings between leaders of the two
countries allow for the creation of a unique mechanism of
state-to-state cooperation in dealing with not only bilateral
relations, but also the cardinal problems in world politics.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov also said that close contacts with his Chinese
counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, "allow us to regularly `synchronize
watches' and coordinate positions to the most acute international
problems."
</P>
<P>
He was confident that the further development of active
interaction between Russia and China on the world arena accords
with the interests of both countries, as well as security and
stabilization of the world.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, meanwhile, noted the need for common efforts to reverse
the situation whereby economic interaction lags behind political
interaction.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister believed that through meetings and
negotiations during the upcoming summit, the two countries will
find resolutions of the outstanding problems and make real
progress in deepening the beneficial trade-economic cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China, as two great powers and permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council, have special responsibility for world
peace and security, Ivanov said. "We well understand it and act
accordingly."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that strengthening the Russian-Chinese
partnership oriented to strategic interaction is contributing to
stabilizing international politics and helping to settle
international conflicts.

<P>
HARARE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Commercial Grain
Producers Association (cgpa) Saturday said the country is facing
a critical shortage of maize.
</P>
<P>
Maize is Zimbabwe's staple food grain. Zimbabwe this year was
forced to import 200,000 tons of maize from South Africa to cover
the shortfall of 400,000 tons, cgpa said.
</P>
<P>
It said there is urgent need to increase maize production so
that Zimbabwe does not end up importing the crop at exorbitant
prices.
</P>
<P>
Cgpa Chairman J. Burger told the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana

interest shown by farmers in maize production because of
viability problems.
</P>
<P>
"We need zimbabwe to be self-sufficient to maintain food
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burger stressed the current maize planting process should be
speeded up before the planting season draws to an end.

ANKARA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz Saturday was reelected as leader of the ruling
center-right Motherland Party in its sixth congress.
</P>
<P>
The reelection of Yilmaz showed that his party has given him
strong support on the brink of the collapse of the coalition
government set up in June last year.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the minority government of corruption and having
relations with gangs and mafia, three opposition parties of
pro-Islamic Virtue Party, the True Path Party and the Republican
People's Party have asked the prime minister to resign,
</P>
<P>
Turkish parliament has accepted three no-confidence motions
aimed at toppling the government.
</P>
<P>
The crisis emerged after businessman Korkmaz Yigit claimed
that Yilmaz rigged the bidding process of the Turkish Trade Bank.
</P>
<P>
If the government falls with the scheduled vote of confidence
Wednesday, the parliamentary parties will have 45 days to form
another coalition. If they fail to do so, Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel will appoint a caretaker government to rule until

<HEADLINE> Arms Inspections Proceed Smoothly in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. weapons inspections in
Iraq proceeded smoothly for the fourth consecutive day Saturday
with full cooperation from the Iraqi side, said an Iraqi
official.
</P>
<P>
Hussam Mohammed Ameen, director-general of Iraqi National
Monitoring Directorate which provide escorts for U.N. arms
inspectors, was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying a
missle team made a surprise visit to a military enterprise.
</P>
<P>
However, sources close to U.N. arms inspectors told Xinhua
that the missile team just conducted routine monitoring activities
 to a military project that had been checked several times
before.
</P>
<P>
The sources said incidents might come up when intrusive
inspections are conducted to new suspected sites in the
following days.
</P>
<P>
A chemical team of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM),
which oversees disarmament in Iraq, visited a weapon site to
check tagged equipment there, said Ameen, adding a biological
team also visited a site, where they maintained surveilance
cameras and checked tagged equipment.
</P>
<P>
Four groups of the Interational Atomic Energy Agency in
charge of Iraq's nuclear program inspected some Iraqi buildings
where they took some samples of leaves.
</P>
<P>
Ameen also said that the American U-2 reconnaissance plane
on Saturday violated the Iraqi air space and reconnoitered some
locations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has criticized chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler, who on Wednesday accused Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz of concealing information from arms teams.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said the U.N. teams has conducted long searches of
many of Iraqi government archives but found nothing contrary to
its declarations.
</P>
<P>
Butler's requests for handing out Iraq's secret documents of
biological and chemical program "seemed to be provocative rather
than professional," Iraqi officials said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arms inspection in Iraq was resumed Wednesday, one
day after the inspectors returned from Bahrain, where they had
relocated last week amid fears of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, as Washington prepared to launch air strikes
against Iraq, Baghdad announced it would resume full and
unconditional cooperation with the inspectors.

<P>
TEHRAN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Atomic Energy Minister
Yevgeny Adamov arrived here Saturday to inspect the Bushehr
nuclear plant which is under construction with Russia's
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Adamov said that his three-day visit was
aimed at reviewing the work carried out in constructing the
1,000-megawatt Bushehr nuclear plant in southern Iran, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the cooperation between the two countries should expand
to other fields from the nuclear sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Vice President Gholamreza Aqazadeh said
Iran and Russia have removed ambiguities on the construction of
the Bushehr nuclear plant following talks between officials of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Without elaborating the ambiguities, Aqazadeh, also head of
Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, said that Tehran and Moscow
not only solved problems relating to the Bushehr nuclear plants,
but also paved the way for cooperation in other fields such as
health and industries.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranian officials earlier expressed dissatisfaction with
the pace of construction and urged Russia to speed it up.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of talks, Moscow assured Iran that it would
hand over the nuclear plant to Tehran for operation next year.
</P>
<P>
Russia concluded the contract on the Bushehr nuclear plant
with Iran in 1994, defying the U.S. pressure against cooperation
on the project.
</P>
<P>
Washington warned that any kind of nuclear assistance to Iran
could aid Iran's alleged nuclear weapons plans.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia has argued that the plant is purely for
peaceful purposes while Iran has also denied that it is seeking
nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Japan to Increase Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian region of Sakhalin
and the Japanese island of Hokkaido signed an agreement on
friendship and cooperation on Sunday, according to the Interfax
news agency.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Sakhalin governor Igor Farkhutdinov said
a priority for such cooperation is to implement off-shore oil and
gas projects in Sakhalin.
</P>
<P>
The main problem facing the Kuril Islands is energy supply and
the first thing for Sakhalin and Hokkaido to do is to build a
geothermal energy system on the Kuril Islands.
</P>
<P>
Hokkaido governor Tatsuya Hori said that Hokkaido companies may
actively participate in the development of the resources of the
Sakhalin Sea.
</P>
<P>
He added that Japanese companies, which have experience in
undertaking projects in climatic conditions similar to those in
Sakhalin, can be particularly useful in building houses, roads and
other infrastructure projects in Sakhalin.
</P>
<P>
Both sides believed that stronger good-neighborly ties between
Sakhalin and Hokkaido will help promote the bilateral relations
between Russian and Japan at the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Partner in Nepal Threatens to Quit Govt Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), the junior coalition partner,
reiterated Sunday that it will pull out of the government if the
agreements reached with its major partner were not implemented by
the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an interaction program held in Kathmandu, CPN-ML
General Secretary Bam Dev Gautam said that an ultimatum in this
regard has been given to Prime Minister and Nepali Congress (NC)
President Girija Prasad Koirala, Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the agreements which are in favor of the nation
and people, are not enforced by December 1, there is no meaning
for his party to remain in the government.
</P>
<P>
The agreements the NC reached with the CPN-ML and other left
parties cover a number of issues including law and order situation
in the country, the withdrawal of Indian troops from Nepali land
in Kalapani and reviewing the controversial 1950 Indo-Nepal
Friendship Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML has threatened to quit the government several times
this month. On November 17, it issued a sternly-worded ultimatum,
saying that it would withdraw from the government within 15 days
if the agreements are not implemented.
</P>
<P>
The other left parties have announced a nation-wide agitation
program against the government.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), which has been pushing for early
elections, has also announced a two-month protest program starting
on November 27 to pressure the government for early, free and fair
elections.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Koirala had said that he preferred April/May
next year as the date for the elections, which should be held in
November that year.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of transferring Inspector-General
of Police Achyut Krishna Kharel, a principal demand of the CPN-ML.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML joined hands with the NC in late August, turning the
minority government of the NC into a coalition with a majority of
seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the CPN-ML, the government succeeded in
passing in parliament the budget and policies and programs for the
1998/99 fiscal year which begun in mid-July.

BANGKOK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Julie Halard-Decugis of
France beat China's Li Fang to win a women's tennis tournament in
Pattaya, Thailand, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old French, the second seed in the tournament,
needed only 49 minutes to beat Li 6-1, 6-2.
</P>

French opponent.
</P>
<P>
She lost her serve three times and conceded the first set in
only 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Li, 25, was forced to call a time out before the restart for
treatment to a minor injury on her right foot.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Halard-Decugis was equally relentless,

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The second largest
consignment of Egyptian donation to the recently announced
administration of Mogadishu has landed Sunday afternoon at the
airport of Ballidogle, 90 Km Southwest of the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the police commander of Mogadishu, Abdi
Hassan Awale Qeybdid, the uniforms of more than 3000 strong
police force arrived Sunday from Egypt as part of their
support to Mogadishu's administration.
</P>
<P>
Qeybdid who spoke with the reporters immediately after
arriving from Ballidogle said this donation is further
encouraging the authority to take immediate steps in securing the
stability of the capital.
</P>
<P>
He also said his men have already finished
their first round of training concerning the police tactics in
fighting against banditry in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
However, he has declined to mention the date his men will
be deployed in the streets of Mogadishu. "We will announce the
exact date of our operation within this month," he said
cautiously.
</P>
<P>
Despite these heavy preparations and the existence of the
Islamic courts in some parts of Mogadishu, the people of the
capital are nowadays threatened by terrifying acts of insecurity
which seem to be targeting the ordinary civilians and the
business people.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people have died and more than seven others
were wounded in the past two days in separate incidents in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and six others were wounded Saturday
when heavily armed militiamen have intercepted at Afarta Jardine
junction a convoy of commercial goods from who natural port of
EL-Ma'an, 30 Km north of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen with their security escort have returned fire in
their attempt to defend their goods. The subsequent exchange of
heavy fire has left the death of two of the bandits before their
remaining were forced to flee for their lives.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Arrives in Moscow for Sixth Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
arrived here Sunday afternoon local time for a four-day visit at
the invitation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Jiang will have his first informal meeting
with Yeltsin, dedicated to extensive and in-depth discussions on
bilateral ties and international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The "no-tie" meeting is expected to promote the healthy growth
of a strategic partnership between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As results, a joint statement on the bilateral relations in the
21st century and other important documents are expected.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth summit meeting between the two heads of
state. Jiang visited Russia in 1994 and 1997, and Yeltsin visited
China in 1992, 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
This time, Jiang will also meet Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, Chairman Yegor Stroyev of the Federation Council, the
Upper House of parliament, and Chairman Gennady Seleznev of the
State Duma, the Lower House of parliament.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to tour New Siberia after his stay in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Since the first summit in December 1992, China and Russia have
signed a series of important documents, and their relationship has
embarked on a track of mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In the first summit in Beijing, they worked out a total of 24
documents, including a joint statement on the foundation of the
bilateral relations, a protocol on disarmament, an agreement on
confidence building in the military field in border areas, and
accords on economic, trade, science and cultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
When Jiang visited Russia in December 1994, the two presidents
signed a joint declaration, stating that the two countries shall
de-target their strategic nuclear weapons at each other.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they signed a joint statement committing their
countries to reducing military presence along their common borders
to the lowest possible level, commensurate with their neighborly
ties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also penned an agreement on the western section
of the Sino-Russian border.
</P>
<P>
Two years later, when Yeltsin visited China again, he and Jiang
agreed to build a strategic partnership oriented toward the 21st
century between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed to establish a mechanism of regular
meetings between leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They stated in Beijing that the demarcation on the eastern
section of the Sino-Russian border had been completed.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997, Jiang and Yeltsin signed a joint statement in
Moscow to endorse the multi-polarization of the world and the
building of a new world order.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the frequent exchange of visits between
Chinese and Russian leaders, together with the wide range of
common understanding they have reached, have secured the stable
growth of the neighborly relationship between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Strengthen Cooperation with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) plans to provide China with technology and personnels needed
to tackle problems related to the medicare system reform, a
virtual epidemic of tuberculosis and AIDS, according to WHO
director-general Gro Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
WHO is willing to provide support and strengthen cooperation
with China in related areas, according to Brundtland. The WHO
official made the comments during an afternoon meeting with Health
Minister Zhang Wenkang.
</P>
<P>
China is reforming its decades-old free medicare system in urban
and rural areas because it no longer satisfies the increasing demand
for medical services and results in an excessive waste of health
resources, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The goal of reform is to provide basic medical services and
attract both governmental and individual funding, as well as the
valuable advice and successful experience offered by WHO,
according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Zhang responded to the WHO official's question concerning an
epidemic of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS in China by noting that
the Chinese government pays great attention on preventing and
controlling the diseases.
</P>
<P>
The government is especially concerned about the fact that 40
percent of areas lacking effective treatments for TB report over
250,000 related deaths every year.
</P>
<P>
AIDS, which has preyed on a reported 300,000 people in China, has
also been the subject of close government attention, with plans
calling for publication of national plans for AIDS control in the
near future, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland, who is visiting China for the first time as the
head of WHO, said the organization will launch a Stop TB
Initiative designed to spark global concern about the disease. She
expressed the hope the Chinese government will support the activity.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese health minister also expressed his wish to
help both neighboring and African countries establish training
centers and develop drugs to control malaria.
</P>
<P>
WHO officials will also visit central China's Hubei Province
and the eastern city of Shanghai to investigate local work to
control TB, as well as rural health care services and medicare for
the elderly.

<P>
KUNMING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The government of Ninglang
Autonomous County, home of the Yi ethnic people in northwestern
Yunnan Province, is extending great effort to help the victims of
the recent two earthquakes which hit the county on November 19.
</P>
<P>
The two quakes, measuring 5.0 and 6.2 on the Richter Scale
respectively, killed three people and injured more than 1,000
others in addition to displacing some 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"We are making the best use of every minute to distribute
tents, quilts, and other relief materials to quake-stricken areas,
and prevent exposure during the cold weather," said Duan
Zengqing, Party secretary in Lijiang Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Tents now cover the soccer field at the No. 1 Ninglang County
Secondary School which has 1,500 students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
"Schools was in session when the quake hit, and the teachers and
staff immediately dismissed classes and dispersed the students to
ensure safety.
</P>
<P>
Classrooms sustained different degrees of damage and classes
are currently being held in temporary facilities on the
playground," according to Principal Ma Yonghong, who spent the two
previous nights without any sleep.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in county hospitals are busy treating people injured
during the quake, with most injuries resulting from falling rock
or roof tiles. Twenty doctors and nurses are treating people
around the clock.
</P>
<P>
Heavy damages to some county roads and highways have created
major difficulties in transporting relief supplies, Nonetheless,
various supplies have reached remote areas which sustained serious
damages.
</P>
<P>
Local officials noted that the county is located on a seismic
belt and has witnessed a number of quakes measuring over 5.0 on
the Richter Scale since last October. The accurate forecast for
the quakes helped to reduce damages this time.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Urged to Resolve Prisoner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- As Israel and the
Palestinians were fiercely disputing over the release of
Palestinian prisoners, U.S. officials stepped in Sunday and urged
the two sides to resolve the difference themselves.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. did not see any violation of the land-for-peace deal
by Israel to include 150 common criminals in the 250 prisoners who
were released last Friday as called upon by the accord, said a
statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) complained to Washington over the weekend that, by
releasing criminal prisoners instead of political prisoners,
Israel breached a verbal agreement the two sides reached during
the negotiations last month in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said Israel had agreed in the talks that
a total of 750 Palestinian prisoners to be released in three
stages would be political prisoners, those taking part in
resistant movement against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat has sent letters of
complaint to Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and U.S. Middle
East envoy Dennis Ross over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Security Chief Mohammed Dahlan called the release
"an insult to the Palestinian people" and "the most dangerous
step taken by Israel" since the signing of the peace deal last
month.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Israel insisted that it had never agreed to
release "members of terrorist organizations" and those "with
blood on their hands."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a weekly cabinet
meeting Sunday that he had promised PNA President Yasser Arafat
during the U.S. summit talks to release only 100 "security
prisoners," or political prisoners as called by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has promised to bring up the matter with the
Israelis in time for the next prisoner release, expected in four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
She made the pledge in a telephone conversation with Arafat
last Friday, during which Arafat raised the issue to her, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani is expected
to meet early this week with Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinians have expressed their satisfaction
with Israel's implementation of the first stage of further
withdrawal from the West Bank last Friday as agreed upon in the
land-for-peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Israel turned over 2 percent of the West Bank under its full
control to joint jurisdiction with the Palestinians and
transferred another 7.1 percent under joint control into fully
Palestinian-run areas.

<P>
KUNMING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The government of Ninglang
Autonomous County, home of the Yi ethnic people in northwestern
Yunnan Province, is extending great effort to help the victims of
the recent two earthquakes which hit the county on November 19.
</P>
<P>
The two quakes, measuring 5.0 and 6.2 on the Richter Scale
respectively, killed three people and injured more than 1,000
others in addition to displacing some 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"We are making the best use of every minute to distribute
tents, quilts, and other relief materials to quake-stricken areas,
and prevent exposure during the cold weather," said Duan
Zengqing, Party secretary in Lijiang Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Tents now cover the soccer field at the No. 1 Ninglang County
Secondary School which has 1,500 students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
"Schools was in session when the quake hit, and the teachers and
staff immediately dismissed classes and dispersed the students to
ensure safety.
</P>
<P>
Classrooms sustained different degrees of damage and classes
are currently being held in temporary facilities on the
playground," according to Principal Ma Yonghong, who spent the two
previous nights without any sleep.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in county hospitals are busy treating people injured
during the quake, with most injuries resulting from falling rock
or roof tiles. Twenty doctors and nurses are treating people
around the clock.
</P>
<P>
Heavy damages to some county roads and highways have created
major difficulties in transporting relief supplies, Nonetheless,
various supplies have reached remote areas which sustained serious
damages.
</P>
<P>
Local officials noted that the county is located on a seismic
belt and has witnessed a number of quakes measuring over 5.0 on
the Richter Scale since last October. The accurate forecast for
the quakes helped to reduce damages this time.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Northern State to Implement Major Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's northern state
of Kedah is going to implement a number of major projects to
kick-start its economy.
</P>
<P>
The proposed landbridge project between Kedah and Southern
Thailand at an estimated cost of 5 billion ringgit (1.315 billion
U.S. dollars) will be implemented next year to stimulate the
state's economic growth, Malaysia's national news agency Bernama
reported Sunday, quoting the state's Chief Minister Sanusi Junid.
</P>
<P>
The landbridge project, initiated under the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) plan, is
among the several major projects identified by the Kedah state
government to kick-start its economy.
</P>
<P>
Other major projects to be implemented next year to rejuvenate
the economy in the state are the 4 billion ringgit (1.052 billion
U.S. dollar) Petronas' fertilizer production plant and the 2.4
billion ringgit (631.578 million U.S. dollar) power generation
plant, and the 400 million ringgit (105.263 million U.S. dollar)
Beris Dam project, the chief minister said when tabling the 1999
Budget at the State Legislative Assembly, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
Sanusi said Kedah continued to receive foreign investments
despite the economic slowdown and since the financial crisis
erupted in July last year, 28 new projects worth 538 million
ringgit (141.578 million U.S. dollars) had been carried out in the
state particularly at the Kulim Hi-Tech Park, creating 3,334 job
opportunities for locals.
</P>
<P>
Kedah is expected to chalk up a 30.41 million ringgit (8.002
million U.S. dollar) deficit next year, with its operational
expenditure estimated at 290.54 million ringgit (76.457 million
U.S. dollars) against 260.13 million ringgit (68.455 million U.S.
dollars) in revenue.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A recent study with the title
"How We Dream Today" revealed that the people of Beijing are the
most romantic Chinese and have the greatest wishes and aspirations.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 residents of the cities of Beijing, Shanghai,
Chongqing and Hong Kong were asked to respond to a questionnaire
by the Shanghai Hongqiao Friendship Store and Shanghai Zhongheng
Consultative Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
They found that Beijing residents crave love: 12 percent of the
respondents said "love" is what they dream most about. Next come
travel, going overseas, and friendship, and what they dream least
about is money and health.
</P>
<P>
Of the people of Shanghai, 23 percent care most about
housing and 22 percent, about children.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people care most about careers and health.
</P>
<P>
When asked to respond to the statement "I am a person with many
dreams", 26 percent of the Beijingers said yes and came in
first among the four groups. Only 4 percent of the people of
Chongqing said yes.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhang Dajun of China Southwest Normal University says
that the attitudes in the survey reflect differences between
cities in economic development and geographical location, as well
as personalities.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yu Wujin of Shanghai's Fudan University says that
Beijing's more diverse culture has helped encourage the dreams of
the people there.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Denmark
shuttlers showed their superiority in men's singles with a 2-1
victory over China at a badminton friendly here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China sent their Thomas Cup men's singles trio, Sun Jun, Dong
Jiong and Luo Yigang while Denmark dispatched Peter Gade,
Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen and Kenneth Jonassen.
</P>
<P>
Cheered on by a sellout crowd at the Beijing College Stadium,
Dong Jiong, the 25-year-old home favorite, tied the current world
number one Peter Gade 9-15, 15-6 in the first two games of the
opening match.
</P>
<P>
Dong, runner-up of the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, led the
third game 8-5 and 13-11 before Peter scored four consecutive
points to triumph 15-13, winning the 70-minute battle for Denmark.
</P>
<P>
"I had no pressure compared with Dong even though I was not
familiar with the court," said the 21-year-old Peter. "I
fortunately exploited Dong's unforced errors in the third game
and won the match."
</P>
<P>
The 75-minute tussle between Luo Yigang and Kenneth Jonassen
was just a copy of first rubber.
</P>
<P>
The world number 13 Jonassen and Luo, fourth on the world
rankings, split the first two games 17-15, 15-6 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Luo got off to a good start 8-3 in third game but his
defensive returns let his rival many chances to smash, conceding
the lead to Jonassen.
</P>
<P>
The Dane then led 14-11 before the 24-year-old Luo saved six
match points to lose the decider 12-15.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation between Olympic gold medalist Hoyer-Larsen
and 1998 All-England champion Sun Jun was one-sided when Sun led
all the way to a 15-9, 15-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
"It was a close match though we won the best-of-three match.
Both players performed very well," said Thomas Lund, coach of the
Denmark team. "We were lucky to snatch the victory at both
deciders of first two matches when Chinese shuttlers still had
chances to win."
</P>
<P>
Li Yongbo, the Chinese head coach, said: "The loss showed our
weakness at net play and at the ability of converting the crucial
points."
</P>
<P>
At the Thomas Cup in Hong Kong last May, China lost a derby
3-2 in the preliminary round when world championship runner-up
Sun fell to world top player Peter Gade and Olympic silver
medalist Dong was defeated by Jonassen. Luo chalked up the only
singles victory for China against Hoyer-Larsen in three rubbers.
</P>
<P>
Both teams lost their semi-finals as China were beaten by
Indonesia while Denmark defeated by Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses Butler of Trying to Create New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said here Sunday that chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler's request for handing out Iraq's secret documents
of biological weapons is "provocative" and aiming at "creating
new crisis."
</P>
<P>
At a seminar sponsored by a non-governmental organization to
show Arab solidarity with the Iraqi people, Aziz said some of the
documents Butler requested "did not exist."
</P>
<P>
"How can Iraq provide UNSCOM (the U.N. Special Commission)
things that do not exist," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq will publish the letters between the Iraqi
government and Butler in order to clarify the facts.
</P>
<P>
He accused Butler of trying to make new pretexts for
U.S. military attack against Iraq and obstruct the
U.N. comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with relevant
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq agreed a week ago to unconditionally resume U.N. weapons
inspections, defusing the standoff with the U.N. over Iraq's
October 31 decision to halt all cooperations with U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The weapons inspection in Iraq was resumed on Wednesday, one
day after the inspectors returned from Bahrain, where they had
relocated amid fears of possible U.S. air strikes.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt Launches Attacks on UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government is
launching large-scale attacks on the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in central part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The attacks, which has been going on for a week, is part of
the plan for the government forces to restore government
institutions throughout the country, the independent Actual
weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is now concentrated in Bie Province's Alto Hama
areas, a strategic point linking the central areas to UNITA's
bases in the eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government forces had surrounded UNITA's political and
military capital of Andulo in Bie Province and Bailundo in Huambo
Province, after breaking through the rebel forces' first front.
</P>
<P>
Joan de Matos, Chief of Staff of the government forces, is
very much worried over the situation in the diamond-rich Lunda-Norte
Province and Lunda-Sul Province, after he toured the two provinces.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has been relying on diamonds there for its logistics
supply.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been very fierce in the central part of the
country, with reportedly the Kuito Hospital in Bie Province being
full of wounded soldiers of the government forces.
</P>
<P>
While the government refuses to give any information on the
reported fightings, the U.N. Special Envoy Issa Diallo issued a
statement Saturday, saying that "peace process is in crisis" and
urged Angolan people "not to give up hope", and continue to carry
out the Lusaka Peace Protocol.

<HEADLINE> Sex Aids Becoming More Acceptable In Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A year ago, a young man
opened a sex aids store in the city of Yiwu in east China's
Zhejiang Province and, a year later, he was able to set up a
chain store.
</P>
<P>
Sex aids have come to be acceptable by more people around here
and stores specializing in sex aid products and sex-related
publications can be found in big cities and some villages.
</P>
<P>
However, it was not too long ago when sex was still a taboo in
China and just mentioning the word in public was considered
indecent.
</P>
<P>
Wang Aiping, a family planning consultant in the city of
Jiaxing, says that sex and sex aids are no longer mysteries and
people are getting more information through various channels, and
"this is healthy".
</P>
<P>
Jiaxing, a medium-sized city in Zhejiang, has 260 sex aids
stores in the urban area and nearby counties and villages.
</P>
<P>
One store, "Human Origins", which opened in 1996, has tripled
its business every year and now has 900,000 yuan in sales.

<HEADLINE> New Variety of Cocoa Developed in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 22 (Xinhua) --Nigeria, a major cocoa producing
country, has developed a new variety of cocoa called "Hybrid" and
9.5 million Hybrid seedlings are on the verge of sale, The
Guardian on Sunday reported.
</P>
<P>
The new variety has been developed by the Tree Crop Unit of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources in Ondo State
in cooperation with the Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The new breed combines high yield with early maturity, high
resistance to disease and easier management, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Henry Olaniyi Akingbulugbe, President of the Farmers' Congress
of the Ondo State, who has planted some hectares of the new
seedlings, confirmed that the aroma of the hybrid is "very good"
compared to that of the traditional variety.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the hybrid had been developed to rehabilitate
cocoa farming and replace ageing trees in the country, especially
in Ondo State, the largest cocoa producing state in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The new breed matures within 30 months compared to almost 60
months maturity period of earlier improved breeds and its output
can reach one ton of cocoa beans per hectare in stead of 250
kilograms of cocoa beans from old variety.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in India Rises to 8.85 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of
inflation rose to a 163-week high of 8.85 percent for the week
ending November 7 on sustained increase in prices of primary food
articles, official sources said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest rate of inflation based on wholesale price
index (WPI) recorded since September 23, 1995. During the week
under reference, inflation rose by 0.34 percentage points to 8.85
percent from 8.51 percent in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The increase in inflation is mainly on account of primary food
articles, especially essential commodities. In the last few
months, commodities like onion, potato, pulses and edible oils
have witnessed an unprecedented rise in prices.
</P>
<P>
Rise in prices of items like onion and potato does not get
properly reflected in WPI as these commodities carry only very
small weightages in the all commodities basket, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Zambians Demanded to Surrender Illegal Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
offered a seven-day general amnesty for people with illegal
firearms to surrender them to the police.
</P>
<P>
The move follows a spate of robberies that have rocked the
capital city Lusaka and the Copperbelt.
</P>
<P>
Alex Chilufya, Police Public Relation Officer said here
Saturday that the amnesty was effective from Saturday midnight,
Times of Zambia reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The police officer announced on behalf of the government that
illegal weapons, especially military firearms, should be
surrendered to the nearest police stations and the owners would
not be prosecuted for not being licensed.
</P>
<P>
Chilufya, however, added that those in possession of military
weapons would not be allowed to get licenses.
</P>
<P>
He warned that any person who failed to take advantage of the
amnesty should be met with stern police action and hoped that the
public would cooperate during the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The officer specifically mentioned Lusaka and the Copperbelt
as the most targeted areas. The police would not compromise
with anyone who ignored the government's goodwill, he said.
</P>
<P>
Armed bandits have of late been terrorizing Lusaka and
Copperbelt residents at will.
</P>
<P>
A number of petrol filling stations in the capital have been
robbered on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
The most recent bizarre killing is that of former Finance
Minister Ronald Penza in cold blood at his resident early this
month.

<HEADLINE> Tough Laws Expected on Kenyan Tobacco Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco companies in Kenya
will soon have to comply with a tougher regulatory legislation,
Attorney-General Amos Wako has warned.
</P>
<P>
In collaboration with the Ministry of Health, new laws will
soon come out to monitor and regulate the presence of harmful
constituents contained in tobacco products, Wako was quoted by Sunday's
Daily Nation as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the laws, "the government intends to go beyond merely
carrying the warning that 'Smoking is harmful to your health,' it
will now require provision of a list of the harmful constituents
contained or generated in the smoke of the product and their
respective quantities," Wako said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming legislation will also regulate marketing and
advertizing of tobacco products and prohibit smoking in cinemas,
theaters, public transport, hospitals and other specified
buildings, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he assured those in the tobacco industry that the
laws are not meant to drive them out of business, urging them to
positively participate in the legislation.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the British American Tobacco (BAT)
Kenya's 1998 annual long service award-giving ceremony in
Nairobi.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Warns of More Syrian Ditches Along Yarmuk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has warned that it will
have less water from the Yarmuk River because Syria in the upper
reaches have built many ditches along the river's tributaries.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued by Jordanian Minister of Water and
Irrigation Hani Malki after a regular cabinet session on Saturday,
Sunday's semi-official Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Even now, Jordan can not get its full water share from the
river, as Syria has built more than 30 ditches and pumping
facilities along its tributaries to store water, said Malki.
</P>
<P>
Mainly because of Syria's construction of ditches, the annual
flow of the Yarmuk River has decreased to 270 million cubic
meters when it runs into Jordan from 470 cubic meters years ago
when it runs into Jordan, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Malki made these remarks as the two countries are holding a
joint meeting in Amman on sharing the water of the river, which
mainly feeds Jordan, Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan expects to get a dam project approved by the Syrian side
during the two-day meeting from Saturday to Sunday. The dam aims
to store water from the river for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In 1955, an Arab League committee on water set Jordan's
annual share of the river's water at 330 million cubic meters and
90 million for Syria. Syria currently gets 220 million cubic
meters of water from the river each year.

LUSAKA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The breakaway group has said
that the leader of the former rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) Jonas Savimbi has lost direction.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's Sunday Mail quoted leader of the Renovation Committee
of UNITA, Ngolo Manvkola, as saying here Saturday that Savimbi
has no longer any military strategy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Manvkola called for immediate
implementation of the Lusaka Peace Protocol signed four years ago
by the Angolan government and the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
He said that the war in Angola has lost meaning to UNITA
members and UNITA members feel there is no need to continue
fighting the government.
</P>
<P>
"Fighting the government is like waging a war against members
of the same family because we have representatives in
government," Manvkola said.
</P>
<P>
He said Savimbi still buys guns from East Europe via countries
in the Great Lakes region.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Reviews Tea Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
reviewing its Tea Act to make it responsive to the changing
demands of the industry.
</P>
<P>
"The intention of the review is to remove unnecessary controls
and to enhance the regulatory role of the Tea Board of Kenya
(KTDA) in a liberalized tea industry," said Agriculture Minister
Musalia Mudavadi, as quoted by the Nation newspaper Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the review has been accelerated because tea
is currently the country's largest foreign exchange earner with
an annual turnover of 54 billion Shillings (some 900 million U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months, the country earned 362 million
Dollars with tea export.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted a bumper tea harvest this year due to the
positive effects from the El Nino induced rains, the minister
said, adding that the 1998 production is likely to reach a record
peak of 280 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has increased investment in
infrastructure, especially roads, in tea-growing areas in order
to revamp the industry.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi said the government is taking structural reform
measures, including the removal of price control for tea sold in
the local market, creation of room for competition in tea-packing
and distribution, and the restructuring of the KTDA.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Bails out Cash-Strapped Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
injected two billion Shillings (33.6 million U.S. Dollars) to
save the cash-strapped National Bank of Kenya (NBK), the fourth
biggest in the country, from collapse.
</P>
<P>
The rescue package was announced Saturday by Finance Minister
Simeon Nyachae, following panic withdrawals by depositors of 1.6
billion Shillings from the bank in one week, national press
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"To ease pressure on the bank, the government has decided to
immediately inject two billion Shillings in honor of its
guarantee to the National Bank of Kenya in respect of these
parastatal loans" which borrowed money from NBK between
1990-1993, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NBK has non-performing loans amounting to a whopping three
billion Shillings, most of them are due from parastatals, private
companies and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the government paid 1.5 billion Shillings
to the NBK to settle debts owed to the institution by five
private companies.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said with 23 billion Shillings in
assets, NBK was "sound and healthy" and the run was induced by
the directors and shareholders of those private banks put under
statutory management by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) in the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the determination that the government will do
anything possible to re-stabilize the 55-member banking industry
in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
He claimed a plot had been hatched to scare NBK's depositors
by exaggerating the banks liquidity problems as part of a wider
scheme to pommel the government to pressurize the CBK to lower
the cash ratio and bail out troubled private banks through
provision of soft loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he advised fledgling banks to either amalgamate to
widen their capital base or transform themselves into financial
institutions to do away with demanding responsibilities such as
those of trading in the Clearing House.

<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines plans to speed
up the development of its rural air transport system by expanding
airport facilities, especially in the remote provinces, the
Philippines News Agency said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Vicente Rivera Jr., Secretary of Transportation and
Communications, was quoted as saying that this initiative would
spur economic activities in the countryside and improve the
delivery of basic services to the rural folks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a recent conference of the International
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (IAOPA) in California, the
United States, he said the country "cannot fully develop without a
strong rural air transport system."
</P>
<P>
Rivera asked the IAOPA to help the Philippines develop its
domestic airline capability.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that his country is a developing nation with about 65
percent of its people living in poverty, Rivera said a "robust
transport sector is seen as an important pre-requisite to its
overall development strategy."
</P>
<P>
In many parts of the country, he said, air transport is the
only time-efficient means of travel.

MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Despite the on-going financial

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese aid mission will
arrive in Manila this week to discuss details of the Philippines'
share in the 30 billion U.S. dollar Miyazawa aid package intended
for the recovery of Asian economies battered by the regional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The presidential palace announced here Sunday that the
government will channel its share of the Miyazawa fund to pro-poor
projects and programs, particularly in rural infrastructure and
social housing.
</P>
<P>
Among these are the construction of farm-to-market roads and
irrigation projects for farmers and low-cost homes for the urban
poor, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Miyazawa fund, named after Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, is one of the concrete measures announced by Japan at
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Kuala

<HEADLINE> School Dropouts Increase in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's economic hardships
and some traditional practice are forcing thousands of children
to drop out of schools, the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture
said in an interview with the newspaper that the high costs of
education which have been worsened by the economic structural
adjustment program are forcing both male and female children to
drop out of schools at an alarming rate with girls being the
worst affected.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent analysis by the U.S. Children and
Education Fund, the attrition rate in transition from primary to
secondary school for girls rose from 21 percent in 1985 to 33.5
percent in 1998 whereas that of boys rose from 16.12 percent to
26.1 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Children's Fund said the major causes of
girl-child lower participation and achievement rates include
socio-cultural influence on parents' preferences for the
education of males over girls, home work demands on girls, early
marriages and unhospitable school environments for the
girl-child.
</P>
<P>
Most parents interviewed by the newspaper said economic
hardships have led to lack of financial resources to send their
children to secondary school.
</P>
<P>
Sexual harassment and abuse of female pupils and students in
Zimbabwean school institutions are the problems, among others,
causing the dropouts, the Ministry of Education, Sports and
Culture said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, India Agree to Renew Transit Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India have agreed
to renew the bilateral transit treaty before its expiry on
December 5, press reports here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Indo-Nepal talks in this regard concluded last Friday in
New Delhi and India agreed to simplify the transit procedures for
Nepal, The Kathmandu Post said, quoting a joint press statement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had held four-day preliminary talks in Kathmandu
in September.
</P>
<P>
The daily said India agreed in principle to the automatic
renewal of the treaty every seven years, another request made by
the Nepali side.
</P>
<P>
India reiterated its commitment to finish the work on the
extension of the broad-gauge rail link between Raxual (India) and
Sirsia (Nepal) before the completion of the construction of the
Inland Container Depot (ICD) at Sirsia.
</P>
<P>
The work on the extension of the rail link is being financed
and carried out by the Indian government, the English-language
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side agreed in principle to the Nepali request for
the establishment of regular freight train service between the ICD
at Sirsia and the Calcutta port in India, on which Nepal depends
heavily on for foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
India agreed to provide increased storage area at the Calcutta
port to further facilitate the movement of Nepali cargo, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It said a bilateral agreement on regulation of trans-border
movement of motor vehicles is under consideration and both sides
acknowledged that its early conclusion would greatly facilitate
cross-border operations of passenger and cargo vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India share a 1,750-km-long border which is open to
each other.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the two sides also exchanged views on
cooperation between the two governments in preventing unauthorized
trade and expressed their determination to take all necessary
measures to combat such practices.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the treaty has to be endorsed by the cabinets of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As a land-locked country, Nepal largely depends on the transit
routes through India for foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> China To Reduce Losses in Relics Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- China is organizing scientific
and effective management to protect its hundreds of thousands of
historical sites in order to reduce losses caused by poor
management.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 300,000 sites of ancient structures,
including ancient buildings, temples, cultural ruins and burial
grounds in China, called "fixed cultural relics" by the central
government which trys to keep track of them all.
</P>
<P>
To date, 750 historical sites on the state protection list are
well-protected ones and are managed with comprehensive records.
</P>
<P>
However, most of those on regional-level protected lists merely
have the name and location, without adequate background material
and explanations, due to the lack of sufficient funds and
staff. Some ancient buildings are even facing threats from city
and county construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenbin, head of the State Cultural Relics Bureau, said
the bureau will standardize the management of historical sites,
establish data banks, and send specialists to cities and counties
to guide protection work.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also plans to organize training courses emphasizing
exploration and excavation, and surveying and drawing. It will
also develop software so that computer users can electronically
visit historical sites nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a set of atlases is expected to be completely
finished within the next decade which will detail all of China's
historical sites.

LHASA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A decade-long afforestation
drive has improved the ecological surroundings in southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region, according to the regional
forestry department.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 hectares of land have been covered with trees,
and a 400-hectare nursery has been planted, improving the
surroundings over a previously desert area of 20,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
With scant precipitation and high, rugged terrain, the region
is hostile to the growth of trees. Governments at all levels have
offered both financial and policy support to the afforestation
drive, and local people have participated in the drive
spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, Tibetans have volunteered to
plant more than 80,000 trees.
</P>
<P>
More than 85 percent of the farmland in Xigaze city is dotted
with shelter forests, which protect farmland from sand storms, and
about 3,000-hectares of afforested land grow trees for harvesting,

<HEADLINE> Price Drop Hits Mozambique's Cotton Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Owing to the price drop of
cotton on the international market, Mozambique's cotton export
income has droped sharply this year, though it is trying to
double its export volume.
</P>
<P>
Erasmo Muhate, Chairman of the Mozambican Cotton Association
has said that despite their double export volume this year,
their cotton export only gets in about 25 million U.S. Dollars as
compared to 30 million last year.
</P>
<P>
Cotton export companies tried to purchase cotton at 2,000
Metical (0.166 U.S. Dollars) a kilogram from farmers after the
price drop on international market, but were refused by farmers
who insisted to sell their produce at a price not less than 3,000
Metical a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's cotton was sold at a price of 3,300 Metical a
kilogram prior to the price drop at the interantional market.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique, with estimated 200,000 cotton farmers, grew about
70,000 tons of cotton last year, and about 80,000 to 85,000 tons
this year.

<HEADLINE> 992 NLD Members Resign in Myanmar: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 992 members of
Myanmar's opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) from 15
township branches in 8 states and divisions of the country have
resigned up to November 18 since September, the New Light of
Myanmar newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 10 branches of the party have been dissolved, the
official newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The NLD members are said to have resigned out of their own
volition, for they had no desire to carry out political activities
of the party.
</P>
<P>
The NLD members and branches are said to have presented their
resignation and dissolution requests to their respective township
offices of the Multi-Party Democracy Election Commission formed
to supervise the general election held in May 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, the Yangon-based NLD headquarters charged in a series
of statements that the authorities have been cracking down on the
party, pressuring its detained members to resign and some
township branches to dissolve illegally and forcibly.
</P>
<P>
The NLD said it "could not accept the dissolution (of the
branches) at all," adding that "as a branch of the party, it has
no rights to do so without the knowledge of the Central
Headquarters."
</P>
<P>
It also said that the move goes against the Political Parties
Registration Law designed by the authorities concerned.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of the NLD members and the dissolution of its
branches came after a series of government-organized "mass
rallies" across the country against the NLD and its leadership,
especially Aung San Suu Kyi, the party's general secretary.
</P>
<P>
The NLD said the authorities were "illegally" using people from
all walks of life who are under "pressure" to express the
"people's desire," creating further political confusion.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that it reserves the rights to organize
similar mass rallies to present facts on the current situation in
Myanmar as a legal political party.
</P>
<P>
The NLD won the 1990 general election -- contested by 93
political parties -- with 396 parliamentary seats out of 485.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Building Material Prices Soaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Prices of building materials
in Zimbabwe have shot up by between 50 and 100 percent over the
past few months, as the industry reacts to the continued
devaluation of the Zimbabwean Dollar and the recent 68 percent
fuel hike.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted earlier this week by the Mail newspaper
showed that prices of cement and other building materials had
been hiked to offset increased production and overhead costs, the
paper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This was having a great impact on most home builders who have
been forced to shelve their building projects to seek for more
funds, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Retail outlets said the price of cement had risen three times
over the past four months.
</P>
<P>
Other materials like timber and paint shot up by almost 55
percent as manufacturers and retailers passed on the costs to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Zimbabwean Dollar has been devalued by about 60
percent due to worsening economic situation in the country.

BANGKOK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to cash
in some 5 billion bahts (139 million US dollars) from the
upcoming 13th Asian Games, the Thai tourism authorities estimated

Sports fans from China, Japan and South Korea have booked some
10,000 tickets for their cheering squads, mostly soccer fans,
said the officials in charge of Asian Games tickets.
</P>
<P>
However, the sale of tickets is far behind the expectation and
the organizers have resorted to cheaper prices to allure more
local fans to the sports venues.

COLOMBO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) would be aiming to uproot one of the major army camps
in the Mannar area of the Northern Province of Sri Lanka during
its "heroes' week", according to reports reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Military sources were quoted as saying there were reports that

<HEADLINE> President Jiang's Visit Is of Historical Significance: Ambassador (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's visit to Japan will have historic significance and an
impact on Sino-Japanese relations, Japanese ambassador to China
Sakutaro Tanino told Xinhua at weekend.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang will be the first Chinese head of state to
visit Japan, he pointed out, and the Japanese government hopes the
visit will provide a good opportunity to gear relations to the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Tanino has been studying Sino-Japanese relations studies for
almost four decades. Looking back, he said that Japan's aggression
and colonial in the past caused great tremendous losses and
suffering and that Japan has expressed its heart-felt apologies
for these acts.
</P>
<P>
He said the current Sino-Japanese relations are the result of
hard work and great efforts by many statesmen and men of insight
of both countries, and that Japan and China, leaving aside their
differences in ideology and social systems and by opposing
hegemonism, concluded a peace and friendship treaty 20 years ago
when the Cold War was still going.
</P>
<P>
That treaty provided an important basis for promoting
friendship between the people of both countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanino served previously in Japan's foreign ministry and said
that he is proud to have witnessed the signing of the
treaty. President Jiang's coming visit coincides with the treaty's
20th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang will discuss youth exchanges and cooperation in
science, technology, enterprises, and environmental protection for
the 21st century.

<P>
Moreover, Tanino noted, the trade volume between the two
countries was worth 63.8 billion U.S. dollars last year, while the
1972 figure was only 1.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan has invested in more than 16,000 projects worth
approximately 30 billion U.S. dollars and that Japan has become
China's largest trading partner, and China is Japan's second
largest, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciates China's reduction of exports to Japan
this year, and that Japanese investment in China has been dropping
since 1996 because of the poor performance of Japan's domestic
economy.
</P>
<P>
Japan will work hard to revitalize its economy, restructure its
financial system, and stabilize the exchange rate of the Japanese
yen, he said, and he believes that Japan's economic recovery and
the improvement of China's investment environment will benefit
Sino-Japanese economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Tanino worked in Beijing in the 1970s and has personally
witnessed for the enormous changes that have taken place since the
reforms and opening-up policy started two decades ago and said
that the most important change is in the people's thinking rather
than in the appearance of more skyscrapers and cars. The Chinese
are now more open and pragmatic and China is more energetic, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese ambassador finally said he would like to convey
the best wishes of the Japanese people to the Chinese people and
he was looking forward to the complete success of President
Jiang's Japan Trip.

<HEADLINE> More Firms Set To List in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A fresh group of mainland
companies is poised to go public in Hong Kong as the market show
signs of stabilizing, reported China Daily today.
</P>
<P>
The China Securities Regulatory Commission last week said it
had completed the selection of the fifth batch of firms for
overseas listing, and Hong Kong is the prime choice for such
firms.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong market has returned to around 10,000 points from
its low of about 6,000 last year, buoyed by a reviving Japanese
currency and a belief that regional economies have reached the
bottom, and are set to recover. And many international investors
are coming back to the Hong Kong market from the United States as
the prospects of the US economy remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
The full list of H-share candidates has not been publicized,
but market sources said the majority of the enterprises are from
industries in the infrastructure sector such as airport and
highway construction and power generation.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure companies are believed to have stable and
lucrative yields. Moreover, these firms are usually new and free
from the burdens of social obligations which hamper the operations
of the many State firms.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts said the "China fever" seen in the first
half of last year will not recur because investors have become
more realistic in the wake of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Investors will be cautious as there are still many
uncertainties as to what measures China will take to sustain its
high economic growth next year, analysts said, adding investors
will check the quality of the listed companies carefully rather
than just snapping up any old China-related shares, as they tended
to do early last year.

<HEADLINE> Innovation Key to China's Future Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The experience of foreign
high-tech firms was highlighted in discussions on the upgrading of
Chinese enterprises at a recent forum sponsored by US firm
AlliedSignal in Dalian, a port city in northeast China's Liaoning
Province, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The debate at the forum was part of the worldwide discussion on
how best to deal with the current economic situation, in which
stagnating markets go hand-in-hand with financial volatility, said
the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The need for greater innovation is regarded as especially
urgent in China, where industrial output generated by high-tech
products accounts for less than 10 percent of the country's total,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It noted that science and technology now only contribute to
around 30 percent of China's economic growth, while their share in
developed countries is usually between 60 and 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
And only about 10 percent of scientific research findings in
China find their way into production.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, AlliedSignal, a New Jersey-based
high-tech manufacturing company in the aerospace, automotive and
chemicals sectors, is playing an active role in financing
high-tech projects and training local personnel.

<HEADLINE> China Inspires Foreign Firms To Exploit Coalbed Methane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- China's fledging coalbed
methane industry is expected to take off in the near future,
thanks to a series of effective incentive, according to China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The China United Coalbed Methane Co. Ltd(CUCBM) has drilled 11
self-financed wells that indicate sound gas flows, said Sun
Maoyuan, vice-president of the company.
</P>
<P>
North China's Shanxi Province, which possesses about
one-quarter of China's total coalbed methane reserves, wishes to
promote comprehensive co-operation with the company to shape the
coalbed methane sector as one of its pillar industries, Sun noted.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that five contracts between CUCBM and three US
companies have been implemented smoothly, and it is now
negotiating with several foreign partners to expand co-operation
to Jiangxi, Xinjiang and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of foreign companies expressed strong enthusiasm in the
investment, but they said incentives offered by the Chinese
government are inadequate, and infrastructure for coalbed methane
transportation and distribution is non-existent.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that China should implement more favourable
incentives for coalbed methane exploitation than for conventional
natural gas and oil, since it carries higher risks, higher
front-end costs, and longer payback periods.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises can enjoy import duty exemption and a low
value-added tax rate of only 5 percent, according to Li Hongxun,
an official with the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Coalbed methane is an unconventional form of natural gas. To
prevent gas explosions, 6 billion cubic metres of methane are
expelled from China's mines annually, seriously polluting the
environment and wasting energy resources.
</P>
<P>
China's coalbed methane reserves, estimated at 30 to 35
trillion cubic metres, are located about 2,000 metres
underground. And CUCBM aims to produce 10 billion cubic metres
annually by 2010.

BELGRADE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel said Saturday that the Kosovo crisis is
expected to be solved politically within this year, reported the

<P>
Schuessel, whose country is holding the rotating presidency of
the European Union (EU), made the remark in a visit to Banja Luka,

</P>
<P>
More efforts have been made to increase political contacts over
the issue, he added.

situation" in Kosovo, saying that the ceasefire accord has been
generally observed.

refusal to open a dialogue with the Belgrade authorities,
Schuessel said he hoped "wise political leaders (of the ethnic

Rolf Rue, president of Airbus Industrie China Operations, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the period, he predicted, Chinese airlines will need to
purchase 1,381 airliners with 70 or more seats, worth some 130
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese airlines have incurred losses recently due to a
sharp decline in traffic and profits caused by the economic
turmoil and a slowdown in domestic economic growth, said the China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
But it quoted analysts as saying that the downturn was
temporary, as China's aviation sector can still expect rapid
expansion of passenger and cargo demand.
</P>
<P>
Bai Zhijian, president of the China Aviation Supplies Import &AMP;
Export Corp., China's only authorized civil aircraft importer,
told the newspaper: "The government is not saying it is suspending
approval for purchases of aircraft; the policy is to decelerate
the pace of fleet expansion for the time being because of the
Asian crisis."

<HEADLINE> Action Taken to Help Enterprises Fight Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese governmental
institutions have taken concrete measures to help small and
medium-sized firms upgrade technology and reduce pollution, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Environmentally Sound Technology Transfer Centre,
established last year, has set up a website on the Internet to
offer domestic and overseas research institutes and enterprises a
means to communicate through www.cestt.org.cn for eco-friendly
technology exchanges, said Shi Han, director of the center.
</P>
<P>
It will also help these firms find financing to ease capital
shortages which have hindered technological upgrading, and the
center's services will focus on the paper, food, leather,
electroplating, and textile industries, which pose more serious
pollution threats, noted Shi.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science and Technology has set up a fund with 3
billion yuan (361 million U.S. dollars) for the enterprises to
upgrade traditional industries and develop high technology, since
most of them have difficulties in the appliance of eco-friendly
technology due to capital shortages.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Bank of China, one of the country's major
commercial banks, will give priority assistance to enterprises
that operate in line with State environmental protection
regulations and particularly those which introduce advanced
environmental protection technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture show that small and
medium-sized enterprises account for 98.6 percent of all
industrial firms. Most of them have difficulties in using
eco-friendly technology due to insufficient funds.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises contribute to a quarter of China's gross
domestic produce, one third of farmers' incomes and 47 percent of
industrial incremental value, according to the Township Enterprise
Department of the Ministry of Agriculture.

<HEADLINE> China to Issue Corporate Bonds for Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Railways (MOR)
and a group of enterprises will soon be approved to issue
corporate bonds to finance the country's infrastructure
construction spree, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Companies on the candidate list include central and regional
enterprises in such sectors as highway construction, urban sewage
disposal and treatment and telecommunications, the paper quoted a
government source as saying.
</P>
<P>
It said the quota of bond issue for MOR is 1.6 billion yuan
(192 million US dollars), though the national quota is still not
available.
</P>
<P>
"The quota will not be publicized to avoid an impact on the
stock market," the source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
China launched a gigantic infrastructure building program
earlier this year to stimulate its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Officials have said that the main funding sources for the
program include September's 100 billion yuan treasury bond issue,
bank loans and enterprises' own reserves.
</P>
<P>
China's corporate bond issuers must obtain official approval
before going ahead. Financial authorities usually examine
applicants once a year and applicants from different industries
are examined together.
</P>
<P>
This year, the authorities singled out infrastructure projects
for examination first to enable qualified firms in this sector to
get the funds as soon as possible, said the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest water
conservancy and hydropower project, is also on the candidate
list.
</P>
<P>
The project, which first tried a corporate bond issue last year
with a one billion yuan offer, has a quota of two billion yuan
this time, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> EU Backs Italy in Its Dispute With Turkey Over Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
supports Italy in its standoff with Turkey over the extradition of
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, the Austrian Foreign
Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Austria, in its capacity serving the EU's rotating presidency,
expressed "full solidarity with Italy in her determination to
fully implement her laws and treaty obligations," according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Italy has rejected Turkey's demand to hand over Ocalan,
detained in Rome on November 12 on a false passport, on the ground
that its constitution forbids extradition to a country where death
penalty is in force.
</P>
<P>
Ankara brands Ocalan as "the world's bloodiest terrorist,"
holding him responsible for more than 30,000 deaths in the 14-year
armed campaign led by his Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) for a
Kurdish homeland in southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Austrian Foreign Ministry also
contained the EU's condemnation of all forms of terrorism,
including the PKK's "terrorist activities".
</P>
<P>
In this context, the EU reiterated the significance of
international conventions, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Davenport Meets Hingis in Chase Championship Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Already assured of
finishing the year as the No. 1 player in the world, Lindsay
Davenport of the United States is one win away from closing the
year in style.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, the top seed, advanced to the final of the s
eason-ending 2 million US dollars Chase Championships today with
a gutty three-set win over former No.1 Steffi Graf of Germany.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old overcame a nasty blister on her left foot and
rallied from trouble in the third set to beat the five-time cha
mpion 6-1, 2-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Davenport's opponent in Sunday's best-of-five set final will
be Martina Hingis of Switzerland -- the woman she replaced at No.
1. Hingis set up a rematch of this year's U.S. Open final by
beating Romanian Irina Spirlea 6-2, 7-6 (9-7) in today's other
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
"It will be really fun, one versus two," Davenport said. "Even
though I will be No.1, it will be an interesting match. We have
played a lot this year."
</P>
<P>
The two have met four times this year, with Davenport winning
three of those matches. She topped Hingis to win her first Grand
Slam singles title just over two months ago at the U.S. Open in
New York. The all-time series stands tied at 6-6.
</P>
<P>
Davenport's victory snapped Graf's 12-match winning streak, a
run compiled over the past three weeks, and ended Graf's 10-match
winning streak at the Chase Championships. It also avenged a
loss to Graf in the final of last week's Avanta Championships.
</P>
<P>
"Last week, she played unbelievable," Davenport said of Graf.
"I think she made a few more mistakes today."
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I am disappointed right now," Graf said after the
match."I knew I was really close and I don't know what happened."
</P>
<P>
"I gave it everything I had the last three weeks and that was
a lot," said Graf, who today became the only WTA Tour player to
play four straight three-set mathces in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hingis improved her record to 6-0 against Spirlea and staged
an impressive comeback in the second set to keep from losing a
set for the first time against the tall Romanian.
</P>
<P>
"It was just a good comeback," said Hingis, who will be
appearing in the final for the second time in three years.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Lewis Camp Dismiss Unification Doubts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- British boxer Lennox Lewis's
manager Frank Maloney dismissed Saturday suggestions that the
British boxer's world heavyweight unification bout with Evander
Holyfield could be in doubt.
</P>
<P>
The title showdown, which has taken months to set up, is due
to take place in March next year.
</P>
<P>
But Holyfield's attorney and adviser Jim Thomas is reported to
have said there are issues - believed to be concerning the
payment of undercard fighters and sponsorship - that are still to
be sorted out.

<HEADLINE> New Grain Distribution System Working In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- More state-owned grain
enterprises are improving as China's grain distribution reform
begins taking effect.
</P>
<P>
China started the reforms in April, stopping grain dealers from
purchasing grain directly from peasants or doing wholesale
business. Jiangxi province observed state policies in providing
better service, purchasing all surplus grain farmers offer, and
paying cash on delivery.
</P>
<P>
As a result, sales of state-owned grain enterprises in the
province are up 430 million kg from last year. The province has
closed 1,321 private grain wholesale shops and confiscated 9.47
million kg of illegally purchased grain, and grain companies have
reported profits of 13.6 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's state grain companies have lost more than 100 billion
yuan over the past several years. Nearly half the country's grain
was sold by state companies, whose poor operations made it
difficult for them to guide grain prices or for the government to
regulate the grain market and stop grain speculation.
</P>
<P>
"Because private enterprises sold grain at a low price, we had
to sell at a price lower than what we paid peasants. That's why we
are always losing money," said one saleswoman at a state-owned
grain company. But, the present grain price is acceptable for one
young woman who was buying grain at a shop, who says that if grain
is always selling for less than the purchase price, the grain
market will be in a chaos.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ruling Party Proposes to put Soeharto Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The dominant Golkar faction of
Indonesia's People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) has proposed to
the government to put former president Soeharto under house
arrest, Antara news agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Such decision should take effect starting on the date of its
issuance," the faction's spokesman, Marzuki Darusman, said here
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The move was necessary as part of concrete legal steps to solve
the former president's alleged involvement in corrupt, collusive
and nepotistic practices as quickly as possible, Antara quoted
Marzuki as saying.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the government's announcement to set up an
independent committee to probe into Soeharto's wealth amassed
during his 32 years of rule, he said the decision to put him under
house arrest could be made before or at the time when the
committee has been set up.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung disclosed Saturday that
President B.J. Habibie will soon set up a committee that will
probe into the wealth of Soeharto as decreed by the MPR.
</P>
<P>
The Special Session of the MPR, which ended on November 13,
agreed to add a provision to a decree on clean government,
preventing centralization of power, corruption. collusion and
nepotism.
</P>
<P>
Political parties, public figures and students have urged the
government to implement the decree immediately so as to push
forward sweeping reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung said the committee will be made up of figures with
strong integrity and credibility, and that the president himself
will appoint the members of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki suggested that the committee be made up of experts from
various disciplines.
</P>
<P>
In September, President Habibie set up two teams to investigate
the wealth of Soeharto. Last week, the Attorney General's office
revealed that the government had found 2.3 million U.S. dollars
worth of accounts in Soeharto's name with domestic banks. Some
estimates have put Soeharto and his family's wealth as high as 40
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Historians Say China over 1,000 Years Ago Was Attractive Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Tang Dynasty (618-907)
was a center of Eastern and Western culture and was regarded as
the most attractive place and a "melting pot" in the world,
historians say.
</P>
<P>
At an international symposium on Tang culture, Ge Chengyong, of
Northwest University, said on Friday that there was a cultural
blending in the 200 years before the Tang Dynasty and the Han had
genetic exchanges with minorities, giving openness and
civilization to the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
In 731, more than 50,000 non-Han people from areas north and
west of China were permitted to move to the interior and many
businessmen with long noses could be seen in Chang'an, the capital
of the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Ge says that the government of the Tang Dynasty had many
preferential policies for immigrants, including tax exemptions,
and that more than a tenth of the high-ranking officials at
provincial level in the Tang non-Han people.
</P>
<P>
There were foreigners from more than 70 countries in China. If
they violated the laws of the Tang Dynasty, they were treated the
same way as the Han, according to the laws, Ge says.
</P>
<P>
The Tang Dynasty encouraged foreign trade and reduced taxes for
foreign businessmen and it was easy for foreign businessmen to get
rich.
</P>
<P>
The government permitted marriage with non-Han minorities, but
forbade foreign husbands to take away their Han wives, Ge says.
</P>
<P>
There was a variety of exotic cultures in the Tang capital and
many foreign singers and dancers performed in the Tang palace.
</P>
<P>
With its political, economic and cultural advantages, Tang
dynasty was worthy of the center of the world then.
</P>
<P>
The material richness, cultural prosperity, and scientific
development of the Tang dynasty attracted a large number of
foreign scholars to China, Ge says.

<HEADLINE> Venables Says Allegations Are "Rubbish" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Terry Venables, manager of the
Crystal Palace football club, said that the allegations against
him were "absolute rubbish".
</P>
<P>
According to the Independent newspaper on Saturday, police in
Hampshire are investigating the transfer of five Australian
players to Portsmouth Football Club while the former England and
Spurs manager Terry Venables was chairman.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that police officers have asked Interpol
to make inquiries in Australia.
</P>
<P>
But Venables said on Saturday evening that the allegations
were "absolute rubbish".
</P>
<P>
After his current team Crystal Palace had lost at Swindon,
Venables said: "I have got nothing to say about it and I have
never heard from anyone.
</P>
<P>
"The front page of that national newspaper was absolute
rubbish."
</P>
<P>
He also described earlier press reports as "fabrication".
</P>
<P>
Fraud squad officers are looking into "allegations of bad
business practice" brought to their attention by the current
board.
</P>
<P>
Central to the concerns raised are "the transfer of five
Australian players bought by Terry Venables when he was at the
club", according to the police.
</P>
<P>
After leaving his job as England coach, Venables moved on to
take up the same post with the Australian football side.
</P>
<P>
It was pipped to qualify for the 1998 World Cup, in France, by
the Iranian national team.
</P>
<P>
The allegations come soon after Crystal Palace called in the
Football Association to examine the transfers of two Chinese
players Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai after a discrepancy was revealed
between the fee and the amount the Chinese authorities were
expecting to receive.

<HEADLINE> Hodgson Quits as Blackburn Hit Bottom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Roy Hodgson has parted company
with Blackburn Rovers after the club hit rock bottom following a
humiliating 2-0 defeat at the hands of relegation rivals
Southampton in English Premier League on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hodgson wrote in his regular Saturday newspaper column only
hours before the game: "The way a manager behaves in times of
crisis can often be the decisive factor in determining whether a
team pulls through or slides deeper into trouble."
</P>
<P>
Rovers fans will hope his decision to quit will not be the
decisive factor leading to their relegation.
</P>
<P>
The club, who won the championship only three years ago, have
won only two of their 14 league games and conceded 22 goals this
season.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Hodgson had been touted as the next England
manager and angry Blackburn fans were mockingly chanting "Hodgson
for England" towards the end of game.
</P>
<P>
Hodgson failed to appear at the post-match press conference,
and instead, chief executive John Williams announced that he had
left the club.
</P>
<P>
A club statement said: "Following the run of recent poor
results, Jack Walker and Roy Hodgson have agreed that Roy will be
leaving the club.
</P>
<P>
"The club are disappointed at this outcome but feel the
decision is inevitable and in the best interests of Blackburn
Rovers."
</P>
<P>
Hodgson was a surprise appointment in June 1997 as the club
attempted to rebuild after they managed only 13th place under Ray
Harford.
</P>
<P>
Not well-known in England, Hodgson was a much-respected coach
on the continent. He built his reputation in Sweden where he led
Malmo to five consecutive titles, and then cut his international
teeth with the Swiss national team, taking them to the 1994 World
Cup and 1996 European championship finals.
</P>
<P>
That was enough to persuade Inter Milan to offer him one of
the biggest jobs in the game, coach to one of the most
prestigious clubs in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Although he took Inter to the UEFA Cup final, he was unable to
mount a serious challenge to Juventus in the league and cut short
his contract after just one season in charge.
</P>
<P>
He faced a difficult job at Blackburn, but after taking a
while to settle in, he oversaw a late push that secured a UEFA
Cup place and restored the faith of the locals.
</P>
<P>
At the same time he earned a reputation as a shrewd TV analyst
and was mentioned as a possible future England manager.
</P>
<P>
He spent heavily to try to restore Blackburn's fortunes, but
some of his buys raised eyebrows among the Ewood Park fans.
</P>
<P>
Most notable was the purchase of Kevin Davies for 7.5 million
pounds (12.46 million U.S. dollars) from Southampton in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
Davies has failed to score this season and with 2.5 million
pounds (4.15 million U.S. dollars) Martin Dahlin struggling with
injury, Hodgson splashed out another 4.25 million pounds (7.06 mi
llion U.S. dollars) for Bolton's Nathan Blake last month.
</P>
<P>
Although Blackburn were struggling in the league and went out
of the UEFA Cup in the first round to Olympique Lyon, there was
no indication that Hodgson was considering leaving.
</P>
<P>
"We've had a bad start but our ambition is still to finish in
the top six," he said three weeks ago. The league is tight and we
should not abandon that ambition."
</P>
<P>
He became the fifth premier league coach to leave his club
this season after Liverpool's Roy Evans, Tottenham Hotspur's
Christian Gross, Newcastle United's Kenny Dalglish and Leeds
United's George Graham.

<HEADLINE> Aston Villa Tastes First Defeat at Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A hat-trick from Robbie Fowler
gave Liverpool a 4-2 victory over Aston Villa, which tasted its
first defeat of the season at the English Premier League on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The top three all lost as second-placed Manchester United went
down 3-1 at Sheffield Wednesday and third-placed Arsenal slipped
1-0 away to Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Those results allowed Chelsea and Leeds United to close
ground, with a 4-2 success at Leicester City and a 4-1 victory
over Charlton Athletic respectively.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool had won only once in their previous nine league
games but roared 2-0 ahead after seven minutes with headers by
Paul Ince and Fowler.
</P>
<P>
There was end-to-end action and chances galore but no more
goals until Dion Dublin pulled one back two minutes into the
second half.
</P>
<P>
Fowler restored the two-goal advantage only for Dublin, with
his seventh goal in three games since joining Villa from Coventry
City, to make it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Fowler struck again for 4-2 and Villa then had Stan Collymore
sent off for a second booking in the 68th minute.
</P>
<P>
Dublin missed a chance for his second successive hat-trick as
David James brilliantly saved his penalty after the keeper had
brought down Julian Joachim.
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful game and a great performance by my pla
yers," said Liverpool coach Gerard Houllier.
</P>
<P>
Sheffield Wednesday had only one win in their last 10 games
but a bad error by Peter Schmeichel, who let Niclas
Alexandersson's shot slip through his hands, allowed them to go
ahead after 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Andy Cole equalised but a second for Alexandersson and one by
Wim Jonk gave Wednesday the points.
</P>
<P>
A 77th minute Efan Ekoku goal was enough for Wimbledon to beat
Arsenal but a bigger worry for coach Arsene Wenger will be the
injuries received by Patrick Viera and Dennis Bergkamp that makes
both doubtful for Wednesday's European Champions' League game
against RC Lens.
</P>
<P>
"We were not aggressive enough, they won more of the fights,"
said Wenger.
</P>
<P>
Southampton climbed off the bottom for the first time this
season with a 2-0 win at Blackburn Rovers, the losers dropping to
last place. Matt Oakley, after four minutes, and Steve Basham, a
minute from time, earned Saints their first away win of the
season.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham Hotspur beat 10-man Nottingham Forest 2-0 and Mi
ddlesbrough beat Coventry by the same score.
</P>
<P>
There were 28 goals in the day's eight games, an average of
3.5 per match, which should hoist the premier league from last
place in Europe's goals-per-game standings.
</P>
<P>
Derby County play West Ham United on Sunday and Everton face
Newcastle United on Monday.

<HEADLINE> British Detectives Investigate Venables Transfers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Fraud squad detectives are
investigating the transfers of a number of Australian players to
Portsmouth Football Club while it was under the control of the
former England manager Terry Venables.
</P>
<P>
The Independent reported on Saturday that police in the
southern English county of Hampshire are examining allegations of
"bad business practice" involving the purchase of players last
year.
</P>
<P>
The report said five players are believed to be involved. They
include Robert Enes from Sydney United, Hamilton Thorpe from
Western Adelaide, Craig Foster from Fairfield Marconi and
Australian John Aloisi, who joined from the Italian club
Cremonesi. All four joined Portsmouth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Venables, who bought Portsmouth in August 1996 when the club
was in crisis, has declined to comment. His spokesman said "He
is not aware of any situation requiring any investigation in any
event."
</P>
<P>
News of the Portsmouth inquiry follows the decision taken on
Tuesday by English first division club Crystal Palace, where
Venables is now coach, to ask the Football Association to
investigate a shortfall in the payment for the transfer of two
Chinese internationals.
</P>
<P>
Palace paid 1.35 million pounds (about 2.27 million U.S.
dollars) in August for Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai. But the Chinese
football association is reported to expect 900,000 pounds (1.51
million U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
Venables has said he played no part in the Chinese transfers.
</P>
<P>
Palace said Friday it was "committed to the highest standards
of corporate governance". Portsmouth Football Club declined to
comment on the police inquiry.
