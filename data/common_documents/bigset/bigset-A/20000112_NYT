THE YEARS AND PAIN FAIL TO STOP ARMSTRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ The warm glow radiating from Trace Armstrong after
his three sacks last Sunday that helped the Miami Dolphins gain
their first road playoff victory in 28 years made it easier for him
to dismiss the message his body was sending. ``This time of year,
you're almost bankrupt physically,'' said Armstrong, a defensive
end.
</P>
<P>
   In his 11th National Football League season, Armstrong, who
recently turned 34 years old, spent his day off Monday mixing
plenty of rest with several hours of physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   His neck was still bothering him when he showed up Tuesday to
begin practice for Miami's American Football Conference playoff
game Saturday at Jacksonville. His performance in the 20-17 victory
over Seattle gave him a team-leading 10.5 sacks for the season.
That led to the question of whether he felt more like 24 than 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I feel more like 54,'' he said with a wane smile. ``Ask
me on Thursday or Friday. What is this anyway, Week 20?''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's body may be balking, but he has been playing his
whole career for the national stage that looms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature plays a cruel trick on you in this game,'' he said
softly. ``Just when you start to figure it out mentally, your
physical skills start to go. But when you get in a game like the
one this week, experience helps. Because playoff games are
different from regular-season games. The intensity level is higher.
The mistakes that are made are magnified.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is used mostly in passing situations, so the
6-foot-4-inch, 270-pounder must hope that his teammates can slow
down Jacksonville's running game, which he described today as the
league's best. But his value extends beyond his playing ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He studies film like a coach,'' said assistant head coach Dave
Wannstedt. ``He's like having another coach on the field. Plus, he
practices the way he plays. I had him seven years ago in Chicago
and he practices as hard now working on the little things as he did
then. That's the kind of example you hope a veteran sets.''
</P>
<P>
   His fellow defensive end Jason Taylor, in his third pro season,
makes it a point to sit next to Armstrong in meetings and said ``he
helps me every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Taylor is more than nine years younger.
Armstrong, who also is president of the National Football League
Players Association, is accustomed to being viewed as one of the
team's sages.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'm beyond even that stage,'' he said. ``I'm pretty
sure they view me like some antique.''
</P>
<P>
   After a pause, he added: ``I just enjoy helping players. If it's
in a meeting room, talking about how to run a stunt, or something
to think about on a blitz; or if it's off the field, guys wondering
about finances _ I just enjoy doing anything to help out.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is widely known that Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino,
now in his 17th season, has yet to get a Super Bowl ring, Armstrong
also is without one, having spent his first six seasons with
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized going into this year that we had an opportunity,
and you don't get them all the time,'' he said. ``You just start to
develop this feeling of urgency because you know you're not going
to be back too many more times or have too many more
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong plans to get a law degree when his football career is
over. Some even have called him the heir apparent to Gene Upshaw as
executive director of the players association.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't plan to quit playing the game for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have to run me off,'' he said. ``You have to realize
I've been a football player since I was 7. One of the strange
things about this game is you're 34, and in regular society that's
still a fairly young man, and they're starting to tell you you're
too old any more to do what you've done your whole life. It's
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong understands he could be looking at his chance of a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very solid football team,'' he said Tuesday. ``It's
not like we feel everybody has to play their best game for us to
win on Saturday.'' &QL;

SLICING BUDGET NUMBERS: JUST WHAT DO THEY MEAN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki's proposed new state budget is
$76.8 billion, a 5.5 percent increase. Right? Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to gauge what a governor's proposed budget actually means
is akin to palm-reading. The numbers are sliced so many ways, so
subject to manipulation and so prone to comparisons that make
``apples to oranges'' sound pretty good, that it is often hard to
know what to believe.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there are three budgets, not one. The core is the
general fund, about half the total, which generally includes state
taxes and the things they pay for.
</P>
<P>
   The next category is called the state funds budget, which
includes the general fund and various other sources of state
revenue and expenses, like tuition paid by students in the State
University system, and totals more than $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the all-funds budget, that $76.8 billion number,
which includes federal grants for things like welfare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki likes to talk about the general fund as being the
important figure, because it is the one that rises slowest. But,
like Gov. Mario Cuomo before him, he has dampened that rate of
increase simply by declaring that certain things are not part of
the general fund any more, though they are still reflected in the
state funds and all-funds budgets.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year-old state program to lower the property taxes charged
by local school districts also skews the results. It shows up on
the books as a spending item _ payments to the districts _ not as a
drop in revenue, the way an ordinary tax cut would. If this program
were calculated like other tax cuts, the overall spending increase
would be 3.4 percent, not 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also routinely overestimates what programs will cost, and
underestimates tax revenue, as a way of restraining the
Legislature's tendency to spend freely. That makes comparisons to
past years difficult. The State Senate and the Assembly, in
drafting their budget plans, will change those estimates,
``finding'' billions of dollars more to spend but claiming that the
total is the same as the governor's.
</P>
<P>
   The final budget tends to lean toward the governor's penchant
for caution. For example, the 1998-99 budget was called a $71.4
billion plan when it was adopted, but once the fiscal year ended,
it turned out that the state had spent $70.6 billion. How much is
the 1999-2000 state budget? No one will really know until after the
fiscal year ends March 31. The administration is calling it $72.8
billion, but that is just an estimate.
</P>
<P>
   So the 5.5 percent increase in the governor's new proposed
budget is arrived at by dividing a projection by an estimate. In
other words, don't bet on that figure turning out to be accurate.
</P>

 DeVRY GIVES CAREER TRAINING THE OLD COLLEGE TRY  
 (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers

 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A knit cap on his head, his long legs encased in
baggy jeans, Issan Duke was perched on a stool in the computer
laboratory at the DeVry Institute of Technology, an upstart college
in the Long Island City section of Queens that believes it has
created a practical and efficient form of career-oriented liberal
arts education.
</P>
<P>
   In the lab, a bright, cavernous room with row after row of
computers and other technical equipment, Duke, a 20-year-old
first-term student, patiently pinched clamps onto thin wires,
measuring voltage.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Jayson Burton, an ebullient 18-year-old freshman, was
learning to use Microsoft's PowerPoint software program. And Jaya
Ramathal, a fourth-semester student, was working on an accounting
assignment that called for using software to send out checks and
bills.
</P>
<P>
   In its concentration on career skills, DeVry _ a part of DeVry
Inc., one of the largest commercial higher education groups in the
United States _ sounds like those ubiquitous proprietary or career
schools that used to be a staple of matchbook covers. Those
no-frills schools promise to prepare students quickly for rewarding
careers in business and technology, without the extras of a rounded
liberal arts education.
</P>
<P>
   DeVry, too, promises a quick path to a career, but the
resemblance ends there. The DeVry Institutes are a chain of 17
accredited colleges that grant baccalaureate degrees but have
followed a McDonald's formula: Their programs are quick, relatively
inexpensive (for a private college) and quality-controlled. That
translates into a limited curriculum of standard courses designed
at the company's headquarters in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to produce Harvard graduates,'' said Ronald
Taylor, DeVry Inc.'s president. ``Our students are interested in a
career and want the skills _ technical and nontechnical _ to do the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the focus is on practical knowledge and careers, DeVry
also makes a substantial effort to give students a traditional,
though abbreviated, general education. A bachelor's degree
candidate, for example, must take 12 credits of humanities, 12
credits of social sciences and 13 credits of communications,
including composition, professional writing and public speaking.
</P>
<P>
   There are no sororities or fraternities, no football team and no
summer vacations (they are not considered a good use of the
student's time or the school's physical plant). But DeVry says that
more than 92 percent of its graduates who look for jobs in their
field find them within six months of graduation.
</P>
<P>
   DeVry differs from traditional colleges in other ways, too. It
uses market research to help choose the fields it offers and
television advertisements to attract students. And its faculty in
Queens _ a mix of 25 full-time and 41 part-time teachers _ is on
contract (there is no tenure), and all teachers are evaluated
annually. The only criterion is teaching, not research, although
many members of the faculty _ more than half of whom have
doctorates _ conduct research on their own time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a much more vigorous accountability system than at
other colleges,'' said Roger Andersen, president of the Queens
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory work is at the heart of what the college offers.
Other colleges assign homework, but for students at DeVry,
projects, problems and papers are commonly done during class on
computers or machines.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of study and less than $40,000 in tuition
(less for programs like accounting that require only eight
semesters), students emerge with a bachelor's degree, a smattering
of humanities and social sciences, and hands-on training in a
business or technical field like electronics, computer information
systems or accounting.
</P>
<P>
   DeVry's businesslike approach, which some see as a threat to
more traditional, not-for-profit colleges, has paid dividends not
only in steadily rising revenues and earnings (DeVry Inc. earned a
record $39 million last fiscal year on revenues of $421 million),
but also in an expanding student body. In November, the company had
43,063 undergraduates, and another 6,180 graduate students at its
graduate school of management.
</P>
<P>
   While the formula may be efficient, some educators at more
traditional colleges are concerned that students are shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of college should be to expand horizons and allow
students to explore,'' said Joanne Reitano, a history professor at
CUNY's La Guardia Community College, just a block from DeVry. ``The
purpose of education is to nurture, not to narrow.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an old industrial neighborhood near the 59th Street Bridge,
the Queens campus is DeVry's first in New York City, but Taylor
envisions two or three eventually. And despite abundant
competition, the 14-month-old campus is ahead of projections, DeVry
executives say. With 1,248 students this term _ three-quarters of
them black or Hispanic _ the college has already exercised its
option to expand to three floors from two in its building, the
former International Design Center of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Students say the expansion will come none too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeVry is overpopulated,'' said Nelson Fong, a third-term
student who transferred from the State University of New York at
Buffalo. ``Sometimes when we're scheduled for labs we can't get
computers. You just stand around and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the hands-on lab work, DeVry's formula calls for
students to plunge immediately into their areas of concentration.
The formula also calls for them to attend three 15-week semesters a
year _ basically year round. Students must be in school five hours
a day, five days a week, and virtually every minute in classes and
labs is accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   That approach appeals to many students. Duke, who is 20 and in
his first semester of study to be an electronics technician,
transferred to DeVry from City University's New York City Technical
College after repeatedly failing CUNY's writing examination.
</P>
<P>
   Although DeVry is more expensive (about $4,400 a semester, vs.
$1,600 for New York residents at a CUNY senior college), Duke said
he was attracted by the hands-on learning and the year-round
schedule, which will let him earn an associate's degree in less
than two years. ``I knew I could finish in a certain time and get
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Qureshi, a 21-year-old student from Pakistan who wants to
be an information technology consultant, transferred to DeVry from
Hudson County Community College in New Jersey to follow his
favorite professor, Eli Weissman. He said he found DeVry ``much
faster and up to date'' than Hudson, and liked being able to take
more computer courses and fewer general education courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Hudson, I would have graduated in June with an associate's
degree,'' he said. ``Now I'll graduate in another year with a
bachelor's degree.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nalisha Bhimsingh came to DeVry from her native Trinidad after
hearing about it from a cousin in Canada. Now in the fourth
semester of the five-semester electronics technician program, she
works as a tutor and lab assistant and expects to earn her
associate's degree in June.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that DeVry works for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, who transferred to DeVry from the State University at
Buffalo, said he had been attracted by DeVry's smaller classes and
fewer general education requirements. But after a year, he said, he
told the dean that DeVry was not offering the courses he needed and
that some of the teachers were not very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that I don't have to take too many courses that
don't pertain to my interests,'' Fong said. ``But it's more narrow
than I expected.'' He said some of his classmates had left and he
was considering leaving, too.
</P>
<P>
   DeVry executives will not talk about dropout rates for any
single campus, but they say the national graduation rate is close
to 40 percent, in line with national averages.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen says that as the college grows, it will expand its
offerings, making it more attractive. In the meantime, he has his
sights set on the college's first graduation, in June.

JERVIS ANDERSON, 67, WRITER FOR NEW YORKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jervis Anderson, a staff writer for The New Yorker
for 30 years and a leading chronicler of African-American life best
known for his biographies of A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin,
died sometime over the Christmas and New Year holidays at his home
here. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently died of natural causes, according to Ellen
Borakove, a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner. His
body was found Jan. 7 after neighbors noticed newspapers and mail
piling up.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's most recent book, ``Bayard Rustin: Troubles I've
Seen,'' a biography of the civil rights advocate who played a
leading role in organizing the 1963 March on Washington, made the
New York Times best-seller list in 1997. In reviewing the biography
in The Times Book Review, Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at
Columbia University, wrote of Anderson: ``He provides the first
thorough account of Rustin's life and career, and he suggests how
Rustin became so eminent a figure without ever becoming a genuine
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was born in Jamaica, then a British colony, on Oct. 1,
1932. He attended the Kingston Technical School at Kingston's
University of the West Indies. He worked as a reporter for The
Daily Gleaner, the island's leading newspaper, and as a young man
became part of the circle around independence leader Michael
Manley. He wrote frequently for Public Opinion, a weekly magazine
edited by Manley's father, N.W. Manley.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson moved to New York in 1958 to attend New York
University, where he studied with philosopher Sidney Hook. In the
early 1960s he began to write for publications associated with New
York intellectual life, including Commentary and Dissent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Anderson became a staff writer for The New Yorker,
where he remained until his retirement in 1998. For most of that
time, he was the magazine's only black staff writer.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrik Hertzberg, senior editor at The New Yorker, who was a
friend and colleague of Anderson for 31 years, said that Anderson
was one of the last of a breed, ``the independent intellectual and
a man of letters.'' Hertzberg added, ``Without academic or
university affiliation, and with very little financial reward, he
followed his nose, his heart and his mind wherever they took him.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Anderson made a splash when his profile of A. Philip
Randolph, the labor and civil rights leader and Harlem Renaissance
figure, ran in three successive issues of The New Yorker. Published
as a book the following year, ``A. Philip Randolph: A Biographical
Portrait'' remains in print and is considered the definitive work
to date on Randolph, the founder and longtime president of the
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
1969 about Harlem's cultural history, Anderson wrote: ``To the
majority of blacks who are attracted by it, a yearning for Harlem
is akin to the call of home: where struggling, hoping, speaking,
loving, laughing, dancing, singing and sharing in the rich fund of
black American myth produce a sense of common experience, style and
cause; a place, too, where eyes and faces and gestures speak a
language so familiar that it registers not so much in the brains as
in the bones.''
</P>
<P>
   At The New Yorker, Anderson also wrote a four-part series of
articles on the cultural history of Harlem, published in book form
in 1982 as ``This Was Harlem: A Cultural Portrait, 1900-1950,'' In
the 90's, his articles for the magazine included profiles of Derek
Walcott, the Nobel Prize-winning poet; Cornel West, the scholar and
writer, and Wynton Marsalis, the jazz musician. David Remnick,
editor of The New Yorker, said, ``One of the most unforgettable
pieces he ever published here was a long profile of Ralph Ellison
in which he went back to Oklahoma with Ellison and painted the
deepest portrait of an extremely private man.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his books on Randolph, Rustin and Harlem,
Anderson was the author of ``Guns in American Life,'' a
journalistic study of America's fascination with firearms.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson's retirement from The New Yorker in 1998, he
remained active as a writer and scholar. At the time of his death,
he was working on a book about the young manhood of novelist Ralph
Ellison and a memoir of his own youth in Jamaica.

   Jerome Goldstein, 77, Founder Of a Furniture Polish Company &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Goldstein, who built a modest business selling a homemade
wood restorer into a multimillion-dollar, publicly traded company
called Scott's Liquid Gold, died Jan. 15 in Denver. He was 77 and
lived in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was large-cell lymphoma, said his son, Mark
Goldstein, the president and chief executive of the Denver company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Goldstein's mother, Ida, bought the formula for Scott's
Liquid Gold, a type of furniture polish, from a door-to-door
salesman for $350; the salesman had acquired it from a chemist, Lee
Scott, who developed it early in the century.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein and his two brothers began mixing and bottling the
liquid in a small garage in East Denver and sold it door to door. A
year later, Goldstein took the company public, and since then it
has expanded and developed new products like air fresheners and
cosmetics. .
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the company also owned the Aquafilter Corp.,
one of the world's largest manufacturers of cigarette filters.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped down as president and chief executive of Scott's in
1990 but retained the title of chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein was born on Sept. 23, 1922, in Denver and attended the
University of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Goldie, died in 1998. Besides his son, Goldstein
is survived by his second wife, Shirley Francis Goldstein; two
daughters, Leslee Brooks, of Encino, Calif., and Teri Owen, of
Manhattan; two brothers, Ivan Goldstein and Max Goldstein, both of
Jerusalem, and five grandchildren.

   Marcantonio Vilaca, 38; Art Dealer Promoted Brazilians
</P>
<P>
   Marcantonio Vilaca, an art dealer whose gallery in Sao Paolo was
as instrumental in introducing European and North American artists
to South America as it was in promoting young South American
artists abroad, died Jan. 1 at his parents' home in Recife, Brazil.
He was 38.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Karla Meneghel Ferraz de
Camargo, Vilaca's partner.
</P>
<P>
   Vilaca was born in Recife in 1962 and began collecting at the
age of 15. He graduated from Mackenzie University in Sao Paulo in
1985, majoring in law. Vilaca began his art career in the late
1980s, working first as director of Galeria Algodoeira Palmceirense
and then as co-owner of Galeria Passargada de Arte Contemporanca,
both in Sao Paulo. In 1992 he opened Galerie Camargo Vilaca with
Ms. Camargo. The gallery promoted, often with first shows, such
internationally known Brazilian artists as Beatriz Milhazes,
Ernesto Neto, Valeska Soares, Jac Leiner and Adriana Varejao.
Artists from the United States and Europe who had their first South
American exhibitions at Camargo Vilaca included Charles Long,
Fabian Marcaccio, Juan Usle, Pedro Cabrita Reis and Saint Clair
Cemin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his parents, Maria and Marcos Vilaca, he is
survived by a sister, Taciana Vilaca Bezerra of Recife, and a
brother, Rodrigo, of Sao Paulo.

EDITORIAL: A MISGUIDED EXPANSION OF STATES' RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan. 12:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's efforts to diminish the federal government's
authority over the states proceeded Tuesday with a 5-4 decision
holding that Congress lacked the power to bind state governments to
the federal law barring age discrimination in employment.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was the first of five major rulings dealing with
the fundamental constitutional issue of federalism _ the balance of
power between the states and the federal government _ that are due
from the court this term. It held that the states' sovereign
immunity from suits in federal court shielded them from Congress'
law against age discrimination in employment.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling applies to employees of state governments. These
employees will no longer be able to seek redress in federal court
under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Instead
they will have to make their case in state court, relying on the
often weaker protections provided by state age-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could conceivably call into question other existing
civil rights laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act. In
essence, the decision substituted the court's own judgment about
the seriousness of the age-discrimination problem for Congress'
judgment. In so doing, it adopted a constricted view of Congress'
traditional authority under the 14th Amendment's equal protection
clause to define and legislate civil rights protection for
vulnerable groups like older workers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and
joined by the other members of the court's aggressive ``states'
rights'' cluster _ Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy. Rulings
favorable to states' rights are no longer surprising from this
court. Even so, both the majority and dissenting opinions were
striking for the harshness of their wording. The federalism issue
is clearly a matter of profound debate on the court, and the lines
are beginning to harden.
</P>
<P>
   In an angry but well-reasoned dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens
skewered the majority for ignoring ``the importance of respecting
the Framers' decision to assign the business of lawmaking to the
Congress.'' The Framers, he noted, built ``important structural
safeguards'' into the Constitution by giving each state equal
representation in the Senate and apportioning the House along state
lines to insure that ``the normal operation of the legislative
process itself would adequately defend state interests from undue
infringement.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans concerned about preserving civil rights and Congress'
legitimate role in providing national remedies to national problems
had best brace themselves. Tuesday the justices also heard
arguments in another important federalism case, this one testing
the constitutionality of the Violence Against Women Act. The
age-discrimination decision could well be a harbinger of other
damaging federalism rulings to come.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you were watching the CBS Evening News broadcast
live from Times Square on New Year's Eve, you might have seen a
billboard advertising CBS News out in the square behind Dan Rather.
You might have looked at the well-placed billboard and wondered
just exactly how it was that CBS was able to place its ad so
fortuitously.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, it didn't. The billboard and the advertisement for
CBS did not exist. The image was digitally imported onto the live
CBS broadcast, obliterating an existing, real billboard _ the NBC
Astrovision underneath the New Year's ball and a Budweiser ad _
using electronic insertion technology.
</P>
<P>
   Inserting digital images has become increasingly common in
sports and entertainment programming, usually to insert advertising
and corporate logos , but has generally been considered out of line
in the world of news shows, a type of programming in which the
assumption of reality is considered sacrosanct, and not informing
viewers is considered a breach of journalistic guidelines. CBS
contends such practices do not cross ethical boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News is using the technology as part of a broad agreement
the network signed last year with a technology company, Princeton
Video Image, to provide branding services for a variety of CBS
programs. The technology has been used regularly on ``The Early
Show'' and the news magazine ``48 Hours'' and was used on the
``Evening News'' on Dec. 30 and 31, according to CBS news
executives.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, news show logos that appear real are being inserted
on the sides of structures like the General Motors building, on the
back of a horse-drawn carriage in Central Park, in the fountain
outside the Plaza Hotel and, on Tuesday's ``Early Show'' broadcast,
in the center of Wollman Rink in Central Park. In some instances,
the logo clearly resembles a large billboard advertising CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the technology is part of a multi-year deal that CBS
has signed with Princeton Video Image to provide branding services
for a variety of CBS programs. ``The Early Show'' has been the most
ardent user of the technology and has been using it almost every
day since the show's debut on Nov. 1, at times making it appear
that a large promotional billboard several stories high is attached
to the General Motors building, where the show is aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for some way to brand the neighborhood with
the CBS logo,'' said Steve Friedman, the executive producer of
``The Early Show.'' ``It's a great way to do things without ruining
the neighborhood. Every day we have a different way of using it,
whether it's logos or outlines. And we haven't even scratched the
surface of its uses yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said that the practice did not press the boundaries of
ethical guidelines for the CBS news division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not distort the content of the news,'' he said, and
compared the use of the technology to earlier visual innovations.
``I remember the hue and cry when people started to use graphics on
news.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS News' deal with the Princeton company was reported in the
Jan. 3 issue of the trade magazine Broadcasting &AMP; Cable magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said that the news division examines each case
individually before putting the virtual logos on air. ``The
technique, I find, works best if you put it someplace where there
is intended to be something,'' he said. ``If it feels that it is
not correct to use it, then we obviously won't use it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, knew about the use of the virtual technology
during the broadcast and did not protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he did not know in advance,'' Shapiro said. ``These are
not things he needs to worry about. He spends most of his time
worrying about the content of the broadcast. But as a production
technique he was most certainly aware that it was happening around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather did not return a phone call seeking comment Tuesday
night. Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson, anchors of ``The Early
Show,'' could not be reached for comment
</P>
<P>
   Harry Jessell, the editor of Broadcasting and Cable magazine,
said that the technology raised questions with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does raise some ethical questions for CBS,'' he
said. ``You would think that a TV news organization would not
tamper with video, especially live video. Viewers should be able to
rely on the fact that what they are seeing is actually there.''
</P>
<P>
   Network news has flirted with similar technological issues
before. In 1994, the use of a fake backdrop caused an outcry when
the ABC journalist Cokie Roberts appeared in front of a picture of
Capitol Hill. Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor, introduced a
report from Ms. Roberts and said that she was reporting from
Capitol Hill; Ms. Roberts, wearing a coat, appeared in front of
what looked like the Capitol. But without the knowledge of network
viewers or even Jennings, Ms. Roberts was actually inside the ABC
News Washington bureau with a photographic image of the Capitol
projected behind her. Ms. Roberts and Rick Kaplan, then the
executive producer of ``World News Tonight'' and now the president
of CNN, were both reprimanded and the network apologized on air.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for NBC, ABC and Fox said their news units did not use
such digital technology on news broadcasts. Christa Robinson, a
spokeswoman for CNN, said she knew of no instance of the
technology's use.

IN CONTEST FOR CONSERVATIVE VOTERS, 4 REPUBLICANS SHOWCASE A
CONSERVATIVE EDGE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reflecting the growing competition for the party's most
ideologically conservative voters, four of the Republican
presidential contenders are unveiling new television advertisements
emphasizing conservative positions on issues like abortion and
offering the harshest critiques to date on the Clinton
administration's moral authority and record on the military.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four, Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Orrin Hatch of
Utah, take on President Clinton in perhaps the toughest language of
the campaign on the airwaves. In a new McCain commercial running in
South Carolina, Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the managers of
President Clinton's impeachment trial, calls the senator ``the
conservative who will stop Bill Clinton's betrayal of our
military.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, in a 28-minute speech in the form of an advertisement,
says the stewardship of Clinton and Vice President Al Gore may be
remembered ``as the most deceitful and corrupt in our nation's
history.'' The video is scheduled to debut Wednesday night on
WMUR-TV in Manchester, N.H., and will also run in Des Moines, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements arrive in the midst of a intensifying
struggle among the candidates over who has the truest claim to be
the standard-bearer for conservatives, a group that votes in
disproportionately high numbers in primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher Steve Forbes has a new 30-second spot in Iowa
devoted exclusively to his stand against abortion. And in Texas
Gov. George W. Bush's latest commercial, which begins running
Wednesday in South Carolina, the closing slogan, ``A fresh start
for America,'' has been modified to ``Conservative values, and a
fresh start for America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been talking about values and the compassionate
conservative agenda,'' said Mark McKinnon, Bush's media adviser.
``It's really just marrying the governor's agenda on values and his
conservative background.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is the latest in Bush's rapidly expanding
national advertising campaign. McKinnon said the candidacy this
week added two more states, Virginia and Washington _ which hold
primaries on Feb. 29 _ that bring to eight the number in which Bush
is running commercials.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, McCain has concentrated his media buys in three
states with early primaries, New Hampshire, South Carolina and
Michigan, while Forbes is spending most of his money in two, Iowa
and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam, has
counted on building a base of support among the state's many
military retirees. In the new commercial, Graham says that McCain
``showed us what honor really means, a value we respect in South
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood up for our families, with a 17-year pro-life voting
record, and has voted to take pornography off the Internet,'' the
congressman continues. ``John McCain will bring honor back to the
Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot, Bush campaign officials say, is in stark contrast to
the less ideological image McCain has projected in his
advertisements in New Hampshire, where, for example, he has not
emphasized his position on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very seriously doubt he'd run that spot on WMUR in New
Hampshire, or on `Ally McBeal,''' said Stuart Stevens, one of
Bush's media advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's new spot seems designed as a message to McCain's intended
base in South Carolina. In the commercial, titled ``Respect,''
images of older people alternate with shots of Bush in front of a
large American flag. One interlude has an older man in veteran's
uniform standing by a flagpole, raising a flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our greatest generation deserves our greatest respect,'' Bush
says, a reference to a phrase popularized by Tom Brokaw's
best-seller about World War II and the soldiers who fought it.

EDITORIAL: ROUND ONE AT SHEPHERDSTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Jan. 12:
</P>
<P>
   The first round of peace talks between Israel and Syria got off
to a grindingly slow start in Shepherdstown, W.Va., before
adjourning this week. But there is still a good chance of meeting
the deadline, set by Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, for a
broad peace agreement late this year. For that to happen Syria will
have to do more to show that it is prepared to offer Israel
friendly relations and special security guarantees in exchange for
the return of all or most of the strategically valuable Golan
Heights. Thus far, Damascus has wanted to talk only about
territory. Its attitude toward these other essential dimensions of
peace has been chilly and unpromising.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Syria's foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, plan to
return for further talks next week. In the initial sessions, both
sides played to public opinion back home, advertising their
determination to defend national interests. That was necessary,
particularly in the case of Israel, where any agreement will be
submitted to a public referendum. But having staked out their
opening positions, both sides should return to the talks prepared
to show some flexibility as well.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said that the depth of its withdrawal from the Golan
will correspond to the strength of the security guarantees it
receives from Syria and to Syria's willingness to offer real peace.
The Barak government has also suggested that Israel would withdraw
no further than the internationally recognized boundary between
British Palestine and French Syria established after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, for its part, has insisted on a return to the unofficial
boundary that existed before the June 1967 Mideast war. That line
runs some 30 feet farther west, giving Syria access to the Sea of
Galilee, Israel's largest reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has the stronger legal case. Drawing the border where
Syria wants would let Damascus keep the territory it took by force
in the first two decades of Israel's existence while requiring
Israel to surrender everything it took by force in 1967. But any
agreement on borders needs to reflect contemporary political needs,
not just legal history. Adjustments in one direction or another
could be justified by other elements of a comprehensive deal.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, meanwhile, needs to recognize that Israel must retain the
ability to get early warning of Syrian military movements,
information Israel now gets from its monitoring stations atop the
heights. If Israel withdraws, such intelligence will have to come
from an American or international force stationed on the heights,
perhaps with some Israeli participants. Syria also must extend full
recognition to Israel, halting bellicose government propaganda and
denying sanctuary to violent Palestinian groups.
</P>
<P>
   Progress in the first round was mainly limited to getting
Israelis and Syrians to meet and refine their disputes about the
negotiating agenda. Even then, it took several personal
interventions by President Clinton to keep the talks going. Next
week the two sides should begin to tackle some of the underlying
issues. Despite substantial opposition in Israel to a Golan deal,
Barak's ultimate willingness to compromise is not in serious doubt.
On his return to Israel on Tuesday night, he offered a relatively
optimistic assessment of the talks. But for these to succeed,
Shara's boss, President Hafez Assad, must prove equally willing to
make trade-offs in the interest of peace.  &QL;

MCCAIN ISSUES CONFLICTING STATEMENTS ON CONFEDERATE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ga., S.C.)   (Eds.: ADDS new McCain quote in 5th graf; SUBS weaver's quote in
22nd graf to clarify heritage remark; adds new 23rd graf with more
explanation from Quinn; Corrects spelling of `forbears' in graf

 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last three days, Sen. John McCain has made three
conflicting statements on the Confederate flag issue raging in the
key primary state of South Carolina, and with each statement, his
position has become less clear.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, speaking on the CBS News program ``Face the Nation,''
McCain said he considered the flag ``offensive'' and a ``symbol of
racism and slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in a statement distributed to South Carolina
reporters, McCain reversed himself and called the flag ``a symbol
of heritage,'' using the precise language that white Republicans
have used in the state to justify keeping the flag flying over the
statehouse. Aides said he had misspoken in the television
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Tuesday night, in an interview in New Hampshire, McCain
reversed himself again, saying that if he said he sees the flag a
symbol of heritage, he misspoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``My forefathers fought under the Confederate flag,'' McCain
said. ``I believe that they believed their service was honorable.''
</P>
<P>
   But the statement calling the flag a symbol of heritage has been
on his campaign Web site for two days, and was distributed as a
news release by his staff. His top South Carolina strategist,
Richard M. Quinn, said earlier in the day that McCain had called
the flag a symbol of heritage ``at least 150 times in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the phrase ``symbol of heritage'' may sound innocuous
outside the South, its meaning is unmistakable in a region where
conflicting interpretations of the Civil War are often as important
as any contemporary political issue. Saying the flag is a symbol of
heritage rather than a reminder of racism is an argument made by
those who say the war was not fought over slavery, but over state's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain, like the other major Republican candidates, has
declined to take a position on the specific issue of whether the
flag should fly over the South Carolina statehouse, his
characterization of the flag's symbolism makes him the only major
presidential contender to empathize with the flag's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When whites say heritage in the South, they are generally
referring to a heritage in which black people are excluded,'' said
Bernard Powers, a professor of history at the College of
Charleston, S.C. ``In the best possible light, the senator is just
trying to be political, but I fear that he is uninformed about a
critically important element of American history and its legacy for
contemporary times.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag issue is enormously volatile in South Carolina, which
is holding a Republican presidential primary on Feb. 19 that is
crucial to McCain's hopes for the nomination. The NAACP has
declared an economic boycott against the state as long as the flag
flies over the Capitol, but Republicans in the state House of
Representatives have blocked any attempt to move it.
</P>
<P>
   In declaring the flag a symbol of heritage, McCain, of Arizona,
has taken a more conservative position than his chief rival for the
Republican nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, or any other
major candidate. When he is asked about the flag issue in South
Carolina, Bush has repeatedly said that the matter was for South
Carolinians to decide. On Monday night, he told MSNBC in an
interview that he would not fly the Confederate flag over the Texas
statehouse ``because of the symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has much closer ties to the leaders of the pro-flag
movement. One of the most prominent members of the so-called
Heritage Movement in the state, who has helped organize the
campaign to keep the flag flying, is Quinn, McCain's chief
strategist in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, the editor in chief of the neo-Confederate magazine
Southern Partisan, is the father of state Rep. Rick Quinn, the
majority leader, who has said the flag will not be lowered as long
as the NAACP boycott is in effect.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Quinn said Tuesday that he had not pushed McCain to
support the flag. But the emotions sweeping the state are intense
and may explain why McCain felt it necessary to issue a formal
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the business community is lobbying hard to remove the
flag, most of the Republicans in the legislature _ who represent
white districts necessary to win the primary _ are fervently in
favor of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's written statement, which also appeared on his Web site,
was his first on the subject, and was issued quickly after he
seemed to suggest on Sunday that he found the flag offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Confederate flag is offensive in many, many ways, as we
all know,'' he said on the CBS program ``Face the Nation'' on
Sunday morning. ``It's a symbol of racism and slavery. But I also
understand how others do not view it in that fashion. My forbears
from Mississippi fought under the Confederate flag. They were not
slave owners, and I'm sure they considered their service _ one I
believe died in Shiloh _ was honorable. So, I obviously understand
why many Americans find it offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, he issued a statement apparently intended to
correct the impression that he finds the flag offensive, and it was
that most recent statement that appears to align him with the flag
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to how I view the flag, I understand both sides,'' he said
in the statement. ``Some view it as a symbol of slavery; others
view it as a symbol of heritage. Personally, I see the battle flag
as a symbol of heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said in an interview Tuesday that McCain had misspoke on
Sunday by not saying the flag was offensive ``to some people.'' He
added that McCain has often said that he considered the flag a
symbol of heritage, but had never issued a formal, written
statement of his position before. Several political reporters in
South Carolina confirmed that they had heard McCain describe the
flag as a symbol of heritage over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, McCain's political director said Tuesday night that
McCain had used the phrase many times but was referring to his
relatives' service in the Confederate army.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talking about the heritage of his family,'' Weaver said.
``That's different from heritage that some may see it as _ a sign
of segregation or political issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said in an interview Tuesday that McCain had misspoken on
Sunday by not saying the flag was offensive ``to some people.'' He
added that McCain has often said in the past that he considers the
flag a symbol of heritage, but had never issued a formal, written
statement of his position before. Several political reporters in
South Carolina confirmed that they had heard McCain describe the
flag as a symbol of heritage over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush has several pro-flag supporters in his camp, as well,
including Charlie Condon, the state attorney general, who is
co-chairman of Bush's South Carolina campaign. But none are as well
known for their ideology as is Quinn, whose quarterly magazine has
become a leading journal of the notion that the Civil War was not
fought over slavery.
</P>
<P>
   A recent issue of the magazine, the cover of which shows a man
reading an Uncle Remus book to his grandchildren, contains a list
of the 15 best Southern books of all time. Though the list includes
Faulkner, Robert Penn Warren and Margaret Mitchell, most are
sympathetic to the Southern cause, and none is by a black writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magazine takes the view that the flag should be regarded
as a symbol of heritage, rather than slavery,'' said Quinn, who was
the Rev. Pat Robertson's media adviser in 1988. ``Many Southerners
believe that there are positive aspects to Southern history,
without having to link everything to slavery. Taking down the flag
or hiding it or treating it in a dishonorable way turns the banner
over to the racists on both sides. It helps define the flag as
something ugly and evil rather than something that memorializes the
heroism of these young men who fell for the South, most of whom
were not slaveowners.''
</P>
<P>
   But the word heritage means something very different to black
residents of South Carolina, most of whom do not vote in the
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a word kind of like `choice' or `life' in abortion, a
code word to mean certain things that people don't want to come
right out and say,'' said Lonnie Randolph Jr., president of the
Columbia branch of the NAACP, who oversees the group's economic
sanctions against the state. ``Of course the flag has to do with
heritage, but it's a heritage of white supremacy and racism. Too
many people are in denial about what the heritage really is.''

<P>
   The statement came a day after a family court judge in Miami
awarded temporary custody of 6-year-old Elian to his great-uncle.
The boy was found clinging to an inner tube after his mother and
several others drowned trying to flee Cuba in late November.
</P>
<P>
   Although contending that it _ and not the state court that
issued the custody ruling on Monday _ had jurisdiction in the case,
the immigration service said it would not enforce its Friday
deadline and would probably allow the boy to remain in this country
until the court hearing on March 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since everything is under review,'' said Maria Cardona, an
immigration service spokeswoman, ``we'll most likely extend that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a new controversy erupted over documents
showing that the family court judge, Rosa I. Rodriguez, had failed
to disclose a business relationship with a man who serves as
spokesman for the boy's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spending reports filed by Rodriguez with the Miami-Dade
Elections Department show that she had paid the spokesman, Armando
Gutierrez, his wife, Maritza, and their consulting firms $60,946
during her campaign in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In failing to disclose the relationship during the hearing,
Rodriguez, of Miami-Dade County Circuit Court, violated the Florida
Code of Judicial Conduct, said Anthony V. Alfieri, director of the
Center for Ethics and Public Service at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But Celena Rios, director of family court operations for the
11th Judicial Circuit of Florida, said that while the judge's
conduct was ``troubling'' under the code ``there is no obligation
that a judge disclose the participation of any individual in a past
campaign who is not an attorney and is not a party in a pending
legal matter before her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gutierrez called the campaign services and her husband's
services on behalf of Elian's Miami relatives ``apples and
oranges.''
</P>
<P>
   While Elian has remained in his relatives' Little Havana
neighborhood where he has started school, he has become the focal
point of the vast Cuban-American population's loathing for the
41-year-old government regime of President Fidel Castro, its
failure to dislodge him and its usually emphatic support of family
ties, including a father's claim on his motherless child.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service has come under growing criticism for
delays in its decision to return the boy to his father and
continuing delays in enforcing the return.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the agency says it has been proceeding in the
child's best interest. Russ Bergeron, an agency spokesman said,
``We felt it was necessary to allow a reasonable period of time so
the family would have time to reach some agreement and so the
logistical issues of reuniting him with his father could be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron said the agency also wanted to allow all sides to seek
relief through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the delays, ``every day it gets more painful,'' said
Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches,
which dispatched three emissaries to Cuba to interview the father
and found him eager for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, 11 people were charged with disorderly conduct
Tuesday for blocking the entrance to the Federal Building in Lower
Manhattan, which houses the offices of the immigration service.
They were among about 50 protesters, including former U.S. Attorney
General Ramsey Clark, who called for the return of Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Now the disclosures about Rodriguez's campaign ties to a
supporter of allowing Elian permanent residency in the United
States, have stirred the pot further.
</P>
<P>
   For helping Rodriguez's election, her first, Gutierrez's
consulting firm, Gutierrez &AMP; Associates, received two payments
totaling $7,500, according to the elections commission. His wife's
firm, Creative Ideas and Advertising Inc., received four payments
totaling $53,446 for advertising and other media services. Both
rejected any implications of a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I helped her with her campaign,'' Gutierrez said. ``But I help
over 100 judges with their campaigns. That's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   His assistance, he said, had been ``no secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gutierrez said she and her husband had seen the judge only
once, nine months ago, since working on her election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked with her to get elected,'' she said, ``but that is
totally irrelevant. It's apples and oranges. It has nothing to do
with this child.''

OFFICIALS UNVEIL NEW CENSUS PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BILL HILLBURG 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stung by criticism that a 1990 undercount cost
California about $2.2 billion in federal funding over the decade,
Census Bureau officials on Tuesday unveiled a new program designed
to increase response to the mail-in effort that begins in March.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, ``How America Knows What America Needs,''
information kits will be sent to thousands of civic leaders
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   From March 27 to April 11, the Census Bureau will post response
rates, updated daily, for thousands of cities on two Internet sites
(www.census.gov and www.HAKWAN.com).
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt expressed confidence that
the program would result in a 5 percentage point increase over 1990
census' 65 percent in California and nationwide mail response rate
a 5 point drop from the 1980 response.
</P>
<P>
   Census forms will be mailed to 100 million households nationwide
in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Some 83 percent of all households will receive a short form
asking basic demographic questions. The remaining 17 percent will
be asked to fill out more detailed long forms.
</P>
<P>
   Households that do not respond by April 11 will be canvassed by
enumerators, or census takers, from late April through early July.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, response rates to the 1990 mailed census
surveys were generally higher in upper- and middle-income
communities and dropped in those with lower-income residents and
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The best response rates were posted by La Canada Flintridge (85
percent) and Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village (both 80 percent).
Vernon (39 percent) and Compton (49 percent) had the region's
lowest response rates.
</P>
<P>
   Other 1990 census response levels included Los Angeles (60
percent), Long Beach (63 percent), San Bernardino (59 percent),
West Covina (69 percent), Pasadena (68 percent), Santa Clarita (69
percent), San Fernando (67 percent), Ontario (61 percent), Downey
(73 percent) and Lompoc (67 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt blamed the declining response on ``the public's
indifference and cynicism about civic responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is committed to doing a better job of counting the
poor and immigrants. To do that, the bureau is hiring thousands of
census takers from ethnic communities to canvass neighborhoods and
urge participation.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for California, with about 40 percent of the
nation's 25 million foreign-born residents, many undocumented.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, undercounts ranging from 7 percent to 10 percent were
estimated among Southern California's Latinos, Asians and
African-Americans, including a shortfall of 50 percent in Long
Beach's large Cambodian community.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials, who estimated an overall undercount of
5.1 percent and a loss of $104 million in federal funding, later
joined with other cities in an unsuccessful court challenge of 1990
census data.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the census, which is also used to determine reapportion
congressional districts, cost California one seat.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates for the 2000 census predict a gain of two House seats.
</P>
<P>
   A state Department of Finance found that in July 1997 those
overlooked mainly came from the fast-growing minority population.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990-97, Latinos increased from 7.7 million to 9.6 million,
raising their percentage of the state's total population of 33
million from 26 percent to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian population rose from 2.7 million to 3.6 million during
the same period, up from 9 percent to 11 percent of the state
total.
</P>
<P>
   The number of whites was unchanged at 17 million, but the
percentage fell from 57 percent to 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The African-American population remained at 2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The state survey found Latinos and Asians are the fastest
growing groups in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 census will feature several innovations, including
filing the short form via the Internet. Two statistical methods,
one for determining federal funding levels and the other to
determine House reapportionment, will be used.
</P>
<P>
   For federal funding, traditional methods of mail-in
questionnaires and canvassing should come up with 90 percent of the
total count. The rest will be tallied by the block sampling, which
used trends to possibly cut the undercount in half.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans successfully sued last year to force
use of mailed forms and canvassing for all reapportionment data.
Critics claimed the GOP was worried sampling would help Democrats
by increasing the tally of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 2000 census will do a better job of racial and ethnic
identification. Respondents, formerly limited to choosing a single
ethnic category out of six choices, will now be able to check any
and all categories that fit their personal multiracial and
multiethnic profiles.

MARINERS DEAL SELVES, GRIFFEY A BETTER HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Aaron Sele ``falls like a star out of the sky'' and
lands prominently in the Mariners rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Gillick gets a phone call from Sele's agent Monday morning
saying the Northwest native is urgently awaiting an offer from the
Mariners. The call comes a week after Gillick thought Sele was
completely lost to the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   As if signing John Olerud, Arthur Rhodes, Mark McLemore, Stan
Javier and Kazuhiro Sasaki weren't enough proof that the new
general manager is here to improve the Mariners, Gillick has the
luck of stealing a 29-year-old free-agent prize out from under
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If only the Mariners had had this kind of mindset, checkbook and
aggressive will last winter. Maybe then, at least some of the
Gillick's unfinished and less pleasant business would not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if the M's had had a more competitive team in 1999, Ken
Griffey Jr. would have spent more time chasing the AL West pennant
and less time pondering his future _ one he eventually told the
Mariners did not include Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That was November. Now it's January. So much has happened in
terms of player transactions for the M's, yet bottom line, one
critical scenario remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mariners fans have speculated that Griffey might be cheered
by all these signings that have brought closers, speed and some
versatility. That does not seem to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for all the moves Gillick has made to improve the
Mariners, they all bump up against this immovable object called
``The Griffey Situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an odd mix. On the one hand, there is all this good
feeling about deals that seem to bolster the M's. On the other
hand, there is all this weirdness and speculation about the team if
Griffey stays or goes.
</P>
<P>
   The center fielder says he will come back and play out the final
year of his contract. This comes after Griffey's list of teams to
which he said he would accept a trade dwindled from seven to four
to one.
</P>
<P>
   If Griffey will still accept a trade to the Reds, the Mariners
seem quite willing to investigate what must be their limited
options in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Gillick confirmed that someone from the Mariners front
office has been in touch with a senior Reds' official, though not
general manager Pat Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   If the Reds have any sort of deal in mind, the Mariners have
said they want to hear about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some conversations _ the organization has _ fairly
recently,'' Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   A trade before spring training is still possible but far from
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a dead issue for me,'' Gillick said about trading
Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go back to the joint statement that was issued for
what Kenny's desires were. We're still taking into consideration
what he wants to do. Even though something hasn't happened now,
we're still proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm going to say is that we're going to try, as it was
mentioned in the joint statement, to comply with Kenny's request
and try and get him closer to home.''
</P>
<P>
   Since November, when the M's and Griffey met in Florida and were
told about his long-term goals, Griffey's feelings of benevolence
toward the Mariners appears to have changed.
</P>
<P>
   In December, he took extreme exception to off-hand remarks
attributed to Gillick during the owners meetings. Later, another
unnamed Mariner official told a newspaper Griffey is acting like a
``spoiled brat.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever high hopes Griffey had for a smooth transition to
wherever it is he really wanted to go have blown up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gillick said despite Griffey's anger toward him, the
lines of communication remain open. Griffey, at least though his
agent, is exchanging notes and ideas, especially since the M's have
talked to the Reds again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably Kenny got a little miffed at me when I said he
changes his mind,'' Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think as time goes on, everybody _ ballclubs, the Reds
_ things change. ... Different things happen on clubs that change
their mind. So I would think that changing your mind is an ongoing
process,'' Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this all along, it wasn't my request to go closer to
home. I would be very, very satisfied if Kenny Griffey and Alex
Rodriguez played their entire careers here with the Mariners. ...
Those are the types of players you look for, players with those
types of skill levels.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gillick is trying to soft-peddle the intent of his earlier
comments regarding Griffey, it may be too late. Griffey, notorious
for his self-described elephant-like memory, is hard-pressed to
forgive and forget _ even if it would help get him wherever it is
he wants to be quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Gillick wheels and deals wisely with a healthy Mariner
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had told both of our All-Star players, both Griffey and
Alex Rodriguez as well as Edgar (Martinez) and Olerud, that we were
going to improve this team. So I guess the best way to prove it is
to do it. So I guess you can say we've put our money where our
mouth is,'' Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   As of January, it sure seems that what was once Griffey's team
has become Gillick's team.

FBI INVESTIGATING FAVORITISM IN BROOKLYN COURTS, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal investigators have begun an inquiry into in
an unusual letter that surfaced in Brooklyn political circles last
month hinting that party loyalties and court-appointed legal work
in the borough's court system go hand in hand, two officials
familiar with investigation said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, refused
to provide specific details about the inquiry stemming from the
letter, which was written by two lawyers with strong ties to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The officials stressed that the investigation was in its
earliest stages. Word of it came a day after the state's top judge,
Judith S. Kaye, announced that she was appointing a special
investigator to check on allegations that judges favor lawyers with
strong political ties when granting court receiverships or
surrogate work throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Court watchdog groups have long voiced despair over the
potential for favoritism in a system in which party leaders hold
great sway over which judges are placed on the ballot. In recent
days, the issue has focused on Brooklyn, where a nomination to the
bench by the Democratic Party is tantamount to election.
</P>
<P>
   According to the two officials, the current investigation stems
from a letter written on Dec. 20 by two Democratic Party loyalists,
Thomas J. Garry and Arnold J. Ludwig. In their letter, which was
sent to more than 40 Democratic Party officials in Brooklyn, the
two men bitterly complained that a fellow lawyer, who holds no
party office, had excluded them from a sizable court-awarded
assignment despite their ``unquestioned'' fidelity to the party for
more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer accused in the letter, Ravi Batra, has defended
himself by saying that he fired the two men as legal advisers in
handling the affairs of a failed cemetery in Brooklyn because they
were trying to ``churn legal fees to the detriment of the estate.''
As the court-appointed receiver for the property, the Cypress Hills
Cemetery, Batra said he had a responsibility to protect the
estate's assets, and asserted that he acted correctly by dismissing
Ludwig and Garry.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three men returned phone calls Tuesday seeking
comment. David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the state's Office of
Court Administration, said he no knowledge of the federal
investigation.

PANEL SUGGESTS DEMOLISHING FAMED HUDSON BRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ The Tappan Zee Bridge has become so
dilapidated and is so congested by traffic that it should be torn
down and replaced with a new eight-lane bridge with commuter rail
tracks, a state task force recommended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A new bridge would cost about $4 billion, according to the task
force, which was appointed by Gov. George Pataki last year to study
ways to ease traffic on the Tappan Zee. It also recommended
increasing tolls during peak driving periods to reduce congestion
while a new bridge is under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are likely to be unpopular with many people
on both sides of the Tappan Zee, which spans the Hudson River
between Nyack, in Rockland County, and Tarrytown, in Westchester
County. Just last week, more than 400 people packed a meeting of
the New York State Thruway Authority in Nyack, expressing
skepticism and anger at the suggestion of a new bridge, which they
said could adversely affect the environment, add traffic and
compromise their quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   But after a meeting in Manhattan Tuesday, the task force, which
was headed by E. Virgil Conway, the chairman of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, said that it would cost $1 billion to
rehabilitate the bridge. The better solution, the task force said,
would be a new bridge parallel to the existing one, with four lanes
in each direction, bracketed by commuter rail tracks. The existing
bridge, which opened in 1955, would then be demolished.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The rail link would consist of two new pieces. One would
originate at Stewart Airport, in Newburgh, and end at an existing
terminal at Port Jervis. The other would stretch from Suffern,
cross the new bridge between Nyack and Tarrytown, then end at an
existing station in Port Chester.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the bridge-and-rail project could be finished in 10
years. In the meantime, the task force recommended, the best
temporary solution to alleviate a nightmarish commute would be to
introduce what is called congestion pricing, which raises the toll
at certain times of day to induce some drivers to make the trip at
times of lighter traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The task force's recommendations will be delivered to Pataki,
perhaps as soon as the end of this week, Kelly said. But there is
no timetable for action by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, those who have been following the incremental progress
of Pataki's task force said Tuesday that they would be surprised if
Pataki did not endorse the general idea of a new bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said last summer that replacing the bridge was an
option because ``it is so old and does need such major repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents, environmentalists and transit groups appear to
be gearing up for what could a dogged fight against the
recommendations. They say that the task force's suggestions leave
many crucial questions unanswered, including whether the project
will entail widening the Cross Westchester Expressway, whether the
federal government will pitch in with financing and how much land
will need to be condemned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge feasibility questions are not answered,'' said Jon
Orcutt, associate director of the Tri-State Transportation
Campaign, a coalition of private environmental groups. ``So we
think the new bridge is a Trojan horse for widening the Thruway in
Rockland County.''

KNICKS GET A LATE SCARE BUT OUTLAST THE BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Chicago Bulls had crept to within a layup,
staging a furious comeback from 25 points down in the fourth
quarter Tuesday night. They had done almost everything needed to
shock Madison Square Garden back to life and put the fear of losing
into a suddenly dysfunctional New York Knicks team.
</P>
<P>
   If they had only remembered to guard Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Standing behind the top of the arc almost on the left wing _ as
lonesome as the United Center in June _ the Knicks forward took a
pass from Latrell Sprewell with 47.1 seconds left Tuesday night,
aimed and fired in a 3-pointer that effectively ended Chicago's
run.
</P>
<P>
   That shot not only provided impetus for a 95-88 New York
victory, it also concluded a blowout turned wild thriller. At the
end, amid the gasps, one could barely tell the difference between
the National Basketball Association's haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost focus,'' Johnson said in a relieved Knick locker room.
``It's the NBA, and they kept playing hard. Those guys showed heart
and character.''
</P>
<P>
   For those final, frenetic minutes, the Bulls (5-27) treated
their three-game winning streak like a precious metal they could
not part with. That they came in with the worst record in the
league did not seem to matter. They were a bunch of players who
loved the game, taking it to the home team on its own floor, much
like the old Bulls of you-know-who.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted with their team's meltdown, the Garden fans seemed on
the precipice of actually cheering for them.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Brand nearly completed a stirring comeback by putting back
a missed free throw by Ron Artest to pull Chicago to 90-88 with 1
minute 6 seconds left. It was improbable, given that the Bulls
trailed, 80-53, with 24 seconds left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was even more stunning because the Knicks (21-13) were on
their way _ laughing on the bench, pounding one another's fists.
About to beat a team by more than 25 points for the first time all
season, they looked more conquering than complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get what you deserve in this game,'' an exasperated coach
Jeff Van Gundy said. ``We deserved to be up by 25, and we deserved
to almost lose the game. That is the bottom line. I am going to
keep it at that; that is the best way I can explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   After a barrage of Marcus Camby dunks and Johnson 3-pointers in
the third quarter _ he made 4 of 6 in the game and ended with a
team-high 19 points _ it was clear to see how times had drastically
changed, the Knicks turning to the Bulls to improve their
confidence and inflate their statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But first gradually and then stunningly, it happened. Artest,
the active forward who left St. John's after his sophomore year,
led Chicago with 24 points. None of his field goals was larger than
when he dropped in a 3-pointer from the left wing with less than
five minutes left, a shot that trimmed the Knicks' lead to 86-77.
Then Toni Kukoc fed center Chris Anstey for a dunk. And Artest
scored inside on a tough layup. Suddenly, it was a game, with only
5 points separating the teams with 3:35 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls' scoring binge at one point reached 26-6. For the
quarter, Chicago outscored New York, 33-15.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks would have to fight for it. With 3:11 left, Patrick
Ewing (14 points, 14 rebounds) drove to the middle and was fouled
hard by Anstey. The two traded words and nearly shoves. After a
double technical, Ewing hit two free throws. Sprewell then stole
the inbound pass and scored on a layup to give New York a 9-point
cushion with 2:49 remaining. Still, the Bulls would not fade.
</P>
<P>
   They parlayed two Kukoc steals in the backcourt into points to
slice the lead to 90-85. After Artest's miss and Brand's put-back,
the fear factor grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was exhausted,'' Brand said after scoring 22 points and
grabbing 7 rebounds. ``We wanted to be seen as a team that is going
to fight and fight and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of Chicago's resilience, the game appeared over in the
second quarter. During an 11-1 Knick run to close out the half,
John Wallace scored 7 points _ none more vicious than a dunk over
Trevor Ruffin with 23.3 seconds left. Receiving a pass from Johnson
at the free-throw line, he took one dribble and soared over the
Bulls' front line. Depositing the ball over Ruffin, who fouled
Wallace on the play, the Knick reserve was showered with applause.
</P>
<P>
   As the teams left the court at halftime, it was not hard to see
which had been dealt a better hand this season. His Bulls racked by
injury, coach Tim Floyd used two players in the first half, Dedric
Willoughby and Chris Carr, who were not even on the roster until
Monday. Matt Maloney, waived by the Houston Rockets before the
season, signed with the club last week and was only playing his
third game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Knicks still needed Johnson's timely 3-pointer to
put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spree penetrated and he found me,'' Johnson said. ``I hit a
couple early and I was feeling good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost blew it,'' Sprewell added. ``It's not like we quit
playing totally. But mentally, we just weren't in the game as
much.''

CBS NEWS CREATING IMAGES THAT DO NOT REALLY EXIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to restore first name and title of Eric Shapiro in 11th
graf.) 
 (mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you were watching the CBS Evening News broadcast
live from Times Square on New Year's Eve, you might have seen a
billboard advertising CBS News out in the square behind Dan Rather.
You might have looked at the well-placed billboard and wondered
just exactly how it was that CBS was able to place its ad so
fortuitously.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, it didn't. The billboard and the advertisement for
CBS did not exist. The image was digitally imported onto the live
CBS broadcast, obliterating an existing, real billboard _ the NBC
Astrovision underneath the New Year's ball and a Budweiser ad _
using electronic insertion technology.
</P>
<P>
   Inserting digital images has become increasingly common in
sports and entertainment programming, usually to insert advertising
and corporate logos , but has generally been considered out of line
in the world of news shows, a type of programming in which the
assumption of reality is considered sacrosanct, and not informing
viewers is considered a breach of journalistic guidelines. CBS
contends such practices do not cross ethical boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News is using the technology as part of a broad agreement
the network signed last year with a technology company, Princeton
Video Image, to provide branding services for a variety of CBS
programs. The technology has been used regularly on ``The Early
Show'' and the news magazine ``48 Hours'' and was used on the
``Evening News'' on Dec. 30 and 31, according to CBS news
executives.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, news show logos that appear real are being inserted
on the sides of structures like the General Motors building, on the
back of a horse-drawn carriage in Central Park, in the fountain
outside the Plaza Hotel and, on Tuesday's ``Early Show'' broadcast,
in the center of Wollman Rink in Central Park. In some instances,
the logo clearly resembles a large billboard advertising CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the technology is part of a multi-year deal that CBS
has signed with Princeton Video Image to provide branding services
for a variety of CBS programs. ``The Early Show'' has been the most
ardent user of the technology and has been using it almost every
day since the show's debut on Nov. 1, at times making it appear
that a large promotional billboard several stories high is attached
to the General Motors building, where the show is aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for some way to brand the neighborhood with
the CBS logo,'' said Steve Friedman, the executive producer of
``The Early Show.'' ``It's a great way to do things without ruining
the neighborhood. Every day we have a different way of using it,
whether it's logos or outlines. And we haven't even scratched the
surface of its uses yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said that the practice did not press the boundaries of
ethical guidelines for the CBS news division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not distort the content of the news,'' he said, and
compared the use of the technology to earlier visual innovations.
``I remember the hue and cry when people started to use graphics on
news.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS News' deal with the Princeton company was reported in the
Jan. 3 issue of the trade magazine Broadcasting &AMP; Cable magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Shapiro, director of the ``CBS Evening News'' and CBS News
special events, said that the news division examines each case
individually before putting the virtual logos on air. ``The
technique, I find, works best if you put it someplace where there
is intended to be something,'' he said. ``If it feels that it is
not correct to use it, then we obviously won't use it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, knew about the use of the virtual technology
during the broadcast and did not protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he did not know in advance,'' Shapiro said. ``These are
not things he needs to worry about. He spends most of his time
worrying about the content of the broadcast. But as a production
technique he was most certainly aware that it was happening around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather did not return a phone call seeking comment Tuesday
night. Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson, anchors of ``The Early
Show,'' could not be reached for comment
</P>
<P>
   Harry Jessell, the editor of Broadcasting and Cable magazine,
said that the technology raised questions with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does raise some ethical questions for CBS,'' he
said. ``You would think that a TV news organization would not
tamper with video, especially live video. Viewers should be able to
rely on the fact that what they are seeing is actually there.''
</P>
<P>
   Network news has flirted with similar technological issues
before. In 1994, the use of a fake backdrop caused an outcry when
the ABC journalist Cokie Roberts appeared in front of a picture of
Capitol Hill. Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor, introduced a
report from Ms. Roberts and said that she was reporting from
Capitol Hill; Ms. Roberts, wearing a coat, appeared in front of
what looked like the Capitol. But without the knowledge of network
viewers or even Jennings, Ms. Roberts was actually inside the ABC
News Washington bureau with a photographic image of the Capitol
projected behind her. Ms. Roberts and Rick Kaplan, then the
executive producer of ``World News Tonight'' and now the president
of CNN, were both reprimanded and the network apologized on air.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for NBC, ABC and Fox said their news units did not use
such digital technology on news broadcasts. Christa Robinson, a
spokeswoman for CNN, said she knew of no instance of the
technology's use.

ROBERT H. CRAFT, 93, LONGTIME SECURITIES INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (nk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert H. Craft, a prominent international investment banker in
the 1950s and '60s, died on Dec. 26 at his home in Carefree, Ariz.,
near Phoenix. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   In a 50-year career that began a month before the stock market
crash of October 1929, Craft held executive and consulting
positions in international finance, including the presidency of the
Paribas Corp. in New York and of Chase Manhattan Bank's overseas
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Craft was born on Feb. 9, 1906, in Cedarhurst, N.Y. He began his
career with the Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, a predecessor of
the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., after graduation from the Wharton
School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   He rose from bond analyst to vice president and treasurer at the
company. In 1953, he took a leave of absence to accept an
appointment as a technical consultant to the Federal Reserve's
rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
</P>
<P>
   There, Craft was instrumental in developing the ``bills only''
policy, which holds that the Fed should try to influence only
short-term interest rates, those paid on Treasury bills, letting
market forces decide long-term rates, paid on bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Craft did not return to Guaranty Trust after the Fed appointment
ended. Instead, from 1953 to 1956, he was executive vice president
of the American Securities Corp., an investment bank. In 1956, he
became president and later vice chairman of the Chase International
Investment Corp., the overseas financing unit of Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1960, Craft was named president and chairman of the
executive committee of the Paribas Corp., then the U.S. investment
banking subsidiary of the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, the
largest financial institution in France not owned by the
government. He served in those posts until 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, he became chairman of the finance committee of the
Missouri Pacific Railroad. He stayed with the railroad until 1975,
also serving as chairman of its parent company, the Mississippi
River Corp., from 1971 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Craft was also a consultant to the World Bank, served on the
boards of numerous corporations and, in 1956-57 was president of
the Investment Bankers Association, the predecessor of the
Securities Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving to Arizona in the mid-'70s, Craft was a longtime
resident of Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Janet; two sons, Robert Jr., of
Washington and George, of Houston; a daughter, Carol Schaefer, of
Greenwich, Conn.; and seven grandchildren.

A CLASS ACT IS SNUFFED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (bl)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSET, Mass. _ Robert Crouch and Paul McManus taught the same
class together in the same room at Somerset High School for 30
years, longer than many marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Somerset, 30 miles west of Cape Cod, knew that
whatever educational fads came and went, the subject examined by
Crouch and McManus never varied: American history from the colonies
to the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was a graduate school course in the 10th grade, one in
which the only textbooks were primary source documents like John
Smith's account of the Jamestown settlement and George Washington's
correspondence. The two teachers cross-examined students as if they
were on trial and demanded that they ``refute, support or respond
to'' quotations from leading historians.
</P>
<P>
   This school year, however, like the producers of a long-running
Broadway show closed before its time, Crouch and McManus had to end
their class. The reason: it did not fit the new curriculum
guidelines issued by Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The state says that American history before 1865 should be
taught in the eighth grade. Tenth-graders, the state suggests,
should be taught world history from 1815 to the present. That
course is a sequel to the recommended ninth-grade course, on world
history from the fall of Rome to 1815.
</P>
<P>
   Although school districts are not bound by the frameworks, the
state test at the end of eighth grade is on American history
through the Civil War; the test at the end of 10th grade requires
two years of world history.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch and McManus are committed to teaching high school, and
are not sure that eighth graders can handle their course. So they
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do mourn the class,'' McManus said. ``It was so much fun to
teach. Every year, you'd do additional reading. You'd add a new
source, a new document. And then Crouchie and I would go at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are quick to say that the overall standards movement,
which spawned the Massachusetts frameworks, is a vast improvement
over what existed before: an absence of any articulated
expectations of what students should know. In Massachusetts, for
example, state requirements for high school graduation before this
year were four years of physical education and a year of American
history. Forty-nine states now have, or are writing, guidelines on
what should be taught when.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any innovation, however well-intentioned, something
always gets lost in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   I say this not as an impartial observer. I took ``Crouch and
McManus,'' as their course was known, almost two decades ago. For
me, it was like watching Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe at Wimbledon
and then taking tennis lessons from them afterward. The way they
taught that course made me want to be a nonfiction writer _ one who
writes, more often than not, about learning.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent, New-England-gray afternoon, I joined Crouch and
McManus at T.K. O'Malley's, a sports bar across the Taunton River
from Somerset High. Over 20-ounce glasses of beer, they recalled
their decisions to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, it turns out, was able to look out at his own high
school graduation and see his father. McManus, who grew up in a
Fall River housing project, watched his father go off to World War
II and never return. Crouch, reared in the projects of Dorchester
and Roxbury, lost his father, a railroad car inspector, in an
accident on the Boston &AMP; Maine.
</P>
<P>
   McManus thought he might change the world from the front of a
classroom. Crouch was thinking more about the handful of very good
teachers he had had _ and the larger roster of bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after they joined the faculty at Somerset High, they
combined their two 25-student classes into one room, the better for
the students to hear alternating points of view.
</P>
<P>
   They are warhorses now, at least in their profession _ McManus
is 57, Crouch 55 _ and yet they are starting over: just as they
have for three decades, they are back in Room 310. This time,
though, like immigrants learning a new language, they are teaching
world history.
</P>
<P>
   To recreate what they once had, they are working overtime _
Crouch took a college refresher course; McManus is often reading a
chapter ahead of the class _ studying primary sources like ``The
Communist Manifesto'' and then wielding them to sharpen students'
critical thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just last week, I was doing a class on Italian unification,''
McManus said. ``I was talking about Mazzini and Garibaldi, and I'm
talking about Victor Emmanuel and Cavour, and Napoleon III and
Bismarck, and all of a sudden I wasn't sure what I was talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked over at Crouchie and said, `Help!' ''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, he added, ``It was wonderful.''

IN SUING EMPLOYER, IMMIGRANT FIGHTS DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a maid for a high-ranking diplomat from Bahrain,
Shamela Begum says she was kept a virtual prisoner in a high-rise
apartment on Manhattan's East Side. For almost nine months, she was
forbidden to go out alone, she says, and forced to work seven-day
workweeks for meager wages that she never got to see herself.
</P>
<P>
   So about four months ago, Ms. Begum, a mother of three from
Bangladesh, illiterate and in many ways ill-prepared for the modern
world, made a bold escape. She was on a rare trip outdoors with her
employer's wife when, by chance, she heard a sidewalk fruit vendor
speaking her native Bengali. As soon as the diplomat and his wife
had left town later that day, she slipped out of the apartment,
summoned a little boy to show her how the elevator worked, and
found her way back to the vendor, to whom she poured out her tale.
Within days, she managed to get out for good.
</P>
<P>
   Then, mustering more courage, Ms. Begum took a typically
American route to justice: she sued.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Begum, however, faces a hurdle that other ill-paid laborers
seeking redress do not face: because her former employer is a
diplomat, he is potentially beyond the reach of the American
courts.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare effort to hold an official of a foreign government
accountable to the laws of the United States, Ms. Begum has accused
the diplomat who employed her, Mohammed Saleh, and his wife,
Khatun, of flagrant state and federal labor law violations. Filed
in December in U.S. District Court in Manhattan and seeking
unspecified damages, the suit also accuses the Salehs of a civil
charge of false imprisonment. The most serious charge accuses the
couple of keeping Ms. Begum in indentured servitude.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Begum's lawyers say they are seeking to push the legal
envelope. Although diplomats serving in a foreign country are
required to abide by the host country's laws, they are immune from
legal action, both civil and criminal, according to the Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position,'' said Ms. Begum's lawyer, Chaumtoli Huq of the
Asian-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund in Manhattan,
``is that hiring an employee to clean your house and watch your
children is not related to consular functions and should not be
immune from federal and state law.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Ms. Begum's accusations are just that; no witness can
corroborate her version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Saleh is second secretary at the Bahraini Mission to the United
Nations, in effect the No. 3 official there. He did not return
repeated telephone calls seeking comment. Several calls placed
recently to other officials at the Bahraini Mission in New York and
to the Bahraini Embassy in Washington were also not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a lawyer for the defendants, David Wohabe, hung up
the phone when asked to comment. The defendants have until Jan. 24
to respond to the charges in court.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawsuit has already produced results. In Washington,
State Department officials, aware of Ms. Begum's claims, said they
were preparing a detailed new memorandum spelling out the
obligations of U.N. diplomats toward their domestic workers. The
department is also drawing up a brochure meant to inform those
domestic workers of their rights in this country, officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Begum's bewildering journey _ as described in interviews and
court documents _ began a little more than a year ago in Dhaka, the
Bangladeshi capital. The wife of a vegetable vendor, she had never
worked outside her home. She had only seen how friends and
neighbors went abroad, found work and returned with money to build
a house or set up a business of their own.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, after contacting an employment broker, Ms.
Begum, who is in her mid-30s, decided to make the trek herself.
Unable to read or write, she pressed her thumbprint on an
employment contract that promised a job as a domestic worker in the
desert monarchy of Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe I can improve myself if I go abroad,'' she
said in rapid-fire Bengali the other day. ``I thought my kids will
say, `My mother sacrificed so I could do something.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Bahrain came the first surprise. Her employer, she said, told
her that she would soon be working for his brother in New York.
State Department records show that on Dec. 2, 1998, Ms. Begum went
to the U.S. Embassy in Manama, the Bahraini capital, where she was
given a visa allowing her to work as a live-in maid for Saleh.
According to an employment contract reviewed by embassy officials,
Ms. Begum was to earn minimum wage _ $5.15 an hour _ and to be
provided free room and board, State Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The gross domestic product of Bangladesh, one of the world's
poorest countries, is about one-tenth that of Bahrain, an oil-rich
hereditary monarchy in the Middle East that has a shortage of
laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Begum arrived in New York on Dec. 13, 1998. That day, Ms.
Begum contends, the Salehs took away her passport. Her salary,
roughly $100 a month, was sent directly to her husband in Dhaka,
she says, adding that she did not get paid for her last two months
on the job. Indeed, she says, she had not seen any type of American
currency until recently.
</P>
<P>
   When her employers left town, she contends, they left little or
no food. On one occasion, she says, Mrs. Saleh struck her with a
glass. Ms. Begum communicated with her employers in a mix of broken
Arabic and Bengali. For many months, her family did not know where
she was.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, Ms. Begum said, she was allowed to leave the
apartment only three times, accompanied by the Salehs for short
walks in the neighborhood. On most days, she stared out the windows
of their apartment near the U.N. building. And she wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could I tell? I just cried,'' she said. ``I didn't even
feel the wind, see the trees. They wouldn't let me see another
human being.''
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 800 migrant domestic workers with special visas
allowing them to work for United Nations officials in New York,
said State Department officials. Many other workers, government
officials say, are brought here illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Honey of the Institute for Policy Studies, a research
organization in Washington that has taken up the cause of domestic
workers employed by officials at foreign embassies and
international agencies, said it was not uncommon for maids to have
their passports taken away, to be barred from contacting friends
and to earn salaries of $100 to $400 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a handful of lawsuits have been filed, seeking
back wages and damages, she said. A few have been settled out of
court; others have been thrown out because diplomatic immunity was
upheld.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Begum said it was impossible to escape her predicament. She
knew no one in New York. She could not read street signs. She had
no money. What she had instead was a mounting $1,400 debt for her
passage out of Bangladesh _ a daunting sum in that country, where
the per capita income is less than $300.
</P>
<P>
   On her third and last outing with Mrs. Saleh, to a supermarket
one day last August, she overheard a conversation in Bengali among
some sidewalk fruit vendors. Mrs. Saleh, she recalled, pressed her
not to dawdle. `` `Quick, quick,''' Ms. Begum recalls her saying.
`` `America bad. America bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, when the Salehs left town later that day, she left
the apartment alone for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Working the elevator was the first hurdle. She had never been on
one by herself before, and so she stood there as the door
repeatedly closed and opened on the same floor. A boy finally
helped her get downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Begum retraced her steps to the fruit vendor and told him
her tale. The vendor contacted Thikana, a Bengali-language weekly
newspaper published in Queens. A reporter for the paper contacted a
South Asian workers' rights group called Andolan _ the Bengali word
for ``movement.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 30, a member of Andolan, Nahar Alam, showed up at the
Salehs' apartment. At Ms. Alam's request, officers from the 17th
Precinct took a complaint alleging false imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Salehs had diplomatic immunity, they were not
arrested, said a police spokesman, though the department made no
determination as to whether the case, based on its merits, could be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said recently that they would have
sought a waiver of immunity from the government of Bahrain had the
police referred the case for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Department's position is to react to cases where
prosecutors want to proceed but need a waiver to do so,'' said
Robert Moller, minister counselor for the department's Office of
Host Country Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Begum left the Salehs' apartment for good the day the police
came. Now in the country illegally, she has yet to gain control of
her destiny, though her circumstances are markedly better. With
help from Andolan, she found a job as a live-in maid for a family
in Pennsylvania, earning $1,100 a month. It is a luxurious amount
by Bangladeshi standards. And while conditions are hardly perfect _
she gets a three-day weekend once a month, for instance _ she can
feel her earnings in her own hands. Finally, she says, she feels as
if she is working. For now, she does not want to give that up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't suit me, being here, being away from my children,''
she said, wrapping a polyester scarf around her head and shivering
in the crisp winter wind the other day. ``It's just for the money
I'm here. Just for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   How long she will remain in the United States is unclear. She
hopes to return with enough money to set up a small business for
her two sons, ages 10 and 15, to run when they are older. She has
married off her daughter, now 17 and uneducated like herself. Under
no circumstances, she says, will she let her come to the United
States to work.

HENRY PLEASANTS, 89, MUSIC CRITIC AND AUTHOR
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Pleasants, a music critic, author and translator, died at
a hospital in London on Jan. 4. He was 89 and lived in London.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasants was best known for his books about the voice, which he
loved, and contemporary music, about which he had become
disillusioned in the early 1950s. His first book, ``The Agony of
Modern Music'' (1955), was a polemical study that became the
subject of heated debate in the new music world.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Pleasants issued a stark challenge to the world of
contemporary composition. He began by writing: ``Serious music is a
dead art.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``The vein which for 300 years offered a seemingly
inexhaustible yield of beautiful music has run out. What we know as
modern music is the noise made by deluded speculators picking
through the slag pile.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasants closed the book with the contention that the only real
modern music was jazz, a theme he developed further in ``Death of a
Music?'' and ``Serious Music and All That Jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his books about vocal music were ``The Great Singers: From
the Dawn of Opera to Our Own Time,'' a 1966 survey that has become
a standard reference work; ``The Great American Popular Singers'';
and ``Opera in Crisis.'' His last book was ``The Great Tenor
Tragedy: The Last Days of Adolphe Nourrit,'' a 19th-century tenor
for whom Rossini wrote several roles.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasants was born in Wayne, Pa., in 1910 and studied at the
Philadelphia Musical Academy and the Curtis Institute of Music. He
began his writing career as a critic for The Philadelphia Evening
Bulletin in 1930, when he was 19. He was the music editor from 1935
to 1942, when he joined the Army. After World War II he was
involved in the de-Nazification proceedings against several
musicians who were prominently involved with the Third Reich,
including the conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler and Walter Gieseking.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasants joined the U.S. Foreign Service in 1950 and held
positions in Munich, Bern and Bonn until his retirement in 1954.
From 1945 to 1955, he contributed articles about European music to
The New York Times. After his retirement from the Foreign Service,
he became the London editor of Stereo Review, and from 1967 to 1998
he was a music critic for The International Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the harpsichordist Virginia
Pleasants; two sisters, Constantia Bowditch of Peterborough, N.H.,
and Nancy Logue of Clarksville, Tenn.; and a brother, William, of
Bethel, Del.

TWO BOATS STAY IN CONTENTION FOR LAST SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ On a day when the winds blew with
authority and the waves splashed over the bows and rails of the
competing yachts, the Prada Challenge and Stars and Stripes both
managed to win and keep pace with each other for the remaining spot
in the America's Cup challenger final.
</P>
<P>
   Prada defeated Le Defi Francais by just 9 seconds, holding on in
the final leg against the French boat Sixth Sense, the fastest boat
downwind in Auckland. Stars and Stripes had a less stressful time
down the stretch, defeating America True by 46 seconds to get its
first victory against its fellow Californians in four attempts.
</P>
<P>
   With one race remaining, Prada has 6 points; Stars and Stripes
has 5 points with two races remaining. No matter which team
qualifies, its opponent in the next round is certain because
America One, which represents the St. Francis Yacht Club in San
Francisco, clinched its place Wednesday with a 17-second victory
over the Japanese syndicate, Nippon Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave Paul Cayard's crew its eighth victory in nine
starts in these challenger semifinals. Its only defeat came in its
second race when it suffered a jib breakdown against America True.
But just as Cayard's syndicate rebounded in style from some
personnel defections and fund-raising concerns in the preparatory
phases of its campaign, America One rebounded from that equipment
breakdown, as well. And now the team and its new, versatile boat
USA 61 will be favored to win the right to face Team New Zealand in
the America's Cup defense in February.
</P>
<P>
   Even though America One won't race again under pressure until
Jan. 25, when the challengers final is set to begin, it still has a
role to play on the water in these semifinals. Its last race in
this round is scheduled for Thursday against Stars and Stripes, but
it remains to be seen whether Cayard will risk his men and material
in a race of no importance to his syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting,'' said Stars and Stripes tactician Tom
Whidden. ``If it's pretty windy, I'd be surprised if he came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard agreed. ``I might make the call in the morning.'' he
said. `` It's a tough call. I don't want to jeopardize my assets. I
don't have as many masts as Prada.''
</P>
<P>
   Prada will face Nippon, now eliminated, in its final race. Stars
and Stripes is scheduled to face America One and then America True
again in a makeup race for one postponed because of repair work to
Stars and Stripes' transom.
</P>
<P>
   If Prada and Stars and Stripes sweep their remaining races, both
will finish with 7 points, which would force a one-race sail-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing,'' said Stars and Stripes helmsman Ken
Read. ``Who would have guessed this on Sept. 1 when we sailed this
boat for the first time?''
</P>
<P>
   Stars and Stripes did indeed get a much later start than its
primary competitors, but its nonracing skipper, Dennis Conner, has
plenty of America's Cup experience and plenty of friends from New
Zealand who have helped him study the local weather and conditions.
Wednesday, Conner gave his crew another motivational speech over
breakfast, the latest in a series in this round.
</P>
<P>
   The weather conditions were also motivational for Stars and
Stripes, whose boat, USA-55, is relatively sturdy and relatively
wide in comparison to its rivals and thrives in stronger winds. The
winds reached speeds of up to 23 knots on course Wednesday and the
sea conditions were choppier than at any other time during this
round.
</P>
<P>
   But America True, just like the French, did not race Wednesday
like a team that has already been eliminated. After the second
windward mark, Stars and Stripes led by 24 seconds, but when
Whidden and the afterguard changed spinnaker sets late in the beat,
the crew had difficulty reacting quick enough and several precious
seconds elapsed before their chute finally opened.
</P>
<P>
   At the next mark, the lead was only seven seconds but then Stars
and Stripes pulled away upwind, gaining nearly a minute in the
heavy conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Prada also had spinnaker problems, fouling up a complicated drop
at the first leeward mark and getting the spinnaker hung up in its
mast. &QL;

<HEADLINE>
EDITORIAL: GEORGE PATAKI, CENTRIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Jan. 12.:
</P>
<P>
   With his new $76.8 billion budget for the next fiscal year, Gov.
George Pataki has proposed again to tap New York State's huge
surpluses for modest spending increases and tax cuts, building on
his increasingly centrist politics of the last couple of years. The
major exception to that approach is in school aid, for which Pataki
recommended a package that shortchanges New York City and is
certain to provoke a battle in the Legislature. In a welcome
gesture to fiscal prudence, the governor also recommended setting
aside more than $2 billion in surpluses generated by boom times as
reserves for future use, and he endorsed a constitutional amendment
to curb state borrowing and restore the state's abysmal credit
rating.
</P>
<P>
   There have been fights over school aid every year since Pataki
took office in 1995, and this one immediately looked familiar as
the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, vowed to restore cuts in
funds for preschool, teacher pay and smaller classes in New York
City. The governor countered that he was actually increasing school
aid over all by $355 million, but his budget aides conceded that
the city would get less than 29 percent of this money even though
it has 37 percent of the state's pupils. Pataki apparently
calculates that no matter how much aid he puts in for the city, the
Legislature will always try to raise the ante, so it makes sense to
start with a low figure. But these fights create an atmosphere of
debilitating hostility when the need in the city is so great.
</P>
<P>
   A complicating factor in this year's fight is politics. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani is gearing up to run for Senate against Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who may announce her candidacy as early as next
month. Silver, an ardent Democrat who supports Mrs. Clinton, will
somehow have to work with the mayor to win more aid. Giuliani, who
tried to block the appointment of Harold Levy as schools chancellor
on the ground that he was too close to Silver, also needs to set
aside his antipathy for the speaker to do what is best for the
city. In the end, presidential politics may persuade Pataki to make
more money available to avoid undercutting the education message of
his presidential candidate, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's recommendation to curb the state's debt contains
an especially important proposal to end a disguised form of
borrowing that began in the Rockefeller years and is now spiraling
out of control. Under a plan that would have to be approved by two
sessions of the Legislature and then the voters, the state would
have to disclose all its borrowing schemes and cap them at a low
level. In making this reform, the Legislature has to make sure that
Pataki does not cap borrowing at such a low level that it would
hurt the state's ability to meet its infrastructure needs in a
decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   After five years in office, Pataki has emerged more and more as
a moderate Republican. He has backed several environmental projects
and in December worked out a deal with the Democrats to raise
tobacco taxes and use the revenues for health care. This is
expected to be the first year in a long time that will not feature
the usual battles over cuts in Medicaid pushed by the governor.
Despite his tax cuts that could produce deficits if the current
prosperity evaporates, Pataki's recent centrist course marks a
significant change. It shows he is thinking about his political
future and his overall record. It also suggests that the state
Republican Party will be going into the next election as the party
of something other than cutting government across the board.

OUTSIDER? INSIDER? A LAWYER WINS AS BOTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By JAN HOFFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the nonchalant elegance of Astaire, the lawyer Ted Wells
tap dances at the edge of the abyss for his clients _ CEOs and
politicians, mostly. On behalf of a national Cabinet secretary he
addressed a jury for three days, without notes; on behalf of
another, Wells, after having had his way with the 70 witnesses the
federal government had put on the stand, didn't bother putting on
any of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Both times he won acquittals, of course. White-collar
litigators, not typically generous with praise unless they're
looking in the mirror, invariably speak of Wells' record _
recently, seven for seven _ as ``staggering,'' his courtroom
performances ``magnificent,'' and his standing as one of the
``premier trial lawyers in America.''
</P>
<P>
   So why, in conversation the other day, was he being so cautious?
</P>
<P>
   For just when a topic would take flight, he would bring it back
to earth _ deftly, with a toothy smile _ and order it off the
record, or retool it with tamped-down language. You could almost
see him weighing every remark against the reaction of all the
constituencies who may be taking notice, because of his new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little nervous,'' said Wells, on his sixth day at Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison, where he is the first outsider
in 30 years to be brought in as a partner. He was not only named
co-chairman of its 150-lawyer litigation department, but is also
expected to revive the luster that dimmed with the passing of its
superstar, Arthur L. Liman, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A tale from his activist days in the black students' movement is
followed by: ``I don't want people to think there's some
rabble-rouser at Paul, Weiss. Don't do that to me!''
</P>
<P>
   Charming grin, apology, explanation of sorts: ``I try to play at
a lot of different levels. I want to do the Microsofts. And my guy
is running for president.'' Wells is campaign treasurer for a
friend of more than 20 years, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   That layered look is what makes Wells, 49, so intriguing, this
moment such a mix of accolades and agita. In moving from Lowenstein
Sandler, his New Jersey firm for 22 years, to Paul, Weiss, an
international powerhouse, he can compete for the biggest cases in
the country, billing $575 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Wells, a behind-the-scenes force in New Jersey
politics, has moved to a national stage. He has helped raise nearly
$28 million for Bradley, by wheedling and holding fund-raisers at
the Livingston, N.J., home he calls ``my expensive steal,'' where
he lives with Nina, his wife of 28 years, who is also a lawyer.
Their two children are on leave from college to toil for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   His professional ambition and political activism are shaped by
his self-awareness as a role model. He is Paul, Weiss' only black
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My age group is very sensitive to its responsibilities in
terms of giving back to the African-American community,'' Wells
said. ``As opposed to black people under 35 who say, `I'm doing
this on my own and I don't want to hear about being black.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``My litigation practice has ranged from Michael Milken to Floyd
Flake to Exxon to the NAACP,'' he continued. ``Mike Espy and Ray
Donovan'' _ the former Cabinet secretaries _ ``came to me when they
were in trouble. Great trial lawyers are not limited to a select
group of white males. There's a social value in having
African-American lawyers thought of in that ilk, and it's important
to break the mold.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who attended Holy Cross on a football scholarship and has
a master's in business and a law degree from Harvard, was raised in
Washington on a shoestring by his mother, who worked in a Navy mail
room. Ma Wells, as she is known, attends all his Washington cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``She owns the federal courthouse!'' he said. ``She exudes love.
My mother just embarrasses mean people into being nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Something of that compassionate demeanor translates into her
son's courtroom style, described as approachable and appealing
rather than dazzling and theatrical. To get juries to trust him, he
will concede that his clients have made mistakes, and then argue
why they still deserve to be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said I love juries, and I believe in unconditional
love,'' said Wells, who is 6 foot 3 with an athlete's energy and
grace. ``And I'll say, `I can't just love you when you vote my way
_ I have to love you however you vote.'''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, making jurors feel guilt-ridden if they find his
clients guilty. ``I haven't just won,''` he said. ``I've won and
had jurors embrace the client. That's the real goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for trials close to home, Wells moves into a hotel, getting
pumped in a high-end bunker with legal briefs, room service and
daily workouts. Next will be the Rihga Royal to prep for the Jan.
24 criminal trial of Dr. Niels Lauersen, a Park Avenue specialist
accused of insurance fraud over billing for infertility treatments,
which are not covered, as standard gynecological care. ``It's a
very difficult case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't turn down cases because the facts are bad,'' said
Wells, who rejected opportunities to be a federal judge or U.S.
attorney _ too staid. He would love to square off against David
Boies, who prosecuted the Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet! We're all just big kids,'' Wells said with his bright
grin. ``Bottom line? `Hey, let's draw!'''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BY the time he finished praising Chan Gailey, you wondered why on
earth Jerry Jones had fired him. Oh, yeah, right. Not enough wins.
</P>
<P>
   Firing a coach is one of those exercises that does not get
easier with practice. You think of the French, cutting off the
buttons and epaulets of a disgraced officer while a steady drumbeat
breaks the silence.
</P>
<P>
   Jones drums them out of the corps with kindness. As he announced
the firing Tuesday, he recalled having hired Gailey because he had
``a character beyond reproach,'' and virtues that included
ambition, integrity, seriousness and imagination. He was also
expected to ``put in an offense that fit the personnel that we had,
and I hoped to acquire in the future, so that we could do great
things for the Dallas Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in this latter department that Gailey fell short, failing
to produce the right answers. Jerry needed someone more intuitive,
more inscrutable. He should have hired Charlie Chan.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the Cowboys has been a source of disenchantment
to the team's fans and of puzzlement to the owner. The Cowboys have
employed four coaches dating to 1960, and under Jones three have
come and gone in the last 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was a perception that the Dallas job had become a
revolving door, he replied, just a tad defensively, ``The other two
changes I've been a part of, I knew those guys for 30 years each
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to his former Arkansas soul mates, Jimmy
Johnson, who won back-to-back Super Bowls, and Barry Switzer, who
was never accepted in Dallas but did not prevent the Cowboys from
winning a third ring in the '90s. While it would not be technically
correct to say either was fired, both left with settlements
described as generous.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, in his first official act as the new owner of the team
in 1989, Jones broke the news to Tom Landry that after 29 seasons,
his services were no longer required. A firestorm followed what was
seen as the rude treatment of a legend, and Jones needed years, and
two Super Bowls, to overcome that first impression. He learned, as
most owners do, the difference between honor and dumb.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, you note that Landry needed five seasons before the
Cowboys reached the .500 mark and a sixth before they won more
games than they lost.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine any coach in the NFL getting a grace period of
six years in today's broiling pressure? Jones did not invent the
era of the quick thumb, but he has moved it along. Gailey lasted
two seasons, ending both with playoff losses in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   In what might be seen as an acknowledgment of the turmoil that
has been so much a part of the team's recent history, Jones said:
``This decision was about football.'' It was not, he added, about
egos or clashes or contentiousness or ``friendships gone awry.''
</P>
<P>
   Which of them had control split up the act between the two JJs,
and the troubling image of drugs, guns and girls cut short
Switzer's tenure. Jones gave Gailey credit for helping clean up the
team's act, and the somber ex-coach accepted it. ``I think our guys
understood how to handle themselves,'' he said, ``and I appreciate
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a kind of mea culpa _ at times sounding as if he were
testifying before the House Ethics Committee _ Jones added that the
firing was not about ``a structure that created problems in making
decisions.'' Translation: Gailey's insistence on being his own
offensive coordinator was not a fatal issue.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he sacrificed on the altar of Troy Aikman's discontent,
although at times the quarterback clearly felt restrained by the
offense. The Cowboys lost their last eight road games, including
Sunday's 27-10 defeat at Minnesota. Four of those losses were to
teams that scored only 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say the players undermined me,'' Gailey said. ``I
think they told the truth about what they believed. You think there
are always extenuating circumstances that might play into
decisions. But sometimes you go by the bottom line, and that was
what happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was grateful Jones did not keep him dangling. There were
clearly few other reasons for gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to be a head coach,'' he said, ``to be in the
NFL, to be with this organization. I'm going to look back on it and
say I learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been a mildly surprising choice, an assistant for 10
years, two as the offense coordinator for the Steelers. His only
head coaching experience had been at Troy State. None of the three
men hired by Jones had held the top job in the NFL, and he would
not discuss his criteria for the next adventurer.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey leaves with his dignity intact, but we never really
got to know him. He was asked if he could envision what he would be
doing today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finish packing,'' he replied.

ROBITAILLE HONORED FOR 1,000th GAME 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Kings left-winger Luc Robitaille was
honored before Tuesday's game for recording his 1,000th career game
during the last road trip.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed his appreciation the only way he knows, scoring his
17th goal of the year in the first period against the Ottawa
Senators and the 534th of his career. That put him 20th all-time,
passing Hall of Famer Frank Mahovalich. Stan Mikita is next at 544
and then Robitaille's boyhood idol, Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard, at
541.
</P>
<P>
   For his 1,000th game, Robitaille was presented two off-road
motorcycles from his teammates, a trip to Hawaii from Kings
management, a crystal trophy from NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and
a painting from the Senators depicting youth hockey in his native
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, who was honored last year for scoring his 500th
career goal, said the significance of the individual milestones he
has reached the past two seasons won't mean much until after he
retires.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, who turns 34 next month, says the only thing that is
important now is winning a Stanley Cup. Two years after the Kings
reached the finals in 1993 against Montreal, Robitaille was traded
to the Pittsburgh Penguins and then on to the New York Rangers
before returning for the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get as close as we did that year, you realize how
truly special it is,'' Robitaille said. ``You're sure it can happen
again if you just work a little harder, but things change and it
never happens again. Going all the way would be incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's career has been marked by more than just games and
goals. He has been active in the community and a part-owner of the
Iceoplex skating facility in North Hills, where the Kings train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luc has been the most popular player on this team since the
day he walked in here,'' general manager and former teammate Dave
Taylor said. ``He always has had time for everyone and has been a
great asset to the community. Even though he left here for a few
years, Luc will always be remembered as a King first.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Out awhile: Robitaille scored his goal while playing on the
second line, where he'll remain while Jozef Stumpel is out of the
lineup with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille moved back to the second unit last week when Donald
Audette suffered an ankle sprain and has stayed even though Stumpel
is sidelined. The Kings are now going with a first line of Len
Barrie, who scored two goals on Thursday against Florida, and
Vladimir Tsyplakov.
</P>
<P>
   But there is not doubt Stumpel is missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the Jozef Stumpel from two years ago,'' coach Andy
Murray said. ``The center on the first line is so critical to the
whole team, but injuries have really slowed him. We're hoping to
get him back soon, but he'll probably be out at least another
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel, who missed six weeks earlier this season after
abdominal surgery, scored 79 points two seasons ago, including a
team-high 58 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he was slowed by the abdominal problem that carried
over to this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very frustrating because I felt very good after coming
back,'' Stumpel said. ``I sat around so long all I could think
about was being in there and helping the team. Hopefully this won't
be too much longer.''

</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-POLITICS (Berlin) _ The slush fund scandal surrounding
Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor, shakes up German politics:
Kohl's successor as head of the Christian Democrats, Wolfgang
Schauble, is tottering after admitting taking money. The scandal
has given Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats new life,
with victory now expected instead of a predicted defeat in the next
state election. By Roger Cohen.

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-LOW-INCOME _ President Clinton plans to propose a
substantial expansion in the program of tax credits for the working

   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-MICROSOFT (Undated) _ To the company's adversaries, the
very name ``Microsoft'' suggests menacing power. It has been called
the Death Star, an 800-pound gorilla and worse. And in the
government's sweeping antitrust case, Microsoft was portrayed in
convincing detail as a monopolistic bully. America Online Inc., in
particular, was bent to Microsoft's will, according to court
testimony. But after America Online's move on Monday to buy Time
Warner Inc., the largest merger in history, Microsoft suddenly
seems less threatening. The deal, to be sure, changes none of the
facts in the antitrust case. But antitrust experts say it could
figure into the calculations the court makes on sanctions against
Microsoft, if it loses the case, or in settlement talks. By Steve
Lohr.

chairman, urged the assembled press corps earlier this week to
`look at the body language` among the executives on stage as proof
of how harmoniously his company would blend with America Online,
there was an uncomfortable silence. Then Robert W. Pittman,
president of AOL, put his arms around his Time Warner neighbors.
The gesture drew laughter and diffused an awkward moment, but it
did not necessarily provide assurances of a happy cultural mesh. By
Amy Harmon and Alex Kuczynski.

   AOL-TIME-CONSUMERS (Undated) _ The merger agreement between AOL
and Time Warner is reverberating throughout the communications and

SONICS GIVE WESTPHAL FIRST VICTORY OVER HIS FORMER TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A part of Sonics coach Paul Westphal wants you to
believe it was just another game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the next one will be. But just call the Sonics' 101-88
victory over the Phoenix Suns Tuesday night at KeyArena a slight
exercise in revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The win was Westphal's first in five tries against his former
team since he took control of the Sonics in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd be a little more giddy,'' said Westphal, who was
fired as head coach of the Suns in 1996. ``It's about time, really.
We've played them five times. It's a good win. I'm glad I don't
have to talk about it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal and the Sonics had already lost a Nov. 21 matchup at
Phoenix earlier this season. Phoenix won all three meetings last
season.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was little doubt Tuesday Westphal would finally
down the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' offense ran smoothly and their defense held the
run-and-gun Suns to a crawl. Westphal watched a six-point halftime
lead expand to 13 points late in the third, and the Sonics kept
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   They led by 20 points with 4:08 left in the game after Gary
Payton fed Brent Barry for a fast-break layup. Curiously, Barry,
Payton, Rashard Lewis, Horace Grant and Greg Foster were on the
floor against the Suns' `C' team late in the game with the Sonics
up 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just making sure,'' Westphal said, smiling. ``But it's not any
personal vindication for me.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Sonics have taken to heart are their up-and-down
performances at home.
</P>
<P>
   Their victory against the Suns was characterized by consistent
performances on both ends. The last time the Sonics played in
KeyArena, they blew a 19-point first-half lead and lost to the Los
Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, though, set the tone defensively. He slowed down Suns
point guard Jason Kidd most of the game. Kidd finished with 15
assists, but had just 12 points on 5-for-15 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics disrupted the Suns' offense by forcing other players
to handle the ball. Phoenix settled for jump shots and struggled to
score inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed on our man,'' Payton said. ``We stayed in front of
Jason and made him throw passes over us. This is the first time
we've done this at home in a while. We needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton actually won the point guard duel even though the younger
Kidd has replaced him as the leading vote-getter among Western
Conference guards in All-Star balloting. Payton, who started the
past two All-Star games, is third behind Kidd and Lakers guard Kobe
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, Kidd and Bryant would start. Payton would
likely be added to the West roster by the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   That subplot finished with Payton amassing 23 points and 13
assists in 43 minutes. He turned the ball over just once, which
epitomized the Sonics' offense. They committed just 11 turnovers,
patiently waited for good looks at the basket and shot 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're good offensively and don't turn the ball over and get
decent shots, then (teams) can't get in transition,'' Westphal
said. ``I thought they didn't hurt us very much with their
transition., and they're a great transition team.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lot of ways, the Suns and Sonics mirror each other. Both
teams use small lineups and rely on outside shooting and fast-break
baskets. The Suns have emphasized defense more since Scott Skiles
took over as head coach when Danny Ainge resigned last month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Suns did little to stop the Sonics from running
toward easy baskets. Barry's aggressiveness translated to 21
points, and the Sonics got a second consecutive quality performance
from Rashard Lewis off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 12 points, including three 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very impressed with that young man,'' Westphal said. ``I
mean, in tough situations, he gets bigger and bigger, and that's a
sign of a guy who's got a great future.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Lewis' 3-pointer that put the Sonics ahead for good. They
led 34-33 with 7:37 left in the second. That was the Sonics' first
lead since they went ahead 13-12 in the first.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 25-19 after the first quarter, the Sonics
held a 51-45 advantage at halftime. The Suns never got any closer
than nine points after the third.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had not beaten Phoenix since March 1, 1998, and snapped
a six-game losing streak to the Suns. Westphal, who spent most of
his NBA life in the Suns organization as a player and coach, left
the court smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've been in the league a long time, you know you want to
beat your former team,'' Sonics center Horace Grant said. ``We sort
of knew it, but (Westphal) never brought it up.''

FAMILIAR LAPSES PROVE COSTLY AGAINST SENATORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings had never lost to the Ottawa
Senators in six games at home.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, they couldn't help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Every time they mounted a little momentum, the Kings did their
best to play their worst in a 4-3 loss in front of 14,224 at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they pulled within a goal with 12 minutes left, they
lost Luc Robitaille for the rest of the game with a slashing
penalty and a game misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   It was only one of several indiscretions that caused the Kings
to look more like the team that dropped six straight in December
than the club that recorded a win and a tie in its last two games.
</P>
<P>
   There were the two power-play goals by Ottawa's Joe Juneau they
allowed in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Even after tying the game, the Kings gave up a brutal goal to
former King Scott McEachern in the first minute of the second
period after defenseman Aki Berg fanned on a clearing pass in front
of goaltender Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three minutes later, Fiset, who had started the last
eight games, was the culprit when Marcus Arvedson scored on a long
goal beyond the right faceoff circle. Fiset was pulled in favor of
Marcel Cousineau, who did not allow another goal.
</P>
<P>
   But the game was lost right there even though the Kings scored
their third goal early in the third period on Mattias Norstrom's
first goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators have built a solid season despite a controversial
contract holdout by its best player, Alexei Yashin. They also were
playing the first of back-to-back games in Southern California with
a game tonight against the Mighty Ducks at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the team is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But in this one, the Kings were the ones who looked distracted.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings seemed to clean up their mess after tying the game in
the final minutes of the first period after dropping behind 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, honored before the game for reaching the 1,000th
game of his career, tied it after the Kings had been outshot 16-1
in the first 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the Kings were sluggish and the Senators took
advantage. Juneau's first goal came on a blast from beyond the left
faceoff circle. With Bryan Smolinski off for cross checking, Ottawa
center Radek Bonk cleared the middle, but Juneau's shot struck
Fiset and trickled in with 10:38 gone in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three minutes later, the Kings found themselves in a
similar situation. Robitaille was off for cross checking. This
time, the Senators had three whacks at Fiset, one after the puck
glanced off Berg's skate. Juneau poked the last one in and Ottawa
led 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The second one stirred the Kings for the final 5 1/2 minutes of
the period.
</P>
<P>
   Playing short-handed with Vladimir Tsyplakov off for
interference, captain Rob Blake got things going when he picked up
a Smolinski pass along the right boards and skated into the
Senators end. He then slid before sliding a pass in front to Dan
Bylsma, who beat Patrick Lalime.
</P>
<P>
   With just over a minute left in the period and Ottawa coming off
a penalty kill, Robitaille tied the game at 2. After a blast by
Blake, he missed on the rebound but lifted the puck over Lalime's
left shoulder for his 17th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Things looked good, but not for long.

FISET ACCEPTS BLAME FOR LOSS TO SENATORS
</HEADLINE>
 ... KINGS WRITETHRU (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even though Stephane Fiset was pulled early in the
second period Tuesday night, he knew there would be a few more
shots fired his way.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood in the Los Angeles Kings' postgame dressing room
after their 4-3 loss to the Ottawa Senators, Fiset took the blame
for his team's worst game since its six-game meltdown last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was my fault, no question,'' said Fiset, who left
just 3:26 into the second period after giving up a long goal to
Marcus Arvedson. ``We need some big saves to keep us in the game
and I just didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, who was playing his eighth consecutive game since Jamie
Storr suffered a concussion, wasn't tired. The team came in after
four days off and had a win and a tie in its two previous games.
But not only did Fiset play poorly, he had company.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators, who hadn't won in six career tries in Los Angeles,
looked at home in front of 14,224 at Staples Center. They had the
benefit of five power-play opportunities in the first period and
Joe Juneau scored on two of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are the league's most penalized team, Ottawa the
least. The results were predictable and too much to overcome, even
after Fiset left and Mattias Norstrom made it a one-goal game with
12:41 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``No goalie wants to go through that, nobody wants to get
pulled,'' said Fiset. ``But it was the right decision. That's hard
to say, too. We back ourselves into a corner, then built a little
momentum. Then we gave it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom's goal made it 4-3, but less than a minute later, Luc
Robitaille received two minutes for slashing and a game misconduct
that ended his night.
</P>
<P>
   On the night he was honored for his 1,000th career game,
Robitaille also tied the game at 2-2 with just over a minute left
in the first period. But this was not a game to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings were outshot 16-1 in the first 15 minutes of
the game, the game was decided early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Even after tying the game, the Kings gave up a brutal goal to
former King Scott McEachern in the first minute of the second
period after defenseman Aki Berg fanned on a clearing pass in front
of Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a play that can't happen against a team like Ottawa,''
Kings coach Andy Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three minutes later, Fiset was the culprit when
Arvedson scored on a long goal beyond the right faceoff circle.
Fiset was pulled in favor of Marcel Cousineau, who stopped 12 shots
and did not allow another goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators have built a solid season despite a controversial
contract holdout by its best player, Alexei Yashin. They also were
playing the first of back-to-back games in Southern California with
a game tonight against the Mighty Ducks at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the team is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But in this one, the Kings were the ones who looked distracted.
They seemed to clean up their mess after tying the game in the
final minutes of the first period after dropping behind 2-0.
Instead of responding to Robitaille's goal, the Kings came out with
their worst hockey since the three-game, 23-goal fiasco in
mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   But it was that way all night. Playing short-handed with
Vladimir Tsyplakov off for interference in the first period,
captain Rob Blake got things going when he picked up a Bryan
Smolinski pass along the right boards and skated into the Senators
end. He then slid before sliding a pass in front to Dan Bylsma, who
beat Patrick Lalime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about turning points, I thought we would have
responded after the short-handed goal,'' Murray said. ``But it
really never happened.''

BILL PITS ENVIRONMENTALISTS, FARMERS AGAINST DEVELOPERS IN WATER 
 DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ A odd political alliance of farmers and
environmentalists squares off Wednesday against builders and cities
in the latest round of a nearly decadelong fight to block new
housing developments that don't have a sufficient water supply.
<P>
   The battle began in 1991 when East Bay Municipal Utilities
District refused to provide water to developers of the 11,000-home
Dougherty Valley project near San Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight has since taken on statewide importance as
California grapples with the prospect of accommodating some 3.6
million new residents over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more people move here, we have to be more responsible in
our use of resources. And water has been one of those things we've
said we're not going to worry about because it's always there,''
said Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, D-Santa Monica. ``I don't think
that's responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuehl is the author of a bill that requires cities and counties
to show that once a new housing tract is built there will still be
enough water available _ even in drought years _ to meet all
agricultural, residential and business needs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure will be heard Wednesday in the Assembly Local
Government committee.
</P>
<P>
   Each year since 1991, on bill after bill, EBMUD and its farmer
and environmentalist allies have been defeated by a politically
powerful coalition of builders, realtors, cities, counties and the
California Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists like the idea of making housing projects
contingent on water availability because it could slow development.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers back the measure because they don't want to lose their
share of California's water to urban and suburban users.
</P>
<P>
   EBMUD fears overextending itself by having to provide more and
more water to new developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make sure you can meet the needs of your existing
customers before you take on additional ones,'' said Randy Kanouse,
EBMUD's lobbyist. ``One-third of the water we sell is to
businesses. They have expectations that they'll get all the water
they need.''
</P>
<P>
   But builders, realtors and Shappell Industries _ one of the
developers of Dougherty Valley _ say the solution to California's
water needs is more dams and reservoirs, not added restrictions on
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill punishes those who are looking for an affordable
place to live,'' said Tim Coyle, lobbyist for the California
Building Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``What public policy interest does this serve? Safeguards
already exist at the local level,'' Coyle said ``A home doesn't get
built unless there is an adequate supply of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities also oppose the bill because they say they already
consider water supply in making development decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Two East Bay Democrats _ Assemblymembers Tom Torlakson of
Antioch and Ellen Corbett of San Leandro _ are pivotal to the
bill's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Torlakson wanted to gut a similar bill so both sides
could work out their differences.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when Torlakson was a Contra Costa County supervisor,
the county approved the Dougherty Valley development that rankled
EBMUD.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the board voted to oppose a bill like the one Kuehl is
carrying this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom is still deliberating, although he's acutely concerned
about the issue,'' said Robert Oakes, a Torlakson spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Corbett said she is inclined to support it. ``It makes sense to
determine if water is available when making decisions on land
use,'' she said. EBMUD's problems with Dougherty Valley were
resolved in 1998 when Shappell and another developer, Windemere
Ranch Partners, paid $18 million to Zone 7, the Tri-Valley's water
district to provide the project's water.

 ANALYSTS SEE A CLEAR BENEFIT IN AOL'S MOVE  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online's stock fell almost 12 percent Tuesday on
morning-after worries that many of the expected benefits from its
acquisition of Time Warner won't come easily _ with one exception.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agreed that AOL's $160 billion purchase will
hasten its ability to provide customers with high-speed Internet
service and a wider variety of online content from Time Warner's
vast libraries of music, magazines and movies.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also could speed the day when Bay Area residents have
a choice of cable Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, AT&AMP;T is the only company providing cable Internet
service in most parts of the Bay Area. The company has an exclusive
agreement with ExciteAtHome, which provides high-speed Internet
service over AT&AMP;T's cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T says it eventually will sign similar deals with other
Internet service providers, but only after its pact with
ExciteAtHome expires in mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   But several experts predicted Tuesday that the AOL-Time Warner
deal will put pressure on AT&AMP;T to open its network to other
Internet service providers, like America Online, right away.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Battle for Open Cable Lines
</P>
<P>
   AOL had been leading the charge for ``open access,'' or giving
customers a choice of high-speed Internet service providers by
forcing cable monopolies to open their lines to competing ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   It also will be able to lead by example: In taking over Time
Warner, the nation's No. 2 cable company after AT&AMP;T, it can
immediately open up  &LR; its own cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Time Warner also has an exclusive agreement with a
single company, RoadRunner, to provide high-speed Internet service
through its cable lines. But AOL President Steve Case said Monday
that he will continue to support open access.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, which would like to gain access to AT&AMP;T's vast cable
network, could gain additional leverage with its purchase of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has been trying to persuade Time Warner to let it sell
local telephone service over Time Warner's cables. Now AOL could
offer to let AT&AMP;T do just that _ in exchange for letting AOL sell
Internet access over AT&AMP;T's cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly (AOL) has a monster negotiating chip,'' said Barry
Parr, an Internet analyst with International Data Corp. in Mountain
View.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said the deal puts more steam behind the
open-access push.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears this will speed along open access ... and put more
pressure on AT&AMP;T,'' said Cliff Staton, executive director of the
Open Access Alliance of the Bay Area, which has been championing
the issue locally.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T insists its plans remain unchanged. ``We're committed to
giving customers a choice,'' said spokesman Clay Ryder, ``but we
will honor our exclusive agreement'' with ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T did end the pact early, analysts said the clear loser
would be ExciteAtHome. The Redwood City company estimates it
reaches between 15 and 20 percent of its 1.1 million Net customers
nationwide through AT&AMP;T's cable TV lines. If ExciteAtHome lost its
exclusive contract, other ISPs could  &LR; would try to steal those
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But ExciteAtHome Vice President Richard Gringras insisted that
his deal with AT&AMP;T is not in jeopardy. An early end to the contract
``is simply not in the cards,'' Gringras said.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned whether AOL is really committed to open
access, saying the company might only open access to affiliated
companies or give its rivals worse terms than its allies.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Gringras argues, the AOL-Time Warner deal will give
ExciteAtHome a boost by publicizing the attraction of high-speed
connections. ``We only think this will help stimulate our growth
and consumer awareness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Michael Graham of Robertson Stephens in San
Francisco said, ``I don't think it means that much at all for
AtHome.'' He added that some ExciteAtHome investors might be
disappointed that America Online didn't buy their company instead
of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   In a dismal day for tech stocks overall, ExciteAtHome shares
were down $2.75 to $37.25. AOL fell $8.63 to $64. And Time Warner,
which on Monday gained more than $25, or 39 percent, gave back
$6.25 to close at $86.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts worried that AOL's breakneck growth rate would
slow with Time Warner's stodgier media properties included. Others
wondered whether employees who originally came from Time Inc.,
Warner Communications, Turner Broadcasting, Netscape and AOL could
become one big happy family.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also questioned how the deal would affect Yahoo, which
offers a variety of content including stock quotes and chat, for
free on the Web. Many analysts said the move puts pressure on Yahoo
to acquire other media companies to keep up with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   With Time Warner, AOL gains access to an enormous breadth of
media brands ranging from Sports Illustrated to CNN to Bugs Bunny.
Theoretically, it could offer some of this content exclusively to
customers to help persuade them to sign up with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated that Yahoo could buy Walt Disney Co.,
another giant media company that, like Time Warner, has had trouble
moving its successful brands online. Yahoo, with a market
capitalization of $105 billion (versus $75 billion for Disney) is
one of the few Net companies big enough to acquire Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time seeing a market where (America Online and
Time Warner) is a unique marriage,'' said Clay Ryder, an analyst
with Zona Research in Redwood City. ``This is just the first.''

 &HT;    Athletes get foot-in-mouth disease
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Tired of seeing Dan Quayle used as a punching
bag just because when he opens his mouth, he sticks his foot in it?
Here are some quotes sent to me via e-mail that shows when it comes
to making stupid statements, athletes can hold their own with
politicians any day.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Nobody in football should be called a genius. A genius is a
guy like
</P>
<P>
   Norman Einstein.'' (Football commentator and former player Joe
Theismann.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I'm going to graduate on time, no matter how long it
takes.'' (Senior
</P>
<P>
   basketball player at the University of Pittsburgh.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You guys pair up in groups of three, then line up in a
circle.'' (Bill
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, a Florida State football coach.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``That's so when I forget how to spell my name, I can still
find my
</P>
<P>
   clothes.'' (Stu Grimson, Chicago Blackhawks left wing,
explaining why he
</P>
<P>
   keeps a color photo of himself above his locker.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You guys line up alphabetically by height'' (Bill Peterson,
a Florida
</P>
<P>
   State football coach.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I play football. I'm not trying to be a professor. The tests
don't seem
</P>
<P>
   to make sense to me, measuring your brain on stuff I haven't
been through in
</P>
<P>
   school.'' (Clemson recruit Ray Forsythe, who was ineligible as a
freshman
</P>
<P>
   because of academic requirements.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I know the Virginia players are smart because you need a
1500 SAT to
</P>
<P>
   get in. I have to drop bread crumbs to get our players to and
from class'' (George Raveling, Washington State basketball coach.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Why would anyone expect him to come out smarter? He went to
prison for
</P>
<P>
   three years, not Princeton.'' (Boxing promoter Dan Duva on Mike
Tyson.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I can't really remember the names of the clubs that we went
to.'' (Shaquille O'Neal on whether he had visited the Parthenon
during his visit to
</P>
<P>
   Greece.)

 &HT;    Mineral slimming's mantra: Wrap it up, I'm not taking it home
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ My sister and I have this holiday
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Each year we inevitably find ourselves side by side in our
parents' bedroom, next to the mirrored closet, comparing the size,
shape and relative attractiveness of our butts. (Don't worry _
we're fully clothed.)
</P>
<P>
   Racked by body-image issues, each of us is convinced the other
has been more blessed by the gluteus maximus gods. Which made this
the perfect time of year, I thought, to subject myself to a mineral
body wrap and give my caboose a boost.
</P>
<P>
   Lured by the promise of walking out several inches smaller in
circumference _ without any messy huffing, puffing and sweating or
any calorie counting
</P>
<P>
   _ I visited the offices of Slimmer Bodies.
</P>
<P>
   All I have to do, according to the Slimmer Bodies press release
that landed on my desk a few weeks earlier, is get bundled in
mineral-soaked bandages and lurch around _ think Boris Karloff _
for an hour. Sounded like, pardon the pun, a cinch.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Slawson, Slimmer Bodies owner (and, yes, the owner of a
slimmer body), is on the phone with a potential body-wrap client
when I arrive (a man, she says, who needs a little hand-holding).
Wearing a casual black dress, she's open and friendly, the kind of
woman who soothes your insecurities by dishing about her own figure
flaws.
</P>
<P>
   She first has me fill out a brief health form, which questions
how devoted I'll be to a healthy diet and exercise plan after my
wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure, whatever. Bring on the bandages.
</P>
<P>
   I am shown to a dressing room where I change into my blue
gingham, '40s-style swimsuit (most folks wear their undies _ but
for the sake of the photographer I have in tow, I take the demure
route). On my way to the measuring room, Slawson has me drink a
Dixie cup full of what tastes vaguely like grape juice. She says
it's a concoction that will boost my supply of minerals and
vitamins. That way, when the wrap begins its sucking action, I
won't be drained of nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the moment I've feared: Slawson and her tape measure.
She measures my upper arm (small), my forearm (smaller) and my
wrist (smallest). The area above my bust (small), below my bust
(smaller) and my rib cage (smallest). And finally the dreaded lower
extremities: mid-thigh (large), upper thigh (larger) and hips
(largest). A total of 18 measurements in all, which Slawson notes
down to a one-eighth of an inch on a chart.
</P>
<P>
   The Slimmer Bodies wrap, which is actually the Victoria Morton
Body Wrap (as seen on Extra! and Sally Jessy Raphael), doesn't
promise lost pounds, although you are weighed before and after.
</P>
<P>
   Developed 30 years ago, the wrap does guarantee, however, that
inches will melt away. It's not a dehydration wrap, the Slimmer
Bodies literature assures. Inches are lost through the use of a
secret solution, ``composed entirely of food-grade inorganic
minerals and distilled water.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery minerals seep into your skin, pull out whatever
``toxins'' you're toting around and shrink your tissues to leave
you six to 20 inches smaller (remember, that's a 20-inch total loss
spread over 18 separate measurements). In other words, you cannot
will the ``toxins'' to exit from your ample thighs and and take up
refuge in your meager chest.
</P>
<P>
   (And now a word from a medical professional. . . While a body
wrap temporarily could leave you a sliver of your former self, it's
not a permanent solution to feeling you're too big for your
britches. ``You don't need to be a physician to know you're not
going to lose any fat by that means. You lose fat by burning more
calories than you take in,'' says Dr. Patrick O'Neil, director of
the Weight Management Center at the Medical University of South
Carolina. But he does concede that wraps can provide the illusion
of being thinner: ``If that's what somebody's after and they know
that's what they're getting, then you're in business.'')
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, that's what I want. And so begins the short process of
binding. The key is to wrap tight, Slawson says. And boy does she.
She swaddles my legs, hips and stomach in moist Ace bandages as if
she's Hattie McDaniel, I'm Vivien Leigh, and we're replaying the
corset scene from ``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   My legs start to go slightly numb, but Slawson assures me that
as soon as I start ambling around the Slimmer Bodies office, I'll
feel more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   And then Slawson, like some fairy godmother to the posteriorly
cursed, asks if I want a ``butt lift.'' Heck, yes! Gimme the
Jennifer Lopez special! Slawson yanks bandages up between my legs
to create a huge, diaper-like wedgie. And with my wrapped hands, it
is impossible to unwedge myself.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she accessorizes my flesh-toned ensemble with a rain
poncho to keep me warm and clear plastic bags on my hands and feet.
The bags will catch the ``toxins'' that escape my body, she
explains.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, I'm fairly toxic. During the hourlong session of
``mummy aerobics,'' which amounts to me walking clumsily in circles
in a large, spartan room at the back of Slimmer Bodies while we
watch videotapes of Victoria Morton performing body wraps on talk
show after talk show, the toxin-filled bags must be dumped every 10
minutes. I become obsessed with how much runoff I'm producing,
holding up my left hand to check the bag's toxin level every couple
of minutes. Slawson wears surgical gloves to empty the bags _
otherwise, my toxins will irritate her skin, she says. (I have to
wonder what all these poisons are doing to my insides.)
</P>
<P>
   In between the emptying of the toxin bags, Slawson slathers me
with more of Slimmer Bodies' secret sauce, which is kept warm in
the kind of rectangular double boiler you see on a buffet. Then
it's back to the main room for more shuffling in a circle, more
watching of exercise videos whose moves my bandaged limbs have no
hope of mimicking, and more idle chitchat.
</P>
<P>
   I learn that Slawson takes Tae Kwon Do. She demonstrates a
powerful, shoulder-high kick that I realize could easily level me
in my mummified state.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, an hour has passed and Slawson quickly unspools the
bandages from my now-shivering body as if they were on fire and she
is trying to save me from the burning fabric. She then reaches for
that blasted tape measure.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, the tape measure is now my friend! I am almost 12
inches smaller. My forearms, wrists, rib cage and calves are the
same, but who cares? I lost 7/8 of an inch from each upper thigh,
7/8 of an inch from my hips and an inch from my tummy. That's big
news in the land of the pear-shaped.
</P>
<P>
   And when I later see photos of my bikinied backside, I realize
my sister could be in for some tough competition this year.
</P>
<P>
   We have liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   Slawson says I can maintain my shrunken silhouette as long as I
don't gain any weight. She was right. I felt slimmer for several
days. But then I started gulping eggnog almost daily throughout the
holidays. (Which explains why I'm pushing maximum density again.)
</P>
<P>
   Would I return to Slimmer Bodies? If I had a spare $85, sure.
The feeling of suddenly occupying less space provided a nifty
albeit temporary boost to my self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention my butt.

 &HT;    Favorite years are a surprise
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The teachers at the Muse Machine workshop sat
around the table, engaging in an activity for which their day jobs
afford little opportunity: a philosophical conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The topic: ``What was your favorite year?''
</P>
<P>
   ``1985 _ the year I got married,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   ``1995 _ the year I got divorced,'' countered another.
</P>
<P>
   ``1973 _ my junior year in high school,'' piped in a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a better junior year than I did,'' groused a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation-starter was this weekend's Muse Machine
performance of the 1992 Broadway musical My Favorite Year. The
story, based on the 1982 movie starring Peter O'Toole, follows a
tumultuous few weeks in the life of aspiring young comedy writer
Benjy Stone. The year is 1954, and Benjy is charged with
``babysitting'' dissolute former matinee idol Alan Swann, based on
Errol Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   Director and choreographer Nat Horne's favorite year just
happens to be 1954: ``That's the year I came to New York and
decided to go into show business and give up plans to become a
professor of math. I had to starve for a month and eat oatmeal. So
1954 was not the best year, but my favorite year, because it was
the year I decided, 'I'm doing this and nothing else.' And I did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That dichotomy was also present in the response of co-director
and music director David Dusing, who couldn't single out one year
as his favorite:
</P>
<P>
   ``The year I started performing professionally. The year I first
toured. The year of a long-ago failed romance that when recalled
still, for some odd reason, has a sadness and sting.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. The years that come back most vividly are the
tumultuous ones, the times of struggle and change. I suppose I
should say my favorite year is the year I got married (who needs
that stress)? or the years my children were born (who needs the 4
a.m. feedings)? Instead I think of my first job, when we were all
young and hungry, one big happy dysfunctional family. Or the year I
fell in love for the first time, with all the attendant expectation
and misery. Or the year I started dating my husband, with all the
attendant skepticism and surreptitious happiness. Or this year,
when my children have become so suddenly, so completely, their own
people.
</P>
<P>
   What would the Muse Machine's young cast members _ all high
school students _ have to say on the subject?
</P>
<P>
   Ben Magnuson, a high school junior who plays Alan Swann, said
this year is his favorite year: ``The day after one show ends,
another begins. That's really what I want to be doing. It's nice
having no life.''
</P>
<P>
   Katharine Jackson, a senior, is in her seventh year with the
Muse Machine. The daughter of Helen and Isaiah Jackson, former
conductor of the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra, she has graduated
from a one-word part in Music Man to last year's stunning turn as
Lola in Damn Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   On reflection, Jackson chose her sophomore year, when she landed
an ingenue role in Mame: ``That's when I was in the middle, looking
up at the stars. I could see how far I'd come, and I could see how
much I have to look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, how she doesn't pick the easiest year, or the happiest
year, or the year of her greatest triumph. How she understands, at
such a young age, that any year that you're striving, looking at
the stars, most fully alive, can turn out to be your favorite year.

 &HT;    Son's unsportsmanlike outbursts troubling
 &HT;    By Dr. Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A reader recently presented the following problem:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. LeCrone: Our son is an excellent tennis player but he
seems to have a terrible problem dealing with the occasional losses
that he experiences. He has broken and thrown his racket numerous
times. On other occasions he has lost his temper at the end of the
match and yelled obscenities at his opponent and the line judges.
He won't even speak to anyone, including his girlfriend, for
several days after a loss. He doesn't exhibit this behavior in any
other situations including school, social relationships or other
competitive sports. Can you make any helpful suggestions that we
might pass on to him?
</P>
<P>
   Dear reader:
</P>
<P>
   Has your son picked up some bad habits of modeling after other
athletes who exhibit unsportsmanlike conduct when losing?
Occasionally, I have seen young athletes who actually admire the
antics displayed by the poor sports in their particular sport.
Close inspection sometimes reveals that this is an
attention-getting mechanism and that they are willing to resort to
negative behaviors to receive the attention of others.
</P>
<P>
   Other athletes with your son's problem are so focused on the
outcome of a particular event that they lose track of the process.
The big picture in becoming proficient and a consistent winner in
any sport is to recognize that getting there takes time and
experience. Getting better includes competition with those who have
more experience, and this translates into some losses as a part of
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the opportunity to learn from a less than desirable
outcome is one of the great keys to success in athletes. This
includes observing the behavior of the more proficient opponent and
learning from his or her style and technique.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals who go ballistic when they lose are often
individuals with problems of low self-esteem. They view their
performance as a direct measure of their self-worth, becoming so
absorbed in winning that they equate losing with being a rotten,
lousy, totally unsuccessful individual in all respects of life.
</P>
<P>
   The poor loser needs to frequently remind him- or herself that
sports are designed to entertain, and having winners and losers
makes the event more interesting. If the outcome were certain,
there would be much less interest in playing or watching the sport
in the first place. Sports losses are disappointments, not death
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Helping your son learn to deal with loss now can be a great
benefit in helping him deal with the many challenges of adult life
in the world outside of play.
</P>

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take 1 of two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q : A question on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' recently
asked whose jurisdiction the U.S. Coast Guard was under. The answer
was the Department of Transportation. When did it change from the
Treasury Department?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most recent change occurred on April 1, 1967, when the
DOT was formed. Before that, control of the Coast Guard _ an
amalgamation of five formerly distinct federal services _ had been
changed a number of times.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard was formed under that name on Jan. 28, 1915,
when the Life-Saving Service and Revenue Cutter Service were
combined. The Revenue Cutter Service was created in 1790. The
Life-Saving Service was an independent bureau of the Treasury
Department. On April 6, 1917, with the declaration of war against
Germany, the Coast Guard was transferred to the Navy Department. On
Aug. 28, 1919, it reverted to the Treasury Department. On Nov. 1,
1941, it was transferred back to the Navy Department. On Jan. 1,
1946, it returned to the Treasury Department. And then, 21 years
later, it made its change to the Transportation Department, where
it remains to date.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The incident involving Atlanta Braves relief pitcher John
Rocker's controversial comments in Sports Illustrated reminds me of
that famous quote: ``I may not agree with anything that you say,
but I will defend to the death your right to say it.'' Who first
said that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some sources attribute the statement _ ``I disapprove of what
you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it'' _ to
French philosopher Voltaire (1694-1778). But the Oxford Dictionary
of Quotations said the words, in fact, are S.G. Tallentyre's
summary of his attitude toward Claude Adrien Helvetius after the
condemnation and burning by the French parliament of Helvetius'
book ``De l'Esprit'' in 1759.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A brief announcement on TV said the nuclear submarine Topeka
was at the international dateline at midnight Dec. 31 so its crew
could be the first people to welcome the new year. I didn't see or
hear anything else about it. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Pearl Harbor-based Navy sub was straddling the
international dateline 400 feet below the surface of the Pacific at
the stroke of midnight Dec. 31, meaning its bow was in one year and
its stern in another. It also was straddling the equator, meaning
it was in both the northern and southern hemispheres.
</P>
<P>
   The sub's commanding officer, Cmdr. Mark Patton of Cheyenne,
Wyo., said the Topeka's positioning was intended to demonstrate the
Navy's confidence that it was ready to handle the so-called Y2K
computer bug, and not a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   The 360-foot-long sub, with a crew of 130, used sophisticated
satellite positioning technology to determine the proper location.
Up above, boats of various sizes circled the area.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article Dec. 31 reported that Sarah Knauss, the world's
oldest living person, had died at 119. Who is now the oldest living
person, and what is the age?
</P>
<P>
   A: Researchers at Guinness Book of World Records are trying to
track down several people who would inherit the title, Guinness
spokeswoman Louise Wilson, in London, told Q&AMP;A. They include a
woman in Poland who is said to be 118, and a man in Oregon who may
be 111.
</P>
<P>
   Until their ages are authenticated _ meaning that a birth
certificate or other undisputed proof of age is provided to the
researchers _ the oldest authenticated person is a Scottish woman,
Marget Eaton McHowat, 107, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   McHowat was born as Marget Eaton Webster on Dec. 4, 1892, in
Brechin, Scotland. She became the oldest living person in Scotland
in April 1999. The eldest child of David and Marget Webster, she
was married to Robert McHowat from 1923 until his death in 1957.
They had two children, Margaret Jean (1926-71) and Irene Anne (born
in 1930 and still living).
</P>
<P>
   Outliving both her brother and sister (who died at 94 and 71,
respectively), and reaching a greater age than her parents (78 and
82), Marget McHowat claims never having a day's illness in her
life, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A list of notable deaths in 1999 included the name of
Elizabeth Guthrie Foster. Is that the author of the children's book
``Gigi,'' about a merry-go-round horse?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Elizabeth Guthrie Foster, who died Nov. 4 at age 86, was
the first woman to head the Atlanta College of Art. She also was a
fellow in the National Association of Schools of Art and Design.
</P>
<P>
   The Elizabeth Foster who wrote the children's book about Gigi, a
horse on the Prater in Vienna when World War I broke out, was born
in Cleveland in 1905 and died in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My Bermuda grass has some pesky weeds I want to kill. I
understand that applying Round-up on dormant, brown Bermuda grass
in the winter will not harm the grass come spring. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. But there's an important condition, said Gil Landry a
turfgrass specialist with the University of Georgia Extension
Service's Experiment Station in Griffin. You must be certain the
grass is totally dormant, meaning there must be no green leaves
beneath the canopy. A grass often appears dormant on the top,
Landry explained, but when you look into the canopy or below the
top leaves, you can find green leaves. If that's the case, don't
apply the Round-up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a reprint of that famous photo of accordionist Graham
Jackson, with tears in his eyes, taken at the time of President
Franklin Roosevelt's death at the Little White House in Georgia.
Whatever became of him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jackson died in January 1983 at the age of 80. He drew
national attention in April 1945 when he was photographed by Life
magazine while playing ``Going Home'' at Warm Springs, Ga., after
FDR died.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain a Latin phrase in Larry McMurtry's ``Lonesome
Dove''? It is this: Uva uvam vivendo varia fit.
</P>
<P>
   A: Many interpretations have been offered by various Latin
scholars. Perhaps the one most agree on was offered first in 1988
by an unnamed Latin language instructor at San Diego State
University, who called it a ``pseudo'' Latin phrase: ``A grape
matures by looking at another grape.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Los Angeles Public Library, McMurtry himself
provided this same translation. In explanation, the library
suggested that McMurtry probably had begun with a self-composed
proverb in English, and ``fractured it a bit'' in attempting to
convert it to Latin.
</P>
<P>
   The literal translation, by the way, is something like this:
(The) versatile grape becomes a grape by living.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter-in-law received a ``pea coat'' for Christmas. We
think the name derives from the Navy in World War II, but we aren't
sure. Do you know the origin?
</P>
<P>
   A: The original ``P'' coat was issued by the Navy before World
War II. The ``P'' stands for ``pilot,'' referring to a ship's
navigator, not an aviator. You'll see it spelled as two words (pea
coat) or one (peacoat), or it might be called a ``pea jacket.'' By
whatever name, it remains a classic fashion statement. The
traditional style calls for eight buttons, in two rows, and a wide,
deeply notched collar. It's waist-length or slightly longer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent question about Al Gore referred to his Army
``enlistment.'' Somewhere I had gotten the impression that Gore
served as an officer. If so, your reference to ``enlistment'' is
inaccurate. I see this mistake frequently in various publications,
and I hear it on the air from time to time. Am I correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gore wasn't an officer, although he had graduated from
Harvard and could have chosen to train as an officer candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As widely reported for years, Gore volunteered for enlistment in
the Army after graduating in 1969, even though _ again, as widely
reported _ he was opposed to U.S. involvement in Vietnam and worked
in the campaign of anti-war presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy.
After he arrived in Vietnam, Spec. 5 Gore served seven months as a
reporter with the noncombat 20th Engineering Battalion, stationed
outside Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   You can check his background online at several sites, including
that of the nonpartisan Project Vote Smart
(http://www.vote-smart.org). You also can get biographical
information at Gore's official Web sites,
www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/index.html and
www.AlGore2000.com/gorefamily/gorefamily.html).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently was asked if Al Gore had enlisted in the Army
rather than having served as an officer. The person asking the
question said he had seen and heard it reported in the media that
Gore had enlisted, adding that this was a mistake. What do you call
it if he was an officer, if it's not an ``enlisted man''?
</P>
<P>
   A: A commissioned officer in the military has chosen to train
for appointment to a position of authority (``an officer''), but he
or she is not considered to have ``enlisted.'' This is the
definition of ``enlisted man'' (or ``enlisted person'') in
Webster's New World Dictionary: ``any person in the armed forces
who is not a commissioned officer or warrant officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore wasn't an officer, although he would have been eligible to
enter officer training _ if he chose to do so _ after graduation
from Harvard University. He didn't.

 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of two.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Exactly what does it mean to say a lake is ``dead'' because
of pollution caused by toxic waste?
</P>
<P>
   A: It means a lake has become ``eutrophic.'' Eutrophic is a
technical term defined as ``pertaining to a lake containing a high
concentration of dissolved nutrients, either by natural means or
pollution, with periods of oxygen deficiency.'' When oxygen is
depleted, fish and other aquatic life are choked.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the cause of death of Wendy's CEO Gordon Teter ever
determined? An article mentioning his death reported that an
autopsy was planned, but I didn't see anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Initial reports indicated that Teter, 56, died of natural
causes on Dec. 18. A spokeswoman at the coroner's office in
Columbus, Ohio, told Q&AMP;A that autopsy reports typically aren't
available until six or eight weeks after death.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the reports I've seen about the influenza virus
spreading across the United States, there has been no mention of
the specific type. Some types are treatable and covered by current
vaccines. Is this one of them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The predominant influenza strain circulating this winter
is A Sydney. It was the strain anticipated by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, so people receiving the vaccine
this season ``should be pretty well protected,'' said CDC spokesman
Tom Skinner. And even if they contract flu, their symptoms should
be lessened.
</P>
<P>
   While the CDC has monitored increased flu activity nationwide in
the past few weeks, many different types of virus can cause upper
respiratory tract infections that may resemble flu, Skinner added.
So what people may think is flu could be something else.
</P>
<P>
   For people considered to be in ``high risk'' categories _ older
than 65, or residents of nursing homes or other closed
environments, or those with chronic heart and lung conditions _
Skinner emphasized the CDC's concern about having flu vaccinations
every year: ``This is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw the final half of the movie adaptation of
Tennessee Williams' ``Baby Doll'' on AMC. Since the cast wasn't
listed at the end, can you tell me who played the title role, what
other pictures she was in, and if she's still living?
</P>
<P>
   A: The baby doll in the steamy movie _ considered notorious when
it was released in 1956 _ was portrayed by Carroll Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Doll'' was Baker's second film. The role branded her as a
sexpot. As a result, her career was most vividly marked by her work
in it and other once-controversial productions, such as ``The
Carpetbaggers'' and ``Harlow.'' But she also appeared in ``The Big
Country,'' ``Giant,'' ``Mister Moses,'' ``How the West Was Won,''
``Cheyenne Autumn,'' ``Ironweed,'' ``Kindergarten Cop,'' ``Watcher
in the Woods'' and ``The Game,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   At last report the 68-year-old grandmother _ her daughter has
three children _ was married to British actor Donald Burton and
living in Los Angeles. Baker continues to turn up from time to time
in made-for-TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I didn't see anything about the White House greeting cards
sent by President and Mrs. Clinton, but David Letterman said on his
program that he received one. Can you share any details with us?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1999 card featured a rendering of a watercolor painting
depicting the North Portico of the White House. The design was by
artist Ray Ellis of Martha's Vineyard, Mass. Ellis, known for his
watercolor and oil landscapes, also designed the 1998 White House
holiday card, which featured a watercolor painting of the State
Dining Room.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokeswoman Marsha Berry said the White House was
chosen as the subject both years ``to pay tribute to an American
treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   The '99 message: ``Our family wishes you and yours a blessed
holiday season filled with treasured memories of past traditions
and joy and peace in the new millennium.'' It was signed by the
president and first lady and embossed with the presidential seal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife and I were born in the '50s, graduated from high
school in the '60's, finished college in the '70s, got married in
the '80s, and turned middle age in the '90s. Now we're looking
forward to retirement in the ??s. That's the question: When we talk
about this decade, exactly how do we specify it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Way back in 1993, Futurist magazine, which was living up to
its name, conducted a readership poll on this very issue. As you
might imagine, there was no definitive conclusion. And there seems
to be none now.
</P>
<P>
   Most futurists (64 percent) voted for ``the two-thousands.''
Individual years would be pronounced ``two-thousand-one, two-
thousand-two,'' and so on. Meanwhile, an additional 9 percent of
the futurists said they wanted to see the decade dubbed the
``twenty-ths.'' Five percent went for ``the oh-ohs,'' and an equal
percentage chose ``the double-ohs.'' Four percent went for ``the
zeros.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Simon Collier, chairman of the history department
at Vanderbilt University, ``the two thousands'' moniker most
closely reflects past traditions surrounding turns of the
centuries. ``With the years 1900 to 1909, we would always have
called those `the ninteen hundreds,' '' Collier said. But he
pointed out a complication: ``What's happened is that in the
English language, the terms `eighteen hundreds' or `nineteen
hundreds' have come to mean the whole century, rather than the
centuries' first decades.''
</P>
<P>
   So let's wait and see how the debate unfolds, as it most surely
will, now that the future is here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the expression ``Trip the light fantastic'' mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It means ``to dance gaily,'' explains the Morris Dictionary
of Word and Phrase Origins. It comes from Milton's poem
``L'Allegro'' and begins ``Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee
Jest and youthful Jollity.'' Further on is this: ``Sport that
wrinkled Care derides,/ and Laughter holding both his sides./ Come,
and trip it as ye go/ On the light fantastic toe.''
</P>
<P>
   But the expression gained its greatest popularity in the lyrics
of ``The Sidewalks of New York'': ``Boys and girls together, me and
Mamie O'Rourke,/ Tripped the light fantastic on the sidewalks of
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the broadcasts of New Year's Eve festivities from
around the world, it was reported that midnight in Newfoundland is
10:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Aren't all time zones one hour
apart?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. While most are one hour apart, there are exceptions.
World Book Encyclopedia explains that because it differs from its
neighboring zones by only a half-hour, the Newfoundland Time Zone
is not a ``true'' standard time zone.
</P>
<P>
   Other half-hour-zone situations exist in Pitcairn Island,
Norfolk Island, the Marquesas Islands and the Cook Islands, all in
the South Pacific; central Australia; the Andaman and Nicobar
islands, in the Andaman Sea south of Myanmar (the former Burma);
Sri Lanka; and India. And there are others.
</P>
<P>
   Nepal offers yet a different exception, of just 10 minutes. When
it's 5 o'clock in Karachi, Pakistan, the time is 5:30 in India, its
neighbor to the east. But it's 5:40 in Nepal, which is on India's
northeastern border.
</P>

powers. As such, they can _ and do _ change their timekeeping
systems as they see fit. So no universal rules apply.

   World Book Encyclopedia, in the T volume (look under Time), has

<P>
   Q: I've been saving all my lottery tickets because I was told
that if I ever won, I could use the non-winning tickets as an
offset on my tax liability. Is this true? I have a lot of unlucky
tickets in shoeboxes that I'd like to throw away if this is just a
hoax.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can toss those boxes of losing tickets for previous
years. Only those that were losers in the year in which you win the
lottery are deductible, said IRS spokesman Eric Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Leap year occurs every four years to adjust for the fact that
we circle the sun approximately every 365 1/4 days, so we add one
day every four years to account for that discrepancy. I remember
reading that this adjustment is too much, and that once every 400
years, we're not supposed to have a leap year. I thought 2000 was
one of those times, but all the 2000 calendars I have seen show a
Feb. 29. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the Gregorian calendar, which is the civil
calendar in use today, years evenly divisible by 4 are leap years,
with the exception of centurial years that are not evenly divisible
by 400. Therefore, the years 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2100 are not leap
years, but 1600, 2000 and 2400 are.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q : A question on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' recently
asked whose jurisdiction the U.S. Coast Guard was under. The answer
was the Department of Transportation. When did it change from the
Treasury Department?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most recent change occurred on April 1, 1967, when the
DOT was formed. Before that, control of the Coast Guard _ an
amalgamation of five formerly distinct federal services _ had been
changed a number of times.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard was formed under that name on Jan. 28, 1915,
when the Life-Saving Service and Revenue Cutter Service were
combined. The Revenue Cutter Service was created in 1790. The
Life-Saving Service was an independent bureau of the Treasury
Department. On April 6, 1917, with the declaration of war against
Germany, the Coast Guard was transferred to the Navy Department. On
Aug. 28, 1919, it reverted to the Treasury Department. On Nov. 1,
1941, it was transferred back to the Navy Department. On Jan. 1,
1946, it returned to the Treasury Department. And then, 21 years
later, it made its change to the Transportation Department, where
it remains to date.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The incident involving Atlanta Braves relief pitcher John
Rocker's controversial comments in Sports Illustrated reminds me of
that famous quote: ``I may not agree with anything that you say,
but I will defend to the death your right to say it.'' Who first
said that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some sources attribute the statement _ ``I disapprove of what
you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it'' _ to
French philosopher Voltaire (1694-1778). But the Oxford Dictionary
of Quotations said the words, in fact, are S.G. Tallentyre's
summary of his attitude toward Claude Adrien Helvetius after the
condemnation and burning by the French parliament of Helvetius'
book ``De l'Esprit'' in 1759.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A brief announcement on TV said the nuclear submarine Topeka
was at the international dateline at midnight Dec. 31 so its crew
could be the first people to welcome the new year. I didn't see or
hear anything else about it. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Pearl Harbor-based Navy sub was straddling the
international dateline 400 feet below the surface of the Pacific at
the stroke of midnight Dec. 31, meaning its bow was in one year and
its stern in another. It also was straddling the equator, meaning
it was in both the northern and southern hemispheres.
</P>
<P>
   The sub's commanding officer, Cmdr. Mark Patton of Cheyenne,
Wyo., said the Topeka's positioning was intended to demonstrate the
Navy's confidence that it was ready to handle the so-called Y2K
computer bug, and not a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   The 360-foot-long sub, with a crew of 130, used sophisticated
satellite positioning technology to determine the proper location.
Up above, boats of various sizes circled the area.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article Dec. 31 reported that Sarah Knauss, the world's
oldest living person, had died at 119. Who is now the oldest living
person, and what is the age?
</P>
<P>
   A: Researchers at Guinness Book of World Records are trying to
track down several people who would inherit the title, Guinness
spokeswoman Louise Wilson, in London, told Q&AMP;A. They include a
woman in Poland who is said to be 118, and a man in Oregon who may
be 111.
</P>
<P>
   Until their ages are authenticated _ meaning that a birth
certificate or other undisputed proof of age is provided to the
researchers _ the oldest authenticated person is a Scottish woman,
Marget Eaton McHowat, 107, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   McHowat was born as Marget Eaton Webster on Dec. 4, 1892, in
Brechin, Scotland. She became the oldest living person in Scotland
in April 1999. The eldest child of David and Marget Webster, she
was married to Robert McHowat from 1923 until his death in 1957.
They had two children, Margaret Jean (1926-71) and Irene Anne (born
in 1930 and still living).
</P>
<P>
   Outliving both her brother and sister (who died at 94 and 71,
respectively), and reaching a greater age than her parents (78 and
82), Marget McHowat claims never having a day's illness in her
life, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A list of notable deaths in 1999 included the name of
Elizabeth Guthrie Foster. Is that the author of the children's book
``Gigi,'' about a merry-go-round horse?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Elizabeth Guthrie Foster, who died Nov. 4 at age 86, was
the first woman to head the Atlanta College of Art. She also was a
fellow in the National Association of Schools of Art and Design.
</P>
<P>
   The Elizabeth Foster who wrote the children's book about Gigi, a
horse on the Prater in Vienna when World War I broke out, was born
in Cleveland in 1905 and died in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My Bermuda grass has some pesky weeds I want to kill. I
understand that applying Round-up on dormant, brown Bermuda grass
in the winter will not harm the grass come spring. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. But there's an important condition, said Gil Landry a
turfgrass specialist with the University of Georgia Extension
Service's Experiment Station in Griffin. You must be certain the
grass is totally dormant, meaning there must be no green leaves
beneath the canopy. A grass often appears dormant on the top,
Landry explained, but when you look into the canopy or below the
top leaves, you can find green leaves. If that's the case, don't
apply the Round-up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a reprint of that famous photo of accordionist Graham
Jackson, with tears in his eyes, taken at the time of President
Franklin Roosevelt's death at the Little White House in Georgia.
Whatever became of him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jackson died in January 1983 at the age of 80. He drew
national attention in April 1945 when he was photographed by Life
magazine while playing ``Going Home'' at Warm Springs, Ga., after
FDR died.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain a Latin phrase in Larry McMurtry's ``Lonesome
Dove''? It is this: Uva uvam vivendo varia fit.
</P>
<P>
   A: Many interpretations have been offered by various Latin
scholars. Perhaps the one most agree on was offered first in 1988
by an unnamed Latin language instructor at San Diego State
University, who called it a ``pseudo'' Latin phrase: ``A grape
matures by looking at another grape.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Los Angeles Public Library, McMurtry himself
provided this same translation. In explanation, the library
suggested that McMurtry probably had begun with a self-composed
proverb in English, and ``fractured it a bit'' in attempting to
convert it to Latin.
</P>
<P>
   The literal translation, by the way, is something like this:
(The) versatile grape becomes a grape by living.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter-in-law received a ``pea coat'' for Christmas. We
think the name derives from the Navy in World War II, but we aren't
sure. Do you know the origin?
</P>
<P>
   A: The original ``P'' coat was issued by the Navy before World
War II. The ``P'' stands for ``pilot,'' referring to a ship's
navigator, not an aviator. You'll see it spelled as two words (pea
coat) or one (peacoat), or it might be called a ``pea jacket.'' By
whatever name, it remains a classic fashion statement. The
traditional style calls for eight buttons, in two rows, and a wide,
deeply notched collar. It's waist-length or slightly longer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent question about Al Gore referred to his Army
``enlistment.'' Somewhere I had gotten the impression that Gore
served as an officer. If so, your reference to ``enlistment'' is
inaccurate. I see this mistake frequently in various publications,
and I hear it on the air from time to time. Am I correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gore wasn't an officer, although he had graduated from
Harvard and could have chosen to train as an officer candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As widely reported for years, Gore volunteered for enlistment in
the Army after graduating in 1969, even though _ again, as widely
reported _ he was opposed to U.S. involvement in Vietnam and worked
in the campaign of anti-war presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy.
After he arrived in Vietnam, Spec. 5 Gore served seven months as a
reporter with the noncombat 20th Engineering Battalion, stationed
outside Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   You can check his background online at several sites, including
that of the nonpartisan Project Vote Smart
(http://www.vote-smart.org). You also can get biographical
information at Gore's official Web sites,
www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/index.html and
www.AlGore2000.com/gorefamily/gorefamily.html).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently was asked if Al Gore had enlisted in the Army
rather than having served as an officer. The person asking the
question said he had seen and heard it reported in the media that
Gore had enlisted, adding that this was a mistake. What do you call
it if he was an officer, if it's not an ``enlisted man''?
</P>
<P>
   A: A commissioned officer in the military has chosen to train
for appointment to a position of authority (``an officer''), but he
or she is not considered to have ``enlisted.'' This is the
definition of ``enlisted man'' (or ``enlisted person'') in
Webster's New World Dictionary: ``any person in the armed forces
who is not a commissioned officer or warrant officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore wasn't an officer, although he would have been eligible to
enter officer training _ if he chose to do so _ after graduation
from Harvard University. He didn't.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Exactly what does it mean to say a lake is ``dead'' because
of pollution caused by toxic waste?
</P>
<P>
   A: It means a lake has become ``eutrophic.'' Eutrophic is a
technical term defined as ``pertaining to a lake containing a high
concentration of dissolved nutrients, either by natural means or
pollution, with periods of oxygen deficiency.'' When oxygen is
depleted, fish and other aquatic life are choked.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the cause of death of Wendy's CEO Gordon Teter ever
determined? An article mentioning his death reported that an
autopsy was planned, but I didn't see anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Initial reports indicated that Teter, 56, died of natural
causes on Dec. 18. A spokeswoman at the coroner's office in
Columbus, Ohio, told Q&AMP;A that autopsy reports typically aren't
available until six or eight weeks after death.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the reports I've seen about the influenza virus
spreading across the United States, there has been no mention of
the specific type. Some types are treatable and covered by current
vaccines. Is this one of them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The predominant influenza strain circulating this winter
is A Sydney. It was the strain anticipated by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, so people receiving the vaccine
this season ``should be pretty well protected,'' said CDC spokesman
Tom Skinner. And even if they contract flu, their symptoms should
be lessened.
</P>
<P>
   While the CDC has monitored increased flu activity nationwide in
the past few weeks, many different types of virus can cause upper
respiratory tract infections that may resemble flu, Skinner added.
So what people may think is flu could be something else.
</P>
<P>
   For people considered to be in ``high risk'' categories _ older
than 65, or residents of nursing homes or other closed
environments, or those with chronic heart and lung conditions _
Skinner emphasized the CDC's concern about having flu vaccinations
every year: ``This is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw the final half of the movie adaptation of
Tennessee Williams' ``Baby Doll'' on AMC. Since the cast wasn't
listed at the end, can you tell me who played the title role, what
other pictures she was in, and if she's still living?
</P>
<P>
   A: The baby doll in the steamy movie _ considered notorious when
it was released in 1956 _ was portrayed by Carroll Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Doll'' was Baker's second film. The role branded her as a
sexpot. As a result, her career was most vividly marked by her work
in it and other once-controversial productions, such as ``The
Carpetbaggers'' and ``Harlow.'' But she also appeared in ``The Big
Country,'' ``Giant,'' ``Mister Moses,'' ``How the West Was Won,''
``Cheyenne Autumn,'' ``Ironweed,'' ``Kindergarten Cop,'' ``Watcher
in the Woods'' and ``The Game,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   At last report the 68-year-old grandmother _ her daughter has
three children _ was married to British actor Donald Burton and
living in Los Angeles. Baker continues to turn up from time to time
in made-for-TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I didn't see anything about the White House greeting cards
sent by President and Mrs. Clinton, but David Letterman said on his
program that he received one. Can you share any details with us?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1999 card featured a rendering of a watercolor painting
depicting the North Portico of the White House. The design was by
artist Ray Ellis of Martha's Vineyard, Mass. Ellis, known for his
watercolor and oil landscapes, also designed the 1998 White House
holiday card, which featured a watercolor painting of the State
Dining Room.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokeswoman Marsha Berry said the White House was
chosen as the subject both years ``to pay tribute to an American
treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   The '99 message: ``Our family wishes you and yours a blessed
holiday season filled with treasured memories of past traditions
and joy and peace in the new millennium.'' It was signed by the
president and first lady and embossed with the presidential seal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife and I were born in the '50s, graduated from high
school in the '60's, finished college in the '70s, got married in
the '80s, and turned middle age in the '90s. Now we're looking
forward to retirement in the ??s. That's the question: When we talk
about this decade, exactly how do we specify it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Way back in 1993, Futurist magazine, which was living up to
its name, conducted a readership poll on this very issue. As you
might imagine, there was no definitive conclusion. And there seems
to be none now.
</P>
<P>
   Most futurists (64 percent) voted for ``the two-thousands.''
Individual years would be pronounced ``two-thousand-one, two-
thousand-two,'' and so on. Meanwhile, an additional 9 percent of
the futurists said they wanted to see the decade dubbed the
``twenty-ths.'' Five percent went for ``the oh-ohs,'' and an equal
percentage chose ``the double-ohs.'' Four percent went for ``the
zeros.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Simon Collier, chairman of the history department
at Vanderbilt University, ``the two thousands'' moniker most
closely reflects past traditions surrounding turns of the
centuries. ``With the years 1900 to 1909, we would always have
called those `the ninteen hundreds,' '' Collier said. But he
pointed out a complication: ``What's happened is that in the
English language, the terms `eighteen hundreds' or `nineteen
hundreds' have come to mean the whole century, rather than the
centuries' first decades.''
</P>
<P>
   So let's wait and see how the debate unfolds, as it most surely
will, now that the future is here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the expression ``Trip the light fantastic'' mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It means ``to dance gaily,'' explains the Morris Dictionary
of Word and Phrase Origins. It comes from Milton's poem
``L'Allegro'' and begins ``Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee
Jest and youthful Jollity.'' Further on is this: ``Sport that
wrinkled Care derides,/ and Laughter holding both his sides./ Come,
and trip it as ye go/ On the light fantastic toe.''
</P>
<P>
   But the expression gained its greatest popularity in the lyrics
of ``The Sidewalks of New York'': ``Boys and girls together, me and
Mamie O'Rourke,/ Tripped the light fantastic on the sidewalks of
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the broadcasts of New Year's Eve festivities from
around the world, it was reported that midnight in Newfoundland is
10:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Aren't all time zones one hour
apart?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. While most are one hour apart, there are exceptions.
World Book Encyclopedia explains that because it differs from its
neighboring zones by only a half-hour, the Newfoundland Time Zone
is not a ``true'' standard time zone.
</P>
<P>
   Other half-hour-zone situations exist in Pitcairn Island,
Norfolk Island, the Marquesas Islands and the Cook Islands, all in
the South Pacific; central Australia; the Andaman and Nicobar
islands, in the Andaman Sea south of Myanmar (the former Burma);
Sri Lanka; and India. And there are others.
</P>
<P>
   Nepal offers yet a different exception, of just 10 minutes. When
it's 5 o'clock in Karachi, Pakistan, the time is 5:30 in India, its
neighbor to the east. But it's 5:40 in Nepal, which is on India's

</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. Naval Observatory says, nations are sovereign

systems as they see fit. So no universal rules apply.
</P>
<P>
   World Book Encyclopedia, in the T volume (look under Time), has
a two-page map of all zones. An accompanying table compares times
all over the globe. It's worth a trip to the library.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been saving all my lottery tickets because I was told
that if I ever won, I could use the non-winning tickets as an
offset on my tax liability. Is this true? I have a lot of unlucky
tickets in shoeboxes that I'd like to throw away if this is just a
hoax.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can toss those boxes of losing tickets for previous
years. Only those that were losers in the year in which you win the
lottery are deductible, said IRS spokesman Eric Roberts.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Toss out the old, try a taste of the new in your kitchen
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's a brand new year _ a perfect time
for a fresh start in the kitchen. Start by embracing the winter
bounty of juicy oranges and sweet stone crabs. Kick off the century
with a sensible diet. Be adventurous and add new ingredients to
your pantry. While you're at it, get rid of those ancient spices
and clean the fridge! It will make cooking a pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   FRESH FROM FLORIDA:
</P>
<P>
   These foods, wonderful in their essence, also work well in
creative dishes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Signature fruits _ the citrus family _ are in their glory now.
Cut them up, juice them, or leave them whole in a lovely dessert
that features spun caramel threads.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stone crab claws, the tempting sweet crustaceans, are a luxury
treat through May, when their season ends. You have a choice of
appetizer-sized jumbos or the mediums. Make your own garlic dip for
a new treat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Red, ripe tomatoes are in fields ready for picking. Why not
preserve some this year to have the rest of the season? Make tomato
sauce and freeze it _ no canning needed. And the best part: You can
control the additives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Luscious strawberries will be in markets soon. Desserts are a
natural with this berry, but try a salad for something fresh. We
like spinach and red onion with berries, and a balsamic vinaigrette
over all.
</P>
<P>
   _ Corn in winter? You bet. For the up-and-down winter weather,
whip up a stew, hearty with beef, tomatoes and corn. It's a meal in
a pot and you don't even have to cut the kernels off the cobs.
</P>
<P>
   What's a New Year's without a dieting resolution? This year,
stick with the basics:
</P>
<P>
   _ Strive for the recommended ``five-a-day'' fruits and veggies.
Eat two of them raw _ to eliminate fat and calories added by
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Drink water daily _ most experts suggest eight 8-ounce glasses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat breakfast as a true meal. Try to get at least three of the
major food groups in: eggs or some protein; oatmeal or whole-grain
cereal; some fruit or juice. You can lose weight by adding this
meal, since you won't be so hungry at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get your vitamins either from nutrient-rich foods, or from
supplements. Learn what your body needs and tailor your supplements
to you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exercise at any age: It keeps muscles and bones in shape and
it can increase weight-loss results by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   FRESHEN YOUR PANTRY:
</P>
<P>
   _ Add soy _ it's the hot new food for the millennium, said to be
one of the healthiest. Tofu is soy _ so is soy sauce, soy milk and
soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try a new flavor of oil or vinegar. It doesn't take much of
either to add flavor to food, but it can change a dish radically.
Learn to deglaze a pan with vinegar or finish a soup with a dribble
of oil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go Asian: Change your spice cabinet from Mediterranean and add
fish sauce, too. Basil's run its course. Try citrus peel, ginger,
cardamom, cayenne and cinnamon in main dishes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Toss out the tired old pasta, rice and potatoes, and move to
new sides such as couscous or quinoa or bulghur wheat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add anchovy paste. This small change can open up an ocean of
new cooking possibilities. Meats, sauces, dips and marinades
benefit from this humble fish.
</P>
<P>
   FIVE WAYS TO CLEAN AND ORGANIZE YOUR KITCHEN:
</P>
<P>
   _ Clean out that fridge! Toss the holiday pickles and fruitcakes
from the year before last. Use vinegar to wash the inside walls and
drawers for a clean smell.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a date: Buy several permanent markers and start marking
the date of purchase on food cans, boxes and frozen items. Start
rotating your stock to use the oldest first.
</P>
<P>
   _ De-bug your spice cabinets. If you have spices and herbs older
than six months, chuck them _ you won't lose any flavors! Replace,
and get busy marking them with date of purchase.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reassess those messy utensil drawers. Gadgets are no good if
you don't use them _ toss out the useless things. Real chefs don't
rummage around for tools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clean filters and disposals. Your stove fan has a filter
that's best cleaned with straight ammonia. Pour a bleach solution (
1/4 cup per gallon of water) down the sink disposal with the water
running.

 &HT;    Hashing it out: The forgotten staple of yesteryear is just as
good today
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you think you're too time-pressed to fix
dinner, consider your grandmother, who didn't have a microwave,
dishwasher or a cupboard full of convenience foods at her
fingertips. Now, there was a woman who had to work to get dinner on
the table.
</P>
<P>
   And she had some pretty good ideas about how to do it as
efficiently as possible. Sometimes she made a hash of it.
Literally.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that today's cooks have forgotten about the simple
supper called hash. At its most basic, hash is nothing more than
cooked meat or chicken _ the leftovers from Sunday's roast cut up
into little pieces _ plus potatoes and onion. Cook the mixture in a
little butter until crisp, and that's hash. New Englanders put
beets in their beef hash and called it red flannel hash, and they
sometimes made hash with fresh codfish, but neither version had a
place in homes in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are variables. Depending on what was on hand,
some cooks added green pepper or mushrooms. As comfort cooking has
made a comeback, chefs have made upscale versions of hash,
substituting smoked salmon for beef and adding lots of seasonings
that Grandma never kept on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The potatoes can be raw or cooked, peeled or not; the meat,
potatoes and onion can be chopped by hand, ground in a meat grinder
or chopped in a food processor. Purists insist on chopping them by
hand.
</P>
<P>
   And as cookbook author James McNair points out, there are two
basic versions of hash: one is crisp, the other is soft.
</P>
<P>
   For a refresher course, we turned back the clock to older
cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old edition of Joy of Cooking passed down at this
newspaper makes hash using leftover gravy. One recipe for a quick
hash calls for a can of cream of mushroom soup and a cup of
frankfurters, which could destroy your faith in that book forever.
</P>
<P>
   The late James Beard, the dean of American cookery, offers
homage to recipes for beef and chicken hash in his book
appropriately named American Cookery. They are traditional
no-nonsense recipes, with nothing more unusual than a grinding of
nutmeg or a touch of cream. But even Beard offers a quick corned
beef hash recipe that begins with a can of corned beef and a can of
corned beef hash.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have never tasted hash _ except from a can _ we
offer two basic versions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In his most recent book, ``James McNair's Favorites''
(Chronicle, $29.95), the author offers a recipe for corned beef
made from scratch. Leftover corned beef brisket is cut into thin
strips. Potatoes are cooked fresh and cut into strips. Red bell
pepper is added to the mixture, along with some garlic. Seasonings
include Worcestershire sauce and thyme. It may not be for weekday
cooks but it makes a fine Sunday supper.
</P>
<P>
   Note that the beef, potatoes and peppers are cut into similar
sized strips rather than cubed in the traditional fashion. If
you're starting from scratch, cook the corned beef in simmering
water, figuring on
</P>
<P>
   1 hour per pound.
</P>
<P>
   NEW FASHIONED CORNED BEEF HASH
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 pound cooked red potatoes, unpeeled
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sliced onion
</P>
<P>
   2 red bell peppers, stemmed, seeded and cut into thin strips
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 cups cooked corned beef
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   salt
</P>
<P>
   freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped fresh flat leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   Cut the cooked potatoes into narrow strips and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet, heat the oil and two tablespoons of the
butter. Add onion and sweet pepper, and cook over medium heat,
stirring frequently, until vegetables are very soft but not
browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook a minute
longer. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, the reserved
potatoes, corned beef, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, as well as salt
and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, to bring up
browned bits of the crust (easily done with a spatula). When
browned bits are well incorporated in the hash, stir in the parsley
and press down to allow the hash brown fully on bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Serve on warmed plates. If desired, top with a poached egg.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use either leftover beef or corned beef for this recipe. Even
accomplished cooks favor serving the hash with ketchup, though
Beard favored bottled chili sauce _ slightly warmed. Top with
poached eggs for a traditional hash supper.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSIC SKILLET BROWNED HASH
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups cooked meat
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cubes raw potatoes, with or without skins
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, diced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   With a sharp knife, cut the meat into small pieces. Combine the
meat, potatoes and onion in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.
Turn into a hot, well-greased skilled. Cook over medium-low heat
until a crust forms on the bottom. Use a spatula to turn the hash
and brown the other side. Stir it from time to time to let the hash
brown throughout. Shortly before it is done, pat it down firmly to
form an unbroken cake. This will require a half-hour cooking in
all. Serve with chili sauce or ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   Note: A little cream added toward the end of the cooking process
helps the browning and eliminates any dryness.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For a contemporary version of hash, consider Elisabeth Rozin's
recipe for Curried Turkey Hash. It's from her bookBlue Corn and
Chocolate (Knopf, $25), which is devoted to native American
resources such as turkey. She combines cumin, turmeric, fenugreek,
ginger and ground coriander to make a curry seasoning. If you don't
have fenugreek, just leave it out. You can also experiment using
curry powder, which already is a mix of those spices.
</P>
<P>
   CURRIED TURKEY HASH
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 to 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon turmeric
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fenugreek
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon coriander
</P>
<P>
   3 cups finely chopped cooked turkey
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 cups diced cooked potato
</P>
<P>
   2 large stalks celery, finely diced
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup light cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chicken or turkey stock
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   several dashes Tabasco sauce
</P>
<P>
   several grinds black pepper
</P>
<P>
   In a small skillet, saute the onion in the butter until just
wilted. Add the cumin, turmeric, fenugreek, ginger and coriander
and cook, stirring, another few minutes. In a large bowl combine
the turkey, potato and celery. Scraped the spiced onion mixture
into the turkey mixture and blend thoroughly. The recipe can be
made ahead to this point and refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl whisk the egg lightly. Stir in the cream, stock
and the remaining seasonings. Blend thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Generously butter a large shallow casserole or baking dish,
approximately 9 by 13 inches. Spoon the turkey mixture into the
casserole, pressing down and smoothing with a spatula. Pour the egg
mixture over the turkey. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until set and
lightly browned.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago Daytonians looking for an early a.m. bite to eat
stopped in at the Purple Cow restaurant, in the old Miami Hotel,
recently demolished as part of the Lazarus implosion. A favorite
was corned beef hash and eggs. All they did was cut a slice from
canned corned beef hash, brown it and top with a poached egg.
</P>
<P>
   This quick version also relies on canned corned beef hash, but
James Beard jazzed it up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   JAMES BEARD'S QUICK CORNED BEEF HASH
</P>
<P>
   1 can corned beef
</P>
<P>
   1 can corned beef hash
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons butter or beef drippings
</P>
<P>
   Chop the canned corned beef rather coarsely and combine with the
corned beef hash and chopped onion. Heat the butter or drippings in
a heavy skillet and cook the hash, pressing it down well to start a
crust. Scrape the bottom with a spatula and bring some of the crisp
bits to the top. Continue doing this until the crusty and soft
parts are equally mixed. Then let the bottom crust uniformly.
</P>
<P>
   Serve as is or top with poached eggs.

</P>
<P>
   Use pasteurized eggs for this recipe as a safety measure, or use
commercial mayonnaise according to the directions that follow.
</P>
<P>
   GARLIC MAYONNAISE
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup fresh bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1whole egg
</P>
<P>
   1egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   2whole cloves of garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8teaspoon hot Hungarian paprika (or use cayenne)
</P>
<P>
   1/4teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4cups extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Moisten the bread crumbs with 3 tablespoons water. Squeeze all
of the water out and set aside. Place the egg, the yolk and garlic
in the bowl of a food processor. Blend until the egg is light and
frothy and the garlic is minced. Add the lemon juice, salt,
paprika, mustard and bread crumbs. Blend until the mixture is
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   With the processor running, add the olive oil in a slow, steady
stream through the feed tube. Stop the machine, scrape down the
sides of the bowl, then blend again. Adjust the seasoning to taste.

<P>
   To make with commercial mayonnaise: Combine 2 cups of
store-bought mayonnaise with 2 teaspoons chopped garlic, 1/8
teaspoon Hungarian paprika and 1/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard.

Books, 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   The following recipe will bring out the natural flavor of
oranges, but be forewarned_ it should be made on a nonhumid day to
prevent the sugar from melting off the oranges.
</P>
<P>
   GLACEED ORANGES
</P>
<P>
   12seedless navel oranges of good color
</P>
<P>
   4cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2cups water
</P>
<P>
   With an orange peel stripper, strip 20 or so pieces of peel from
the oranges. Immerse the peels in boiling water for 5 minutes, then
drain and cool. Peel the rest of the oranges, using a very sharp
knife. Remove all rind and membrane.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the sugar and water together in a heavy saucepan. Do not
stir. When sugar is dissolved, cover pan and boil for 5 minutes.
Remove cover. Syrup should be clear. Continue cooking to the hard
ball stage (250 degrees on a candy thermometer).
</P>
<P>
   Lower heat and, working quickly, dip each orange in the syrup,
using sharp pronged forks. Stack oranges in a serving dish.
</P>
<P>
   When all the oranges have been dipped, add the peels to the
syrup and cook over low heat 3 minutes. Remove the peels to an
oiled surface to cool. Keep pieces separate and use to decorate the
glazed oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: To make the spun sugar netting over the oranges, dip a
fork in the hot sugar-syrup and drizzle back and forth over the
oranges quickly. As it hardens, the syrup will form the fine,
fragile threads. Do not refrigerate, as this will cause the threads
to soften and melt. Take care when working with this and all hot
sugar mixtures; they will stick to the skin, causing serious burns.

 &HT;    Weighing carefully the vino varieties

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Post-millennium musings:
</P>
<P>
   I was able to take some time off from work over the holidays,
and during that period, I tasted and slurped up some wonderful,
awesome, just really fine wines. Some were mine, but the best
fermented juice to cross my tongue belonged to friends generous
enough to share wines for which they paid, quite frankly, a pretty
penny. Tasting them reminded me of a question I've heard repeatedly
posed to wine sellers and tasters about expensive wines: ``Are they
worth that much more? Is a $50 wine really 10 times better than a
$5 bottle?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: No, of course not. And, the answer is: Well,
maybe.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to quantify the enjoyment of wine, or food, or
anything sensual, but for the sake of argument, let's say that a
$50 bottle of wine is 20 percent better than the $5 bottle. For
most folks, that price-to-quality ratio isn't going to make any
sense; they'll gladly take 10 bottles of the inexpensive wine. But
for others, that 20 percent boost in taste sensation or overall
enjoyment could well be worth a tenfold price increase, even if it
makes the logical, accounting-conscious part of our brain blanch.
(After all, it's that party-pooper-but-sensible part of the brain a
lot of folks ignored when they bought their millennium celebration
Champagnes and wines for their New Year's Eve events.)
</P>
<P>
   I was trying to pin down what made one particular wine _ it was
a 1982 Chateau Margaux _ that I shared recently (it wasn't mine,
alas) so special. And I'm not sure this captures it, but it comes
close, at least for me. Sure, the wine ``tasted good'' _ a lot of
wines do. But this was a wine that virtually commanded your
attention, grabbed you by the collar (subtly) and told you it was
special. I was carrying on a conversation with a friend while I
took a sip of the wine. A half-minute or so after I had swallowed
it, I could still taste the wine's flavors. In waves. At one point,
I stopped in midsentence and uttered something scholarly and
erudite, as only a wine columnist can, something like, ``Whoa!''
</P>
<P>
   It was good juice. And it was telling me, ``I'm special. You
can't ignore me.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it doesn't have to be an '82 Margaux in your glass to
capture that spirit. Depending on the atmosphere, the food, the
company, the circumstances, a far less expensive wine can push the
same buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, I advocate taking wine off its pedestal,
reminding folks it is at its core an agricultural product produced
by grape farmers and should not be treated with such reverence or
snootiness that it ends up intimidating people. But every once in a
while, I'm reminded there's a little bit of magic in wine, a magic
that, once experienced, is not easily forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a ``Whoa!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wine of the week: 1999 Altos Malbec Las Hormigas, $9.99: Yes,
a '99 for $9.99. This delicious red wine hails from Argentina,
which takes the Malbec grape that is used in small quantities in
Bordeaux blends to great heights. This wine isn't a nouveau _
remember, the folks in the Southern Hemisphere have summers during
our winter and vice versa, so this wine was harvested and fermented
in March and April of last year. It's jam-packed with fruit and has
enough spiciness to add interest (and maybe a little bit of that
aforementioned magic). Dry reds for less than $10 don't get any
better than this.

 &HT;    Perez always delivered
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ John Bench was flashy. He hit home runs in
bunches, and even his foul home runs were majestic. He threw
runners out with a gun of an arm that could have been mounted on a
battleship.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Morgan was flashy. He had every skill God could give a
ballplayer. He hit for average and for power. He ran like
Secretariat. He could field and he could throw. And he had this
flapping-elbow deal going in the batters' box that set him even
farther apart.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose was flashy. He was a hitting machine. He did
everything at 100 mph. He dived into bases on his face. He would
run over his grandmother if it meant a victory. He finished every
game with the dirtiest uniform in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Perez was not flashy. Perez was a river on a July day when
it hadn't rained in a month. He was placid. Is Tony breathing? Is
he not? You could never tell.
</P>
<P>
   That was both the upside and the downside of Tony Perez.
</P>
<P>
   You knew as you watched them that Bench, Morgan and Rose were
first-ballot Hall of Famers. You never got that feeling when you
watched Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the doubt was removed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the announcement finally came: On his ninth try,
Atanasio Rigal Perez was elected to baseball's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   I called a man who saw most of Perez's at-bats in Tony's 13
seasons as a Red. Jim Ferguson was the Reds' beat writer at The
Dayton Daily News from 1959-1972, then worked as the Reds public
relations director for another 18 years after that. He's now
director or media relations for Minor League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I tested my theory that one knows a Hall of Famer when one sees
him _ Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Sandy Koufax _ but I never felt that
watching Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it, either, when I watched him,'' he said. ``But
when his career was over, I knew it. It was the cumulative effect
of everything he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Tony was that he delivered and delivered and
delivered and delivered. He wasn't spectacular. If you needed a
single, Tony singled. If you needed a sacrifice fly, Tony got a
sacrifice fly.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes a man in control of his emotions to deliver as Perez
did consistently through his career.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson told a story about that control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was traded after the 1976 season,'' Ferguson said. ``Some
of us were on the Reds' Caribbean Cruise at the time. We stopped at
an island and read about it in the paper. Pete Rose was on the
cruise. Ken Griffey. Bill Plummer. Everybody was stunned. The next
day the cruise ended in San Juan, where Tony lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez had been in the Reds' organization his entire career. But
he handled the trade as if it happened every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was there to meet us when the boat docked and he helped us
get through customs quickly because he pretty much knew everybody
on the island,'' Ferguson said. ``Then he took us out to his condo
and his wife, Pituka, fixed us lunch. We stayed there for six or
seven hours until our plane home. I don't know what was going on
inside Tony, but he was absolutely a great host.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez used that same self-control when he hit with 50,000 fans
screaming and a fastball coming at 94 mph.
</P>
<P>
   I was a doubter, but I can say now without hesitance:
Cooperstown is a better place today than it was yesterday.

wonderful, awesome, just real fine wines. Some were mine, but the
best fermented juice to cross my tongue belonged to friends
generous enough to share wines for which they paid, quite frankly,
a pretty penny. Tasting them reminded me of a question I've heard
repeatedly posed to wine sellers and tasters about expensive wines:
``Are they worth that much more? Is a $50 wine really 10 times
better than a $5 bottle?'' The answer is: No, of course not. And,
the answer is: Well, maybe. (Fisher, Dayton Daily News). 15. MOVED.

   RACIAL PROFILING WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL. Two years ago, most
white people had not heard of racial profiling, such as DWB
(driving or dining while black), and certainly would not publicly
acknowledge that people of color were suspects of crimes simply
because of their race or ethnicity. But with the advent of video
cameras, the Internet and various cable-television stations and
news services, news stories about racial profiling abound. In this
commentary, columnist Akilah Monifa reports on the results of a
recent Gallup telephone poll of 2,006 people, including 1,001
African-Americans, in which those polled were asked what they
thought about racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   THE RETURN OF JUAN SEGUIN _ This week, columnist Juan Gonzalez
reflects on the life of Juan Seguin, the forgotten father of Latino
politics in the United States. Seguin served as both a senator of
the Texas Republic and mayor of San Antonio. Gonzalez believes that
how our nation comes to terms with Seguin's legacy will determine
much about American politics during the 21st century. The reason is
simple: The political influence of Hispanic-Americans is growing at
breakneck speed. For example, between the 1976 and 1996
presidential elections, Hispanic voter registration in the United
States increased 164 percent compared to only 31 percent among
non-Hispanics. ``Descendants of Juan Seguin _ who will number one
out of every four Americans by 2050 _ are finally ready to write a
new chapter in the story of American democracy,'' Gonzalez writes.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP FOR `NUEVA AMERICA.' _ Columnist James Garcia has
always been ambivalent about Geraldo Rivera. ``I sometimes wonder
whether his primary objective is to entertain or to inform,'' he
writes. However, Rivera's latest CNBC documentary, ``Nueva
America,'' merits special recognition. It's an important
achievement because it introduces Rivera's largely white mainstream
viewing audience to the nation's fast-growing, increasingly
powerful and diverse Latino community. In this commentary, Garcia
applauds Rivera's work and highlights the documentary's finer
moments.
</P>
<P>
   `SKEWED' VIEWS OF GAMING REVENUES _ Columnist Tim Giago believes
that there is a skewed tendency by charitable foundations and other
contributors to charities and causes to assume that because there
are some Indian nations that have grown wealthy from their gambling
revenues, these tribes should bear the brunt of contributions to
needy Indian programs or institutions. But only 5 percent of gaming
tribes are amassing 90 percent of the gambling revenues. This
means, of course, that 95 percent of the Indian nations are still
struggling to bring jobs, better schools and improved health care
to their people. In this commentary, Giago presents his solutions
to the financial problems and other ills that Native-Americans now
face.
</P>
<P>
   STAYING ON GUARD: A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR'S STORY _ For two
years, Jackie Young missed getting her annual mammogram. ``I was
too busy _ running for office, writing my memoirs, traveling,'' she
writes in this feature from KoreAm Journal. But in January 1998,
when she needed a refill for Premarin, an estrogen pill she had
been taking daily since 1980 after her hysterectomy, her doctor
asked her to undergo a routine checkup. A mammogram was included.
``I was aware of the statistics for women in my age group (I'm 65),
but I thought that being Asian was on my side,'' she writes. ``I
had heard that Asian women had a lower incidence of breast cancer.
And besides, my family had no history of cancer.'' Unfortunately,
the test and a subsequent biopsy confirmed her worst fear: She had
cancer. In this feature, Young describes how she coped with the
diagnosis and treatment. A sidebar titled ``The Facts on Breast
Cancer'' is included.

   RACIAL PROFILING WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL. Two years ago, most
white people had not heard of racial profiling, such as DWB
(driving or dining while black), and certainly would not publicly
acknowledge that people of color were suspects of crimes simply
because of their race or ethnicity. But with the advent of video
cameras, the Internet and various cable-television stations and
news services, news stories about racial profiling abound. In this
commentary, columnist Akilah Monifa reports on the results of a
recent Gallup telephone poll of 2,006 people, including 1,001
African-Americans, in which those polled were asked what they
thought about racial profiling.

   THE RETURN OF JUAN SEGUIN _ This week, columnist Juan Gonzalez
reflects on the life of Juan Seguin, the forgotten father of Latino
politics in the United States. Seguin served as both a senator of
the Texas Republic and mayor of San Antonio. Gonzalez believes that
how our nation comes to terms with Seguin's legacy will determine
much about American politics during the 21st century. The reason is
simple: The political influence of Hispanic-Americans is growing at
breakneck speed. For example, between the 1976 and 1996
presidential elections, Hispanic voter registration in the United
States increased 164 percent compared to only 31 percent among
non-Hispanics. ``Descendants of Juan Seguin _ who will number one
out of every four Americans by 2050 _ are finally ready to write a
new chapter in the story of American democracy,'' Gonzalez writes.

<P>
   THUMBS UP FOR `NUEVA AMERICA.' _ Columnist James Garcia has
always been ambivalent about Geraldo Rivera. ``I sometimes wonder
whether his primary objective is to entertain or to inform,'' he
writes. However, Rivera's latest CNBC documentary, ``Nueva
America,'' merits special recognition. It's an important
achievement because it introduces Rivera's largely white mainstream
viewing audience to the nation's fast-growing, increasingly
powerful and diverse Latino community. In this commentary, Garcia
applauds Rivera's work and highlights the documentary's finer
moments.
</P>
<P>
   `SKEWED' VIEWS OF GAMING REVENUES _ Columnist Tim Giago believes
that there is a skewed tendency by charitable foundations and other
contributors to charities and causes to assume that because there
are some Indian nations that have grown wealthy from their gambling
revenues, these tribes should bear the brunt of contributions to
needy Indian programs or institutions. But only 5 percent of gaming
tribes are amassing 90 percent of the gambling revenues. This
means, of course, that 95 percent of the Indian nations are still
struggling to bring jobs, better schools and improved health care
to their people. In this commentary, Giago presents his solutions
to the financial problems and other ills that Native-Americans now
face.

   STAYING ON GUARD: A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR'S STORY _ For two
years, Jackie Young missed getting her annual mammogram. ``I was
too busy _ running for office, writing my memoirs, traveling,'' she
writes in this feature from KoreAm Journal. But in January 1998,
when she needed a refill for Premarin, an estrogen pill she had
been taking daily since 1980 after her hysterectomy, her doctor
asked her to undergo a routine checkup. A mammogram was included.
``I was aware of the statistics for women in my age group (I'm 65),
but I thought that being Asian was on my side,'' she writes. ``I
had heard that Asian women had a lower incidence of breast cancer.
And besides, my family had no history of cancer.'' Unfortunately,
the test and a subsequent biopsy confirmed her worst fear: She had
cancer. In this feature, Young describes how she coped with the
diagnosis and treatment. A sidebar titled ``The Facts on Breast
Cancer'' is included.

 By EDWARD F. REDISH  
 c.2000 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   A statue, a plaque, a commemorative chair: Most memorials are a
dime a dozen. In this avaricious age, when a country truly wants to
honor its own, it reaches for something with real face value.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five hundred years ago, when the Greeks first made coins
with portraits of people on them, only gods and goddesses were
considered fit for the tribute. A few centuries later, Caesar had
to seize control of the Roman mints before his portrait could
appear on denarii.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long, though, before mere mortals regularly made the
grade: Sir Edmund Hillary is on New Zealand's five-dollar bill,
William Butler Yeats graced the Irish 20-pound note, and Che
Guevara gazes heroically from the Cuban three-peso note.
</P>
<P>
   Now a few countries have taken to honoring worldshakers of
another kind: physicists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 20 physicists who have appeared on bills around
the world (another 250 have appeared on stamps), only a handful are
household names: Copernicus, Curie, Einstein, Galileo and Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Kristian Birkeland, are a bit more obscure.
Birkeland is honored on Norway's 200-krone note for his pioneering
studies of the aurora borealis and Earth's magnetic sphere.
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might quip that the Norwegians must be hard up for
heroes. Couldn't they think of anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   But the Norwegians might just as easily turn that question
around: Is Birkeland any less obscure or influential than Salmon P.
Chase, secretary of the treasury under Abraham Lincoln, who appears
on the American 10,000 dollar bill?
</P>
<P>
   And whence the American fondness for politicians? Benjamin
Franklin is the only scientist who appears on American money, and
he earned the honor by drafting the Constitution, not by theorizing
about electric charges.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time, in other words, for Richard Feynman, Robert
Millikan or Murray Gell-Mann to be fiscally immortalized.
</P>
<P>
   True, the regular denominations are taken. But there is one
obvious candidate for another bill, one worth exactly
$3.14159265358979323846 ...
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; MARIE CURIE (1867-1934) and PIERRE CURIE (1859-1906) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY: French, 500 francs ($81)
</P>
<P>
   CLAIM TO FAME: The Curies were the first couple to win the Nobel
prize (in 1903, for discovering radioactivity); Marie was the first
woman to receive the prize on her own (in 1911, for isolating
radium and polonium) and the first person, man or woman, to win it
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Irene Curie, completed the first Nobel trifecta,
winning the prize for chemistry in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Though Marie was a French citizen, she was born in Poland and
also appeared on the Polish 20,000-zloty note (worth only 83 cents
when last issued, in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ERNEST RUTHERFORD (1871-1937) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY: New Zealand, 100 dollars ($53)
</P>
<P>
   CLAIM TO FAME: A mentor to many of this century's greatest
physicists, Rutherford was the first to show that atoms have a
positively charged nucleus surrounded by a swarm of lighter
particles.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford also discovered thoron (an isotope of radon),
detected alpha and beta rays in uranium radiation, and with his

<P>
   A statue, a plaque, a commemorative chair: Most memorials are a
dime a dozen. In this avaricious age, when a country truly wants to
honor its own, it reaches for something with real face value.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five hundred years ago, when the Greeks first made coins
with portraits of people on them, only gods and goddesses were
considered fit for the tribute. A few centuries later, Caesar had
to seize control of the Roman mints before his portrait could
appear on denarii.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long, though, before mere mortals regularly made the
grade: Sir Edmund Hillary is on New Zealand's five-dollar bill,
William Butler Yeats graced the Irish 20-pound note, and Che
Guevara gazes heroically from the Cuban three-peso note.
</P>
<P>
   Now a few countries have taken to honoring worldshakers of
another kind: physicists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 20 physicists who have appeared on bills around
the world (another 250 have appeared on stamps), only a handful are
household names: Copernicus, Curie, Einstein, Galileo and Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Kristian Birkeland, are a bit more obscure.
Birkeland is honored on Norway's 200-krone note for his pioneering
studies of the aurora borealis and Earth's magnetic sphere.
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might quip that the Norwegians must be hard up for
heroes. Couldn't they think of anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   But the Norwegians might just as easily turn that question
around: Is Birkeland any less obscure or influential than Salmon P.
Chase, secretary of the treasury under Abraham Lincoln, who appears
on the American 10,000 dollar bill?
</P>
<P>
   And whence the American fondness for politicians? Benjamin
Franklin is the only scientist who appears on American money, and
he earned the honor by drafting the Constitution, not by theorizing
about electric charges.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time, in other words, for Richard Feynman, Robert
Millikan or Murray Gell-Mann to be fiscally immortalized.
</P>
<P>
   True, the regular denominations are taken. But there is one
obvious candidate for another bill, one worth exactly
$3.14159265358979323846 ...
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; MARIE CURIE (1867-1934) and PIERRE CURIE (1859-1906) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY: French, 500 francs ($81)
</P>
<P>
   CLAIM TO FAME: The Curies were the first couple to win the Nobel
prize (in 1903, for discovering radioactivity); Marie was the first
woman to receive the prize on her own (in 1911, for isolating
radium and polonium) and the first person, man or woman, to win it
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Irene Curie, completed the first Nobel trifecta,
winning the prize for chemistry in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Though Marie was a French citizen, she was born in Poland and
also appeared on the Polish 20,000-zloty note (worth only 83 cents
when last issued, in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ERNEST RUTHERFORD (1871-1937) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY: New Zealand, 100 dollars ($53)
</P>
<P>
   CLAIM TO FAME: A mentor to many of this century's greatest
physicists, Rutherford was the first to show that atoms have a
positively charged nucleus surrounded by a swarm of lighter
particles.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford also discovered thoron (an isotope of radon),
detected alpha and beta rays in uranium radiation, and with his
research assistant Hans Geiger, helped design what became known as
the Geiger counter.

   Zung Wan Kim, a surgeon in Port Chester, N.Y., preps for surgery
like a prizefighter before a major bout. First he punches a soap
dispenser button with his foot and delivers a low blow to a faucet
switch with his knee. Then he rubs the soap over his hands for more
than a minute and rinses it off with graceful left and right hooks
under the stream of water.
</P>
<P>
   He jabs at his nails with a sterile brush for more than another
minute, rinses, scrubs his hands with a sterile sponge, rinses
again, and then repeats the initial wash and rinse.
</P>
<P>
   Ding! The bell goes off on Kim's timer, ending a full
five-minute ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Seem obsessive? Sure, until you consider that the life of the
hernia patient next door depends on Kim's routine. And recent
events have shown that even ordinary hand-washing may once again
become a matter of getting really sick or staying well.
</P>
<P>
   In August of this year, federal health experts reported that
four children in Minnesota and North Dakota were fatally infected
by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium easily passed through
hand-to-hand contact. A strain of S. aureus has in recent years
become resistant to the popular antibiotic methicillin. Yet any
good hand-washing can still send it down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   Lulled by the success of antibiotics in general, Americans have
come to think of compulsory hand-washing as a thing of the past _ a
holdover from the sterile, hyperhygienic 1950s. But more than half
the staph infections caught by hospital patients are now more
resistant to methicillin (up from 1974), and according to some
epidemiologists, the deaths in Minnesota and North Dakota are just
the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the possible exception of immunization,'' says Ralph
Cordell, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, ``hand washing is the most effective
disease-preventing measure anyone can practice.''
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of just how many bacteria you're carrying around,
consider an interesting experiment performed back in the 1930s by
physician Philip B. Price of Johns Hopkins University. Price set up
14 sterile enamel basins, filled them with warm sterile water and
washed his hands with plain soap for exactly one minute at each
basin.
</P>
<P>
   When he was finished, he totaled up the bacteria in the basins
and estimated their original population on his hands: 4.58 million.
Later studies showed that the full census on a single hand can rise
to as high as 200 million and may include viruses and fungi as well
as bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those organisms, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, are
native to our hands. Known as resident flora, they can cause
disease but more often help prevent it by crowding out and
combating invaders.
</P>
<P>
   The more dangerous bugs are the transients that lurk on faucets
and toilet-flush levers in airport rest rooms, on subway handholds,
on public telephone receivers and between the thumb and forefinger
of the person you shook hands with at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Up close, however, the bad guys don't look much different from
the good guys. For instance, when stained and magnified a hundred
times, S. aureus and S. epidermidis both resemble clusters of
merlot grapes.
</P>
<P>
   But some transients clearly don't belong on your hands. The
intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli OI57:H7 (stains pink, looks
from the side like long-grain rice) causes food poisoning in as
many as 20,000 people a year.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli survives all too well outside the intestines,
particularly on food. Patting contaminated ground beef into a
hamburger, for instance, can leave a residue of about 10 million
disease-causing bacteria on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   The fingertips can offer safe harbor to bacteria for up to an
hour, but they are hardly the best hiding places. Just look at your
palms, Cordell suggests, using a 3-D microscope with a
magnification of about 50. At this scale, the handscape is a
territory filled with hideouts. Cold and flu viruses wait until
your hands come in contact with the delicate membranes in your
nose, eyes or mouth, where they can infiltrate cells and duplicate
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some 400 to 500 sweat glands per square centimeter of skin pour
out moisture onto your palms, irrigating bacteria. The glands have
a shaft leading down through the epidermis, the thickest layer of
the skin, to a mazelike ball where sweat collects. On the backs of
your hands, sebaceous glands and hair follicles make even better
foxholes for bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The safest and most expansive microbial bunkers are under the
fingernails, in ``subungual spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the hand is a continent, the subungual spaces are the
caves,'' says Barry Michaels, a microbiologist with
Georgia-Pacific, which makes paper towels and hygiene products. In
fact, 95 percent of the bacteria found on our hands is under the
fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a full five minutes of washing, researchers estimate,
to flush out, shed or kill 99 percent of the transient organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, even most physicians, still don't wash long enough,
often enough or well enough. In one study a few years ago, doctors
and nurses in an emergency room washed up less than a third of the
time after touching patients. And when they did use soap and water,
the average wash-and-rinse was a mere 9.5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hand washers typically fail to clean their fingernails, thumbs,
the creases in their palms and the backs of their hands. Dominant
hands are often underwashed _ if you're right-handed, your left
hand is usually cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is simple. Start with soap and running water at a
comfortable temperature. (Antimicrobial soaps are unnecessary and
they may help spawn bacteria resistant to antibiotics.)
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the soap hits your skin, islands of grease will begin
to dissolve, exposing dormant viruses and living bacteria. E. coli
and other intestinal transients will get caught up in the tide of
soapy water during the first five seconds of the wash. Plain soap
tears off the outer coating of flu viruses, rendering them inert.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-washing also flushes away yeast and other fungi, and the
grapelike clusters of staph will soon slide away as well.
</P>
<P>
   Keep rubbing your soapy hands for at least 15 seconds before
rinsing. Admittedly, that is likely to seem like a long time. To be
sure you don't give up too soon, hygienists recommend washing for
as long as it takes to sing ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.''
</P>
<P>
   If you do all this, you will wipe out as much as 95 percent of
the organisms that were there before you picked up the soap.

   A statue, a plaque, a commemorative chair: Most memorials are a
dime a dozen. In this avaricious age, when a country truly wants to
honor its own, it reaches for something with real face value.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five hundred years ago, when the Greeks first made coins
with portraits of people on them, only gods and goddesses were
considered fit for the tribute. A few centuries later, Caesar had
to seize control of the Roman mints before his portrait could
appear on denarii.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long, though, before mere mortals regularly made the

William Butler Yeats graced the Irish 20-pound note, and Che
Guevara gazes heroically from the Cuban three-peso note.
</P>
<P>
   Now a few countries have taken to honoring worldshakers of
another kind: physicists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 20 physicists who have appeared on bills around
the world (another 250 have appeared on stamps), only a handful are
household names: Copernicus, Curie, Einstein, Galileo and Newton.
</P>

   A statue, a plaque, a commemorative chair: Most memorials are a
dime a dozen. In this avaricious age, when a country truly wants to
honor its own, it reaches for something with real face value.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five hundred years ago, when the Greeks first made coins
with portraits of people on them, only gods and goddesses were
considered fit for the tribute. A few centuries later, Caesar had
to seize control of the Roman mints before his portrait could
appear on denarii.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long, though, before mere mortals regularly made the
grade: Sir Edmund Hillary is on New Zealand's five-dollar bill,
William Butler Yeats graced the Irish 20-pound note, and Che
Guevara gazes heroically from the Cuban three-peso note.
</P>
<P>
   Now a few countries have taken to honoring worldshakers of
another kind: physicists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 20 physicists who have appeared on bills around
the world (another 250 have appeared on stamps), only a handful are
household names: Copernicus, Curie, Einstein, Galileo and Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Kristian Birkeland, are a bit more obscure.
Birkeland is honored on Norway's 200-krone note for his pioneering

   Zung Wan Kim, a surgeon in Port Chester, N.Y., preps for surgery
like a prizefighter before a major bout. First he punches a soap
dispenser button with his foot and delivers a low blow to a faucet
switch with his knee. Then he rubs the soap over his hands for more
than a minute and rinses it off with graceful left and right hooks
under the stream of water.
</P>
<P>
   He jabs at his nails with a sterile brush for more than another
minute, rinses, scrubs his hands with a sterile sponge, rinses
again, and then repeats the initial wash and rinse.
</P>
<P>
   Ding! The bell goes off on Kim's timer, ending a full
five-minute ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Seem obsessive? Sure, until you consider that the life of the
hernia patient next door depends on Kim's routine. And recent
events have shown that even ordinary hand-washing may once again
become a matter of getting really sick or staying well.
</P>
<P>
   In August of this year, federal health experts reported that
four children in Minnesota and North Dakota were fatally infected
by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium easily passed through
hand-to-hand contact. A strain of S. aureus has in recent years
become resistant to the popular antibiotic methicillin. Yet any
good hand-washing can still send it down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   Lulled by the success of antibiotics in general, Americans have
come to think of compulsory hand-washing as a thing of the past _ a
holdover from the sterile, hyperhygienic 1950s. But more than half
the staph infections caught by hospital patients are now more
resistant to methicillin (up from 1974), and according to some
epidemiologists, the deaths in Minnesota and North Dakota are just
the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the possible exception of immunization,'' says Ralph
Cordell, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, ``hand washing is the most effective
disease-preventing measure anyone can practice.''
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of just how many bacteria you're carrying around,
consider an interesting experiment performed back in the 1930s by
physician Philip B. Price of Johns Hopkins University. Price set up
14 sterile enamel basins, filled them with warm sterile water and
washed his hands with plain soap for exactly one minute at each
basin.
</P>
<P>
   When he was finished, he totaled up the bacteria in the basins
and estimated their original population on his hands: 4.58 million.
Later studies showed that the full census on a single hand can rise
to as high as 200 million and may include viruses and fungi as well
as bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those organisms, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, are
native to our hands. Known as resident flora, they can cause
disease but more often help prevent it by crowding out and
combating invaders.
</P>
<P>
   The more dangerous bugs are the transients that lurk on faucets
and toilet-flush levers in airport rest rooms, on subway handholds,
on public telephone receivers and between the thumb and forefinger
of the person you shook hands with at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Up close, however, the bad guys don't look much different from
the good guys. For instance, when stained and magnified a hundred
times, S. aureus and S. epidermidis both resemble clusters of
merlot grapes.
</P>
<P>
   But some transients clearly don't belong on your hands. The
intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli OI57:H7 (stains pink, looks
from the side like long-grain rice) causes food poisoning in as
many as 20,000 people a year.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli survives all too well outside the intestines,
particularly on food. Patting contaminated ground beef into a
hamburger, for instance, can leave a residue of about 10 million
disease-causing bacteria on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   The fingertips can offer safe harbor to bacteria for up to an
hour, but they are hardly the best hiding places. Just look at your
palms, Cordell suggests, using a 3-D microscope with a
magnification of about 50. At this scale, the handscape is a
territory filled with hideouts. Cold and flu viruses wait until
your hands come in contact with the delicate membranes in your
nose, eyes or mouth, where they can infiltrate cells and duplicate
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some 400 to 500 sweat glands per square centimeter of skin pour
out moisture onto your palms, irrigating bacteria. The glands have
a shaft leading down through the epidermis, the thickest layer of
the skin, to a mazelike ball where sweat collects. On the backs of
your hands, sebaceous glands and hair follicles make even better
foxholes for bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The safest and most expansive microbial bunkers are under the
fingernails, in ``subungual spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the hand is a continent, the subungual spaces are the
caves,'' says Barry Michaels, a microbiologist with
Georgia-Pacific, which makes paper towels and hygiene products. In
fact, 95 percent of the bacteria found on our hands is under the
fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a full five minutes of washing, researchers estimate,
to flush out, shed or kill 99 percent of the transient organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, even most physicians, still don't wash long enough,
often enough or well enough. In one study a few years ago, doctors
and nurses in an emergency room washed up less than a third of the
time after touching patients. And when they did use soap and water,
the average wash-and-rinse was a mere 9.5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hand washers typically fail to clean their fingernails, thumbs,
the creases in their palms and the backs of their hands. Dominant
hands are often underwashed _ if you're right-handed, your left
hand is usually cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is simple. Start with soap and running water at a
comfortable temperature. (Antimicrobial soaps are unnecessary and
they may help spawn bacteria resistant to antibiotics.)
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the soap hits your skin, islands of grease will begin
to dissolve, exposing dormant viruses and living bacteria. E. coli
and other intestinal transients will get caught up in the tide of
soapy water during the first five seconds of the wash. Plain soap
tears off the outer coating of flu viruses, rendering them inert.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-washing also flushes away yeast and other fungi, and the
grapelike clusters of staph will soon slide away as well.
</P>
<P>
   Keep rubbing your soapy hands for at least 15 seconds before
rinsing. Admittedly, that is likely to seem like a long time. To be
sure you don't give up too soon, hygienists recommend washing for
as long as it takes to sing ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.''
</P>
<P>
   If you do all this, you will wipe out as much as 95 percent of
the organisms that were there before you picked up the soap.

   Nobody can play frustration quite like Bill Macy. You can see it
in Jerry Lundegaard, the pathetic, scheming car salesman he played
in ``Fargo,'' in Little Bill, the cuckolded porno director of
``Boogie Nights'' _ and in William H. Macy, bona fide movie star.
</P>
<P>
   Over a tuna sandwich, Macy is anguishing over what ought to be a
welcome rite of passage: construction of his new house in the
Hollywood Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 14 months and thousands and thousands of dollars, I
basically have a very expensive hole,'' he says dejectedly.
</P>
<P>
   He seems even reluctant to accept the good fortune that his
performance in ``Fargo'' brought him: an Oscar nomination and a
career switched onto the express track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hit, that's the main thing,'' Macy says with the
caution that comes from working steadily in films for 20 years
before finally _ at nearly 50 _ grasping Hollywood's brass ring.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, it's time to acknowledge that he has indeed taken
hold of that ring _ at least according to his wife of two years,
actress Felicity Huffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My lovely wife, who is so smart, said to me last year, `You
need new goals,''' says Macy, who has something like half a dozen
films under his belt in the last 12 months _ including ``Mystery
Men,'' ``Happy Texas'' and now ``Magnolia,'' the third film from
``Boogie Nights'' wunderkind Paul Thomas Anderson _ and ought to be
the last person to need career counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand what she meant at first, but then I
realized I was operating too long under the assumption all actors
do, the `I've got to get a career' thing. Well,'' he acknowledges,
``I have a career. So now I'm trying to redefine my goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Macy decides to tackle next _ screenwriting (he wrote
TNT's ``A Slight Case of Murder''), directing (HBO's ``Lip
Service'') or finding that elusive role in which he finally gets
the girl _ his performance in ``Magnolia'' as Donnie Smith, a
fading 1950s quiz-show star, can be seen as a step in that new
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the role of Donnie to bust Macy out of his box,'' says
Anderson, who directed the actor in ``Boogie Nights'' and who
conceived the character, which he describes as ``the smartest loser
of all time,'' specifically with Macy in mind.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Anderson wanted the stage-trained actor to forgo
some of the rigorous, anti-Method acting principles that he's
famous for _ theories that have fueled a career that includes an
Emmy-nominated guest stint on ``E.R.'' and more than two decades of
acclaimed theater work in Chicago and New York, where Macy
occasionally teaches a few lucky students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as character. It's just a trick we play
on the audience, with their participation, that's based on
scientific principles,'' says Macy, who first earned his acting
chops at the feet of David Mamet nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright and screenwriter, who has since cofounded two
theaters with Macy and remains one of the actor's closest friends,
was working as an acting teacher at Vermont's Goddard College when
Macy enrolled in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a very good student, and Goddard was an alternative
school in Vermont where the women didn't wear brassieres, and what
more information do you need?'' says Macy, who was born in Miami
but grew up in Virginia and Maryland, where he was the high-school
class president and a folk singer who hoped to become a
veterinarian until he got a good look at the science requirements.
Acting was not only easier, but ``Dave,'' recalls Macy, his voice
tinged with awe, ``made it a calling.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a trade, no different from bricklaying or the
woodworking Macy pursues during his off-hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can be an actor. It's a craft anyone can practice,''
insists Macy, who found ``Magnolia's'' emotion-fraught bar scene _
in which Donnie breaks down, confronting the wreck of his life and
drunkenly declaring his love for the studly bartender _ one of the
most difficult he'd ever encountered. (``Macy still doesn't think
he delivers,'' says Anderson with a chuckle. ``But it's just that
he's uncomfortable with emotions.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard because the objective wasn't clear, and it also
shifted because he was drunk,'' says Macy, who admits his distaste
for playing emotions is part of the fallout from his
``white-bread'' upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest son of a Southern belle mother and a buttoned-down
father _ a World War II hero turned insurance salesman _ Macy grew
up in a household where overt displays of emotion were discouraged.
He can play what he calls ``the imploding WASP'' so beautifully _
all those dispeptic losers that crowd his credits _ because, he
says, he is one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some actors can cry at the drop of a hat, they're so
accessible to themselves,'' he says. ``Felicity is so emotionally
alive she's like a racehorse. Well,'' he concludes, ``I'm a
camel.''

WHERE DOES ELIAN BELONG? NO QUESTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time magazine poses the question as if the answer is debatable:
``Where does he belong?''
</P>
<P>
   There can be no debate, of course, regarding the identity of the
``he'' whose future is at issue. The magazine cover features a
photo of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, perhaps the most photographed
child since Baby Jessica fell into that Texas well back in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows the story. Elian was pulled from the Atlantic
Ocean near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Thanksgiving Day after his
mother died at sea during a desperate attempt to flee Cuba and win
freedom in the United States. At approximately the same moment that
the boy was rescued, he was turned into a political football.
</P>
<P>
   And while Elian's fate is kicked around by politicians and
activists in Cuba and the United States, he remains in Florida _
separated from his Cuban father, whose pleas to be reunited with
his son go unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service finally got around to
deciding that the boy should be sent home to his dad, but then a
judge in Miami one-upped the INS by ruling that Elian should remain
in this country until at least March 6. That's when the court plans
to hear legal arguments from relatives of Elian who want him to
remain in the U.S. permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Let's give Elian's relatives the benefit of the doubt and assume
that they have the kid's best interests at heart _ even though
logic tells us that anyone who really cared about the boy would
want to see him reunited with his father. Maybe the relatives know
something about the father that the rest of us don't know, or maybe
they sincerely believe that a 6-year-old is better off visiting
Disney World with his cousins, aunts and uncles than enjoying the
loving companionship of a devoted father.
</P>
<P>
   Misguided relatives aside, there is no excusing the conduct of
the politicians, bureaucrats and political activists who have
allowed _ no, make that ``encouraged'' _ the continuation of this
fiasco for all these weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro has brazenly made Elian a cause
celebre in his country, exploiting the child's situation to stir up
anti-American sentiment among his subjects. In the United States,
anti-Castro zealots and Castro-bashing pols have buried Elian's
best interests beneath an avalanche of flag-waving rhetoric that is
entirely irrelevant to the proper disposition of a child custody
case.
</P>
<P>
   And child custody is what this is all about, no matter how hard
some groups and individuals try to turn it into a showdown between
the dismal tyranny of Castro's communist Cuba and the glorious
liberty of the world's greatest democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Castro and his enemies can debate the relative merits of Marxism
and a free society till the cows come home. But there is nothing
debatable about the need for a child to be with his father.
</P>
<P>
   No one has turned up a shred of evidence that Juan Miguel
Gonzalez is an unfit father _ indeed, news reports suggest that
Elian's dad couldn't be a more loving, more devoted father.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the problem here? American politicians and Cuban
exiles in the U.S. don't like the Cuban government, and therefore a
perfectly qualified parent should be deprived of his son?
</P>
<P>
   What would the United States say _ and do _ if some foreign
country got its hands on an American child and cavalierly decided
to keep him because the country's leaders and activists disapproved
of America's values and system of government?
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for us that the Soviet Union no longer exists _ and that
Castro no longer has the resources of a military superpower at his
beck and call.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida judge who decided to prevent Elian from going home
said that if the boy went back to Cuba, he would face ``loss of due
process rights and harm to his physical and mental health and
emotional well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. What about the loss of a child's right to be with his
father? What about the emotional harm of a boy's forced separation
from his only living parent?
</P>
<P>
   Where does he belong? It's not debatable.

 &HT;    Home maintenance and improvement planner
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Jan. 13.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year, do yourself and your home a favor.
</P>
<P>
   Develop a master plan for maintenance and repairs that outlines
everything that needs to be done within the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing a list of interior and exterior projects may seem
tedious and time consuming now, but a little planning makes it
easier to shop for competitive product prices and arrange project
financing. It will also give you time to get at least three
estimates and find the best professional for the job after checking
credentials and references.

   ``The most important thing is for the homeowner to get as much
information as they can. That way they can make an informed
decision and know that they're spending their money wisely,'' says
Lou Manfredini, an adviser to www.OurHouse.com, a Web site that

   Home improvement experts recommend negotiating contracts and
scheduling service calls as much as three months before the work
should begin. That's particularly true for seasonal projects that
can take weeks to schedule when consumer demand is at its peak,
such as sweeping the chimney or servicing the furnace.

BESIDE MICROSOFT, A NEW 800-POUND GORILLA LOOMS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the company's adversaries, the very name ``Microsoft''
suggests menacing power. It has been called the Death Star, an
800-pound gorilla and worse.
</P>
<P>
   And in the government's sweeping antitrust case, the Microsoft
Corp. was portrayed in convincing detail as a monopolistic bully.
America Online Inc., in particular, was bent to Microsoft's will,
according to court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But after America Online's move on Monday to buy Time Warner
Inc., at $165 billion the largest merger in history, Microsoft
suddenly seems less threatening _ less the irresistible army of the
Internet era. AOL Time Warner, as the new company will be called,
promises to be a formidable power in its own right, perhaps more
powerful in some ways than Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, to be sure, quickly gained the upper hand in its
first Internet battle _ against the Netscape Communications Corp.,
which America Online bought last year. Microsoft saw Netscape, the
pioneer in Web browsing software, as a threat to its dominance of
personal computing. Microsoft's response was swift and aggressive,
and, according to the Justice Department and 19 states, against the
law.
</P>
<P>
   The America Online-Time Warner deal changes none of the facts in
the antitrust case. But antitrust experts say it could figure into
the calculations the court makes on sanctions against Microsoft, if
it loses the case, or in settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft is an 800-pound gorilla, then there is certainly
another beefy gorilla out there now,'' observed William Kovacic,
professor at the George Washington University law school. ``This
deal does underline the possibilities for upheaval and
transformation in this industry. That could well make it more
difficult for a judge to choose a remedy that has dramatic,
irreversible effects, like breaking up the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The America Online-Time Warner merger, if completed, would
create a powerhouse for the next phase of Internet business:
selling information and entertainment services to consumers who may
tap into them using digital cell phones, handheld devices and
television set-top boxes in addition to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Time Warner deal, America Online had been
bulking itself up to prepare for this so-called post-PC era with a
multibillion-dollar investment campaign over the last couple of
years, since the Microsoft antitrust suit was filed, to strengthen
its network technology and to add services. The acquisitions
include Netscape, Compuserve, MapQuest.com, MovieFone and a
$1.5-billion investment in Hughes Electronics to promote satellite
delivery of Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has gone on its own multibillion-dollar investment
spree, much of it to secure assured distribution for high-speed
Internet access over telecommunications and cable television
networks, both in the United States and abroad. In the last year
alone, Microsoft invested $5 billion in AT&AMP;T, $660 million in
Nextel, $500 million in NTL and $300 million in United Pan-European
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the online business, Microsoft finds itself in the
unfamiliar position of being David to America Online's Goliath. In
the online access market, in which subscribers pay fees,
Microsoft's MSN service had 1.9 million members in the third
quarter of last year, compared with 18 million for America Online,
according to Jupiter Communications, a research firm. America
Online says it now has 20 million subscribers, while Microsoft did
not disclose its current numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft does have some popular sites on the World Wide Web,
like its Expedia travel site and Carpoint auto site, which can be
reached by users through any Internet access service. Yet even by
the measure of number of visitors to its Web sites, Microsoft is
well behind America Online. According to Media Metrix, which
monitors Web traffic, America Online had 54 million visitors in
November, compared with 38 million for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has made some media investments including its joint
venture with NBC for a cable television and online news service,
MSNBC, but recently it had been shifting away from trying to become
a media company. Instead, it has been trying to build up its Web
offerings as delivering personalized information online _ e-mail,
news, stock prices, travel advice, even horoscopes _ that people
use to make them ``more productive,'' just as Microsoft's popular
Office software makes people more productive at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new strategy for MSN is about taking us back to our roots
but twisted and adopted for the Internet,'' Brad Chase, a senior
vice president explained in a recent interview before the America
Online-Time Warner deal was announced. ``There are parts of the
media business that we do, selling ads and so forth. But our main
focus is not going to be on creating content and media, which is
what we had been trying to do for a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's senior executive team met on Monday to discuss the
implications of America Online's move, which is a big step in
becoming a media company. So is Microsoft rethinking its strategy
yet again _ as the richest company in the world, it could afford
virtually any acquisition _ or does it plan to stick to pursuing
its very different Internet strategy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear in mind, we've had one day to chew on it,'' Chase said
Tuesday, ``but I think this deal is kind of positive for us in a
way. It reinforces the very different road we're taking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is saying that its primary anchor is going to be media,''
he added. ``Our primary anchor is going to be services and software
distributed over the Internet that will help consumers run their
lives better, make them more productive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To help revive its online business, Microsoft recruited a new
executive last fall, Richard Belluzo, to head its consumer group.
He came from Silicon Graphics, where he had been chief executive,
but Belluzo was probably best known for his previous work at
Hewlett-Packard, where he built the consumer printer and consumer
personal computer businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists it is still very early in the Internet
business and that America Online's lead is by no means
insurmountable. ``As a mass-market consumer medium, the Internet is
just beginning to emerge and it will be accessed from many devices
other than the PC,'' Belluzo said. ``People talk about all the
subscribers AOL has, but in a few years we will look back and say
those numbers are trivial.''
</P>
<P>
   In the markets where Microsoft has engineered come-from-behind
winners, the company has followed a formula: make competitive
products, but also change the economics of the target market. In
office productivity software, Microsoft once trailed Lotus in
spreadsheets and Wordperfect in word processing. Microsoft steadily
improved its offerings, Excel and Word, but also bundled them into
a single Office suite and priced the bundled offering at about the
same price as rivals were charging for a single office application.

FEW ANTITRUST RISKS SEEN IN AOL-TIME WARNER MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AARON ZITNER   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first glance, America Online and Time Warner
seem to face no major problems from antitrust regulators as they
merge their giant companies.
</P>
<P>
   America Online offers its services over the Internet, while Time
Warner is a leading player in cable, film, and other media and
entertainment sectors. Because those services do not overlap, a
merged AOL-Time Warner would not gain a stranglehold in any one
market because of the deal, company officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But seen in another light, the merger could let regulators find
points to pick at. Television and the Internet are now converging
into a single market. Regulators could argue that America Online is
becoming somthing like a cable outlet itself, just as cable and
broadcast systems are trying to find ways to marry their services
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And if television and the Internet are truly becoming one
market, the new AOL-Time Warner would have a commanding presence.
</P>
<P>
   Several government agencies have the opportunity to study the
merger and to try to alter its terms. They include the antitrust
divisions at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade
Commission, as well as the Federal Communications Commission and
possibly the local and state authorities that control cable
franchise licenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Congress has held three hearings in recent months
on consolidation in the communications industry. Monday, Senator
Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a
Republican presidential candidate, said he would hold one more,
this one on the America Online deal.
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny is sure to take in several unresolved issues in
public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Already, when Time Warner sells the HBO programs it owns to the
cable companies it owns, it must also sell those HBO programs to
competing cable systems. What happens when Time Warner sells its
CNN news service to America Online? Will it now be forced to sell
CNN to every other online company?
</P>
<P>
   Already, cable giants like Time Warner and AT&AMP;T are using their
cable lines to offer high-speed Internet service. If Time Warner
uses its cable lines to help America Online offer high-speed
service, must it also open its network to other companies who want
to do the same?
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade
Commission share responsiblity for reviewing mergers to see if they
violate antitrust law. The two agencies usually confer on each
merger and assign one of them to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Each agency has its special competence, but both can claim to
have the experience to review the America Online merger. The trade
commission reviewed Time Warner's acquisition of Ted Turner's cable
company, while Justice lawyers took charge when AOL acquired the
browser company Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word Monday on which agency would handle the AOL
merger. Nor would the FCC comment on whether it plans to review the
deal. The FCC would have the authority to act if Time Warner
transfers any of its many licenses to AOL, which cover such things
as its wireless phone services and its right to operate the
satellite uplinks by which Time Warner sends programming to its
cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   Local authorities could also cause problems for the merger. In
the process of acquiring cable properties, AT&AMP;T found itself under
orders from city officials in Portland, Ore., to open its cable
lines to Internet service providers owned by competing companies.
The issue is now in court.

`OLD' VS. `NEW' IN TIME WARNER TAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're calling the America Online Inc.-Time Warner Inc. deal a
merger, but it's really a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The new firm will be called AOL Time Warner, not the other way
around. And AOL shareholders will get most of the bounty _ 55
percent of the new company, compared to 45 percent for Time Warner
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the little pipsqueak of a company that's buying the big
behemoth,'' said telecommunications industry analyst Jeffrey Kagan.
``But that's how it's happening these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by the immense value of its stock, AOL has carried out
the first ``new media'' takeover of an ``old media'' company. And
there may be more such deals in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to combine powerful brands in traditional media with a
hot, young on-line company isn't exactly new. Up to now, many
assumed that the big, established old media companies would be the
buyers rather than the bought. That's what nearly happened last
year when Waltham-based Lycos Inc. tried to merge with some of the
television and retailing assets of USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Lycos CEO Bob Davis said that a link with USA
Networks would have given his Internet company a solid foothold in
the world of traditional media. For this, he was willing to create
a new company in which Lycos shareholders would have gotten at most
a 35 percent stake. In essence, the old media people would have
ended up owning the new media company.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal enraged many Lycos investors. At the time, Lycos
shares were soaring above $130, while USA Networks shares were
hovering in the mid-30s. Defenders of the deal stressed that USA
Networks was bringing a variety of assets, like the Home Shopping
Network, which had solid cash flow and a large base of customers.
But shareholders were convinced that Lycos was selling itself too
cheaply, given the run-up in Internet stock values.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, such objections killed the Lycos deal. Charles Conn,
CEO of Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc., one of the USA Networks
companies, thinks the AOL-Time Warner merger shows that Lycos and
USA Networks were on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about vindication, but I do think it shows the
power and credibility of bringing together new media companies and
traditional media companies,'' Conn said.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, it's the new media company that's calling the
tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had asked me a year ago would this merger happen, I
would have said I don't think so,'' said Bruce Leichtman, director
of media and entertainment strategies for the Boston-based Yankee
Group. ``To see AOL as the big fish gobbling the little fish is
almost impossible to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL may be the most successful Internet company, but it's small
fry compared to Time Warner. AOL has just over 12,000 employees,
compared to Time Warner's 67,500. In the quarter ended September
1999, AOL had $1.5 billion in revenues; Time Warner raked in $6.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Time Warner's vast array of physical assets,
from printing presses to television studios. Time Warner CEO Gerald
Levin said Monday that his company's CNN cable news service alone
reaches up to a billion people worldwide. There's also the
company's other TV networks, like TNT, TBN, and the WB Network; its
recorded music business; its Warner Bros. movie and TV production
business; and a stable of magazines including Time, People,
Fortune, and Sports Illustrated. By comparison, AOL offers 22
million subscribers to its AOL and CompuServe Internet services,
and about 50 million monthly visits to AOL's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, all this was outweighed by AOL's extraordinary
market capitalization, which stood at $165 billion when the market
opened Monday morning. By comparison, Time Warner began the day
valued at $71 billion. For all its assets and worldwide reach, Time
Warner was still at the mercy of a stock market that has made AOL a
far more valuable company than Time Warner. Investors have made a
huge bet that AOL and other top Internet companies will acquire
hundreds of millions of subscribers worldwide in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, AOL badly needs Time Warner's old-media assets,
especially its cable television business, which is accessible to 21
million homes nationwide. AOL faces a severe threat to its
business, as AT&AMP;T Corp. and other cable firms start deploying
high-speed Internet connections to homes.
</P>
<P>
   The cable firms have cut their own deals with Internet providers
and frozen out AOL, whose customers would have to pay extra to use
AOL on cable systems. That could lead to massive defections from
AOL's customer base. AOL has been fighting in courtrooms across the
country in an effort to force cable firms to grant it ``open
access'' to their cable Internet services. The Time Warner deal
assures that AOL won't be frozen out of many American homes.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Time Warner badly needs an Internet strategy. The
company was one of the first old media companies to foresee the
significance of the World Wide Web. In 1994, the company launched
Pathfinder, a major Web site that was to feature on-line content
from a variety of Time Warner media properties. But Pathfinder
never caught on, leaving one of the world's major media companies
with almost no significant Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't deliver service over the Internet,'' said
industry analyst Kagan, ``you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the news of the AOL Time Warner deal sent shares of Lycos
and Web leader Yahoo Inc. soaring as investors considered the
prospect that other Internet companies would begin making big
investments in traditional media firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's official,'' said Yankee Group analyst Melissa Bane. ``The
Internet company, at least in this deal, has been seen as the media
leader of the future.''

   Perhaps the only thing stranger than America Online's chairman,
Stephen M. Case, announcing plans to assume the helm of the world's
largest media conglomerate on Monday was the fact that he wore a
suit and tie to do it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Case, 41, heads an Internet company perpetually
thought to be doomed and is known for clinging to his casual
costume of denim shirts and khakis on even the most formal
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But if his attire changes with his company's acquisition of Time
Warner, it should come as no surprise. Since the days of 300-baud
modems, Case has survived the Internet's accelerated evolution with
a series of transformations. His deal with Time Warner is only the
most recent.
</P>
<P>
   It is a character trait that did not go unnoticed by Time
Warner's chairman, Gerald Levin, who had shed his own tie before
Monday's news conference announcing the deal and who took a certain
relish in welcoming the ``suits from Virginia,'' where America
Online is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Steve proposed that I be CEO in that very first phone
call, it caught my attention, because it said something about who
he is,'' Levin said Monday of Case's approach. ``Here is someone
who has built an extremely successful company, still early in his
career, and he was saying `I'm going to give my baby to you as the
CEO because I think that is what's best for both companies.'''
</P>
<P>
   The decision underscored the combination of idealism and
pragmatism that has served Case well through several episodes of
turmoil. Seemingly shy and reserved, Case conceived of a grand
vision for America Online over a decade ago and refused to abandon
it, despite competition that seemed insurmountable and detractors
unwilling to be appeased.
</P>
<P>
   James Kimsey, the company's co-founder and former chairman, said
Case was weaned on crisis. In America Online's earliest years, the
company was constantly running out of money. Trying to find new
partners to carry it through was part of Case's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was well schooled in the harrowing ways of high tech and
particularly in an emerging medium,'' Kimsey said. ``We had very
few resources so we were forced to figure out how to get other
people to carry our water.''
</P>
<P>
   Case, who was raised in Hawaii and received a bachelor's degree
in political science from Williams College, spent his first
postcollege years working in marketing for giants like PepsiCo and
Procter &AMP; Gamble _ he helped invent the slogan ``Towelette? You
bet!'' and then watched the P&AMP;G product fail.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1983, when he hooked up his Kaypro computer to an early
version of an online service, he began to envision an interactive
world where people all over the country could gather. At a company
then known as Quantum Computer Services, he and Kimsey pursued that
vision.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that IBM and Sears had a similar idea.
Their venture, Prodigy, was an online service started a year before
America Online and had parents with deep pockets, so it was easy
for industry watchers to see that the fledgling America Online
would lose that battle. But Prodigy, which was slower to introduce
Internet access and e-mail, stumbled as Case's company gathered
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Case, who frequently pops jelly beans during interviews, has
three children from his first marriage. He was remarried in 1998 to
Jean Villanueva, America Online's former communications chief, who
has since left the company.
</P>
<P>
   With the birth of the World Wide Web, industry pundits again
predicted the end for proprietary services like America Online. But
partly in response to the Web's popularity, the service switched to
flat-rate pricing in 1996 and attracted more interest than it could
handle. Its lack of preparation resulted in one of the worst
moments in the company's history, as millions of customers were
shut out with busy signals.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. Case quickly expanded capacity and announced a
series of executive appointments aimed at getting back in his
customers' good graces. With his frequently posted letters to
subscribers, Case fostered an image of the company as friendly and
open to criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In its first incarnation, America Online billed itself as an
online community. With the new executive team _ including Robert
Pittman, who had built the MTV brand _ in place, the company began
to advertise itself as a vehicle for convenience. Now it is looking
to expand its revenues from e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Once disdained by techies as poorly designed training wheels for
the real Internet, America Online last year acquired Netscape
Communications, a Silicon Valley darling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both grew up with a belief that change is good and should
be embraced rather than feared,'' said Daniel H. Case III, Case's
older brother, who is chief executive of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
``Growing up in Hawaii, you had to wonder: What'sundary?
When we went to college our father told us, `It's all a long way
away, why not go to the East Coast?' So if you're trying to invent
a new industry, why not be the leader?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Case's willingness to adapt to the changing environment does
not come without its casualties. He has pushed aside executives,
including Ted Leonsis, a former president who was once slated to
run the company's media ventures, when he decided on a change of
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In inviting Levin to be chief executive, Case displayed a shrewd
negotiating tactic, but perhaps at the expense of some America
Online executives who have run the company's day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Case says, he wants to evolve once more as chairman of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade ago, AOL had less than 100,000 members and the World
Wide Web hadn't been invented,'' he said. ``Now I'm a billionaire
and on the cover of all these magazines, but I hope my personal
legacy is not about making money. It may sound corny, but I want to
focus on the things I care about. I want to change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Case will be able to exercise as much control over his
own company's evolution in the wake of a combination remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``With America Online, you always got the feeling that they
wanted you to like them,'' wrote one subscriber on an America
Online bulletin board on Monday. He added, ``I have never felt such
vibes from Time Warner.''

 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The America Online-Time Warner merger represents not only the
triumph of the Internet as the irresistible force in business, but
a vision of the Internet as a mass-marketed, middle-of-the-road
medium for Main Street Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Though top executives of both companies presented the deal as a
``merger of equals,'' it was in fact a victory for Stephen Case,
the 41-year-old billionaire who built America Online from a
fledgling dial-up service in the mid-'80s to an Internet powerhouse
able to acquire the world's largest media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online is clearly dominant,'' said David Readerman,
managing director of Thomas Weisel Partners, an investment firm in
San Francisco. ``The nerds have won. This deal really validates the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more so, it would appear to validate AOL, which had long
been derided by techies as a lowbrow medium. They called it
``training wheels for the Internet,'' suggesting it was not the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   But Case, who once developed new pizza offerings for Pizza Hut,
always held his ground. He insisted the online business was less
about technology than about consumer marketing. His vision has
proved to be on target so far, making America Online by far the
biggest online service, with 20 million subscribers. Just where the
combined AOL-Time Warner is headed is difficult to predict, but the
emphasis is certain to be the same _ stressing a mass-market
consumer service that Main Street Americans find attractive, and
hiding the nerdy technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about technology, it's about making this a mass
medium and becoming part of the everyday habits of ordinary
consumers,'' Case said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure of America Online's rapid rise and its current
stature was evident on Wall Street Monday. A few years ago, it was
thought that America Online might indeed merge with a media
company. Disney or Time Warner, it was said, might buy America
Online, which was then seen as a promising upstart. But Monday it
was the shares of Time Warner, one of the world's leading media
companies, with its storied legacy going back to Henry Luce, that
leaped in celebration, like some neglected waif rescued by a
wealthy benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept that something profound is happening in the Internet
space _ I believe that,'' said Gerald Levin, chairman of Time
Warner. ``The new media stock-market valuations are real, not in
every case, of course. But what AOL has done is get first position
in this new world. Its valuation is real, and I am attesting to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the America Online-Time Warner deal is more than a striking
testimonial to the Internet as mainstream media. The proposed
merger is also a big gamble for both companies, as well as an
admission by both that they need each other.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's weakness is the lack of access to high-speed
Internet services over television cables, which rivals AT&AMP;T and
Microsoft have. Once in place, these high-speed, or broadband,
networks _ provided over upgraded cable or phone lines _ open the
door to the digital distribution of new services for interactive
entertainment, information and electronic commerce, via everything
from desktop computers to hand-held devices to television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, with its vast cable networks serving more than 13
million subscribers, gives America Online assured access to the
high-speed networks required for these new mass-market Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest threat to AOL over the next three years was
getting locked out of broadband,'' said David B. Yoffie, a
professor at the Harvard Business School. ``And this deal certainly
helps solve that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But that solution, by joining its fate with Time Warner, could
come at a high cost for America Online. The online leader has been
a favorite on Wall Street because it is seen as a fast-growing
Internet company. Now, however, it is melding its business with a
slower-growing, though far larger, media company whose properties
range from Time magazine to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a prayer that the combined company can grow at
anything like AOL's historical rates of growth,'' Yoffie said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting that concern, America Online's stock price slipped a
bit Monday, closing down $2.1875 to $71.25 a share, while Time
Warner's shares jumped $25.25, to $90.
</P>
<P>
   Case of America Online said that he expected the far higher
valuations given to Internet companies than to media companies to
decline. But he held that view, he explained, not because he
thought investors had bid up Internet shares to outlandish heights,
but more because traditional media would be revived if they got
their Internet strategies right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional media assets have a vibrant future if they can be
catapulted into the Internet Age,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   By linking with Time Warner, Case is also betting that there
will be an advantage to owning those media brands, not just
distributing them through the America Online service. As the
Internet expands beyond the personal computer as the main way to
get online _ with people increasingly tapping into the Internet by
phones, television and handheld devices _ Case says consumers will
want an easy-to-use service that works on all those machines.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, in short, wants to be a one-stop service for the
Internet of the future. ``We don't want AOL to be a place people go
through to get someplace else,'' Case said. ``We want to be able to
create an integrated consumer space. That's why, ultimately, the
ownership of media brands will be important.''
</P>
<P>
   For Time Warner, the deal with America Online is seen as a fast
track to the Internet _ ``the digital transformation of Time
Warner,'' in Levin's terms. Time Warner had tried to make that
transformation on its own, and struggled badly at times. A World
Wide Web site, called Pathfinder, that offered the online versions
of most Time Warner magazines, for example, was abandoned after
years and millions of dollars in losses. Each publication,
including Time, Fortune, People, Sports Illustrated and
Entertainment Weekly, has its own site now.
</P>
<P>
   And Road Runner, the company's high-speed Internet service, has
more than 320,000 customers. But it has not grown as rapidly as
Time Warner had hoped and it is certainly not the online brand that
America Online is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner sees all its media properties going to the
Internet, movies, television, print and music, which is already
well on its way,'' said Harold Vogel, who heads a New York media
investment firm and is an adjunct professor of media economics at
Columbia University's business school. ``And the company has been
frustrated in not being able to exploit its cable and media assets
more effectively in the Internet arena.''
</P>
<P>
   The people behind the merger _ perhaps even more than the
strategy _ will determine whether the combination works. At the New
York press conference Monday, there was no shortage of smiles and
back-slapping and much warm talk of the ``shared vision'' of the
top executives of America Online and Time Warner. Levin went out of
his way to look informal, wearing a sport coat and no tie, while
Case, renowned for his khakis (once appearing in a Gap ad) and
rarely donning a coat, went out of his way to look formal, wearing
a suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the blunt-spoken Ted Turner, who is Time Warner's largest
shareholder with 100 million shares, acknowledged a key issue in
all larger mergers. Turner said the two executives' teams were
filled with ``strong personalities'' and that meant there was
``potential for some friction,'' though he said he did not expect
personality clashes to slow down the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders were even more skeptical. ``Sorting out these
businesses is going to be a task of monumental proportions,'' said
Yoffie, the Harvard professor.
</P>
<P>
   That chore, apparently, will fall mostly on the shoulders of
Levin, who will be chief executive of the combined company, and who
is a more seasoned manager than Case. ``I'll focus on the things
I'm best at _ strategy, technology, policy and running the board,''
Case said. ``Gerry will run the company.''

MERGER MAY BE AN INTERNET TRAILBLAZER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BRUCE RAMSEY   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online's merger with Time Warner is not just the biggest
merger deal ever.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the one that defines the next step for corporate
America on the Internet. And the obvious question is who is taking
the next step? Microsoft and Sony or Disney? Yahoo! and CBS?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is thinking of which deal is next,'' said Stewart
Halpern, who follows AOL for Banc of America Securities in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   There was little more than speculation, Monday. And it was
clearly affecting the stock market. Time Warner jumped by $27.50
per share Monday. But other media companies not part of the deal
started to dance, too: Walt Disney Co. up $4.75, Comcast up $5.44,
CBS up $4.06, Liberty Media up $8.44 and AT&AMP;T up $2.
</P>
<P>
   And the most frequently mentioned partners at this new hoedown
were Microsoft, Yahoo! and AT&AMP;T, News Corp., Sony, Viacom/CBS and
MGM.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition defines what a media company is going to look
like,'' said Paul Noglows, a managing director for Chase H&AMP;Q, the
former Hambrecht &AMP; Quist investment firm. ``We're not going to have
`new-media companies.' Every media company is going to have a
new-media component.''
</P>
<P>
   The AOL-Time Warner deal increases the pressure on everybody
else. ``There's questions about what Viacom does long term, and
Disney and certainly News Corporation,'' Noglows said. ``I don't
think anybody has an offering that's even close to what AOL Time
Warner's going to have.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL now gets control of Time Warner's cable-TV systems, cable-TV
programming (which it bought from Ted Turner), movies, music,
magazines and books _ a menagerie of ``content'' from executive
profiles in Fortune to the cartoon antics of Yakko, Wacko and Dot.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Internet service msn.com has nothing like it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Tom Pilla said the acquisition
``demonstrates how differently people can view the market.''
Microsoft, he said, sees itself as ``a great software and services
platform company that will work with any media company that wants
to offer its content on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a big difference from the idea a few years ago that
Microsoft would become a media company on its own, starting with
Sidewalk, Slate and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Noglows said the AOL deal is a challenge to Microsoft, and ``I
think they're going to have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The AOL-Time Warner merger also challenges Internet companies to
invest in cable. The Time Warner cable systems, most of them local
monopolies, provide a ``broad-band'' conduit that can deliver
television and movies over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're AOL, you need that fast pipe,'' Halpern said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has also been investing aggressively in cable. Last
year it invested $5 billion in AT&AMP;T, $500 million in NTL Inc., $300
million in United Pan-Europe Communications and $400 million in
Rogers Communications Inc., the No. 1 cable company in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   For Paul Allen, the Mercer Island billionaire and Microsoft
co-founder who has been talking about ``broad band'' for a decade,
the AOL-Time Warner deal is a big ``I told you so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the No. 1 provider of narrow-band connectivity
merging with the No. 1 owner of cable companies. If that isn't a
huge lot cast with Paul Allen's wired world, I don't know what
is,'' said Bill Savoy, president of Allen's Vulcan Ventures in
Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   Savoy said the combination of Internet and television, long
talked about, is ``a foregone conclusion, at least at Time
Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it validates what Internet distribution is really
worth,'' said spokesman Mark Peterson of Allen-controlled Go2Net
Inc. in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, Go2Net has been part of Allen's effort to open up
his own ``fast pipe'' to 7 million homes connected to his cable
companies. It also has a deal with Hasbro, the company with rights
to Monopoly, Risk and Clue, to provide games over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle-area company with a direct stake is InfoSpace.com,
which provides software and content to AOL. Vice President Joni
Hanson said the merger ``is fine with us, because we provide
services to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger is also an example of Internet stock valuations.
Compare Time Warner with AOL. Three years ago, Time Warner was at
about $20 per share.
</P>
<P>
   It has gone up about 4.6 times, much of it Monday. Three years
ago, AOL was at about $1.50. It has gone up 48 times.
</P>
<P>
   But revenue at AOL is still less than one-quarter the size of
Time Warner. But its revenue is growing four times faster.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's announcement, the market value of AOL was about
double that of Time Warner. That's why AOL bought Time Warner, and
not the other way around, even though AOL was founded only in 1985
and Time Warner goes back to the 1920s, when Time magazine and
Warner Brothers Pictures were founded.

AOL WANTS WARNER BROS. CONTENT 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ The proposed merger between America Online and
Time Warner Inc. could bring a new wave of activity to the historic
Warner Bros. studios in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Access to Warner Bros. products _ including television and cable
programming, music and movies _ is part of the driving force behind
what would be the largest corporate merger in history, analysts
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Those products, called ``content'' in the Internet arena, will
take center stage in the new, multibillion-dollar company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the merger really reflects the importance of content
and content brands in this battle for the Internet,'' said Michael
Wolf, senior partner at Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton, a New York-based
management and technology consulting firm. ``Time Warner has one of
the biggest libraries of branded content of anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that content is made at Burbank-based Warner Bros.,
where on any given day between 8,000 and 10,000 workers, many of
them contract workers, help create an array of entertainment
products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its huge library of feature films, the studio
produces top television shows, music and movies. Its recent
products include `The Green Mile'' and ``Any Given Sunday,'' the
television shows ``ER'' and ``The West Wing,'' and recording
artists such as Madonna and the Goo Goo Dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' products will remedy AOL's ongoing difficulty in
getting good content for its subscribers, according to analyst
Steve Cesinger of Los Angeles-based Greif &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Warner Bros., they're a premier content
provider in every arena,'' Cesinger said. ``This just allows AOL to
have a direct pipeline of content to put on their site.''
</P>
<P>
   Looney Tunes characters, for example, could help draw viewers to
AOL's sites devoted to children's entertainment. AOL could also
host the official ``ER'' Web site, attracting more advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly $162 billion stock deal, if approved by regulators
and stockholders, also would benefit Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's two Internet services, America Online and CompuServe, have
more than 22.2 million subscribers. Those members would provide a
huge market for Warner Bros. products.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also would give Warner access to AOL's established
e-commerce infrastructure, saving millions of dollars in
development costs, according to company spokeswoman Barbara
Brogliatti.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts us right at the forefront,'' she said. ``It
accelerates our efforts in the digital world.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those efforts, Brogliatti said, is the creation of
original programming for the Internet, an arena that analysts say
is poised for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Cesinger, the Greif &AMP; Co. analyst, said Warner Bros. could see
business boom if the merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were on the studio side, I would think that activity is
going to rev up,'' he said. ``I would think this gives Time Warner
a great engine for growth.''!dlim!!end!

STEVE CASE A MEDIA VISIONARY, SAY HIS FANS IN VIRGINIA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MARILYN GEEWAX  
c.2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ted Turner, 61, and Gerald Levin, 60, have decades
more business experience than Steve Case, 41. But when the biggest
media merger in history was announced Monday, Case was the first
man at the mike, and the one with ``chairman'' behind his name at
the new AOL Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   That Case would emerge as No. 1 among such powerful men
surprises no one in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington,
where America Online's spectacular growth has vastly enriched the
community. Here, Case is widely regarded as a visionary who helped
transform green pastures into seas of shiny Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   His success in the 1990s had the home town expecting great
things in the new century, a number of Virginians said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has known him over the last five years would not
find this (merger) stunning,'' said Jerry Gordon, president of the
Fairfax County Economic Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Duval, secretary of commerce and trade for Virginia, said
people who have worked on economic development projects with Case
believe he represents ``a new generation of corporate leadership''
destined to define the Information Age. What makes Case the best
choice to head the new online/media company is his ``ability to
create a vision and follow it through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That the quiet, almost somber, Case would turn out to be such a
phenomenal success was not so apparent in the early 1980s when,
after graduating from Williams College in Massachusetts, he was
hired by Pizza Hut to help develop new pizza toppings. Putting in
only a short stint in the oregano-and-cheese world, he moved online
in 1983 by joining Control Video Corp., a small company that let
Atari game fans play over telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Dulles, Va., quickly ran into trouble, and
the board of directors fired most of the managers. Case was among
the survivors who helped save the company and rename it Quantum
Computer Services Inc. in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Case headed up sales and marketing at Quantum, which launched an
online service called Q-Link for users of Commodore computers. In
1989, the company launched an online service called America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the company dropped the name Quantum to become
America Online Inc., with Case serving as executive vice president.
In 1992, AOL began selling stock to the public and Case joined the
board. In April 1993, he was named chief executive and added the
post of chairman in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Case's most crucial move came when he pushed for mass
mailings of 3.5-inch America Online disks, providing would-be
subscribers with quick access to the online service. He insisted
the company focus on simplicity and ease of use, making AOL seem
friendly and useful to the average customer who did not happen to
have an advanced degree in computer engineering.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the Case survived the withering criticism that
resulted from extended service outages. By the late 1990s, the
company had straightened out most of its technical problems and was
wildly popular, with more than 20 million subscribers. In its
fiscal 1999, which ended June 30, America Online took in $4.8
billion in revenues and posted a profit of $762 million, or 62
cents a diluted share for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vast increase in his personal net worth, Case has
carved out a reputation in Northern Virginia for being very
concerned with social issues and community betterment. For example,
he has spearheaded industry efforts to narrow the so-called
``digital divide,'' the big gap between computer use among whites
and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said Case also has worked on improving schools and has
done ``a whole lot of good works'' for the county. Despite his
wealth and power, what Case likes to talk about is ``his children,
Little League and PTA,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   In news stories about Case, the words ``shy'' and ``unassuming''
appear regularly. His management style has been described as
``consensus-building'' and ``cool.'' With his thatch of dark brown
hair, Case has the bland good looks of a stereotypical ``soccer
dad'' in Northern Virginia. Compared with the woman-chasing,
yacht-sailing Ted Turner, the AOL leader will give tabloids little
to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wired world, the deliberate, low-keyed management
wonk has emerged as king. And at 41, he may have a good long reign.

EXPERTS SEE CLEARANCE FOR TIME WARNER-AOL MERGER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JULIA MALONE  
c.2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Experts predicted Monday that the huge America
Online-Time Warner merger would win government approval, but only
after the firms satisfy regulators from Washington to state
capitals to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be some comparatively modest modifications, but
none that stand in the way of completing the transaction,'' said
William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at George Washington
University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Time Warner, a news, entertainment and cable
company, with the world's largest Internet provider, AOL, into the
biggest media conglomerate in history raised concerns about
concentration of power.
</P>
<P>
   But company executives argued that the new entity would have no
monopolies in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``No single line of business really dominates its category, so
we don't expect there to be any antitrust issues,'' said Steve
Case, chairman and chief executive of AOL.
</P>
<P>
   A potential sticking point is whether customers of Time Warner's
cable services would be able to choose an Internet service other
than AOL for the increasingly popular high-speed ``broadband''
connections available through TV cable wires.
</P>
<P>
   Case pledged that customers would have free choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue, we thought, would be related to open access,
and we wanted to just take that off the table on day one by
committing to the principle,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Kovacic outlined a ``fairly laborious and
time-consuming collection of regulatory reviews'' that are likely
to take at least a year. And he said that regulators might ask the
companies to issue a written agreement on the ``open access''
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, chairman of the Judiciary Committee's
antitrust subcommittee, announced he would hold hearings to review
the merger plans.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``could make sense for consumers,'' DeWine said in a
statement. But he added that ``it raises a whole host of
competition and public policy issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee's top-ranking Democrat, Patrick
Leahy of Vermont, expressed doubts about the merger. ``The great
promise of the Internet has been to allow people a wide range of
information sources and choices,'' he said. ``What we should do is
make sure that all that information does not become funneled and
controlled by just two or three sources.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to congressional hearings, the companies face the
following hurdles to approval of the merger:
</P>
<P>
   _ Two federal agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and the
Department of Justice antitrust division, must determine between
themselves which one will review the merger to determine if it
would violate antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Federal Communication Commission reviews any change of
licensing and ownership for broadcast and cable operations. The FCC
has a general role of determining whether the change would benefit
the public.
</P>
<P>
   _ State attorneys general can be expected to scrutinize the
plans wherever Time Warner holds a cable franchise. Cities with
Time Warner service can also be expected to look over the plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ The European Union's competition directorate would also have a
role.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some critics saw a dangerous trend in the mega-merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this aggregation of power in a single entity is a
true threat to the democratic order,'' said Edward Herman,
professor emeritus at the Wharton School of Business at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``The antitrust laws have as part of
their function to maintain a decentralized system.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman said that the antitrust watchdogs in the federal
government ``have been ineffectual'' in stopping the escalating
trend toward mega-mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly because of the global competition, and it's partly
because these companies are so politically powerful,'' he said,
citing past campaign contributions. ``The money in elections is so
great that the political system seems unable to resist the force of
that power.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic said that many are beginning to ask if the push to merge
``is approaching a threshold at which we ought to slow down.''
These concerns may not translate into opposition to the Time
Warner-AOL marriage, he said, ``but they will mean that the
deliberative process will be cautious.''

AOL/Time Warner: New, fresh company or confusing mess? 
By Bill Husted  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The combination of AOL and Time Warner creates one of
the richest collections of brands since Mr. Procter met Mr. Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Is that creation a work of genius in synergy? That's the belief
of J. Walker Smith, president of Yankelovich Partners, the national
marketing and research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``An established brand name is a lot cheaper than building a new
brand identity,'' he said. ``What it takes to build a brand is
either a huge amount of money ... or brand new territory to
conquer, and what the Internet brought was brand new territory to
conquer.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is the deal a $350 billion mistake that will erase some of
the value of the brands _ ``mushing them together'' into a bland
customer confusing mess? That's the thinking of Al Ries, chairman
of Ries &AMP; Ries, an Atlanta-based marketing firm that does strategic
planning for ABC Radio, Coca-Cola, Dell, Frito-Lay, IBM, Pillsbury,
Turner Broadcasting and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing unusual in experts that disagree. But both men
and most marketing experts do agree with Jagdish N. Sheth,
Kellstadt professor of marketing and strategy at Emory University's
Goizueta Business School, that the deal creates both pitfalls and
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at those pitfalls, Ries said the new media monolith must
work hard ``to keep each brand separate. When you mush brands
together, you cause confusion on the part of your customers and
prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes _ after spending so much money for Time Warner _ the
temptation will be to milk the brands and meld them to ``make the
synergy pay off. The tendency is that you buy something for more
than book value, otherwise why sell, and now one plus one has to
equal three.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that's just the kind of new math created by what he
calls a genius of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the umbrella of brands does add up to more than
their separate values. That added value comes in being able to
collect marketing information from customers of one brand and use
it to sell those customers another brand under that big umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, consumers could care less if People magazine is owned by
Time magazine. They don't care if it's owned by AOL,'' he said.
``However, from a marketing standpoint it (this deal) has to do
with what the real battle of the Internet is all about _ who owns
the customer. The Internet has made every business into a database
business. The real genius of the AOL Time Warner merger is that
they now have synergistic ways to leverage the ways that they can
sell to their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheth also believes that owning such a premier collection of
brands ``has more opportunity than dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, an almost hidden value in the deal is the creation of
brands that will have global clout and awareness with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately all media have to go global,'' he said. ``AOL is a
global medium, CNN is a semi-global medium, Time is semi-global. It
is a brilliant thing to do. AOL will be the opportunity for them to
become the global media company.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ries believes that the deal will create enough problems
right here at home to keep executives of the new company busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the synergies are phony synergies. (At CNN,
after it become part of Time Warner) did the additions of Time and
Sports Illustrated make the programming any better? It didn't
increase the number of viewers to CNN. It's the same thing as the
Disney/ABC merger. You are competing with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheth says ``that's a legitimate fear, but the opposite is true
too.'' He sees value in consolidating some of the brands since
``too many brands also create tremendous amount of cost of
maintaining those brands. There are no economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what will eventually happen is that you will have
brands created for a specific medium ... and each medium could have
a common brand name. CNN becomes identified with cable; AOL with
the Internet, Time Life with publishing.''

`Backdoor' benefits seen for MindSpring 
By Frances Katz  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The AOL and Time Warner merger took nearly everyone by
surprise, including Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big, bad kid on the block just got a lot bigger and
badder,'' says Charles Brewer, MindSpring's founder, chairman and
chief executive. ``It's a pretty powerful-looking ship they are
building up there.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Miles Russ, Internet services analyst with Robinson
Humphrey, says the merger could be a ``backdoor benefit'' for the
MindSpring/EarthLink combination.
</P>
<P>
   Russ says that eventually AOL Time Warner will be seen more as a
traditional media company, with MindSpring the biggest pure
Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good psychological advantage for MindSpring to
have,'' Russ says, citing terms of future partnerships with media
companies. ``It really raises the profile of what MindSpring can be
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring will come out of its merger with 3 million
subscribers. ``That's critical mass,'' Russ says, ``and the only
ISP out there that will offer the kind of audience to offer goods
and services and turn subscribers into shoppers as AOL has done.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also AOL Time Warner's stated decision to open its
high-speed cable modem lines to competitors such as MindSpring.
Brewer is enthusiastic but wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people don't want to be beholden to only one
option,'' Brewer says. ``People are looking for a viable other
choice, and I think that's the big obvious win from our point of
view. When I first heard the news, I wondered what it would mean
for open access, but this is just unambiguously great.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer has been one of the most vocal proponents in Washington
for the OpenNet coalition, which has been lobbying Congress and the
Federal Communications Commission to either legislate or regulate
access for Internet service providers over cable's high-speed modem
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first of many, many steps on the road,'' Brewer
says.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer says he views the AOL Time Warner deal in the same way he
views MindSpring's agreement with AT&AMP;T to allow MindSpring access
to AT&AMP;T's cable services. ``It's not the whole game,'' he says,
``but it's a big piece. ...The particulars of their commitment to
openness remain to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Russ:''Time will tell. Yes, there will be competitive
access, but how much of a head start this will give AOL is unclear,
and there is really no incentive to work with anyone now that they
have the big giant monolith. How much (competitors) will be willing
to pay is one question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a giant step forward,'' he says, ``but it's a giant step
with an asterisk.''

AOL/TIME WARNER MERGER: How Dominant is too dominant? 
By Frances Katz  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The long arm of AOL Time Warner will soon be able to
touch nearly every consumer in North America and, potentially, the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The merger announced Monday between the world's largest Internet
service provider and the world's largest media empire means
whenever you pick up a magazine, turn on the TV, flip to a cable
channel, go to the movies or log on to the Internet, AOL Time
Warner will probably be there with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is too much to say that this really is a
historic merger; a time when we've transformed the landscape of
media and the Internet,'' AOL chairman and CEO Steve Case, 41, said
at a press conference Monday. He will become chairman of the new
company. ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make the
Internet as central to people's lives as the telephone and the
television.''
</P>
<P>
   In marrying old media with new media, the deal sets a completely
new agenda for the information and entertainment industry in this
country and the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting,'' says Jeff Sadler, an analyst with
FAC/Equities in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up a lot of things. The big question is what's next
for AT&AMP;T, Yahoo and Disney. It's no longer good enough for AT&AMP;T to
bring connections to everybody everywhere. It's not good enough for
Disney to be a powerhouse media company, and it's not good enough
anymore for Yahoo to be the biggest portal,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to build something of equal consequence (to the AOL
Time Warner deal), you'd have to effectively merge all three of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal also makes Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises the
largest independent Internet Service provider in the country. After
its merger with California-based EarthLink Network, it will boast
three million subscribers and could eventually follow in merger
footsteps and partner with another major media player. For other
local companies, such as cable provider Cox Communications, the
deal changes the competitive landscape and will likely prompt them
to reexamine their strategies. In the near term, it's business as
usual at Turner Broadcasting, but long term plans remain
undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a watershed moment for the Internet,'' said
Forrester Research senior analyst Dan O'Brien. ``The distinction
between old media and new media is gone, and there will be a lot of
scrambling among other media and Internet companies to find similar
combinations. O'Brien says the deal clearly solves a bigger problem
for Time Warner than it does for AOL. ``AOL has broadband issues,''
he says, ``but Time Warner has stubbed it's toe repeatedly in the
digital world.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet veterans will remember that Time Warner's ill-fated
Pathfinder.com, was literally one of the first commercial sites on
the Web. However, despite powerful brand names and a serious
commitment to new media, Time Warner has never been able to develop
an Internet strategy that works. With AOL, they are able to solve
their online dilemma without breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sadler, an analyst with FAC/Equities in Boston says how AOL
and Time Warner combine their assets in the future is the key to
how successful the merger will ultimately be. ``The $350 billion
question is what new things is AOL Time Warner going to create?''
Sadler says. ``Is this just a reshuffling of the card deck or is it
a whole new card deck? If this is just another way of looking at
content, this is not worth the $350 billion valuation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's optimistic that the size and scope of the merger
could bring on a new wave of creativity and innovation from smaller
companies from incubators like eCompanies or Atlanta's eHatchery to
pitch their technologies to AOL Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the promise of this merger,'' he says. ``That something
new _ some new aspect of new media _ will come out of it. What we
have today _ libraries of film, magazines, TV shows and movies and
millions of broadband and dial-up customers is not new,'' he says.
AOL Time Warner has to be something more than just another venue
for TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is all about change,'' he says. ``Three years
ago we didn't know what the Internet was going to bring. What AOL
did was usher in all the tools to potentially give us things we
have not yet seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and observers agree that both sides will come up
winners in the deal, being billed as a ``merger of equals.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagdish Sheth, Kelllstadt Professor of marketing at Goizueta
School of Business says the merger was inevitable and very
practical. ``Basically, both companies are content companies,''
Sheth says, adding that the AOL/Time Warner deal will bring
together the various types of media ranging from print publishing
to Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all store, process and distribute information,'' he says.
``They are separated by technology, but soon we are going to see
three horizontal industries. The first is content _ integrated
content _ the original model of Time, Inc. The merger of publishing
and entertainment, that is now Time Warner is already done,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the biggest content nobody at Time Warner could understand
was the content on the Internet side, and that's where AOL comes
in. It was inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   From AOL's perspective, a deal with a major media company that
also owned a major cable operator was also inevitable, according to
Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst with Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both needed each other,'' she says. ``AOL would have
floundered without access to the cable pipes. Time Warner was
everyone's favorite whipping boy with their Internet blunders. For
AOL, they were very anxious to get into the home and go through
cable. It's not surprising that AOL finally struck a deal with one
of the cable players,'' she says. ``We thought they had something
up their sleeve, but we didn't think it was of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree this is the most ambitious merger of its
time, combining a 21st century Internet company with a legendary
20th century media company. They also agree that CEO Gerald Levin
is the one person who can make the merger work and move the company
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great success story of Time Warner is that despite the
great difference in cultures (of the other companies they've merged
with including Atlanta's Turner Broadcasting) is they've been able
to merge it right,'' says Emory's Sheth. ``Levin has the great
knack of putting together those synergies and that creates value
for shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Levin is the manager,'' Sadler says. ``He is really going to
have to hit these guys hard to get them all to go in the same
direction. That's going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester's O'Brien also cites the Byzantine corporate politics
of Time Warner that could keep the new company from moving forward
as some media watchers hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner comes from the world of slow decentralized
decision making,'' O'Brien says. ``AOL comes from an environment of
very quick deals. You have to move fast in the Internet. If the new
company is an 800 pound gorilla, then an 800 pound gorilla is not
going to be that light on its feet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think AOL's (president and COO) Bob Pittman and Ted Turner
are the key to the future of this company,'' Sadler says. ``I have
a feeling we'll all be watching the the Braves games from our
desktops before too long.''

   The America Online-Time Warner merger was such a closely guarded
secret that even the journalists who work for Time Warner, from its
magazines likes Time, Fortune and Money, to its television channels
like CNN, had no inkling it was about to happen. But it became
clear as the news spread Monday that the deal would have a
potentially enormous impact on the company's individual units.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate was seen for CNN, which would benefit from
the promotional strength offered by AOL's 20 million subscribers. A
huge impact, if not immediate, is also expected for Time Warner's
music division, which will become the first major record company to
be so closely affiliated with an Internet company with an ability
to deliver music online.
</P>
<P>
   One executive, who was involved in the deal but insisted on
anonymity, foresaw CNN becoming the key anchor of AOL's news area.
``The news area may be renamed CNN. Or I could envision a new area
that has the look and feel of CNN on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the clear goals for AOL has been to become more and
more important globally,'' said one senior executive who was
involved in the merger deal. ``And there is no more global brand
than CNN. The reality is that CNN will be part of a super charge
forward internationally by AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is completed, CNN is likely to be prominently
cross-promoted to Internet users by AOL, and CNN would
cross-promote AOL's services during its programs.
</P>
<P>
   AOL has an existing deal with CBS to be its broadcast news
partner. The executive involved in the merger agreement said, ``The
CBS deal is for a finite period of time.'' He added quickly, ``AOL
won't be making any efforts to push partners out. That would
obviously bring some interest on the anti-trust side. But the
agreement with CBS is for the USA only. AOL could do a CNN
international connection.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive said that news stories _ rather than appearing on
CNN first, then in a reformatted version online later _ could be
delivered to several news platforms simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   But executives at CNN emphasized that the chief executives at
both AOL and Time Warner had given complete assurances that CNN's
journalistic mission would not be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Music Group, which has been in a free fall recently,
could also be transformed by the promotional and digital
distribution opportunities of AOL.
</P>
<P>
   It is that digital technology _ the ability of consumers to
easily and quickly download music directly off the internet _ that
prompted Robert W. Pittman, the president and chief operating
officer of AOL, to predict Monday that the new company will be
``doing for the next decade what the CD did for the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said that because ``the music business is built on
exhibition,'' the merger with AOL would allow Warner Bros.
unprecedented promotional access to the millions of AOL daily
viewers. He also pointed out the benefit of finding musical talent
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third, it's not an accident that music lends itself to
electronic commerce as a packaged good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.,
said that the new alignment catapults Time-Warner and its ailing
music division onto a different plane and may change the
recorded-music industry at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL was happy to sell their audience eyeballs to other
companies trying to sell their own music,'' he said. ``But they
were not trying to advance the industry in terms of consumer
technology and now they have that obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No other of the four major record companies will have this
marketing and promotional clout, the ability to show 20 million
people the new Warner Bros. musical act every morning on AOL,'' he
said. ``It's impressive and it's hard to build that kind of traffic
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The music division posted third-quarter earnings in October 1999
of $76 million before interest, taxes and amortization, down from
$99 million in the third quarter the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of film, the transaction should give Time-Warner's film
studio, Warner Brothers, a vast new medium for distributing its
movies and television programs. Indeed, the merger is expected to
spur Warner Brothers' rival studios to move more aggressively onto
the Internet. Some analysts say there could be a spate of deals
between studios and Internet companies similar to those that have
already occurred in which filmmaking operations have been combined
with cable and television distribution, as exemplified by Viacom's
recent purchase of CBS. Hollywood in general has been somewhat wary
of the Internet, which is unfamiliar to Hollywood and is seen as
contributing to piracy of its programs and threatening its hold on
creating and distributing entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that upstart AOL has now swallowed the world's largest
media company is likely to contribute to a feeling of insecurity
among entertainment moguls, who are seeing their wealth surpassed
and their seats at the best Hollywood restaurants usurped by the
new media titans _ young e-commerce entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But Warner Brothers has been more aggressive than most studios
in trying to exploit the Internet. In November it launched
Entertaindom, a Web site showing its Looney Tunes cartoons as well
as a variety of programs made just for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For Time Inc., Time-Warner's magazine division, the changes will
most likely manifest themselves first in the arena of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc.'s revenues for 1998 were $4.5 billion to Time-Warner's
$26.8 billion. Time Inc. will become a relatively smaller entity in
the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Time-Warner has tried to exploit the content of Time Inc.
magazines _ Time, People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune are among
the company's titles _ in the electronic universe. Its ardent but
foiled foray into the Internet, the Pathfinder portal, was shut
down last year, and since then it has been reconfiguring its
Internet presence under new management.
</P>
<P>
   Generally recognized as the highest-grossing magazine publisher
in the world, Time Inc. publishes 31 magazines that in 1998
accounted for 21 percent of the total advertising revenues
generated by U.S. consumer magazines. Combined advertising and
subscription revenue for People, Time and Sports Illustrated _
three of the top five highest-grossing magazines in the United
States _ tally up to almost $2.5 billion for 1998. The only
specific provision made for Time Inc. magazines in the announced
deal pertained to In Style magazine, Time Inc.'s frothy celebrity
fashion monthly, which America Online will begin to incorporate
into its Internet service, expanding on the content already
supplied to AOL by People, Teen People and Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Nelson, In Style's managing editor, said that the
magazine had been planning to introduce In Style.com in 2000, a
content and electronic commerce site that will offer clothing and
other goods for purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will clearly make it a more secure strategy,'' she said.

TIME TO GET REAL AND CHANGE THAT BATTERY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: When I bought my computer in 1994, the clock
was so accurate that I used to set my watch by it. A few weeks ago,
I noticed my clock was a few minutes off. This variance has now
gotten so bad that when I boot up each morning, my clock and date
will be as much as 48 hours late. _ Clock Watcher
</P>
<P>
   Dear Watcher: If your PC has been around since 1994, I'm
surprised the whole thing isn't falling apart. A computer of that
vintage can have all sorts of things go wrong: The steam turbine
bearings could burn out, the mainspring might go ``sproinng,'' and
even the hand crank could break off if the gearbox freezes.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing you might check is the clock battery. If I recall
correctly, yours is made of strips of metal suspended in a series
of acid-filled bell jars, connected by heavy-gauge wires. It's
probably worn out after all these years, so it can't hurt to get a
replacement, which you can get at just about any computer store.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to pop the top on the PC, find the old battery, then
make the switch, but that's relatively easy, especially if you're
one of the three or four computer owners in this country who hasn't
thrown away the manual. One precaution: Get into the PC's setup
program and write down all the stuff you find there in the event
that unhooking the old battery flushes your computer's identity
down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   I've never owned a computer with a real-time clock that didn't
stink, so I'm surprised that yours worked as well as it did. If the
battery doesn't fix things, get a time synchronizer from a
shareware site like www.tucows.com. These dealies go out on the
Internet and check the time at someplace official like the U.S.
Naval Observatory, then set your system clock. I'm assuming, of
course, that your Samuel Morse-autographed modem is still sending
out those dots and dashes.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: What are the pros and cons of leaving the
computer on all day as opposed to shutting it down? I am on and off
the Internet three or four times a day. What should I do? _ Chicken
or Egg
</P>
<P>
   Dear Egg: Stop spending so much time on the Internet and go
outside for some fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   Don't try to figure out who's right in this argument, because
it's been going on since some caveperson turned on the first
computer shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared. You leave the
thing on, and the moving parts will wear out as the accumulated
heat slowly fries things. You turn it on each time you sit down to
work, and the sudden surges of power will eventually kill things.
In real life, by the time any major damage is done either way, your
computer will be so obsolete you ought to replace it. Unless you're
the guy in the first question, that is.
</P>
<P>
   I turn mine off on those rare occasions when I haven't passed
out at the keyboard after a three-day Quake death match, but the
only reason I do is that I have a continuous connection to the
Internet with a nonchanging address, and I'm slightly paranoid
about all those nasty things I used to say about hackers. If you
use a dial-up account, you don't have that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: My regular telephone broke, and I wanted to use
the phone dialer in Win98. It dials OK and the call goes out OK,
but I don't hear the person's voice on my speakers. _ Mr. Watson's
Nightmare
</P>
<P>
   Dear Nightmare: Uh, the dialer only dials the number. You can't
actually use it to talk to other people. Got 10 bucks? Go buy a
phone.
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Emilio Bombay is ordinarily much meaner than that. He let
that last guy off entirely too easily. Something must be wrong.

THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF COOKING IN THIS CD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Y2K has passed and home computers are still running,
let's assume the gas, electric and water services are still
working. That way, The Complete MasterCook Suite Featuring Betty
Crocker can be put to work in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The program (Windows; about $45-$50) is not simply another
cooking program, notes publisher SierraHome. It is five complete
recipe collections, making it the largest collection of Betty
Crocker recipes on CD-ROM. There are about 1,000 recipes from Betty
Crocker and another 5,000 from MasterCook Deluxe.
</P>
<P>
   The program allows users to search through recipes by
ingredient, watch video clips for instructions and develop
plan-ahead menus. Recipes can be imported from the Internet, and
the program can provide an instant analysis of any recipes. The
recipes can also be sent through e-mail to friends.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most impressive new features is an ``import
assistant'' which lets users take recipes from the Web and drop
them directly into the program. In addition, a rating system allows
cooks to customize a recipe's attributes based on personal judgment
to rank the recipe's spiciness, preparation time and other
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   The suite includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Crocker's Cooking Basics, with more than 100 simple
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Crocker's Best of Baking, featuring 350 baked recipes
ranging from break to desserts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Crocker's Best of Healthy and Hearty Cooking has more
than 400 recipes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Crocker's Cookie Book offers 225 cookie recipes.
</P>
<P>
   MasterCook Deluxe 5.0 is a collection of more than 5,000 recipes
from food associations, well-known chefs and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The suite also has a pantry management system and more advanced
search capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   MINDGYM: Here's a fun program that works the brain harder than
the mouse: Mind-Gym from Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive. This series
of mental exercises with an attitude won the British Academy of
Film and Television Arts' Best Comedy CD award.
</P>
<P>
   The program's interface is like a gym, and a changing room
provides the center of activity. There, first-time users are told
to sign in, then given a series of puzzles and challenges to
determine mental strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it is off to three areas: a game room; pool of
ideas; and a think tank. There are progress reports along the way
and the challenges get harder as the player gets better.
</P>

MOST PCS HAVE MAINTENANCE SOFTWARE, BUT USERS MAY WANT TO MAKE
ADDITIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: Santa was good to me. Got a new computer for
Christmas. Sure beats the old 486 I was using. I read your section
every week, but I want to know just what kind of software I need to
keep it running. Does it come with everything I need to maintain
it, or is there something I should buy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most modern PCs have a slew of features that help keep them
running well, but you have to know where they are and how to use
them. Most computer makers don't point you to them for a variety of
reasons, including worries that novices might do more harm than
good.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Windows 98 comes with a feature called the
Maintenance Wizard that automates the process of defragmenting your
hard drive, removing temporary files and scanning the hard drive
for errors. It can also be used to turn off programs that launch
automatically via the Startup folder. You can find this wizard in
the Accessories/System Tools folder.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful Windows feature overlooked by many users is the
System Information Utility, also found in Accessories/System Tools.
On the surface, it looks as though all it does is give you detailed
information about your system. But there's a Tools menu item that
is full of goodies, including programs that can restore missing or
corrupt files and another that can turn off even more items that
launch automatically through the Registry.
</P>
<P>
   There are other things you need for maintaining your PC that
don't come with it, or or if they do, they are anemic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some PCs come with a virus scanner. But often it
includes only one or two free upgrades to a database of known
viruses. Since new viruses are found all the time, it's important
to keep your virus signatures up to date. You should either buy a
full-powered antivirus program or upgrade the one that came with
your computer. This is going to cost you some money, but you'll be
glad you did it. The two most popular are McAfee's VirusScan
(www.mcafee.com) and Norton AntiVirus (www.symantec.com).
</P>
<P>
   Also, all Windows users should have an un-install program on
their systems. Even though Windows comes with its own Add/Remove
Programs module in the Control Panel, you may find programs you
want to remove that don't have a listing there. This category of
software usually has other useful features, such as deleting
temporary files or transferring programs between drives or even
between computers.
</P>
<P>
   The two most popular are Norton's CleanSweep and McAfee's
UnInstaller.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you're willing to tackle problems yourself, you may
want to get a utility suite, such as McAfee Office 2000, Ontrack's
SystemSuite 2000 or Norton SystemWorks 2000. These are collections
of software designed to track down and fix problems. If you are a
serious novice but nervous about getting under the hood of your PC,
these programs can help.
</P>
<P>
   These suites also contain both antivirus and un-install
programs, and you save money by buying them as a package.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My new hobby is converting my old photos into digital
pictures on my computer. I've been using the JPG format, and have
been putting the pictures into ZIP files to save space. But I
notice that when I check the properties of the ZIPs, they don't
appear to have been compressed much. Is there any way to shrink
them further?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're trying to compress a file format that's already
compressed. The JPG format is ``tight'' already, and you're getting
only a couple of percentage points of extra compression by using
ZIP files. Unless you're working with larger file formats, such as
BMP, there's not much sense in using ZIP compression to store them.

HIDDEN PROGRAMS THAT CAN THROW YOU
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If you're one of the many who found a new computer
under the Christmas tree, and that shiny new PC was bought from a
retailer, chances are you got a lot more than you bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a name-brand personal computer that uses Windows 98,
watch during the boot-up process at the number of icons that appear
in what's called the system tray, the area to the right in the
taskbar at the bottom of the screen that shows the time.
</P>
<P>
   You'll probably find at least half a dozen icons there in the
typical consumer computer bought at retail _ maybe more. Each one
represents a program running in the background. And that's only the
tip of the iceberg. There are usually even more active background
programs that don't place icons in the tray. You don't know they're
there unless you know how and where to look.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of these computers will tell you that these programs
add features that you'll like. But what they won't tell you is that
they can slow down a PC's performance, conflict with other programs
and possibly make your computing life a living hell.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, PC makers aren't solely to blame. The
services these background programs offer usually are useful and
well-intentioned. Manufacturers add these programs to make PCs
easier to use as well as to differentiate themselves from
competitors. You can also blame Microsoft's Windows 95/98 and the
way it manages what are called resources.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CLOGGING POCKETS OF MEMORY
</P>
<P>
   Windows resources have little or nothing to do with the amount
of memory or hard-drive space on your computer. You can have
hundreds of megabytes of RAM and dozens of gigabytes of hard-drive
space and still run out of resources in short order.
</P>
<P>
   Resources are pockets of memory that Windows sets aside to
manage the operating system's status. They track such things as the
positions of open windows and applications, how memory is allocated
and what drivers are active.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of the legacy of Windows 3.1, the Microsoft shell
that protected early PC users from the horrors of the MS-DOS
command line. With the introduction of Windows 95, the amount of
resources increased dramatically. But modern programs take up more
resources than old Windows 3.1 software, so what was once a bounty
is again a pittance.
</P>
<P>
   This problem recently came to light with owners of new Compaq
Computer Corp. Presario machines. Owners of some models began
experiencing what appeared to be random lockups. But they weren't
random, and they weren't lockups.
</P>
<P>
   What was happening, according to a company spokeswoman, was that
Windows ran low on resources when a Compaq-specific application
kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   The program goes to a Compaq site on the Internet and checks for
updates to key software on the computer. The idea is to make it
easy to keep a system up to date. This is something many users
aren't aware should be done, or they don't know how, or they simply
don't want to be bothered. Automating the process, in theory, is a
good idea.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SLOWDOWN LOOKED LIKE LOCKUP
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Presario owners, however, was that the program
would _ when combined with all the other programs that were running
_ drain Windows' resources. The systems would slow to a crawl,
which appeared to many users to be a lockup. In reality, the
computer had slowed down, and after a period of about a minute or
so, the spokeswoman said, activity would return to normal.
</P>
<P>
   But most users interpreted this slowdown as a lockup, and began
hitting buttons and clicking the mouse. This further overloaded
Windows' resources, and caused a real lockup, or a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has fixed this with a patch that changes how its own
software works. But it still doesn't address the root problem _
that many PCs are overloaded with background programs and Windows
can't handle that gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is not alone in loading up its consumer PCs with
background programs, though the Houston-based company is certainly
zealous about it. Buy a system from Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Gateway
or a manufacturer that sells to consumers and you'll find virus
checkers, keyboard-button managers, video- and sound-settings
control panels, crash protectors and programs that check the Net
for updates. On computers that have rewriteable CD-ROM drives,
you'll find one or two more background programs running. And
notebook computers are even worse.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is aggravated by programs that users install later
that run even more background components. For example, install any
of the popular utilities suites, such as McAfee Office or Norton
SystemWorks, and watch your system tray get even more crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, you can turn off a lot of these programs, disabling
them so they don't launch when your computer starts. On a Presario
5900 I recently tested, only 74 percent of system resources were
available on bootup. By turning off what I considered to be
non-essential, I got that number up to 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (You can find out how many system resources are available by
running the Resource Meter. Go to Start, Programs, Accessories,
System Tools, then click on Resource Meter. It appears as an icon
on the task bar and, yes, it also takes up resources. To learn how
to find and disable background programs, see the column I wrote
last February at
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/02/19/compute.html.)
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokeswoman said the company is working on ways of
increasing system resources in the next version of its consumer
operating system, which has the working name of Millennium and is
due out sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   But until Microsoft fixes the problem _ which, by the way, is
not a factor in Windows NT or the upcoming Windows 2000, both aimed
at corporate users _ PC makers should be more judicious in their
use of background programs. And they should work harder to make
sure their background programs use as few resources as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Users should be given a choice, either when they first turn on a
new computer or through a one-stop control panel, of what is
allowed to run in the background. Although you can do this now
through the System Information utility in Windows 98, it's not a
particularly friendly program. A graphical version, which clearly
explains what each program does and how many resources are
consumed, would be more useful.
</P>

`NEXT FRIDAY' A LOT LIKE `LAST FRIDAY'

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this sequel to the popular, crude comedy ``Friday,'' Ice Cube
once again plays the only reasonable man among a passel of lunatics
and excrement jokes. In that and most other ways, ``Next Friday''
isn't very much different from its predecessor. There is no Chris
Tucker in this one (which, though a mercy to some of us, will
disappointment many). And it largely takes place in Cucamonga
rather than South Central, which means nicer homes and cars, but
everyone in the suburbs is just as broad a caricature as the folks
in the first movie's 'hood were.
</P>
<P>
   As far as thematic variations on the concept go, that's about
it.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Cube's Craig _ despite being the smartest individual
in a several-mile radius _ still has no job. But he does have a
huge problem: Debo (Tiny Lister, reprising his ``Friday'' hulk) has
escaped from jail and is out to get the guy who so embarrassingly
whupped him.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing for his safety, Craig hides out in his lottery-winning
Uncle Elroy's (Don ``D.C.'' Curry) suburban digs. But even as Debo
slowly _ very slowly _ tracks him down, Craig discovers paradise
can be as wacky and dangerous as his old stomping grounds.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, his cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps, less irritating
than Tucker but not as funny, either) is being stalked by an
unhinged pregnant woman who Craig describes, in one of the film's
few witty lines, as ``worse than Left Eye from TLC.'' The hardcase
Latino ex-cons across the cul-de-sac will also prove problematic,
especially after Craig falls for their sweet sister Karla (Lisa
Rodriguez). And then there's the fact that irresponsible Uncle
Elroy has squandered the remains of his lottery winnings on chronic
and sex toys, and a serious property tax bill is coming due.
</P>
<P>
   There are also jokes about bad dogs, more drugs and every ethnic
stereotype imaginable. The pacing is leisurely at its quickest, and
the often broad performances are mainly adequate, with Cube's
controlled bemusement and Jacob Vargas' energetic portrayal of the
key bad neighbor standing out. John Witherspoon is back and more
manic than ever as Craig's dad, and Lister, once again, limits his
performance to barking threats and bonking people's heads.
</P>
<P>
   Cube wrote the script as well as produced. Music-video whiz
Steve Carr makes his feature-directing debut. If you liked the
first one, you probably won't care for this one as much but will
think it's OK. If you're not part of the franchise's apparently
devoted following, nothing in ``Next Friday'' is likely to make a
convert out of you. &QL;

PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to a pair of studies recently released by the Wharton
School of Business, on-line shopping could be in trouble: although
total spending was up in 1999, the average number of dollars spent
per Internet user was down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a growing number of Internet users are dropping out
and going permanently off line, the reports found.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers at Wharton, who have tracked more than 23,000
Internet users since 1997, say that the single biggest factor
depressing on-line sales is concern about privacy _ and
specifically, monitoring by third parties.
</P>
<P>
   A second big factor is an unwillingness to trust the on-line
business with private data.
</P>
<P>
   Web surfers are right to worry: what you do on line reveals a
tremendous amount of information about who you are, what you
believe, how you spend your money, and what you do with your time.
It's all too easy for Web businesses to correlate this information
into a highly detailed profile.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways that consumers can be harmed by an on-line
profile. First, it can reveal information that a person might wish
to keep secret. Second, the information itself can be incorrect or
incomplete, causing the revealed picture to be not just invasive,
but unfair and misleading.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last November I bought some videos from Amazon.com.
Then, on a whim, I went to Amazon's recommendations page to see
what movies Amazon computers thought I would like, based on my
previous book and video purchases. One of the movies was ``Goodbye,
Emma Jo,'' which turned out to be an erotic lesbian film. I had
never bought pornography before, although I had purchased women's
fiction and literature. Now, since I bought the ``Emma Jo'' movie,
every time I ask Amazon for movie recommendations, about half of
the movies turn out to be lesbian porn.
</P>
<P>
   I find this whole situation somewhat amusing. But somebody else
might be offended, or might be worried that Amazon is spreading
misleading information to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet business community realizes that on-line privacy is
an issue that's not going away, so over the past few years
companies like Amazon have taken steps to address some consumer
fears. Many Web sites have posted a so-called privacy policy that
explains what kind of personal information they collect and what
they do with it. Some companies (but not Amazon) have signed up
with TRUSTe (www.truste.com) or BBB Online (www.bbbonline.com),
organizations that promise to enforce these voluntary privacy
policies.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Amazon's privacy policy says: ``Amazon.com does
not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We
may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties,
but you can tell us not to by sending a blank e-mail message to
never(at)amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not that is a legally binding promise is hard to
tell. If I were depending on Amazon's policy, and it were to
change, I wouldn't have much recourse.
</P>
<P>
   Another big problem with these privacy policies is that they are
all written in English. That means that you have to take the time
to find each site's privacy policy and then read it before you can
decide whether you wish to do business. An alternative to these
English-language policies is for companies to use some kind of
unambiguous computer language to describe their privacy practices.
You then could program your computer to download automatically the
privacy policy for every site you visit and give you a warning if
the site's policy offends your sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea behind the World Wide Web Consortium's Platform
for Privacy Preferences (P3P) project. Beyond screening out Web
sites that refuse to respect your privacy, the system also can
transfer your personal information to Web sites that you deem
acceptable. For example, some Web sites won't let you browse their
pages unless you provide them with your name, e-mail address, and
zip code. With P3P, you could program your computer to
automatically provide this information to a Web site if the site
met your privacy criteria.
</P>
<P>
   There's been a lot of industry support behind P3P, with public
testimonials from AOL, IBM, Microsoft, Netscape and others. It's
quite possible that this technology will be built into your Web
browser before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody thinks that P3P is the answer to the
Internet's privacy dilemma. One problem with the system for
automatically sending personal information to Web sites is that P3P
makes it harder for users to provide false information, a technique
used by many surfers to protect their privacy today. Another
problem with P3P, as it is envisioned currently, is that it
transmits a tremendous amount of personal information about the
user to the Web site, but little information about the Web site is
sent to the user to assist in making a privacy judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What type of business is it? Is it a private or a public
company? Where is it incorporated? Is it a subsidiary of another
company, and if so, which one? Unfortunately, P3P does not allow a
user to ask any of these important questions,'' writes Christopher
D. Hunter, a doctoral candidate at the Annenberg School for
Communication, in an article he recently finished on the topic. The
fundamental problem with P3P, argues Hunter, is that it does not
ensure an individual's privacy, only ``industry's view of
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, this is a general failing on the Internet today. An
important principle in data protection is for individuals to be
able to see their records and correct factual errors. But there is
no way for me to get into Amazon.com's database and convince its
computers that I am not a connoisseur of lesbian porn.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's article, which makes for excellent reading about both
P3P and on-line privacy in general, can be found at

FLAT-OUT EXPENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're the sort of person who'd pay $25,000 for a car, and
another $40,000 for the windshield, the computer display industry
is looking for you.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when you can get a high-quality PC for $1,000,
companies are offering flashy flat-panel displays costing well over
two grand. I've been tinkering with one of them _ the SyncMaster
TFT700, a sleek 17-inch flat-panel unit from Samsung Electronics of
South Korea, one of the leading makers of liquid crystal screens
for laptop and desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   The SyncMaster is the sort of flat-panel monitor that could give
these devices a good name. I've seen my share of cheesy-looking
15-inch flat monitors that sell for $1,000 or so. Once the
futuristic thrill fades, I notice the lackluster image quality, and
the way the image looks gray and faded if you view the monitor from
even a slight angle.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to the CRTs _ the traditional cathode-ray tube
monitors. CRTs are fat and heavy, compared with the flat-panel
screens. But CRTs offer bright, sharp pictures that don't fade when
you look at the screen from an angle. Besides, CRTs are a whole lot
cheaper _ $350 or so for a 17-incher.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, flat-panels take up a lot less space, and use that
space more efficiently. Some of the surface of a 17-inch CRT tube
is actually hidden behind the monitor's frame, so the viewable area
is smaller. But with a 17-inch flat-panel, you really get 17
inches. Besides, no matter what's on the screen, flat-panel
displays have a Keanu Reeves-ish aura of sci-fi cool that's always
good for impressing the yokels.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still reactionary types like me who think a
monitor is only as good-looking as the images it displays. For us,
the flat-panel people are now serving up monitors that match up
well against the finest CRTs. Too bad I can't afford one.
</P>
<P>
   The Samsung unit weighs in at $2,400, and good as it is, I'm not
completely content with it. Even after careful tuning, the screen
displays text with a slightly jagged quality. The individual
picture elements, or pixels, are more evident than on a CRT
display, and so text doesn't appear quite as smooth. In addition,
moving images don't ``refresh'' as fast on a flat-panel as on a
CRT. I saw some unwelcome smearing and jaggedness as I soared over
the deserts of Iraq in a virtual F-15 fighter plane.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the colors come across rich and sharp. In a
side-by-side comparison with a new Korea Data Systems 15-inch CRT
monitor, I'd give the Samsung a slight edge in color reproduction.
And the Samsung has successfully tackled the viewing-angle problem
that plagues flat-panel units. You can still make out images on the
screen even when standing to one side and several feet away.
</P>
<P>
   One limit on the Samsung screen's quality is its compatibility
with standard computer video cards. These emit a stream of analog
data that a traditional CRT can handle. But flat-panel displays are
actually digital devices, and they deliver their best performance
when linked to digital video cards. Samsung compromised by building
a display that would work with millions of existing video cards, at
the cost of somewhat lower performance.
</P>
<P>
   Other makers of elite flat-panel monitors are more daring. With
its $2,400 1600SW monitor, Silicon Graphics Inc. bundles in a
digital video card designed by Lexington-based Number Nine Visual
Technology Corp., which recently filed for bankruptcy. Silicon
Graphics says another firm will keep making the cards, which is
just as well. The 17-inch 1600SW is quite a stunner, with
spectacularly lavish color.
</P>
<P>
   I'd cheerfully throw my CRT in the trash in exchange for the new
display from Apple Computer Inc. Their 22-incher is called the
Cinema Display, and with good reason: You could set this thing up
in your living room and watch ``Lawrence of Arabia'' on it. It's
decisively the best flat-panel monitor I've ever seen, and at
$4,000 it had better be. Make that $6,500. The Cinema Display can't
be bought as a separate item, so you'll have to take a $2,500 Apple
G4 computer as well.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's got the makings of a good idea here. The complex
manufacturing process for flat panels means that high-quality ones
will be expensive for years to come, even as computers keep getting
cheaper. Here's an idea: Sell the displays, and throw in a computer
for free.

800 INTERNET ADDRESSES REVOKED BECAUSE OF CHARACTER FLAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to avert a new twist on cybersquatting, the
body that oversees the Internet's address system said it was
revoking hundreds of new domain names because a software bug had
enabled people to claim addresses nearly identical to already
established Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The new trend, where people simply added a dash at the end of
registered addresses, resulted in new domains based on trademarks
like ``www.Microsoft-.com,'' ``www.yahoo-.com'' and a number of
short or catchy phrases, like ``inter-.net.''
</P>
<P>
   The revocation, approved late Tuesday night by the Internet
Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, is believed to the
first wholesale recall of Internet domain names. Officials said the
glitch was a byproduct of opening the lucrative business of
registering domain names to competition last year.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the revoked registrations, like
www.Microsoft-.com, could be classified as cybersquatting, the
practice of registering domain names with the intent of selling
them to others, especially trademark holders, at a hefty profit.
</P>
<P>
   Icann's president, Michael Roberts, said the more than 800
revoked addresses violated a long-standing policy that prohibits
any character but a numeral or letter at the end or beginning of a
domain name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake in the software,'' Roberts said. ``This was
something that shouldn't have been possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A check of the Internet addressing system's database indicates
that some of the registrations were made as early as November.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs who thought they had identified a new trend early
enough to cash in on it were crying foul Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Smith, the director of Consumer.net, a privacy resource for
consumers in Alexandria, Va., said he had registered 164 of the
now-revoked domain names at $30 apiece. He said neither Icann nor
BulkRegister.com, the company that registered his domains, had
informed him as of Wednesday that the registrations were invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there were a mistake, he said, the domains should not be
revoked, as some people have already hired Web hosting services and
begun spending money on establishing a Web presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time they also had a rule that no numbers could be used
in domain names,'' Smith said, ``then 3Com came along and they
changed the rules.''

FOX TRIES TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox Television Entertainment Group chairman Sandy Grushow
conceded Tuesday what everyone pretty much already knew: It's been
a lousy season for the Fox network.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a press conference during the semi-annual TV Press
Tour, Grushow _ who was installed to oversee the network in
November after its disastrous fall premiere _ was blunt in his
assessment of the network's performance and its over-reliance on
stunt ``reality'' programming. ``It has been a pretty challenging
and dissatisfying year,'' Grushow said, ``but it was one that has
been several years in the making.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox failed to prepare for ``the natural aging of our franchise
programs, we failed to replace them with new franchise shows, and
we overly relied on the quick fix of shock programs, to the
dilution of our valuable brand identity,'' Grushow continued.
``Saturating the network with blood-and-guts reality specials has
undercut what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that many of the specials oriented on themes of
destruction and human suffering that have already been produced
will not be aired on the network.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing Fox's change in direction, he talked up new
production deals with respected Hollywood talents. Chief among
these are a new series from ``ER'' creator Michael Crichton, about
which details have yet to be decided, as well as a long-term deal
with ``Ally McBeal'' creator David E. Kelley, two sitcoms from the
Carsey Werner production company (``That '70s Show'') and a series
entitled ``Dark Angel'' from filmmaker James Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the works: A live-action version of the comic book and
animated series ``The Tick,'' from filmmaker Barry Sonnenfeld;
``Fearsome,'' a series from the production company behind the film
hit ``The Blair Witch Project''; and ``The Street,'' a Wall Street
drama from ``Sex and the City'' creator Darren Starr. Actor Tom
Hanks is also developing a series for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   And, he vowed with particular vitriol while referring to a
previously reported piece of stunt broadcasting, ``The American
public will never see a 747 crash in the Mojave Desert on Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the high-profile washout of ``Action,'' a sitcom
that might have been controversial had audiences actually watched
it, Grushow said: ``I would rather fail with quality than succeed
with garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox entertainment president Doug Herzog _ joking that, ``Despite
appearances to the contrary, `beleaguered' is not part of my
official title'' _ likewise conceded defeat. ``We had a bad fall _
not like Sofia- Coppola-in-'Godfather III' bad, but
!ital!really!off! bad.'' Herzog admitted that the network's
association with the shock-reality programming had tainted its
image, which won't be immediately repaired once those specials
leave the network. ``Even if we went off them cold turkey, it'll
take years to shake that reputation _ it'll stay with the public,
it's hard to shake,'' Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog also allowed that the network is ``not terribly proud''
of ``Greed,'' the game show the network rushed onto the air in the
wake of the phenomenal success of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
on ABC. Grushow added that ABC's reliance on that show's popularity
could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ABC spends a lot of time and energy in promoting
`Millionaire' at the expense of other quality series, they could be
left high and dry,'' Grushow said.
</P>
<P>
   Placing Grushow above Herzog at the network was seen in some
circles as a sign that Herzog _ who has only been in his job for a
year _ was in trouble. Grushow declined to say that Herzog's
position was secured, but said that their working relationship was
growing. ``We were obviously just thrown together, and we're just
getting to know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The network enjoyed its first piece of encouraging news in
months, with the highly rated debut of the critically lauded comedy
``Malcolm in the Middle'' on Sunday evening. ``Malcolm'' scored
Fox's highest rating for a series premiere in a decade _ since, in
fact, Fox mainstay ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great script, the show had a clear voice, and there
was a masterful job of directing,'' Grushow enthused. ``It's very
true to itself.'' He said that the decision to keep the show from
premiering in the fall and bringing it in as a midseason
replacement helped it's success ``a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about Fox _ when we get it right, it's a
cultural phenomenon,'' Grushow said. ``When we get it wrong, it's
ugly.'' &QL;

CORPORATIONS RECOGNIZE GROWING VALUE OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The managers of Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co.'s Chicago
office know how to butter up the corporate VIPs. As a holiday gift,
they flew a quartet of jazz singers to the Hartford, Conn.,
headquarters in December to parade around in Mickey Mouse sweaters
and sing Christmas carols to the people who hold real power over
their professional lives.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet sang for the board of directors, of course. But they
also made a special, 25-minute stop in a nondescript room of
cubicles to sing for a group that the Chicago managers wanted to
please as much as anybody else: the computer help-desk staff.
</P>
<P>
   When the foursome had finished with ``O Holy Night'' (a favorite
of the man who answers the help desk's phone, they had heard),
``Silent Night'' and ``We Wish You a Merry Christmas,'' it seemed
clear that the effort at ingratiation had worked: The woman who
runs the help desk was crying.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when millions of white-collar workers depend on a
desktop computer to perform virtually every function of their job,
computer help-desk technicians are fast achieving a position of
unofficial influence that rivals that held by the office secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Given how frequently office computer networks break down, it is
technology support workers who often decide whether people must sit
stewing unproductively for hours or whether a software bug is just
a minor nuisance. As a result, staying in the good graces of the
help desk _ and figuring out which of its members are truly helpful
_ has become a delicate science for many of the nation's office
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The help desk's phone number is usually one of the few that
virtually all company employees know by heart. Some executives have
forged a friendship with a technology staffer they hope will become
their personal computer consultant. And, like the managers at
Phoenix Home Life, employees at all levels are using gifts to curry
favor with computer techies _ or perhaps make up for screaming at
them in a moment of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, behind all of the flattery is a serious issue, computer
industry experts say: There are still too few help-desk technicians
across the country. Some 250,000 and 300,000 employees currently
fit the description of internal technology support staff, up from
about 100,000 in 1992, according to Howard Rubin, the chairman of
the computer science department at Hunter College in New York. They
typically are paid about $25,000-$50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, as relief over the lack of Year 2000
computer problems has followed the gift-giving of the December
holidays, help-desk workers across the country have been bombarded
with homemade cookies, chocolate samplers, fancy lunches and
thank-you notes that are carbon-copied to key executives.
</P>

<P>
   At PricewaterhouseCoopers in New York, help-desk workers have
filled a wall with appreciative e-mails recounting their triumphs.
At the insurance company Marsh USA, word has gotten around that
tech workers in Memphis like salsa and chips, and orders have been
arriving from a nearby Mexican restaurant. And at Burson
Marsteller, the New York public relations firm and a unit of Young
&AMP; Rubicam Inc., the chief financial officer is planning to take out
the entire help desk for lunch at Angelo &AMP; Maxies, an upscale
steakhouse, to celebrate the trouble-free year-2000 changeover.

<P>
   ``We think computer systems have gotten easier,'' said Professor
Paul Danos, the dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.
``But the networks have gotten so complex that you can't do
anything for yourself anymore. You need to get someone to help you.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are usually a handful of people,'' Danos added,
referring to help-desk employees, ``who could really bring an
organization to its knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a growing recognition of the importance of help-desk
workers, the increase in their ranks has not kept pace with the
explosion of computer troubles that have accompanied the growth of
office PCs, internal corporate Web sites and complicated
cybernetworks. In the last four years, the number of calls to help
desks around the country has been increasing by about 20 percent a
year, said Kris Brittain, a research director at GartnerGroup, a
consulting firm in Stamford, Conn. And with unemployment low,
technically savvy help-desk workers are in strong demand,
particularly by nternet start-ups that can offer stock options.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the shortages, computer users at large companies
must often hold for minutes before their calls are answered and
even wait hours to have their troubles fixed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   More than 11 percent of all calls to help desks at large
companies are abandoned, according to GartnerGroup. On average,
callers wait about 53 seconds before hearing a human voice, the
firm said.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the overload, many companies have begun asking
employees to describe their problems in e-mail messages (assuming
that the e-mail system is functioning), rather than by calling.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida is typical. Its help desk
in Jacksonville has grown from 8 employees to 23 in the last
decade, said Anna Guy, who oversees it. But with about 24,000 phone
calls coming in every month, it remains understaffed, and it is not
coming close to meeting its goal of answering every call within 30
seconds, Ms. Guy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're short on staff,'' she said. ``We're in a slump.''
</P>
<P>
   An overworked help desk that must tend to more urgent requests
first and keep everybody else waiting is, of course, an inevitable
target of office apple-polishers. Recently, Ms. Guy and every
member of her staff received a road atlas from the marketing
department, which for the last two years has not had a secretary
and now relies on the help desk for many more tasks. Another group
of employees drove 20 minutes across Jacksonville to deliver a box
of Whitman's chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to go around and meet every single person on the
help desk,'' Ms. Guy said. ``Obviously, your human nature is that
when someone is nice to you, you're nice to them back.''
</P>
<P>
   That is especially the case for technology-support workers, who
spend their days talking to callers made angry by both computer
problems and help-desk delays. The waits only aggravate their
frustration, office workers said, causing technology support
workers to receive some of worst verbal abuse in Corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help desks are a pretty tough environment,'' said Rushdi
Ariss, the information technology manager for C.A. Rasmussen, a
construction company in Simi Valley, Calif., where help-desk
workers received both sweets and thank-you cards in December. ``Not
a lot of people are courteous'' when they call, he said, and
partially as a result, most help-desk workers quit or change jobs
in 18 months or less.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The abuse is another reason for all of the gifts of the last
month. ``I may not be the nicest person'' to the help desk
sometimes, acknowledged Rhet O'Neill, one of the managers of the
Chicago office of Phoenix Home Life. She doubles as a member of the
quartet that sang in Connecticut in December. So, Ms. O'Neill said,
she wanted to make sure that the help desk understood she did
appreciate their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You become important to them,'' she said, of meeting the
support workers in person, ``and therefore your problems become
important to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many executives have another strategy: They skip the help desk
and call a technology worker whose fix-it skills they revere and
whose number, likely as not, they keep hidden away from their
colleagues as though it were a state secret.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Towers Perrin, a management-consulting firm with 8,500
employees, everybody is supposed to start with the help desk for
all problems. But some top executives, like the chief information
officer, find a favorite ``level two'' technology expert they then
call directly, said Steve Stull, the director of office technology
and services. That allows them to avoid the help-desk lines and
help-desk workers who might not recognize their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often,'' Stull said, ``the younger people haven't been around
the firm very long, so they don't even know who the senior
executives are when they call in.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a generous gift can get their attention rather
quickly. The 10 members of Burson Marsteller's help desk, for
example, are unlikely to forget that for all of the obsequious
e-mail, fancy fruit baskets and succulent chocolates that they
received last year, it was chief financial officer Kurt Krauss who
took them out to a steak lunch.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if they all actually made it through the meal. The help
desk manager deliberately picked a restaurant on the same block as
Burson's headquarters. The workers, he realized, were too important
all to be far away from the office at the same time.

IBM TO USE LINUX SYSTEM IN INTERNET SOFTWARE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM, the standard-bearer of mainstream corporate computing,
plans to announce Sunday that it is placing a big bet on Linux, a
symbol of software's counterculture, as the operating system of the
future for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Linux campaign at the International Business Machines Corp.
will include substantial financial investment, an aggressive
marketing campaign and a reorganization. A high-profile IBM
executive, Irving Wladawsky-Berger, former general manager of the
Internet division, is being placed in charge of the company's
software development for Linux, a version of the Unix operating
system available free on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement by IBM is the most striking evidence to date
that Linux is no longer a fringe technology, one that has sometimes
been viewed askance as more a political movement than a serious
development in software.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo last Friday to Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the IBM
chairman, and to the rest of the senior management team, Samuel
Palmisano, a senior vice president, described the rise of Linux as
``an important shift in the technology world,'' as companies use
the Internet more and more to overhaul their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next generation of e-business will see customers
increasingly demand open standards for interoperability across
disparate platforms,'' Palmisano wrote. ``Linux _ a
community-developed version of Unix _ will play a pivotal role in
this. We will embrace Linux.''
</P>
<P>
   Linux is a leading example of so-called open-source software _
software that is distributed free, with its underlying source code
openly published. Open-source technology, like Linux, is developed
by an international community of programmers who also examine the
code to fix bugs and suggest improvements.
</P>
<P>
   In his memo, Palmisano said that IBM would retool all its own
software so that it runs smoothly on Linux, and would work closely
with the Linux open-source community to make IBM technologies
available.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to one company executive, IBM will
probably set up a Linux software operation in India, which has
become a hotbed of Linux development, and hire a Linux marketing
executive from outside IBM by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies in the Linux market, VA Linux and Red Hat, which
make money by selling computers tailored for Linux or by offering
technical support and services for Linux customers, have had highly
successful public stock offerings in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   But they are fledgling companies compared with IBM, which has
close ties to major corporate customers around the world. And while
IBM has been offering Linux on some of its machines over the last
year, the announcement Sunday represents a wholesale, companywide
embrace of the open-source operating system.
</P>
<P>
   For IBM, the move is an effort to rejuvenate demand for its
servers _ larger machines that run computer networks _ and to
undermine key rivals, notably Sun Microsystems and Microsoft, whose
proprietary software is increasingly used in the Internet commerce
market.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, IBM warned Wall Street that its earnings for the
1999 fourth quarter would be below analysts' previous expectations.
It blamed the shortfall partly on depressed sales as companies put
off purchases and instead spent information technology budgets on
preparation for the rollover to 2000. Sales of servers, whether
mainframes or smaller Unix machines, were a particular weak spot.
Since then, analysts have been watching closely to see when, and
how quickly, IBM's server revenues might pick up.
</P>
<P>
   Palmisano, who previously led IBM's fast-growing services
business, was placed in charge of the server business as senior
vice president of the company's enterprise systems group. In a
meeting with analysts last month in New York, Palmisano was quoted
as saying the server business was a ``work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Palmisano called the Linux move ``a long-term
play, not something that will have a financial impact on the
company in the next quarter or two.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that if IBM could be a leader in the Linux movement,
optimizing its machines and its software applications for Linux,
the impact on the server, software and services business could be
``huge for IBM''
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the highly independent, often anti-corporate Linux
community promises to be a challenge for IBM. As Wladawsky-Berger
observed, ``Linux isn't so much an operating system as it is a
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Linux has become increasingly popular over the last year
_ still mainly on servers instead of desktop machines _ IBM decided
it should move early to embrace the technology. Like the rise of
the microprocessor, which caught IBM on its heels in the 1980s, and
the Internet, which IBM moved swiftly to assimilate in the 1990s,
Linux is ``another disruptive technology,'' Wladawsky-Berger noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you exactly where it's going,'' he said, ``but it
feels like another big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Linux announcement, according to analysts, is evidence that
IBM is increasingly nimble in recognizing and reacting to new
technologies. ``IBM wants to make sure it's in the running as Linux
develops over the next few years,'' said Jonathan Eunice, president
of Illuminata, a research firm in Nashua, N.H. ``It's a smart play,
but a bit speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   Linux does seem to be gaining ground rapidly in the corporate
world, at least as an operating system used for new applications
for electronic commerce on the World Wide Web. A recent poll of
more than 2,000 information technology managers by survey.com, an
online research service, found that they planned to increase
applications development for Linux and BSD, the other main
open-source operating system, by up to 500 percent over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing growth,'' said Dave Trowbridge, a senior
analyst for survey.com. ``The era of proprietary standards is dead.
The Internet is changing the way software is developed.''

   WEB SITE OFFERS HELP WITH IRS PENALTIES
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common problems business owners face is being
hit with a penalty by the Internal Revenue Service for not
complying with its intricate rules for quickly turning over to the
government the income and payroll taxes withheld from paychecks.
Now some relief is available from a company that makes tax
software.
</P>
<P>
   At www.taxpenalty.com, a site owned by TimeValue Software of
Irvine, Calif., business owners can list the amount of their
payments and other data to check how much penalty, if any, is due
for late payments or underpayments. While IRS agents have been
shown in some cases to have guessed at the penalty, TimeValue built
its own database to calculate penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS proposed 3.7 million penalties in 1997 totaling $3.23
billion, an average of nearly $900 per case. That means penalties
were sought for about one of every seven payroll tax reports,
TimeValue estimated. The IRS reduces the penalties in about
one-fifth of the cases, but the remaining penalties still totaled
$1.2 billion, or an average of nearly $400 per case in 1997 _ the
most recent year for which data are available.
</P>
<P>
   Often the IRS proposes a larger penalty than is required under
the complex rules on timing of payments, said Tom Persky, a former
IRS executive who designed TimeValue's penalty calculation
software.
</P>
<P>
   He said 91 percent of the businesses that had used TimeValue's
site since it was launched in August had had their penalties
reduced or eliminated. He said that on average penalties are
reduced 44 percent after using the site.
</P>
<P>
   TimeValue, which is privately owned, charges $49 if its site
determines that a proposed penalty should be reduced by $500 or
more. If the penalty reduction is less than that, or no reduction
is warranted, the service is free. The site generates a printout to
send to the IRS to apply for a reduction in penalties.

   VENTURE CAPITALIST'S PLAN TRIPPED UP BY NCAA
</P>
<P>
   When John Hummer, co-founding partner of Hummer Winblad Venture
Partners, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, created a
collegiate competition for Internet business plans, he figured
``March Madness'' had a nice ring to it.
</P>
<P>
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association thought otherwise,
telling Hummer Winblad that the name infringed on a trademark
reserved for the NCAA basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Hummer expected better treatment. He had participated in the
collegiate tournament as Princeton's starting center in 1969, long
before the postseason playoff was known as March Madness. But the
6-foot-9-inch Hummer, who went on to a six-year career in the
National Basketball Association and averaged 6.9 points a game,
knew better than to fight the NCAA on the point.
</P>
<P>
   The new name for the Hummer Winblad tournament is the February
Madness Start-Up Tournament: Nothin' but the Net. Not exactly a
slam dunk, but at least it evokes the basketball court _ and keeps
Hummer out of court.

FOR-PROFIT WEB SITES GIVE NEW MEANING TO CAMPAIGN FINANCING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in October, when Voter.com was pressing the two Democratic
presidential campaigns to pay for space on its new for-profit Web
site, the sales staff sent campaign aides e-mail messages saying
the other camp was about to sign contracts with the site.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic, according to campaign officials, prompted an unusual
exchange: a campaign aide for Vice President Al Gore called the
office of Bill Bradley to ask if the former New Jersey senator's
campaign was really about to sign. The Bradley campaign had no such
plans. Now, neither organization plans to do business with
Voter.com.
</P>
<P>
   Voter.com's 25-year-old chief executive, Justin Dangel, said his
sales staff was truthful at all times and that the campaigns had
merely wavered in their decisions. But the bottom line is that the
contracts were crucial for the Web site because, in Dangel's words,
``it's important for the whole project to have campaigns provide
content.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter.com, which is based in Boston, is among a handful of
Internet start-ups hoping to make money in campaign politics, a
world traditionally dominated by nonprofit and volunteer groups.
But as these commercial political sites strive to cash in on
campaign advertising in a major election year, they are finding it
harder to earn credibility with candidates and the public than to
raise millions of dollars in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   The sites' founders predict they will attract millions of users
this year because an increasing number of Americans have Internet
access and the elections will bring attention to political sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great time to get involved with the process,'' said
Joshua King, spokesman for a new company, SpeakOut.com. The
company's business strategy is to offer users a conduit to write to
their elected representatives, then sell the data about the users'
political views in aggregate form to campaigns and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of likely voters who use the Internet showed
that about a quarter of respondents had searched for information
about political candidates. The research, a random telephone survey
of 1,200 adults, was conducted by George Washington University in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The findings also showed, however, that the respondents were
highly selective about which sources of online political
information they trusted, placing the most trust in church groups
and state election boards, and the least trust in online service
providers, political parties and campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As new players compete for this group's attention, Voter.com
plans to spend $70 million advertising its site this year. Dangel
said the company had already raised part of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Another start-up, GoVote.com, was established to be ``the
leading destination for politics on the Web,'' said Paul Hrabal,
the company's president, a 33-year-old former executive at Dell
Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of these sites say the public needs a politics portal
that will provide voters with information about all candidates in
one visit. That feature _ along with the ability to sell sharply
aimed advertising to candidates and lobbying groups _ could make
the business model work, these investors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who will pay for it will be the people who spend
money trying to reach audiences,'' said Chris Gabrieli, a general
partner in Bessemer Venture Partners in Boston, an investor in
Voter.com. ``I believe there will be one clear winner here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many venture capitalists in Silicon Valley are skeptical,
however. For example, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, a venture firm in
Redwood City, Calif., says it routinely rejects business plans
describing catch-all political sites because the firm is concerned
about the short business cycle, which ends when the election is
over, and because it doubts any single site will dominate the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's going to be one first-to-market site
that's going to make it,'' said Barry Hutchison, a spokesman for
the firm. ``There's not going to be a panacea for the industry.
Those first-to-market sites that are trying to be catchalls are
going to weed themselves out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The key for many of these companies is to collect individuals'
political opinions, then direct advertising from political groups
at them or sell aggregate information on political opinions to
outside parties. Dangel said that if a user on Voter.com indicated
an interest in the environment, then an environmental group that
was a paying client would be given the opportunity to send e-mail
messages to her about the group's positions on evolving issues.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who question this application of electronic commerce
to politics is a privacy advocate who says that databases of
individuals' political beliefs are tempting targets for subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be creating some particularly sensitive databases
that they would have no control over,'' said David Sobel, general
counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit
research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In an environment of fear about terrorism, he said, police
agencies would be likely to serve subpoenas on companies that hold
information about individuals who express extreme views. That
threat could jeopardize the companies' business models.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would assume that users, when they understand the potential
ramifications, would be very apprehensive about providing this
information,'' Sobel said. ``If the value that these sites intend
to collect is information on political preferences of individuals,
they're going to have a hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Internet companies said they were careful to
keep the data they collected separate from information that would
identify individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do it the right way,'' Dangel said. ``If we
find out we're not, we'll change it.''
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the profit-seeking sites has also, in part,
influenced the Markle Foundation's decision to devote $100 million
to public-interest uses of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Blau, program director for the foundation, said nonprofit
groups should not fold their tents just yet. Their advantage, he
said, is that they carry the most credibility. The profit-seeking
companies have the advantage of access to capital, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the content side, certainly the dot-orgs have nothing to be
afraid of,'' Blau said, alluding to the .org suffix in the Internet
addresses of nonprofit groups. But they may need to move faster to
compete, he said, adding, ``Their ability to be responsive is going
to be tested by these new players.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, many of the new players know their weakness
and are gunning for credibility. Richard Kimball, director of
Project Vote Smart, an award-winning nonprofit group that has
provided exhaustive candidate information online since 1996, says
that in recent months he has constantly battled new companies that
steal the nonprofit site's data, logo and name to gain credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The project has developed a threatening legal letter for those
cases. Though Kimball says the situation is troubling, he said that
the attempts to tap into his group's credibility was ``actually
flattering, in a nasty way.''

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ The Internet boom is bringing sweeping
demographic changes to Silicon Valley, according to an annual
report card for the region, which shows that the number of nonwhite
residents surpassed whites for the first time in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of new immigrants, particularly Asians and Hispanic
people, also is increasing a ``digital divide,'' said an annual
report to be issued on Monday by Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a
coalition of corporate and civic groups.
</P>
<P>
   People who describe themselves as white comprise 49 percent of
the population of the counties of San Mateo and Santa Clara,
Silicon Valley's main geographic area. Among the region's
school-age population, whites are an even smaller minority, said
the report, which is prepared each year by researchers at
Collaborative Economics, a consulting firm here.
</P>
<P>
   The two counties' school-age population is 39 percent white, 31
percent Hispanic, 26 percent Asian and Pacific Islander, 4 percent
African-American and 0.2 percent American Indian, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   The changes reflect both traditional immigration patterns and a
new wave of high-skilled, highly entrepreneurial immigrants moving
to Silicon Valley, while at the same time maintaining close ties
with their homelands, said AnnaLee Saxenian, a social scientist on
the advisory committee for the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best and the brightest in the world all want to be here,''
said Ms. Saxenian, a senior fellow at the Institute for Economic
Policy Research at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Venture index, which has been issued each year since
1994 as a broad assessment of the valley's economy and social and
environment, also showed that while the region's boom is
continuing, job growth slowed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The valley added just 1.7 percent, or 21,200, new jobs, despite
an increase of nearly 90 percent in venture capital, to $6.1
billion. That was down from a recent high of 5.2 percent in 1997,
when the region added more than 60,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The declining growth rate suggests a shift away from traditional
manufacturing sectors like microelectronics, semiconductors,
computers and military-aerospace manufacturing, said Douglas
Henton, president of Collaborative Economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a continuing restructuring away from hardware
and toward software,'' he said, noting that the average size of a
Silicon Valley software company is 27 people, smaller than the
mainstay semiconductor companies that employ thousands.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the new high technology job growth in the
valley last year was in software and related services while both
semiconductors and defense/aerospace employment declined, the
report found.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for programmers, driven by Internet start-up
companies, accelerated, with the average annual wage for the
software industry at $95,800 in 1998, the most recent year for
which data is available.
</P>
<P>
   The high salaries of skilled workers, however, contrasts sharply
with the largest employment sector of the region's economy _ local
and visitor services, which include retail and restaurant workers
and had an annual average wage of $22,900.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, adjusted household income for the most affluent 20
percent of Santa Clara County residents rose about $40,000 from
1996 to 1998, to just below $140,000 a year. But for the least
affluent 20 percent, the 1998 level of $36,700 remains below the
average income level earned by the bottom 20 percent of households
in the early 1990s, when adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the valley is doing well,'' Henton said, ``it has got
to do a much better job in working to prepare everyone for the
digital economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the income disparity, the valley has continued to
outpace the financial standing of the rest of the nation. During
the 1990s, for example, real per capita income for Santa Clara
County rose 32 percent, compared with 13 percent for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The changes described in this year's report come at a time when
the valley is having its longest boom ever, which traces to 1992
and was highlighted by a record 77 initial public stock offerings
by companies in the region during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The slowing job growth did bring some good environmental news.
Despite continuing traffic woes, the valley had fewer days when the
region's air quality exceeded federal ozone standards. Air
pollution exceeded federal standards on 12 days in 1999, down from
21 days in 1998.

GATEWAY TO USE CHIPS BY ADVANCED MICRO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gateway Inc., the computer maker that last week
blamed supply problems with Intel Corp. for an earnings shortfall,
plans to announce on Monday that it will again use microprocessors
produced by Intel's archrival, Advanced Micro Devices.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway executives said that the new machines using Advanced
Micro's chips would be available through its stores, World Wide Web
site (gateway.com) and toll-free number (800-846-4208).
</P>
<P>
   It was only last year that Gateway switched from buying some
microprocessors from Advanced Micro to relying on Intel exclusively
for microprocessors, the electronic brains of computers. But last
week, when it cited supply problems as it reduced its earnings
forecast, it described Intel's shipments of chips and computer
boards as ``severely constrained, spotty and unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gateway executives said then that they would not remain so
dependent on a sole supplier and would seek another source of
chips.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, that decision led inevitably to Advanced
Micro. While a handful of companies produce microprocessors
compatible with Intel's, Advanced Micro has been the most
aggressive in terms of meeting, and at times beating, Intel in
absolute performance. And it has the broadest product line of all
Intel's rivals. Last week, Advanced Micro said it was producing an
800-megahertz version of its Athlon microprocessor, giving it, for
now, the fastest chip on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is, this solves their supply problem,'' Charles Wolf,
an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read, said of Gateway. The move, he
said, ``is in part buying insurance, to make sure they have enough
processors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're also sending a message to Intel: `In the future,
treat us better.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said that Gateway's supply problem suggested Intel was
having difficulty meeting production goals for its newest chips and
was allocating them to its most important client, which would be
the Dell Computer Corp., not Gateway. ``Dell has never dual-sourced
on processors,'' he said. ``They're a lot bigger than Gateway and
they've been a loyal customer forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Gateway win was an important one for Advanced
Micro, which for the first time in years is fielding a product line
that can compete head to head with Intel. Previously, Advanced
Micro has either lagged in performance or been unable to produce
its fastest chips in high volumes. But these problems appear to
have been addressed. In addition to Gateway, PC makers that have
said they will use Athlon processors include Compaq Computer, IBM
and CyberMax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gateway's decision to use the AMD Athlon in its Select PC
series enhances AMD's credibility and demonstrates that the Athlon
is gaining acceptance at the high end of the desktop computer
market,'' said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst with Insight 64.
``AMD's win at Gateway reinforces the position of the AMD Athlon
processor as a legitimate challenger in the performance segment.''
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro also plans to announce on Monday that Pionex, an
East Coast computer maker whose machines are sold through
resellers, is offering commercial desktop computers and
workstations based on the Athlon processor. Via Technologies, based
in Taiwan, will also begin shipping a chipset using Athlon,
Advanced Micro said.

INTERNET SHOWS SIGNS OF BECOMING TOP MARKETPLACE IN THE BOOK 
BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new holiday survey of seasoned Internet users indicates that
customers are straying from the bookshelves to buy titles online,
with a majority actually making more literary purchases in virtual
book shops than in standard stores.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting released the results last week of an
eight-day survey that showed that old-fashioned shopping remains an
enduring and robust custom but that books are the leading product
that this bellwether group of customers prefers to purchase online.
</P>
<P>
   Books and videotapes were the only items that more people bought
online than in stores, according to the survey, which polled 541
Internet users between Dec. 27 and Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirms that books are the leading edge of the
transition in shopping that's taking place across the economy,''
said David Brodwin, an associate partner who tracks media and
entertainment for Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven percent of the shoppers bought books online while 37
percent made purchases through traditional stores and the remainder
through catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, video customers made 35 percent of their purchases
through Web sites and 30 percent through physical stores.
</P>
<P>
   The same participants also were involved in a similar October
study. The surveys have a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books are much less risky to buy than buying a piece of
apparel so books have really taken off as a category,'' Brodwin
said, noting that a barrage of advertisements and marketing efforts
from companies like Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com had
apparently helped to reassure customers.
</P>
<P>
   He added that among the shopping categories, which ranged from
clothing and toys to computer software and consumer electronics,
books stood out as a safe electronic purchase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, customers can more easily mimic the retail shopping
experience in a store, by browsing chapters of books posted online.
Still, there appears to be a split developing between men and
women. Men appeared to prefer online shopping; 56 percent of the
men bought books over the Internet, compared with 40 percent of
women.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey suggests there are still limits to Internet
shopping. For example, 81 percent of the customers bought clothing
in conventional stores and 29 percent from electronic stores. The
numbers add up to more than 100 percent because of overlapping
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same time, the customers reported that the digital
shopping experience was not always smooth. Nine out of 10 shoppers
abandoned their electronic shopping baskets at some point during
their browsing.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly 40 percent reported some problem with the Internet
shopping experience, although they claimed the highest satisfaction
level with that form.
</P>
<P>
   The leading complaint was about out-of-stock products. After
that, users bemoaned that purchases were not delivered on time or
delivery charges were excessive. They also had trouble making
connections or navigating a site.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the dominant and overwhelming complaint about
holiday shopping in traditional stores centered on too many people:
overcrowding, long lines, limited parking. The exception to that
was another dominant complaint: the dearth of sales help to answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge with Internet shopping is that there's a
tremendous amount of capacity needed to do the site right,''
Brodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way of looking at this,'' he added, ``is that Internet
shopping is not so great. It still has profound flaws. The key
message is that these companies that want to play in this space
have got to fix these problems.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ When history records the names of Microsoft's great
adversaries, one that might someday join the list alongside Apple,
Netscape and America Online is an Internet company called
RealNetworks.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the intensifying competition, both companies
announced partnerships during the Consumer Electronics Show here to
utilize their software.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by one of Microsoft's former executives, Rob Glaser,
RealNetworks makes so-called media player software _ programs that
companies use to send video and audio files over the Internet and
that consumers use to listen to and view those files.
</P>
<P>
   With some 95 million registered users of its software,
RealNetworks is thought to have a commanding lead in the
media-player market. But lately the company's success has whetted
the competitive appetite of Glaser's former boss, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   For several years Microsoft has had a media player of its own
tucked into the company's market-dominating Windows operating
system for personal computers. Only in the last 12 months or so,
though, has the company been stepping up its efforts to make the
Windows Media Player a central selling point.
</P>
<P>
   At the industry show here, RealNetworks announced an agreement
with Seagram's Universal Music Group, the biggest record label,
which will begin providing music for use with a RealNetworks music
player known as Jukebox. Microsoft, not to be drowned out,
announced that several new portable digital devices coming soon
from various manufacturers would be compatible with Microsoft's
Windows Media Player technology.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly intense competition, which is taking on
overtones of the Microsoft vs. Netscape and Microsoft Network vs.
America Online battles, underscores how much is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, industry analysts say, the contest is not
only about which software will be used to listen to music, or view
video snippets. Instead, the outcome could determine which
company's technology may be the basis for how television, film,
music and other media are distributed and digested in the coming
digital environment known as convergence. By most accounts,
convergence is still many years away, but it could mean huge
business for the companies that sell software to media
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do have convergence, these streaming media players
could be the ones who dominate it,'' said Allen Weiner, vice
president of analytical services for Nielsen/NetRatings, an
Internet research organization. ``This is the most significant
battle in the marketplace today.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner and numerous other industry analysts say that, for now,
RealNetworks has a substantial lead in distributing its main media
player, called RealPlayer. More important, they say, there is far
more media material on the Internet that is compatible with
RealPlayer than with the Windows Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Nielsen/NetRatings reported that in the month of
November, various versions of RealPlayer were used by 8.9 million
people on the Internet, representing 12.1 percent of active
Internet users. Microsoft's Windows Media Player was not only far
behind; with 2.4 million users and a market share of 3.2 percent,
it was not even in second place.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 in November was Apple Computer's Quick Time media player,
with 5.4 million users and a 7.4 percent market share. But in key
ways, some analysts do not see Apple Quick Time as a direct
competitor with the other two programs. Unlike Quick Time, the
RealNetworks and Microsoft players are meant for so-called
streaming media.
</P>
<P>
   With streaming media, the audio or video files remain on a Web
company's site and are played as a continuous stream by the end
user, but are not stored on the user's computer. With Quick Time,
popular for viewing material likes sports clips or movie previews
online, the file must be downloaded onto the user's computer and
then played back. Although Weiner considers Quick Time part of the
digital media future, he does not see it as part of the
streaming-media showdown between RealNetworks and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser, 37, who founded RealNetworks in 1994 after leaving his
position as vice president for multimedia consumer systems at
Microsoft, said he was ``hugely confident in our leadership
position.'' He said RealNetworks planned to expand beyond media
player software to provide an ``integrated suite of media
delivery'' that would include forums for selling copyright-secured
music online, for offering streams of free music and video and for
placing advertising alongside the media content.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this business model is already in place with
RealNetworks' Jukebox software, which consumers can use to store
and organize music collections on their computers. So far consumers
have registered 20 million copies of Jukebox. Microsoft has no
analogous product, although a handful of companies make Web-based
jukeboxes that are based on the Windows Media Player technology.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts note that the online media market is too new to yet
declare RealNetworks the winner. They note that Microsoft has begun
calling its Media Player a ``key component'' of the Windows
operating system. And Microsoft is bundling the player technology
with its industrial-strength Windows NT Server software, which a
Web company could use to disseminate both video and audio in the
Media Player format.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage to a Web media company, Microsoft executives say,
is that they get a media server and corporate computing software
system for a single price. ``Otherwise, you have to buy Sun plus
RealNetworks or Linux plus RealNetworks,'' said Anthony Bay, vice
president for streaming media at Microsoft, referring to competing
industrial-strength software systems. ``Why buy both?''
</P>
<P>
   But RealNetworks executives say that price is largely beside the
point. To begin with, most of the downloads of the RealNetworks
server software used by Web companies are free, according to the
company. And while licenses for the more enhanced versions cost
upward of several thousand dollars, they say such fees are minimal,
compared with the cost of network transmission capacity a company
needs to make audio and video accessible to many users
simultaneously _ whether Microsoft or RealNetworks software is
used.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note, however, that it is difficult to dismiss
Microsoft's ability to leverage its dominance in the operating
system market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very similar behavior pattern'' to the way Microsoft
went after the Netscape market, said Rob Enderle, vice president
and research leader at Giga Information Group, a market research
firm in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Neither Microsoft nor RealNetworks much likes drawing parallels
to Netscape, whose early dominance in the Web-browser software
field was undermined by Microsoft's bundling of its own browser
into Windows. For its part, Microsoft _ amid an ongoing antitrust
case involving that very issue _ does not want to be characterized
as wielding Windows as an anti-competitive weapon in the
media-player war.
</P>
<P>
   And RealNetworks, lest it be cast prematurely as a Microsoft
victim, says the current battle is more analogous to Microsoft's
less successful effort to unseat America Online with the Microsoft
Network.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks executives say their company's advantage is not
simply its millions more users, but the fact that so much more of
the media content on the Internet has been formatted for use with
RealPlayer software _ at least 85 percent of the audio and video
files available on the Net, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft offers no figure of its own, though it does not
dispute that RealNetworks holds an advantage so far. Yet Microsoft
officials contend that their rival's advantage primarily involves
aging material on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are legacy files,'' said Dave Fester, director of
marketing for Microsoft's streaming media division, who noted that
most newer content is compatible with both companies' media-player
software. The Web sites of CNN, Fox and NBC , for example, stream
their audio and video in both the RealPlayer and Windows Media
formats.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever this battle may lead, the rhetoric has become
increasingly testy between the two companies. Enderle of Giga
Information Group thinks Microsoft is especially intense because
Glaser once testified against his former employer's hardball
tactics at a Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Glaser believes the intensity is simply part of Microsoft's
culture. ``As a motivation technique,'' he said, ``they like to
package targets.''

TV plus computer equals a wild world 
By Jack Warner  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here I sit on a Sunday afternoon, watching the mating
ritual of the crested iguana on the Animal Planet channel and
playing solitaire, all on the same screen. Does it get any better
than this?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, it can get a lot better than this, but we needn't go
into that.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt a lot of you are saying something like ``Oh, come on,
TV cards have been around for years.'' It reminds me of an e-mail I
got last week from a reader in Colorado who found it hard to
believe that a computer expert could make such an ordeal out of
formatting his hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   You, sir, have mistaken me for an expert. I am no expert. I am
comparable to the Brazilian tree frog, which I have just learned
may be mistaken for bird droppings until it moves. I'm here to make
the cyber-inept feel comfortable. Together, we muddle through, like
the African bullfrog, which, I see, squirms its ample rump into the
mud until it is completely encased, thus surviving 10 months of
drought.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having established and even justified my incompetence,
let's return to the subject of television on the computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not watching it from a card, but by way of a device called
the Lifeview USB LifeTV box, a snazzy little purple-and-gray box
that plugs into your USB port and your TV antenna or cable
connection. After installing the software, it appears in a little
box about 4 by 5 inches. I suppose it could be made larger, but 4x5
is large enough for iguanas and tree frogs. Adjustment may be
required should I encounter Pamela Anderson Lee or some similar,
larger creature.
</P>
<P>
   Audio comes from the box, although it can be fed into the
computer's audio system. An S-video input, such as you would want
for attaching a video camera, is available. So is software that
will capture still pictures from the video image as well as store
video clips in the computer.
</P>
<P>
   All this is very handy for me, since the memsahib recently
appropriated the computer room TV for her quilting room. This was
fine by me, because I seldom watch television.
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago, I spent a year working in television. A few
days after joining the news operation of a local station, the
assistant news director found me asleep in a video editing room,
the video to be observed bubbling along unviewed. A nice lady, she
worried about me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you all right?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure, I'm OK,'' I replied. ``I've just got this little
problem. Every time I watch TV, I go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The assistant news director looked at me curiously for a moment.
``Then why did you come to work here?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see how I only lasted a year.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the USB LifeTV doesn't seem to have lasted even
that long. Upon selecting the URL for the Web site listed on the
box, I arrived at the home of a Southern California pipe vendor's
association. Undaunted, I searched for LifeTV and wound up at an
online computer catalog that said ``Sorry, not selling it anymore.
(Too many bugs.)''
</P>
<P>
   I haven't encountered any bugs yet, although after the frogs
there were a lot of surly baboons and some zebras.
</P>
<P>
   So, there you are, a report full of croaks and whinnies,
signifying nothing. Welcome to the millennium.

gear with so many facts, figures, news and notes about the 2000
elections that they can hardly be crammed onto one page.
</P>
<P>
   Done up in weird shades of blue and bright green, this is
definitely not politics as usual. It's easy, it's accessible and,
for people who really aren't political junkies, it makes
complicated issues comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   An especially interesting feature of the Politicaljunkie Web
site is a function that allows users to enter a ZIP code or even a
person's last name, for which it will return a list of political
donors in that ZIP code or with that name, how much they've donated
and to whom.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ``politics as usual'' articles, there are
also quirky tidbits like Dweezil Zappa donating money to Vice
President Al Gore's campaign. Zappa's father, Frank, was one of
Tipper Gore's harshest critics when she proposed banning records
with questionable lyrics in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   This is definitely not your father's election year. Even if you
spend no more than five minutes on the Web, you can have
politicaljunkie.com e-mail you a daily briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing politics to the people was the dream of the late John
F. Kennedy Jr., who founded the hard-copy magazine George. As
George evolved, it was heavier on celebrities than on politics, but
Kennedy was still the first to make the point that politics really
is a spectator sport.
</P>
<P>
   There really is no better year than this one to discover that he
was on to something.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analyst Preston Dodd says that when news
breaks, it will break on the Web. If you want to hear the latest
pop-culture quiz put to Bush or want to witness former Sen. Bill
Bradley and Gore taking their weekly potshots at each other over
Social Security, you'll probably be able to find a transcript and
analysis, or perhaps a video, on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Politicaljunkie.com tries to make politics easy to read and
digest, but it's not the only Web site with an approachable,
readable style that's likely to appeal to Web surfers just looking
for a quick political hit.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Democratic National Committee has a little bit
of attitude on its Web site, www.democrats.org.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans may not like it, but the ``Bush Stump Speech Search
Engine'' is funny and may actually get people to read selections
from the Republican candidate's stump speeches on the DNC site.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee, www.rnc.com, responds in kind
with ``The World According to Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   These online slings and arrows are not really attack ads, but
they do make their points with a little bit of humor and attitude.
It's always important when reading materials on clearly partisan
Web sites such as those from the RNC, DNC or the candidates
themselves to consider the source before nodding your head in
agreement. There are many, many places to look for alternate
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Many newspapers such as The Washington Post and the Cox chain
have also set up extensive sites devoted to political news,
analysis and opinion designed for the serious political news junkie
who really wants to delve into the intricate workings of
presidential politics. (Cox newspapers include The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, published by Cox Enterprises.)
</P>
<P>
   The Web also brings lots of people into the political process
who don't normally pay much attention until the primary hits their
home state.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the Web, every voter can watch the high jinks going
on up in New Hamphire via local Web sites, such as the legendary
and conservative Manchester Union Leader (www
</P>
<P>
   .unionleader.com) and WMUR-TV (www.wmur.com), which has teamed
up with CNN to provide in-depth analysis of the New Hampshire
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On these sites, voters from all over the country can find out
what messages the candidates are sending to voters in the nation's
first primary, take a look at their TV ads and read commentary from
a wide variety of sources.
</P>
<P>
   The largest newspaper in the region, The Boston Globe at www
.boston.com, also has daily political coverage of the New Hampshire
madness and even has polls everyone can vote in _ not just people
from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, voting early and often in online polls during the
election season is highly recommended, as it might get one in the
mood for actually getting out of the house to vote for real by the
time November rolls around.

Return of software developers the best indication Mac is back 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two years ago this month, Apple announced it had lost
$1 billion and was laying off tens of thousands of workers. Few
expected the company to survive, at least independently.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to the annual MacWorld trade expo held last week in
San Francisco. It attracted a record 70,000 attendees, who heard
Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs say the company was selling iMacs
as fast as it could make them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, sales in 1999 were up more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No one now is predicting anything but continued success for
Apple and Mac in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest testament to the Mac's comeback is the return of
big-name software developers such as IBM. The computer giant
announced at MacWorld that it would soon release a Mac version of
its Via Voice software, which enables computers to translate the
spoken word into text.
</P>
<P>
   Via Voice, along with Dragon Naturally Speaking, have long been
available for PCs. Dragon also plans to release Naturally Speaking
for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   While the biggest example, IBM was hardly alone. Fifty of
MacWorld's 500 exhibitors were new to the show. Three-quarters of
them were displaying either a new product or an upgrade to an old
one.
</P>
<P>
   That may not sound like much, but two years ago most developers
had stopped making Mac software altogether.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple has come a long way in the past two years, it still
faces many challenges. For one, playing the loyal opposition _ and
doing so profitably _ is an ever-daunting role.
</P>
<P>
   Apple will have to come up with a sequel to its popular iMac to
remain strong. It's a lot harder than it looks to dream up and make
the next cool computer device.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believe that Apple's next great computing device
should not be a desktop computer or even a laptop. Rather, they
want the company to build a competitor to the Palm Pilot and other
hand-held computers, which are taking an ever-growing share of the
computing market.
</P>
<P>
   Another big challenge for Apple this year will be the release of
a new operating system called OS X. This is not an incremental
upgrade, such as OS 9, but a radical rebuilding of the software
that runs the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to greatly increase speed and stability. Under OS X,
the Mac will finally get memory protection and pre-emptive
multitasking. It will also be better able to handle video and sound
clips.
</P>
<P>
   Developing OS X has been a huge engineering challenge. Marketing
it will be just as great a challenge for Apple.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it will remain a fun and exciting year to follow both
Apple and the Mac.

Joke sites: Leave 'em laughing 
By Bill Husted  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You may be ready for a good joke after surviving the
holidays and Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   And most of us have a practical need for jokes from time to
time. If you've ever had to make a speech or presentation, you may
have scurried around trying to find a joke to fit a special
occasion. And, oh yes, it needs to be a clean joke.
</P>
<P>
   The Web can be a funny place. Today we'll take a look at sites
that offer collections of jokes. Most have cataloged the jokes by
category. These sites have been specially selected as offering
clean jokes that should be suitable for almost any family. But
since tastes and standards vary, parents will want to examine each
site closely before recommending it to young family members.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point is a page called Endless Jokes at jokes
</P>
<P>
   .EMPStudios.com/. This site advertises itself as offering
``1,000s of jokes,'' and it seems to live up to that promise. It
has a nifty feature that will make it popular with those who need a
joke for a specific occasion. That attribute is the ability to
search the joke collection for keywords. So whether you're making a
speech to insurance agents, farmers or airline pilots, you should
get help at this site.
</P>
<P>
   Just A Joke Network is located at justajoke.net/ and, like many
of the sites we'll visit, it also catalogs jokes. But there are
some features here that set this page apart. One is the new-joke
section. Since jokes seem to move faster nowadays _ partially
because of the Internet itself, where jokes are the subject of
countless e-mails each day _ this section gives you a chance to
keep current, to be the first at your office to tell a new joke.
For those who don't want to log on to the site each day but would
like to get a joke, there's a subscription service (free) from the
site. Just sign up, and you'll get a new joke by e-mail every day.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Clean Joke Page, run by a fellow who seems
to worry that clean jokes are in short supply. In meek tones, he
notes ``the expectation is that this category should grow very
little over time. There just are not that many clean jokes out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a fairly good supply of jokes here, at
www.mjb.org/jokes/clean
</P>
<P>
   /index.shtml. Some of them are funny. The trouble is that the
jokes are not cataloged by subject, so _ if you're looking for a
specific joke _ you'll have to take potluck.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of a site called 123Humor isn't in the quality or
quantity of the jokes, which is adequate in both cases. The thing
that sets this page at www.123humor.com/ apart is a section of
one-liners. While jokes are often lengthy and require a decent
memory and adequate delivery, a one-liner is easy to remember and
often is just the thing needed for a speech. Here are two examples:
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is better than poverty, if only for financial reasons.''
_ Woody Allen
</P>
<P>
   ``If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Then quit.
There's no use being a damn fool about it.'' _ W.C. Fields
</P>
<P>
   The final site is geared specially to families and kids. That's
important since some jokes _ even clean ones _ are just too
grown-up for some occasions or audiences. So bookmark a place
called Scatty's Place at www.scatty.com/. Like many of the other
sites, the jokes are cataloged by topic, but where else would you
find a selection of ``big cat'' jokes.
</P>
<P>
   What's a ``big cat'' joke? Here's one: What happened when the
lion ate the comedian ? He felt funny.

How I launched my Web without losing my sanity 
By Brenda Watters  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 Noon: My husband is bent over his sewing machine
downstairs, muttering ``stretch stitch.'' Today is my day for
earnest work on my Web site. I want to post my fiction, including
two complete, but unpublished, thrillers, and nonfiction, which is
mostly journalism. In my wildest dreams, my site will attract an
agent who will call (or e-mail) and say ``I want to represent
you!'' So my engineer-husband sews and I compute.
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 1 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   I'm reading ``Make Your Own Web Page!'' by Ted Pedersen and
Francis Moss. The subtitle is ``A Guide for Kids.'' I bought this
book from my second-grader's Scholastic Book Club. I'm not a
techie. When my editor, Gretchen Heber, first OK'd this article,
she dropped ``HTML'' into the conversation several times. Finally,
I asked her: ``What is HTML? Hotmail?'' In response, she may have
sputtered. HTML means HyperText Markup Language. I will write HTML
code to create my Web site. So far, the kid advice is simply
stated. The chapter ``Creating Your Web Site,'' is about site
architecture without mentioning the word architecture. Yet the age
gap between me and its intended readers shows up when the book
suggests I use topics like ``Smelly Things That Are in My Closet,''
or ``The Best Roller Coasters I've Been On.''
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 2 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   My kids, Jay, 5, and Ellen, 8, are next door in Jay's bedroom
playing with a castle he got for Christmas. The catapult shoots
cannonballs. Jay launches a ball at a silver-armored knight. The
knight topples over. Jay places him in the dungeon. The Web page
book has a picture of a kid painting a castle tower. Synchronicity.
That's a good sign. Or should I pay more attention to the symbolism
of the dungeon?
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 3 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   I've done a practice page using HTML. There is a reason for the
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   and  &QR; 
, and the slash, or ``/'', keys. They signal how the copy is
displayed on a Web page. Without trouble, I find and launch an
Internet browser. My success ends. I can't seem to call up my
practice page file. I try Windows Explorer. My file is there, on my
hard drive. I key in an exhaustive address, trying to open my file.
Nothing. I call my husband, John, upstairs. He clicks on the browse
box in the Web browser window. My index.html file is listed. I open
it. My first Web page, with one sentence, is done. I feel like a
country hick. I am in a fancy restaurant with a red bandana around
my neck. I use my dirt-grimed fingers to strip a skewer of beef
kabob. Everyone's watching me.
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 4 p.m.: To continue the country hick analogy, I am
squealing like a stuck pig. I wallow in delight. I'm writing code.
Headlines and text are popping up on my home page. My confidence
soars. Self-loathing knocks on my happy door, though. Why did I
wait so long to do this? It's easier than I thought to write
programming code. I am giddy with my back-and-forth clicking
between the HTML I write in Microsoft's WordPad and the
browser/translator, Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 5 p.m.: I spent the last hour in ``Hicksville USA''
again. I opened the Web designer software I bought at CompUSA. For
a cheap $29.99, I bought ViaPage by ViaGrafix. I loaded a disk
labeled ``DesignCAD Pro 2000, software demo.'' Nothing happened. I
asked John to help. Cleverly, John, Mr. MSEE (master of science
degree in electrical engineering), quickly found the ``real''
CD-ROM. The disk I'd loaded was just a demo for some other piece of
software. The real ViaPage was disguised in an envelope bearing the
license agreement. Who reads those? I check off the registration
screens. ViaGrafix asks me to rate my computer experience. The
scale is one to 10, with 10 being computer genius. Feeling dejected
and dissed by the demo, the arrow flickers to the one. I
reconsider. I know what Windows Explorer is and I e-mail people. I
choose three. DO YOU SEE WHAT A NONTECH I AM? Ha-ha. I know
uppercase print is shouting in cyberworld. Feebly, I ask my
husband, ``Am I cheating by using software instead of writing
code?'' He reassures me. ``No one writes code. They use tools.''
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 10 p.m.: I've battled ViaPage for hours. Cheap doesn't
mean better. It doesn't even mean good. The program is full of
bugs. Hyphens and semicolons throw the text onto the next line. My
thoughtful words are amputated, butchered. As I edit my page, the
cursor jumps after one letter is typed. So ``Boulder, Colorado''
comes out looking like Boulidkere. The errors are random.
</P>
<P>
   12/27/99 Noon: My ViaPage frame resembles a field goal _ two
side columns left and right make up the poles, and three center
boxes are frames for my fiction, journalism and biography. My
progress is stymied. The help menu sucks. After a dispirited phone
call, my husband comes home and tries to teach me a few things.
Soon, he takes over the keyboard. On my shoulders, the cartoon
begins: The angel on my right shoulder says, ``This is your
article, you should be doing your own Web page. Stick to the kids
book.'' On my left shoulder, the devil says, ``Let your husband
take over your page, you'll have something decent to show for it
and meet your deadline.'' John returns to his job at Agere. I face
ViaPage alone.
</P>
<P>
   12/27/99 4 p.m.: Definitely, the dungeon was the omen.
</P>
<P>
   12/27/99 9 p.m.: I spent the day sucked into the abyss of
ViaPage. Again, I recruited my husband's help. He translated my
fiction excerpts into HTML. But, the text I hyperlinked to from the
home page fiction ``teaser'' box does not appear on the second page
correctly. Instead, the text is crammed into the same little box as
the fiction teaser. Plus, the pages take an eternity to open. (A
few days later, Katherine Jones of Milkshake Media warned me to
keep my Web pages to 60K or less for optimal download time).
Retreating from my defeat, I read Carson McCullers' 1940 book,
``The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.'' One of the characters, Singer,
who is deaf, is ringed by people who tell him their hearts'
deepest, aching thoughts. Once in a while, Singer scratches out a
few words on paper, but mostly, he just reads lips. His eyes, his
brows, the set of his mouth, how his long hands rest on the table _
these are Singer's communication tools. No fancy Web pages on the
Internet. Singer is a master of empathic listening.
</P>
<P>
   12/28/99 2 p.m.: No more Via-Page. Back to HTML. Kyla Kanz of
OliveDesign called. She asked me if I'm on a PC or a Mac. PC is the
wrong answer, but it's what I have. The PC's Windows environment is
tougher. ``Between Mac and Windows,'' she explained, ``Mac is cut
and paste. You're not doing code.'' She recommends Dreamweaver
software. ``It's not the cheapest,'' she said. ``I find, though,
that the nontechies in our office gravitate to Dreamweaver. It does
a nice job.'' It costs $129. I don't have it.
</P>
<P>
   12/28/99 7 p.m.: Little things mean a lot. While writing code, I
learned that I cannot use an apostrophe after my last name to do
this: Brenda Watters' Home Page. If I do, people searching my page
(especially those agent-people) won't find me. They'll be typing
Watters without the apostrophe. It's a quibble _ grammatically
incorrect, but search engine-friendly. Likewise, I add ``writer''
before my name to attract the agent-people.
</P>
<P>
   12/28/99 8 p.m.: I'm finally past the halfway point in the
``Make Your Own Web Page!'' guide for kids. The girl who stars in
the book, Elena, shares the same name as my daughter. (Ellen signs
her schoolwork with her Spanish name.) At this point, Elena is
adding a drawing to her page. I'm adding a photo, and I've measured
it in pixels. It's way too large, so I've reduced it by half. The
book warns that the proportions between height and width must stay
the same. (The angel on my shoulder is patting my back.) I go back
to the Web browser. There's my picture! I'm so excited.
</P>
<P>
   12/28/99 10:20 p.m.: A friend of mine, Mike Gunter of Database
City, has offered to set up my site and let me use a DB City server
for hosting my pages. I had checked into the AOL offering for
domain registration and Web page hosting, and saw that it had a set
form to produce a Web page. (''Here are three borders, choose one.
Here are suggested interests: Dating online?'') Not for me.
</P>
<P>
   12/29/99 10:20 a.m.: One of my Girl Scout moms (I lead a troop),
a programmer, called me this morning. I told her I was writing HTML
code to create my own Web site. She laughed hysterically. Everyone
does. What is it? Could it be the ``NT'' stamped on my forehead for
nontechie? In the old days, the techs and nontechs were separated
by a dress code. Techs wore white dress shirts and pocket
protectors. Nontechs wore black turtlenecks and jeans. Those were
uniforms. Today, I imagine myself wearing a white lab coat. I am a
mad doctor. I am creating my cobbled-together beast, the Web site.
If only I had a brain. Then my pages could walk and talk!
</P>
<P>
   12/29/99 11:40 a.m.: Elena's pages are about her family and
hobbies. I've built five links from my home page _ one to each of
my novels, a journalism link, a novel-in-progress link and a link
to a page of writing tips. I just finished adding an ``absolute''
link. Using the Austin Writers' League URL, I wrote an anchor tag
in HTML. When Web site visitors click on the league's Web address,
they'll link up with the league's site. I've tried it. It's really
cool. Elena of the book links her site with www.Internet4kids.com.
That's cool for a kid. I've tried, but can't link to it. Is it my
old age? Instead of a parental control block, maybe there's a kid
control block.

   12/29/99 8:25 p.m.: I've been working on the railroad, all the
live-long day. Sing it! I've toiled all day for days on end. My
office is overheated by computers blowing hot air. As a final
touch, I added my e-mail address to my home page. Now that I've
accompanied Elena on her Web-site journey, I'm glad I learned to
write HTML code. After all, I am the staff who will update my Web
site. Also, there are enhancements I'd like to do: settle on a
consistent font style, use more colors, add a biography, and
regularly add new excerpts onto the other pages. I got a too-late
tip from John: I can select any site on the Web and use my
browser's ``view source'' command to see the HTML code behind the
glitzy graphics. It's OK to copy the code for my own page _ it's in
the category of fair use under copyright law. Also, the members of
my unofficial advisory board recommend that I use a focus group to
test the way I present information. Calling all agents for a focus
group! In my wildest dreams?

Inexpensive printer targets young girls 
By James Cummings

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you're a young lady with a new computer or
someone who has such a young lady in the family, you have until the
end of the month to buy a Barbie printer at a significant discount.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo, a division of Hewlett-Packard, normally sells its Barbie
model printer for $89.99. But you can get a $40 rebate on printer
purchases made by Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, one of the best-known computer accessory
companies, started marketing its inexpensive Apollo line last year.
The Apollo printers use HP Inkjet Technology like models costing
several hundred dollars, but they sell for less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbie printer is pink and white and comes with Barbie
decals to decorate the printer body. It comes packaged with a
Barbie Hair Styler CD-ROM that allows girls to experiment with
onscreen hairstyles for Barbie characters.
</P>
<P>
   The printer is not as fast and doesn't have the resolution of
more expensive models, but it's designed to handle the homework,
play and craft projects its young owners probably are interested
in. It can produce low-resolution color drafts at a rate of 1.5
pages per minute, and its highest color resolution is 300 by 300
dots per inch.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo printers offer easy set-up through the computer's
parallel port, and the installation process is guided by onscreen
help prompts. Apollo also offers round-the-clock toll free
telephone support.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo printers are being marketed nationally through Office
Depot, Wal-Mart and Best Buy stores. You can get additional
information, including online shopping sources, by visiting
www.myapollo.com.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Dell's direct line to the future 
By Jerry Mahoney  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
 &HT;    AUSTIN, Texas _ The story of Dell Computer Corp. and Michael
Dell, its 34-year-old founder, chairman and chief executive, is
sprinkled liberally with superlatives like ``first,'' ``most'' and
``youngest.''
 &HT;    The company was the first big company to sell computers via the
Internet and the most profitable personal computer maker in the
'90s. Along the way, Michael Dell became the youngest CEO to lead
his company into the Fortune 500 and by far the richest American
younger than 40.
 &HT;    Now Dell can add to the list the title of best-performing stock
on the Nasdaq exchange in the 1990s. Shares of the Round Rock,
Texas, company appreciated 88,000 percent in the past decade. One
hundred dollars invested in Dell stock 10 years ago and held
through all seven splits would have grown to $88,000 today. During
the 1990s, which the personal computing industry might remember as
the Decade of Dell, the company evolved from upstart PC maker to
No. 1 in the United States.
 &HT;    Dell's success forced bigger rivals to copy parts of its direct
sales approach. And Michael Dell, once an introverted entrepreneur
who seemed uncomfortable in front of an audience, is now regarded
as a guru of e-commerce. Even giants of the Industrial Age, such as
Ford Motor Co., are seeking his guidance on doing business over the
Internet.
 &HT;    In an era of exuberant expectations, the question inevitably
comes up: What can Dell do for an encore?
 &HT;    Michael Dell _ intense, driven and curious himself about what
his company can achieve _ has no plans to slow down.
 &HT;    He believes Dell can ship four times as many computers in 2004
as it did in 1999.
 &HT;    ``If we were to increase our market share from only 9 percent
last year to only 20 percent, which is probably a goal that's too
low, that would be 47 million units for Dell in 2004,'' Dell said
in an interview last week.
 &HT;    That goal, modest or not, is based on his expectation that
worldwide personal computer sales will soar 69 percent by 2004 and
that Dell will account for more than half of that growth.
 &HT;    But then Michael Dell, who will be 35 on Feb. 23, may be the
most bullish executive in the personal computer industry. He
derides talk of the ``post-PC era'' as ``nonsense.''
 &HT;    ``The real question is whether a company can grow and expand,''
he said. &HT;    MORE OF A CURIOSITY
 &HT;    These days, it's common to hear about young techheads launching
Internet-based start-ups in cramped offices and becoming
multimillionaires when they sell stock to the public. They are
riding the financial tsunami created by Wall Street's infatuation
with electronic commerce and the Internet.
 &HT;    Michael Dell didn't have the Internet to inspire him for the
first 11 years of Dell Computer's existence. Instead, he invented a
radical new way of doing business that conveniently realizes its
full potential on the Internet.
 &HT;    He recognized the opportunity early on and seized it. But it was
serendipity, too, a necessary ingredient in every story of
phenomenal success. It didn't hurt that the establishment in the
personal computer industry viewed Dell as more of a curiosity than
a threat in the early 1990s.
 &HT;    Traditionalists believed that the then-Austin company's new idea
to sell computers directly to customers would fail in key segments
of the market, such as corporations. After all, big companies had
never bought computers directly from the manufacturer before.
 &HT;    The nerdy college dropout, complete with pocket protector and
black horn-rimmed glasses, was convinced that companies would grab
the chance to order a computer configured the way they wanted at a
lower cost and with better service than the big companies offered.
 &HT;    ``We basically had the foresight to break the rules of
traditional business, and we came up with a new set of rules that
were very effective for us,'' Dell said last week. ``And we stuck
by them.''
 &HT;    By the time bigger competitors understood the threat, sometime
in the middle of the decade, the Texas upstart was too big _ and
had too much momentum _ to stop.
 &HT;    In the second half of 1999, Dell achieved his goal and overtook
archrival Compaq Computer Corp. as the top seller of personal
computers in the United States, the world's biggest market.
 &HT;    The research and consulting firm, International Data Corp., said
in a report on the third quarter of 1999 that Dell is closing in on
No. 1 worldwide.
 &HT;    ``Dell continued its long march to market dominance,'' the
December report said. ``For the first time, the Austin-based dynamo
outstripped Compaq in a worldwide category: the commercial desktop
segment.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HISTORY OF THE COMPANY
 &HT;    Michael Dell likes to recount a revelation he had in 1982, when
he was still a high school senior in Houston. While upgrading
friends' computers for spending money, he figured out that IBM's
machines were selling for $3,000, but contained less than $700 in
parts. And he could buy the same parts.
 &HT;    ``Not only was there a high price markup from the dealer to the
customer, but there was an even higher markup from the manufacturer
to the dealer,'' Dell recalls in his book ``Direct from Dell:
Strategies that Revolutionized an Industry,'' published last year.
 &HT;    He enrolled in pre-med courses at the University of Texas in the
fall of 1983, where the computer hobby became his life's dream. By
January 1984, a month shy of his 19th birthday, Dell was moving
more than $50,000 a month in upgraded computers and parts through
his dormitory room in Jester Hall. In the spring, he incorporated
his business as PC's Limited and dropped out of college.
 &HT;    As the 1990s began, the company now called Dell Computer Corp.
had sales of $546 million, $27 million in profit and 2,000
Austin-area employees _ a tenth of its current work force.
 &HT;    Like Southwest Airlines, whose lower-cost operation allows it to
undercut prices of traditional carriers, Dell's success highlighted
the shortcomings of its competitors.
 &HT;    For the most part, computer makers went about their business in
the time-honored fashion: forecast what customers wanted, buy huge
stocks of inventory to build to those forecasts and mark up prices
to cover the costs of buying and holding the inventory.
 &HT;    Dell, meanwhile, was hearing what customers actually wanted
because it dealt with them directly. It avoided costly inventories
of parts and completed machines because it only made computers
ordered and paid for in advance. The result was less-costly
computers and better service. Moreover, working closely with
suppliers allowed Dell to avoid designing and making components
itself.
 &HT;    ``If we hadn't done any one of those, I don't think we would be
where we are today,'' Dell said.
 &HT;    While they scoffed at first, as far back as 1992, Compaq and
others were hedging their bets against Dell and trying to copy
aspects of the direct model.
 &HT;    ``The problem was they didn't understand what we were doing, and
they set it up wrong and it failed,'' Dell said. ``I think this
business of continuously not understanding what the threat is has
been going on for a long time. I think it even goes on today.''
 &HT;    Recently, other companies have acknowledged that they have to
compete on Dell's terms.
 &HT;    IBM last year pulled its consumer line out of retail. Last week,
Compaq paid $370 million for a distribution system that will allow
some of its biggest customers to order what they want and check
order status on the Web.
 &HT;    In a clear admission of Dell's impact, Compaq President Mike
Capellas said the direct system should increase the company's
sagging profits.
 &HT;    ``We'll be better equipped to meet the diverse and changing
needs of our U.S. customers, particularly our major accounts, which
clearly want to go direct,'' he said.
 &HT;    IDC, the research firm, said Dell's third-quarter revenue grew
twice as fast as its nearest competitors.
 &HT;    ``The Texas juggernaut continued to be the biggest share taker
of the total dollar pie,'' IDC said. ``Evidence also indicated
that, as a group, direct vendors ... gained ground on indirect
vendors.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NOT EVERYTHING WORKED
 &HT;    Even in the fiercely intense world of high-tech companies, Dell
stands out. And like its accomplishments, its mistakes stemmed from
a relentless drive to grow.
 &HT;    In 1991, Michael Dell saw an industry consolidation coming. He
believed smaller companies such as his would be relegated to niche
markets, if they survived at all.
 &HT;    ``If we had stayed a small PC company, we would have been
killed,'' Dell said in his book. He was right about consolidation,
but hypergrowth in 1992 threatened Dell.
 &HT;    Compaq started a price war in 1992 with a new line of computers
that undercut the competition. Dell responded with 49 new products,
including the Dimension line of desktop computers for small
businesses and consumers.
 &HT;    Revenue shot up 127 percent and profits doubled. In April 1992,
the board of directors authorized a three-for-two stock split, the
company's first. Dell doubled its worldwide market share to 3.5
percent and elbowed its way from 11th to fifth among computer
makers.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, struggling Northgate Computer Corp. was forced to
sell out to a rival, and debt-laden Packard Bell Electronics Inc.
postponed a public stock offering. Several electronics companies,
including the Magnavox division of Philips Electronics N.V. and
Korea's Goldstar, gave up selling PCs under their own labels.
 &HT;    Dell was bigger, but in trouble.
 &HT;    ``We hit the wall in spectacular fashion and splintered into
thousands of pieces,'' Dell said in the book. ``And we had to pick
them all up and learn some new lessons.''
 &HT;    Scrambling to get overwhelmed systems up to the new speed, the
company ran into more problems in 1993. Cash was tight and Dell was
forced to cancel a planned secondary public stock offering when its
stock price weakened.
 &HT;    PC Magazine named Michael Dell its Man of the Year in the fall
of 1993. It cited Dell Computer's innovative sales, service and
manufacturing systems, which gave customers more choices.
 &HT;    Dell lost $76 million in the spring of 1993, including $39.3
million on notebook computer projects, abandoned because they would
have been behind the curve by the time they hit the market. It
finished the year with a $39.6 million loss _ the only time in the
company's history that it lost money.
 &HT;    Other problems loomed.
 &HT;    In August 1993, the Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S.
Commerce Department subpoenaed records of Dell's sales to Russia,
Iran, Iraq and Ireland. All investigations except the Iran sales
were closed without any findings of wrongdoing.
 &HT;    But in 1996, Dell paid $50,000 to settle a civil complaint. The
company acknowledged that in 1992, it mistakenly shipped 15 PCs to
Iran, which the U.S. government said had ties to terrorists.
 &HT;    Adding to Dell's 1993 woes, Compaq was making a stunning
turnaround by cutting costs and overhauling marketing and
manufacturing strategies.
 &HT;    In 1994, the company paid $13.4 million to settle a lawsuit by a
group of shareholders who alleged that Dell withheld information
when it was losing money in the spring of 1993.
 &HT;    But Dell roared back financially in 1994. GOOD CAME OF BAD
 &HT;    Looking back, 1994 was a major turning point for Dell. Seeds
were sown for the unprecedented growth and prosperity of the second
half of the decade, including six two-for-one stock splits.
 &HT;    At 29, Michael Dell knew his company needed stronger management.
He recruited Mort Topfer, recently retired from Motorola Inc., as
vice chairman in May 1994. The avuncular Topfer guided the company
in critical areas such as long-range planning and overseas
expansion.
 &HT;    That year, Dell ended its two-year experiment with retail sales.
Sales were strong, the company said, but profit was weak.
 &HT;    Finally, Dell started a Web site that allowed Internet-savvy
customers to get technical support. But a number of customers told
Dell they wanted to choose a computer and its specific features and
price alternatives online.
 &HT;    It was another example of how Dell's customers helped it evolve.
 &HT;    Dell allowed that late in 1995, and although it still took a
phone call to close the sale, customers' responses to Dell.com
convinced Michael Dell that the Internet was a natural extension of
the direct model.
 &HT;    ``The only thing more direct is mental telepathy,'' he has said
more than once.
 &HT;    By the end of 1996, Dell's online sales were $1 million a day.
Three years later, Dell.com brings in more than $35 million a day.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BUILDING A TEAM
 &HT;    Michael Dell, the longest-tenured CEO of a technology company,
was often dubbed an upstart, wunderkind or enfant terrible for the
way his company made life difficult for seasoned executives at
bigger companies, such as Compaq, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.
 &HT;    Dell's survival at the top and his evolution from entrepreneur
to chief executive is directly related to his willingness to
acknowledge areas where he needs help and to hire people to provide
it.
 &HT;    Michael Dell says that trying to hire good managers when the
company was still seen as a high risk was a ``tremendous
obstacle.''
 &HT;    ``The idea of going to work for a small company was not very
attractive to a lot of people,'' he said.
 &HT;    Stock options, now a common recruiting lure for high-tech
companies, were not well understood.
 &HT;    ``Most people, when you gave them a stock option, thought you
were trying to trick them,'' he said. ``We'd explain it and they
would say, `What was that again?'''
 &HT;    In 1998, Dell offered options as a way to keep employees. It
gave all employees 200 stock options and said new hires during the
next 10 quarters would also get them. The options allow employees
to buy 20 percent annually for five years.
 &HT;    Senior executives are hired with similar incentives, except
their options run in the hundreds of thousands.
 &HT;    Through the years Dell's drive remained, and it has infused the
company's culture, friends and associates said.
 &HT;    Pete Winstead, an Austin lawyer who has done both business and
personal work for Dell, recalls getting an e-mail recently from him
in which he confessed, ``I was born impatient.''
 &HT;    The intensity and the pace at the company _ where Dell works
standing up rather than sitting at a desk _ can be trying for
employees. The company uses precise measurements that compare goals
with actual performance. Raises, bonuses and job security are tied
to meeting ambitious goals.
 &HT;    Jerry Gregoire, at the time Dell's senior vice president and
chief information officer, told fellow CIOs at a meeting last year
that Dell is a ``very driven and demanding place.''
 &HT;    ``We have a growth trajectory that has us processing 60 percent
more transactions than we were processing just 12 months ago and
has us growing by at least that over the next 12 months,'' he said.
 &HT;    Gregoire had been a chief information officer for about 24
years, including 10 at Pepsi Cola Co., before joining Dell. He
retired in October, at age 47, to raise horses on his Austin-area
ranch.
 &HT;    ``I don't think that anything I have ever done up until now did
much to prepare me for what I'm experiencing at Dell,'' he said
last year.
 &HT;    Topfer recently announced he would retire in two years, but
executive-level turnover has not been a problem. Of 11 vice
presidents in 1995, seven are still with Dell. Steve Dube, of the
New York stock firm Wasserstein Pirella &AMP; Co., says Dell has the
strongest management team in the industry. Compaq, for example,
replaced at least five senior executives in 1999.
 &HT;    The stability includes the man at the top. Rod Canion at Compaq
and Steve Jobs at Apple Computer Inc. were fired within 10 years of
starting their companies. Michael Dell, who still owns about 14
percent of the company, has been at the helm for 15 years.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DELL VS. COMPAQ
 &HT;    Compaq's rise in the mid-'90s as the No. 1 personal computer
maker made it a natural target for Dell, which wants to be first in
every segment of the industry. The two Texas companies became more
than rivals during the '90s _ they became enemies. Dell's success
played a role in the firing of Canion in 1991, after the company
suffered its first quarterly loss.
 &HT;    Eckhard Pfeiffer, who succeeded Canion as CEO and helped build
Compaq into a global power, seemed at times to be obsessed with
Dell.
 &HT;    ``I hate to use this word `direct' in any form,'' Pfeiffer told
Computer Reseller News in May 1997, when asked about Compaq's plans
to fight Dell on Dell's turf.
 &HT;    ``Talk about trying to duck a problem,'' Dell said last week
about the comment, which he had not heard before.
 &HT;    Pfeiffer was fired last April as Compaq faced huge losses and
damaged credibility on Wall Street.
 &HT;    Michael Dell is unfazed by the attacks of his rivals.
 &HT;    ``Having an enemy in the business is not all bad. It gives you
some focus,'' he said, ``but I think the primary focus really has
to be on the customers.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    THE INTERNET OPPORTUNITY
 &HT;    While competitors tried to mimic Dell's model, Dell further
exploited the Internet. Suppliers use the Web to monitor orders
from Dell customers as they come in. This link with customers
through Dell tells them when to deliver more components, which in
turn allows Dell to store and pay for minimal inventory.
 &HT;    The server business provides a telling example of the benefits
of what Michael Dell calls ``virtual integration'' and the direct
model.
 &HT;    In 1996, the company decided to launch a major effort to sell
servers, which are powerful computers that connect networks of
terminals and Web sites. It was an industry secret that Compaq,
which invented the server business, and IBM and Hewlett-Packard
were counting on fat profit margins for servers to subsidize
less-profitable products such as desktops and notebooks.
 &HT;    By the third quarter of 1997, Dell's servers and workstations
accounted for 10 percent of its sales, or nearly $300 million.
Analysts agreed that Dell forced competitors to drop prices on
servers about 15 percent, which further squeezed their profits.
 &HT;    Moreover, with results like that, Dell regularly blew past Wall
Street's expectations. The years 1996-98 were most responsible for
the extraordinary appreciation of Dell stock.
 &HT;    During that time, Dell opened a manufacturing plant in Penang,
Malaysia, to serve the Asia-Pacific countries and added a second
plant in Limerick, Ireland, to supply its rapidly growing European
business.
 &HT;    The expansion continued last year. Dell opened new plants in
Austin; Nashville, Tenn; Limerick; Xiamen, China; and Eldorado do
Sul, Brazil.
 &HT;    The late entry into the server market underscores another Dell
strategy. It has rarely been a leader in technology, relying on
standard components and features, most notably Intel processors and
Microsoft operating systems.
 &HT;    In a speech last year, Dell said standardization makes it
difficult for brands to stand out on performance alone.
 &HT;    ``As the information industry matures and the companies in it
become more fully developed, product differentiation is becoming
more difficult to achieve,'' he said. ``It will give way to process
innovation as the fundamental source of competitive advantage.''
 &HT;    Even Silicon Valley, which became the birthplace of the
information revolution through technological brilliance and product
innovation, sees Dell as a leader in the Internet economy.
 &HT;    ``Its responsiveness to customers has been the envy of the
industry out here,'' said Regis McKenna, the Silicon Valley
marketing guru whose clients have included many of the industry's
best-known companies.
 &HT;    ``For years (Silicon Valley) was focused on engineering,'' he
said. ``In the past five to seven years out here, there's been a
real appreciation for marketing.''
 &HT;    With rapidly growing acceptance of the Internet and new devices
to access it appearing constantly, Michael Dell maintains that the
Internet secures the personal computer's future.
 &HT;    ``I have every imaginable device known to mankind, because I
like to play with all this stuff,'' he said. ``But devices like
Web-enabled telephones, with tiny inch-high screens,'' he says,
``will not replace the PC.''

   ``I'm most proud of the team we've built and the fact that we
went from No. 25 out of 25 to No. 1. And that we've established a
clear leadership in the market and that we positioned ourselves for
opportunities going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   On how he develops his strategy:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say a lot of it is looking at ... near-term trends and
trying to anticipate technological change ... listening to
customers that are leading indicators of changes that are going on,
and listening to our best people. And then I guess there's a little
bit of intuition in there, too.''

   DELL DATA
</P>
<P>
   _ Analysts estimate Dell's revenue for the fiscal year ending
Jan. 28 will be $25 billion. That would be about 4,500 percent
higher than 1990 sales of $546 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company hired at least 4,700 people in Central Texas last
year, more than double its total employment of 2,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dell has built more than 5 million square feet of office and
manufacturing space in Central Texas since 1990. That's roughly
one-third of the enclosed space at UT's central campus.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1999, Michael Dell received about 2,000 invitations to
speak to all manner of groups, from schoolchildren to economists
and executives. He accepts about 20 a year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Insider Research Services says Michael Dell has sold $2.7
billion of Dell stock since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1990, Dell's stock price ranged from $4.88 to $25.39 per
share. That's before adjusting for seven splits since 1992.

FISK KEY PART OF FENWAY LORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This was not Jerry Remy's introduction to Carlton Fisk,
but it was close.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was right after I'd been traded from the Angels,'' Remy
said Tuesday, ``and we were going to play the Yankees for the first
time since the trade. At the time, a couple of my good friends from
the Angels were on the Yankees, Mickey Rivers and (Ed) Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game at Fenway, Rivers came over and said `Hi.'
Well, Fisk came over and said to me, `We don't talk to them around
here.' His hate for the Yankees was very real. I'll never forget
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Remy came to the Red Sox in 1978. Three years earlier, in 1975,
a teenaged Dan Duquette was sitting in his living room in Dalton,
watching Game 6 of the World Series with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell asleep,'' Duquette said, ``but my dad's screaming woke
me up after (Bernie) Carbo's home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette joined in the shouting four innings later, when Fisk
hit the 12th-inning, game-winning home run off the left-field foul
pole that assured him immortality even before his election to
baseball's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defining moment of his career came with the Red Sox,'' the
Red Sox general manager said. ``We've all seen it a hundred times,
but it's still a great shot, a great moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that he's working with the Red Sox again. This is a
good day for the Red Sox, a great day for Carlton Fisk. I'm sure
his mother and father are very proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   John Harrington, the Sox CEO and keeper of the Trust, like
Duquette acknowledged that the other player voted to the Hall, Tony
Perez, had Red Sox ties, too. Like Fisk, Perez hit a memorable home
run in the '75 Series. While playing for Cincinnati's Big Red
Machine, Perez hit one of Bill Lee's eephus pitches deep into the
Boston night for a two-run home run in Game 7, starting
Cincinnati's comeback from a 3-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of three home runs Perez hit in that Series, more
than any player on either team. He later played three seasons for
the Sox, from 1980-82, his first season in a Boston uniform
overlapping with Fisk's last.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of the entire Red Sox organization, I want to
congratulate both Carlton Fisk and Tony Perez on this great honor
and accomplishment,'' Harrington said in a statement. ``Personally,
I feel fortunate to have been able to watch both individuals play,
especially Carlton as a fellow New Englander. The entire Red Sox
Family shares a great sense of pride that their names will forever
be placed among the greatest baseball players of all-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk, an All-Star seven times in his Boston tenure, becomes only
the second Sox catcher voted to the Hall of Fame, joining Rick
Ferrell, who was inducted in 1984. At one time estranged from the
Sox organization, Fisk returned last year as a special assistant to
Duquette, and was behind the plate to receive Ted Williams's
ceremonial first pitch at last July's All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said that while Fisk will have numerous speaking
engagements and other obligations after his election, he hopes to
spend some time in uniform this spring in Fort Myers, Fla., working
with Boston's catchers in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm very happy for him,'' said Remy. ``I was hoping
it would be last year, but there was obviously a lot of
competition. I didn't have any doubt that he would be elected. He
certainly deserves it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time I played with him, he was terrific. As a catcher, he
was better than anyone out there. He was a big guy, but he threw
well, with a quick release. And he was tough. Really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   And he hated the Yankees.

HEALTH CARE MERGERS OFTEN JUST DON'T WORK OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet and media industries are ecstatic over the proposed
combination of America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, people in health care were excited about the
benefits of mergers.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't so excited anymore. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care _
the result of a merger between two health maintenance organizations
_ is operating under state receivership after it said it would lose
$177 million in 1999. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a union
of two Boston teaching hospitals, recently announced a big staff
cut to cope with an expected $100 million loss in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is not confined to Massachusetts or the
not-for-profit sector. Across the country ambitious attempts to
consolidate pieces of the health care business have left investors
battered and bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Healthsouth, a huge chain of rehabilitation hospitals, has seen
its stock fall from 30 to 6 since the middle of 1998. MedPartners,
a company that bought doctor practices nationwide, lost more than
75 percent of its value in 1998 and decided to get out of the
business. Several of the country's largest nursing home chains
filed for bankruptcy last year after their aggressive acquisition
strategies went awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to find health mergers that produced the
results people were looking for,'' said Nancy Turnbull, a lecturer
at the Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Why the dismal outcomes? Executives in the medical business _
and those who follow the industry _ offer a variety of
explanations. They say that in health care:
</P>
<P>
   --Cost savings have proved elusive. In medicine, costs are
driven by factors like new technology and the aging of the
population that are terribly difficult to control. Beyond that,
costs are driven by doctors, a group with no obvious parallel in
other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors are like independent contractors,'' said Turnbull.
``They don't really work for anybody.'' Doctors complain that the
beancounters have taken over health care. The bean counters, on the
other hand, complain that doctors still call the shots. Whoever is
right, costs are rising, not falling.
</P>
<P>
   Some merged health care companies have been able to cut costs on
items like supplies and computer systems. Compared to other
industries _ say banking and retailing _ the postmerger savings
have been puny.
</P>
<P>
   --Blending the cultures is difficult. Culture clashes can be a
problem in any merger. In health care, they are especially acute.
Exhibit A could be the merger of Beth Israel and Deaconess
hospitals in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In each medical speciality, the two hospitals tried to create a
single, unified department. It happens all the time in other
businesses: you combine the accounting staffs, the computer
departments, etc. With doctors, the results were disastrous: egos
were bruised, talent left and morale suffered. ``They did not pay
enough attention to cultural issues at every level of the
organization,'' said Steven Weiner, a health care lawyer with Mintz
Levin.
</P>
<P>
   --The business is stubbornly local. ``Tip O'Neill said all
politics is local. The same is true for health care,'' said Stephen
Caulfield, chairman of the Chickering Group, a Cambridge, Mass.
health insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Each health care market has its own style and personality, say
analysts. The fact that you own a hospital in California counts for
very little when you are trying to buy one in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Health care has proved very resistant to the idea of national
brand names _ a fact of life in practically every other business.
Rob Hallisey, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Funds, points out
that Columbia HCA, the nation's largest hospital chain, set out to
build a national presence. What Coke was to soft drinks, Columbia
was going to be to hospitals. The company has since retreated from
that ambitious goal.
</P>
<P>
   --The government is a big, but unreliable partner. All the talk
about the marketplace in health care misses an obvious point: the
government, through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, pays a big
share of health care costs. The average Massachusetts hospital, for
example, gets 50 percent of its revenue from the two government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act, a measure
designed to slow the growth in Medicare spending. The slowdown
turned into something more like a screeching halt. ``No one
realized how Draconian it was at the time,'' said a local hospital
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The spending cuts upset the plans of hospitals, nursing homes,
and home health companies, especially those who were counting on
increased revenue to make their merger math work out.
</P>
<P>
   Does the failure of the health mergers mean such combinations
can't work? Not necessarily. It does, however, suggest that the
early enthusiasm for any merger does not guarantee comparable
enthusiasm down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Are you listening AOL?

<TEXT>
<P>
   In chickspeak, tearful Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre is the
drama queen, the frumpy leader of the Seattle Seahawks is Coach
Walrus, and the phrase ``potent offensive unit'' may or may not
have anything to do with yardage gained.
</P>
<P>
   Proceed only if you dare, because www.chicksonfootball.com is to
the typical sports Web site what a black-lace teddy is to plain
cotton underwear. The latter provides the basics, but the former
offers the potential for a lot more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Football, the chicks insist, is entertainment. ``We would rather
laugh and gossip and dish than we would argue and get angry,'' said
Becky Smyrnios of Peabody, Mass. ``We're not angry people, we're
giggly people.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly aren't airheaded people. In just the eight months
since Smyrnios and workout partner Stephanie Lee of Groveland began
to act on their chitchat about starting a Web site from which they
could share their love of football and tight pants, they've popped
up in Sports Illustrated (``smirkingly prurient'') and ESPN
magazine (``surprisingly smart''), launched a promising sideline of
radio guest appearances around the country, and will use the coming
offseason to explore avenues of expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of work to be done,'' said Smyrnios.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial investment of about $10,000, they're already
breaking even on operating costs by selling fashion T-shirts and
other apparel known as chickwear. Too busy developing the concept
and content, they haven't even tried yet to sell ads for the site,
which went online in early July. Since the four-paragraph item in
SI last month, the two _ still working their day jobs in corporate
public relations (Lee) and the insurance industry (Smyrnios) _ have
been getting 200 e-mails a week, all of which they try to answer in
the 25 or so hours a week they devote to what is still a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more ideas than there are time and money,'' said
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Described by one wry observer as ``not your normal x's and o's
type of football,'' the site nonetheless betrays its founders'
knowledge of the game amid the double entendres and saucy asides.
By the end of the regular season, Lee was 125-110 for her picks
against the spread, while Smyrnios also broke .500 at 119-116. But
the chicks are far more intrigued by choosing an All-Stud Team (the
Patriots' Lawyer Milloy, they tease, ``can cross-examine us any
time, any place'') or issuing spankings to players behaving badly.
They're betting a lot of other people will be, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a unique approach to football,'' said John
Crowe, who has recruited Smyrnios and Lee to appear on Friday
mornings during the playoffs on ``Sports Radio 790 _ The Score''
out of Providence, R.I., where he is executive producer. ``It's
kind of refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fan is Owen Murphy, a producer at eyada.com, on which
they have appeared on internet radio broadcasts. ``They're funny as
hell,'' he said. ``They were a thousand times better than I ever
thought they could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The chicks have also attracted the attention of academia. Mike
Reilley, a lecturer at the Medill School of Journalism at
Northwestern University, has linked to chicksonfootball from the
Web site for his graduate-level class on the Sociology and Economy
of Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show a lighter side to sports journalism, so to
speak,'' said Reilley, who covered the NFL for three years while
with the Los Angeles Times. ``It's silly and fun, and they mean it
to come across that way. I appreciate the different perspective and
the different voice to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a voice by which some are troubled. ``I felt like I was
walking into a bad fraternity party, the kind where the music is
bad, the jokes are bad, the pickup lines are bad, and some bozo
spills beer in your shoes,'' said Christine Brennan, an author,
broadcaster, and sports columnist for USA Today. ``As I waded
around the frat-party muck, I laughed a few times. (But) I won't go
back. I would hope that our gender could do better than the boys.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that Smyrnios and Lee are well-versed in the
sport (``It's nice to see women talking football, when you weed out
the innuendo''), Brennan can't help but fear that some readers will
confuse their approach with that of serious female journalists. ``I
would hate to have people think this is how women cover sports,''
she said. ``This is how two women who call themselves chicks cover
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   And if two dudes got together and decided to give the same
treatment to, say, the WNBA? Said Reilley: ``It would be, to quote
REM, the end of the world as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even their biggest supporters suggest the chicks overdo some of
the sauciness. ``I think they sell themselves short a little bit,''
said Murphy. Reilley agreed, but quickly pointed out, ``If you're
too vanilla, you don't get mentioned in Sports Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chicks themselves say they have gotten surprisingly few
negative comments. Although they were warned at the outset that
``men will hate you because you don't know anything and women will
hate you because you're sexist bimbos,'' they said, e-mail from
women often begins, ``I wasn't expecting to like you, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people take it for what it is,'' said Lee. ``We're women
who are taking a risk in a male-oriented profession, doing things
our own way.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole enterprise was born just last May, but the chicks'
friendship goes back to Danvers (Mass.) High School, Class of 1984,
where Smyrnios was a gymnast and Lee a cheerleader. While Lee went
to the University of New Hampshire to study journalism and then
Boston University for a masters in communication, Smyrnios got a
degree from Amherst College. Neither was much of a football fan;
that came via Becky's marriage to Peter Smyrnios, almost 10 years
ago, after which Sunday afternoons were given over to the games on
TV. When Lee started joining the chip-eating crowd in the
Smyrnioses' living room, she, too, soon caught the fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably one of the few women around who got into football
because of a girlfriend,'' quipped Lee, whose 4-month-old daughter,
Sydney, has spent every Sunday of her life watching football as
mommy works, after the pair decided it was time to get serious
about putting their voices out on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   From the first keystroke, the chicks knew their Web site would
be more gossip than news, more sarcasm than statistics. (``We're
bored by all the facts,'' explained Smyrnios.) Their naughty
cyperpersonalities, though, seemed to blossom naturally from what
made them laugh as they toiled. Themes on the site include
Smyrnios's ``sickening crush'' on Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy
Aikman, and any player with the last name of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of like romance columnists,'' said Lee. ``We find
this great nugget and build from it.''
</P>
<P>
   And their husbands? While Stephanie's husband Michael is quietly
proud, Peter Smyrnios wants in on the action. ``(Becky) stole my
dream career,'' said the former Peabody High quarterback.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Late out of bed and still in her workout
clothes, the young woman with waist-length cinnamon hair rounds a
corner on Harvard Square pushing an empty stroller.
</P>
<P>
   Bopping along a few steps behind is the Harvard senior's 3
1/2-year-old, happy-go-lucky daughter, who little more than two
years ago ignited a bitter custody fight that provoked a national
debate over a mother's right to advance her career at the cost of a
father's visitation rights. The feud nearly prevented her mother
from returning to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Now in her final semester, Gina Ocon faces the end of her
cocoon-like world of grants, low-interest loans, and
university-subsidized housing. And the post-graduation reality will
test more than the 24-year-old's education, it will test her
ability to confront her past.
</P>
<P>
   The former beauty contestant turned social anthropology major
may soon have to wage another legal battle with her former
boyfriend in Southern California. After graduation in June, she
wants to stay in Cambridge with her daughter, Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I'm not sure what's going to happen,'' Ocon said in a
recent interview as Bailey chased pigeons and devoured spoonfuls of
vanilla ice cream and rainbow sprinkles. ``When he finds out I'm
not coming back, he'll definitely do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall semester of 1997, Ocon has built a life in
Cambridge, just across the Charles River from Boston. She has a
supportive community of friends and professors, a rock band she
sings with that has recorded a few compact discs, and a new
boyfriend, who has become something of a stand-in father to Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   But the terms of her custody could prevent her and Bailey from
staying. Sometime this spring, Ocon has to return to court in
Southern California for a review of her former boyfriend's
visitation rights. If the two don't agree on a new settlement _
Bailey now goes to California two weeks during the school year and
six weeks over the summer _ the girl's father, Tommaso Maggiore,
may again sue for custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would pretty much disappear, but he hasn't,''
Ocon said. ``On the surface, he doesn't appear interested. He
doesn't call for months. But then right before she's supposed to
visit him, he gets very controlling.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since Ocon returned to Harvard with Bailey, not
much has changed in Maggiore's life. He still lives with his family
in Long Beach. He's still pursuing a degree part-time at a local
community college. And he still resents Ocon for taking his
daughter more than 2,500 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at a diving shop where he works in Long Beach, Maggiore,
24, said he would like to see his daughter more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I really don't know what I'll do,'' he said. ``I'm
supposed to get more liberal visitation than I have. Now, I have
pretty much next to nothing. The only thing I have had so far is
heartache.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, he says, he believes chances are slim that he'll
persuade a court to force Ocon and Bailey back to the West Coast.
In California, the law generally favors the custodial parent's
right to choose where he or she lives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Maggiore has a strong argument, lawyers say. When a court
decides what's in Bailey's best interests, especially as she nears
school age, it will be hard to discount having her father nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Maggiore and Ocon knew each other while growing up but didn't
become a couple until she returned to Southern California after her
freshman year at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed a parfect match. She had been a beauty contest
runner-up; he was a well-dressed, handsome heir to a popular
restaurant his family owns.
</P>
<P>
   When Ocon returned to Cambridge after the summer, she discovered
she was pregnant. After considering their options, the couple chose
to have the baby. Ocon took the year off and returned to Long
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Bailey's birth, the young family flew back to
Cambridge where Maggiore applied for a job at one of Harvard's
exclusive eating clubs. They hoped to sign up for campus housing,
but they arrived too late. The affordable apartments were already
taken.
</P>
<P>
   So, the three put off their plans for another year and moved
back to Long Beach. Three months after Bailey's birth, the
relationship unraveled. After several heated arguments, Ocon walked
out with Bailey. Three days later, Maggiore filed for custody.
</P>
<P>
   Months of tears and scorn followed. Accusations volleyed between
Ocon's and Maggiore's increasingly acrimonious families, before
Ocon eventually won the right to take Bailey back to Harvard for
the duration of her studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many lessons I learned,'' Ocon said. ``You
really better be in a serious relationship and know the person well
before you have children. I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ocon is eager to graduate after six years of balancing
single motherhood, hours of studying, and a legal battle, she's not
sure what she wants to do and she's worried about revisiting the
custody issues while starting payment on some $40,000 in student
loans.
</P>
<P>
   She does know, however, that she won't do what she planned on
before going to Harvard. After years of dealing with attorneys,
judges, and seemingly endless legal minutiae, Ocon has decided not
to become a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, she said, she'll apply for a job at Harvard's
fund-raising office, as a way to give back to an institution that
has staunchly supported her, with annual scholarships, hundreds of
dollars worth of day care, and free room and board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't envision wearing a business suit,'' she said. ``I'd
like to do something more academic. Definitely I see graduate
school in my future.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Ocon spends her days running from day care to classes
to band rehearsals to poring over books and writing papers. When
she's alone with Bailey, a giggly girl with bright blue eyes and
stick-straight blond hair, everything else comes after the constant
cautioning, cajoling, and cuddling that goes with motherhood.
Writing an honors thesis, for example, is just too much while being
a single mother.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many students, Ocon has learned how to budget her
time, and she appreciates her education. ``For me, there's a lot of
clarity for why I'm here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiping off the vanilla ice cream smeared on Bailey's plump, pink
cheeks, Ocon says she has few regrets.
</P>
<P>
   She wishes she hadn't expended so much emotion during the
custody fight. There are some words she would take back if she
could. And she would have never gambled her Harvard education for a
fleeting relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one decision she doesn't regret: the decision to
have Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an expectation that you'd feel some resentment toward
her,'' Ocon said. ``Sure, there are the sleepless nights, and she
demands constant attention. But I really enjoy being a mom, and
Bailey's a great kid. The only resentment I have is for him.''

<P>
   For many agricultural cooperatives, 1999 was a year they'd
rather forget. One exception: Welch Foods Inc. of Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to new products, wider distribution, and studies that
talk up the health benefits of grape juice, Welch's, the marketing
arm of the National Grape Cooperative Association Inc., has
recently outperformed much of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frankly hard pressed to come up with any other
(agricultural) product that is doing as well as Concord grapes,''
said Ralph Lawrence, a vice president of CoBank in Denver, which
lends money to many agricultural cooperatives, including Welch's.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last eight months, Welch's has seen monthly sales
running at more than 20 percent above last year's levels, said
Daniel P. Dillon, its president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   There are juice grapes as well as wine grapes. Welch's is about
juice grapes that are mostly grown in Michigan, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Washington state, and Ontario, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1983, Welch's headquarters were in Western New York wine
country. But to attract top talent for its management team, it
relocated to Concord, which around 1850 had given its name to one
of the varieties of grapes that Welch's specializes in.
</P>
<P>
   As grapes thrive, many other farm products are hurting. US
farmers have become so efficient that they now routinely produce
more than paying customers can eat. With supply often outpacing
demand, growers have seen prices for their crops plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. of Lakeville, Mass. is one visible
example of a cooperative that's struggling with oversupply and
falling prices.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, the relative success of the juice grape
``stands out like a beacon,'' Dillon said.
</P>
<P>
   Welch's may be thriving because it's doing a good job fulfilling
an agricultural cooperative's job description.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a publicly traded company, a cooperative's mission is not
simply to maximize shareholders' profits. It also seeks to preserve
the long-term livelihood of its member/growers.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of a cooperative's job is to stimulate demand through
marketing efforts and advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   While other coops change strategies, Welch's prides itself in
staying on message. Its ads relentlessly target families and
feature cute kids. New market efforts include a sponsorship of
iVillage, a Web site that caters to women. And soon Pokemon
characters will be enlisted in a Welch's promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Also stimulating demand is medical research that Welch's has
supported. This research claims that white grape juice may be the
easiest juice for a young child to digest and that purple grape
juice is as good for the heart as red wine.
</P>
<P>
   That research has ``really resonated with consumers'' and helped
to boost sales, said Brian Henehan, who follows the grape industry
at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   Effective marketing may be reflected in Welch's performance in
its most recent fiscal year. Sales rose about 5 percent to a record
$631 million. Net proceeds, the term a cooperative uses for
profits, also hit a record, though they increased only slightly
from $69.8 million to $70.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   For a publicly traded company, such gains would seem modest, but
for an agricultural cooperative, it's ``a phenomenal
counter-cyclical performance,'' said Rex Green, a managing director
for the Boston office of Advest Investment Banking, which advises
Welch's on acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   What's really impressive about last year, according to Dillon,
is that about one third of sales came from new products introduced
within the last five years; in the early 1990s, new products
accounted for about only 10 percent of overall sales.
</P>
<P>
   To a lay person, the phrase ``new product'' means something new
and completely different _ such as Welch's peanut butter and jelly
candy venture with Russell Stover. In industry parlance, however,
taking grape juice or jelly and putting it into a different sized
plastic container can also qualify as a new product.
</P>
<P>
   New containers don't sound like a big deal, but they can have a
big impact on sales.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Welch's products were largely confined to one area
of the supermarket. Because of new packaging, products can now be
found in many supermarket aisles, from the juice shelf to the
freezer case and refrigerated-foods section.
</P>
<P>
   New packaging and different sizes have also given Welch's a much
bigger presence in vending machines, convenience stores, and
membership wholesale clubs. Wider exposure has translated into
higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   Besides effective marketing and wider distribution, Welch's may
have another advantage in its board of directors, said investment
banker Green. Many coops have boards dominated by growers, and one
result is ``insular'' thinking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Welch's, in contrast, has a board that includes growers,
professional managers, and outside directors. A well-balanced board
is partly responsible for the cooperative's carefully thought-out
strategy, Green claims.
</P>
<P>
   Welch's traces its roots to Dr. Thomas Bramwell Welch. In 1869,
looking to make a communion wine that wouldn't make church goers
giddy, he applied the theories of Louis Pasteur to the processing
of Concord grapes. From this mix of religion and science, a
cooperative _ and the US fruit-juice industry _ was born, or so
states Welch's official history.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a search for a church wine today employs
1,250 workers, including about 200 in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges lie ahead. Competition is fierce as beverage makers
battle for a share of the consumer's stomach. In the supermarket, a
rival is as much a soft drink or a bottled water as another juice,
and soft-drink companies in particular have a lot more marketing
muscle than a small player such as Welch's.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the supermarket industry is rapidly consolidating,
and big chains sometimes throw their weight behind their own
store-brand juices and jellies, which can compete with Welch's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the immediate outlook is bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture typically goes in cycles,'' said Cornell's
Henehan. And right now, Welch's has ``the right mix of conditions
to excel.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Among the nail-biting health care providers who treat
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care's million-plus subscribers, none have
greater cause for alarm than those at Harvard Vanguard Medical
Associates, who provide care for nearly one Greater Boston resident
in every 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-three percent of Harvard Vanguard's 300,000 patients are
insured by Harvard Pilgrim, the giant Massachusetts health plan
which state officials took over last week to stave off financial
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The ties between the two go back 30 years. Harvard Pilgrim grew
out of the Harvard Community Health Plan, founded in 1969. Two
years ago, the Harvard Plan's 500 salaried, health center-based
doctors and staff morphed into Harvard Vanguard and split off from
the parent company. But their future is still tightly bound to the
beleaguered HMO.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of dependence, the question among Harvard
Vanguard staffers is: Can we survive?
</P>
<P>
   Internal memos and interviews Tuesday with Harvard Vanguard
executives provide a glimpse of the frantic activity that the
crisis has touched off among Vanguard staffers _ a distillation of
the anxiety that permeates the entire health care industry in
eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes far beyond Harvard Vanguard,'' said Kenneth Paulus,
who takes the reins as Harvard Vanguard's new chief executive next
Monday. ``Everybody has a fair percentage of their income at
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulus guessed there is a 20 percent chance that Harvard Pilgrim
will go bust. ``It would be a huge mistake if we let that happen,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety that permeates Harvard Vanguard was evident in an
email that greeted the group practice's 500 doctors and other
staffers when they reported for work on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither we nor outside experts believe that Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care will be allowed to go out of business,'' wrote Dr.
Gordon Vineyard, the medical group's interim chief executive, and
Dr. Robin Atlas, the chief medical officer. ``Still, we are
planning expeditiously for all contingencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Those contingencies, they acknowledged, include ``the worst-case
scenario _ a liquidation of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Vanguard's top priority, Paulus said, is to accelerate
efforts to win contracts from other health plans so that patients
who lose Harvard Pilgrim coverage can switch to another plan and
maintain their relationship with Vanguard's caregivers. This month
it began offering services to Tufts Health Plan subscribers for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much time we've got,'' Paulus said. ``I hope
to consummate agreements in the next 30 days. It's aggressive, but
it's doable.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Vanguard also must find a new source of capital, which
formerly came entirely from Harvard Pilgrim. Harvard Vanguard
officials said their operations would not be affected if a
now-suspended bond deal to inject new capital into the HMO
eventually goes through. Under that plan, eight of Vanguard's
health centers would be sold and leased back to Harvard Pilgrim.
Paulus did not rule out the possibility that Harvard Vanguard, the
largest physician group practice in Massachusetts except for the
comparably sized Lahey Clinic, might eventually become partners
with another provider group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's potential in our future to have a partnership with
another delivery system,'' said Paulus, currently a top official
with Partners Health Care, the region's largest such system. ``What
that means and how deep that would be, it's too early to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Harvard Vanguard is most at risk, its contingency planning
may be more intense than others'. But everyone responsible for
providing care, buying health insurance, or selling coverage is
feeling the chill.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming their fears, the state regulator in charge of
managing Harvard Pilgrim out of its crisis, insurance commissioner
Linda Ruthardt, Tuesday said she is doing some what-if planning of
her own. Ruthardt has directed Kevin Beagan of her staff to plot
out who might finance care for Harvard Pilgrim's members in case
the HMO can't be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will not have to liquidate,'' Ruthardt said.
``But we're already developing contingency plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers are so worried about the Massachusetts situation that,
for the first time, many are considering national health plans that
have developed local physician networks. While few have actually
jumped ship, many are comparing the networks offered by national
plans such as Aetna and United HealthCare, hoping to find one
similar in coverage to their Harvard Pilgrim plans.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty is motivating employers ``to think nationally
now,'' said Susan Connolly, a partner at the Boston benefits
consulting firm William M. Mercer. ``While it's too soon to say
what's going to happen to Harvard Pilgrim, for an employer to do
nothing at this point would be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enough to turn you gray,'' said Dolores Mitchell,
director of the state Group Insurance Commission, who is
responsible for buying health coverage on behalf of 255,000 state
workers, dependents, and retirees. Nearly 57,000 of those
individuals are currently insured through Harvard Pilgrim, more
than by any other health plan the state offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any responsible benefit administrator, public or private, has
to be thinking through the scenarios and be ready to move,''
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Barrett, chief executive of Lahey Clinic and formerly
of Minnesota's Mayo Clinic, said he has never encountered such a
precarious situation. ``There's no question that Harvard Pilgrim is
an organization we depend a great deal on for our financial
wellbeing,'' said Barrett, whose institution derives nearly 20
percent of its income from Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things Barrett dreads most, he said, is having to
borrow money to pay bills _ a scenario that might unfold if there
is a long delay in repaying the $10 million in debt that Lahey
Clinic says Harvard Pilgrim owes for care provided in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to borrow money to pay bills, it becomes
desperate,'' Barrett said.

BOSTON NATIVE HELPED GET THE DEAL DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ But for a key meeting in Boston two days before
Christmas and the negotiating savvy of a prominent downtown lawyer,
the world might never have seen the epic proposed merger of America
Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   AOL chairman Steve Case, Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin, and
his flamboyant vice chairman Ted Turner dominated the New York
press conference Monday to announce the $178 billion transaction.
But behind the scenes, one of the most crucial players hammering
out the deal was Kenneth J. Novack, AOL's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Novack, 58, spends half his week working out of an AOL office a
short walk across the Public Garden from his Beacon Hill home. He
joined AOL in May 1998 as full-time vice chairman after more than
10 years serving as the company's outside counsel while with Boston
law firm Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky, and Popeo.
</P>
<P>
   Novack handled AOL's initial public offering in 1992, as well as
its 1998 acquisition of CompuServe that added 2 million
subscribers. (AOL currently has more than 22 million.) Case has
called him ``a principal strategist in initiatives that have played
a critical role in our growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Novack's office at Heritage on the Common in Boston was the
scene of a key meeting Dec. 23. He and two top Time Warner
officials, president Richard D. Parsons and Time Warner Digital
Media chairman Richard J. Bressler, and their investment banker
began putting meat on plans Case hatched in Hong Kong two months
earlier for a blockbuster combination of the number one Internet
service provider and the number one media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agreed that we should talk further right after the
holidays,'' Novack recalled of that session, which led to a
five-hour dinner meeting Thursday night at the Northern Virginia
home of AOL chairman Steve Case.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting around Case's dining room table, after enjoying ``a
terrific red wine from Steve's cellar,'' Novack, Case, Levin, and
Bressler were up until midnight working out the final details of
the deal announced Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Novack said the first, most important question was: ``Does this
merger really make sense?'' AOL had been considering several
options to expand, including buying a telecommunications company or
a media company, or simply pouring more resources into expanding
Net-based offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we presented the options to Steve, he had a very strong
instinct that the most dramatic thing we could do was a merger with
Time Warner,'' Novack recalled. ``Gerry and Steve really got it.
The coin dropped for them first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key here is that we are confident that the whole is a lot
greater than the sum of the parts,'' Novack said. ``We will really
build a new paradigm, a new business. We will generate content
which is from its inception multipurpose, and we will be working
hard to make sure that we spread the Internet DNA across Time
Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the merits of the basic idea of an AOL-Time Warner marriage
became clear, Novack said the main focus of talks was how to mesh
the boards and management teams of the two firms, and working out
what became the 55-45 ownership split of the new company between
AOL and Time Warner, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Novack said he finds it ``amazing that the deal did not leak.
Think about AOL: There probably isn't a company in the world that
gets more ink than we do. I think that was a function of two
things: We kept this very, very tightly controlled. We really dealt
with it on an absolute need-to-know basis.''
</P>
<P>
   According to AOL's most recent proxy statement, issued in
September, Novack owned just under 200,000 shares, worth nearly $13
million, and had received during 1998 and 1999 restricted long-term
options to buy 2.08 million more shares. He earned $750,000 at AOL
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Novack, a father of four, held top roles at Mintz Levin for more
than 25 years before joining AOL. He remains of counsel at the
firm, which serves as general counsel to AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Novack was Mintz Levin's managing partner from 1972 to 1978 and
president and chief executive from 1991 to 1994, focusing on
technology firms including Biogen Inc. He is also a trustee of the
Museum of Science and New England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Novack also became nationally known for establishing at Mintz
Levin one of the first and only in-house foundations connected to a
law firm, overseeing both how the firm gave away donations and
coordinating its efforts to have lawyers donate pro bono time
representing and advising charitable and social-service groups.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston native and lifelong resident of the area, Novack
graduated from Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School in its

   Because of his love of Boston, Novack said he tries to spend
half the week in the area and commute the other half of the week to
AOL headquarters in Dulles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said: ``I would only say I am `based' in Boston half the
week. The nature of my responsibilities is such that I am where the
action is. I play a lead role in most of our transactions.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... in particular?''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steinem believes some of the criticism is spurred by
professional jealousy. Hooks has become sought out by major
publishing houses because her prose captures the imagination of
readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a readable scholar,'' says Sherrod. ``Most scholars try
to publish for their 10 friends, writing in jargon, and that
doesn't do any good for the book publishing industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Face to face, hooks exudes positive vibes that make you feel as
thoughyou're her best girlfriend. Her hair is pulled back in a bun
that emphasizes the roundness of her dimpled face. She wears a long
black skirt and pink sweater, which streamlines her short, rather
Rubenesque figure. (Hooks loves writing and discussion, but she has
just as much passion for jewelry and clothing.)
</P>
<P>
   If the conversation lulls for even a moment, this woman who
jokingly declares she wants to become the high priestess of love
hungrily starts probing into matters of the heart. As a
photographer shoots her portrait, hooks simultaneously flirts with
him and interrogates him about his romantic life as though she's a
detective on a particularly intriguing case.
</P>
<P>
   Is he married? What type of relationship did his mother and
father have? You get the feeling the information is being processed
and stored for future reference.
</P>
<P>
   As morning segues into afternoon, she also does not hesitate to
reveal lusty details about her own sexual hunger. She has a love
life that reads like a verse from Lou Bega's hit single ``Mambo No.
5.'' Instead of a little bit of Monica, Erica, and Rita, hooks
talks about Anthony, Nathaniel, and others. (Out of respect, she
doesn't reveal full names.)
</P>
<P>
   Hooks continually returns to two former relationships on this
day. There's the student hooks seduced while teaching at Yale who's
now a classical musician in Boston. And there's Anthony, the most
recent ex-boyfriend, who is 16 years her junior.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent lecture, ``somebody said to me, `Is it true that
you're really into young men?,' '' hooks says while stretched out
comfortably on the red-orange leather couch in her living room. ``I
say, `Actually it's not at all true.' I'm really interested in
feminist men, and when you look for men who are committed to
feminist thinking and action, I find them in the ranks of men who
are 35 and under as opposed to 35 and over, especially black men.''
</P>
<P>
   The complicated subject of love is one hooks began exploring at
age 16 when she began paging through Erich Fromm's ``The Art of
Loving.'' Hooks's intellect made her stand out quickly in her
Kentucky hometown.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and community members would tell her, she says, that
they expected greatness from her. Although hooks's father, who
worked as a janitor, and mother, a homemaker, encouraged their son
and six daughters to read and value education, hooks's intelligence
didn't make her home life easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up in an age where we were expected to be seen, not
heard,'' says Gwenda Motley, 44, one of hooks's siblings, during a
telephone conversation from her home in Flint, Mich. ``Gloria in
particular was very outspoken when it just was not acceptable for
children to be outspoken and hence, yes, she would get the
discipline more so than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooks calls feminism the movement that finally empowered her to
love. Yet in the same breath she also criticizes it for portraying
love negatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to interest people in a movement, you don't trash
what they feel is most important in their life,'' hooks says
earnestly, while at the cafe. ``I think it was a big failure of the
movement to have abandoned that to the depoliticized new-age
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinem, who explored love in a chapter of her 1993 book
``Revolution From Within: A Book of Self-Esteem,'' defends the
movement's stance on love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much damage has been done to women in the name of love,'' she
says. ``It's natural that there would be a hard look and a critique
that came first. Perhaps bell's book is the beginning of a
different stage of reevaluating what's positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation winds to a close. And hooks begins to sound
positively forlorn as she talks about the lack of love in her
current life. Friends abound. She receives a telephone message from
former MTV ``Real World'' housemate and writer Kevin Powell. She
talks about a recent shopping expedition with Jada Pinkett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But other forms of love elude her. Hooks considered adopting a
child, but fears her lifestyle is too selfish for that. She yearns
to be in a relationship with someone, but senses her intellectual
life may be too demanding to sustain one.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hooks reads a book a day. And four hours of her
morning is consumed with writing a set number of pages or
paragraphs in the closetlike study outside her bedroom. She talks
of plans to bring in the new year alone by lighting candles and
giving thanks for ``being able to realize one's deepest visions.''
She later adds, ``It's such a kind of strange, pathetic life.''
</P>
<P>
   Then hooks turns her attention to her guest, and the
thunderstorm of sadness passes. She switches to
high-priestess-of-love mode and begins asking probing questions. As
she analyzes and dissects the answers, she's where she wants to be:
at the intersection of logic and love.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The exhaust fan installed in the ceiling of my bathroom blows
the air straight up into the attic and this has caused a problem
with dampness and mildew accumulating on the overhead roof beams.
</P>
<P>
   I was told the fan's exhaust should be ducted directly to the
outside by running the duct up through the roof, but my peaked roof
is covered with expensive slate tile that I do not want to damage
and which I may not be able to replace if I do.
</P>
<P>
   There is no outside wall in the attic near this fan to which I
can connect the fan's exhaust duct, so can you suggest any other
solution?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you have a peaked or gable roof then chances are you have
overhanging eaves along the outside.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you can run a duct horizontally inside the attic from the
top of the fan opening to the inside of the eave as shown here.
</P>
<P>
   Have it go straight up from the fan as high as possible, then
angle it sideways and slope it down toward the eave opening with as
few bends or twists as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are worried about the security of the overhead door on our
attached garage since it is easy to break into the house from
inside the garage.
</P>
<P>
   The overhead door does have a lock, but it looks like it could
be easily forced open with a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a better way we can secure this overhead door against a
possible break-in?
</P>
<P>
   A: Drill a hole through the side of one track just above one of
the door rollers inside that track. Then insert a long,
bicycle-type padlock through this hole while the door is closed.
</P>
<P>
   This will prevent the door from rolling upward unless someone
removes the padlock from inside the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The concrete floor of my basement leaves a powdery film that
gets tracked onto the carpet in an adjoining room in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything I can do to correct this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: The simplest solution would be to clean the concrete floor
thoroughly, then coat it with two coats of a good quality latex
deck enamel.
</P>
<P>
   The paint will effectively seal the surface and hold down the
dust or powder that keeps coming off on your shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The walls in my living room were covered with sheets of
prefinished wood paneling some years ago, which would be difficult
to remove as they were applied with cement over existing drywall.
</P>
<P>
   Now I want to cover the wood panels with some type of wallpaper,
but the panels have slight grooves between them.
</P>
<P>
   How can I smooth the surface so that I can hang wallpaper over
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The simplest way would be to hang a heavy duty lining canvas
directly over the wood panels.
</P>
<P>
   This type of canvas can be purchased or ordered from most
wallcovering stores for just this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the same as ordinary canvas lining material _ it is a
much heavier duty material that is capable of bridging and covering
up irregularities in the surface underneath, including the grooves
and seams normally found in wood panels.
</P>
<P>
   The material is put up with a special adhesive and leaves you
with a smooth surface over which you can apply paint or wallpaper.

 (Eds.: Ravi Chhatpar is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During his job interview last year at Zefer, an Internet
solutions firm in Boston, Ravi Chhatpar was asked ``to build
something'' with a box of Lego blocks. The 23-year-old Harvard
University graduate was taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told, `You have five minutes to build whatever you want,
then we'll talk about it,' '' he recalled. ``It was a complete
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Chhatpar didn't waste time.
</P>
<P>
   He constructed an aerated cognac snifter and then explained its
functional and aesthetic qualities. His ingenuity paid off: He
landed a job as a consultant in Zefer Co.'s dot-com division.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the nation's big accounting firms altered the
interview by introducing case studies, the old-fashioned sit-down
meeting is again going through a transition as Internet and
computer software firms struggle to find qualified applicants in an
increasingly competitive job market.
</P>
<P>
   The standard interview isn't dead yet, though.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional manufacturers and retailers rely on it as a primary
screening tool, and most employers require one or more face-to-face
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fast-paced world of the Internet, those seeking work
as consultants and computer programmers are being asked to solve
mathematical equations, brainteasers, or riddles, and to
participate in group games and exercises that test a candidate's
ability to collaborate and think under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Aylward has seen her share of odd interviews. As
president of Devon James Associates in Seattle, which develops
recruiting and interviewing strategies for Internet start-ups, she
designs them.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview, one of Aylward's hiring managers
pretended he had forgotten his dry cleaning order and asked the job
applicant to drive him to the shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to see the inside of the person's car,'' Aylward
recalled. ``He also wanted to see if the candidate could answer a
series of difficult questions and get to the dry cleaners on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Aylward identified what she calls the single most important
factor driving the transformation of the conventional interview:
youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the CEOs we work for are between 28 and 34,'' she
said. ``They want to hire clones of themselves. They want people
with off-the-scale energy, wit, and intelligence. They want cowboys
_ people who don't necessarily follow the rules, who question
everything. With every new hire, there is the hope that this new
person will come up with an odd idea that will make the company's
stock soar.''
</P>
<P>
   At ChannelWave in Cambridge, Mass., which designs Web products
that link businesses to resellers, dealers and distributors,
co-founder Ron Schmelzer tosses mind-benders to unsuspecting
applicants. ``It's important to see how well and fast people can
think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During one recent interview, Schmelzer asked: ``If you have two
pitchers of different colored water and you have to put them
together in a single pitcher and then separate them out, how do you
do it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a problem is too difficult to solve,'' he said,
``and the goal is not necessarily to find the right answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The advent of teams, in which groups of professionals are
brought together to work on a project as a group, has played a
significant role in the industry's push to remake the interview,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old process is still necessary, but it isn't sufficient,''
said Jennifer Lawrence, assistant dean for career services at the
Boston University School of Management. ``It doesn't determine who
can strategically apply information, who can manipulate it, or who
can work with others cooperatively while doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Lubrano, director of career services at The Tuck School
at Dartmouth College, recalled an interview in which a top firm
asked candidates from the college to work together to solve a
problem. The firm's principals watched from behind a one-way
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students knew they were being observed, but they couldn't
see the members of the firm,'' Lubrano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we'd see this primarily at consulting firms,'' he
added. ``Now, we are seeing a proliferation of these interviewing
techniques at a lot of Internet companies where time is at a
premium and there is a need to determine intellectual capability
quickly and efficiently, something that cannot always be done
during a 30-minute interview.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this is a full-employment economy and good people are
so difficult to find, companies realize they must be extremely
careful,'' Lawrence said. ``They realize that it's costly to bring
someone in and then discover that he doesn't fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are relying on professional facilitators to
conduct group exercises or interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Browne Center, an affiliate of the University of New
Hampshire, uses them to screen top college seniors for jobs at
Razorfish, an international computer services firm based in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Callanan, vice president of people at Razorfish, said the
company relies on an expert from the Browne Center to administer
games, problems, and team exercises to groups of 25 to 40 student
candidates. ``This allows us to see problem-solving, thinking out
of the box, and leadership ability,'' she said. ``We get to see
them in action and see how well they work in teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The sessions, usually held after the last round of interviews,
are designed to help hiring officers focus on behavioral issues
that might not have been evident during the regular recruitment
process.
</P>
<P>
   They're also fun _ a factor that can deceive candidates into
thinking their behavior doesn't matter. Although the company
informs candidates early on that the sessions are designed to test
creativity and behavior, the students are asked to dress casually,
and the environment is relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The activities are so engaging that people tend to relax and
be who they really are,'' acknowledged Pamela McFee, director of
the Browne Center.
</P>
<P>
   McFee, who has facilitated sessions at Razorfish for four years,
recalled an incident in which a candidate's suggestion that members
of the group work together elicited a hostile response from another
applicant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A peer turned and said, `It will never work!' '' McFee
recalled. ``The behavior was clearly inappropriate. It was also the
most extreme behavior we had seen. No matter how good the grades in
college or the personal interview, that type of trait will not work
at Razorfish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tuck School's Lubrano said consulting companies are relying
more on big social settings to screen MBA graduates for top jobs. A
company invites all types of employees, from administrative
assistants and line employees to the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see how you treat the secretary as well as the
chief executive officer,'' Lubrano noted. ``Is this a person who is
able to work with, and manage, people up and down the food chain?''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ravi Chhatpar received that pile of Legos at Zefer,
he had already attended a social event at the Zefer Cafe for
employees and friends interested in working at the company. The
cafe gives the company a chance to see prospective candidates
interact socially and gives applicants a taste of the company's
culture, a Zefer spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Chhatpar's creativity and social behavior were not
the only factors that landed him the job.
</P>
<P>
   Chhatpar, the older of two children, came to Zefer with a year's
experience in consulting, a science and technical background, a
degree from a respected Ivy League college, and fluency in English,
French, Italian, German, and Hindi.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a yen for new ideas. ``I wanted to be where the
newest idea was happening in the US,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before Chhatpar was offered a job, Zefer relied on a
different approach: It interviewed candidates in a tiny room with a
picture window overlooking a busy downtown street. The room was
equipped with two chairs and a table, at which applicants were
expected to create an object from clay or Lego blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would literally have to crawl up a little ladder to get
to that room,'' recalled Martha Stephens, executive vice president
for people at Zefer.
</P>
<P>
   Why go to such extremes?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all kinds of people working here, and we need to make
sure people are comfortable outside their particular discipline.''

<HEADLINE>
HAS THE FUND STREAK PEAKED? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mutual fund was invented during the Roaring '20s, so it is
perhaps fitting that it came of age in the Booming '90s.
</P>
<P>
   After languishing for generations, the fund industry exploded
last decade, radically altering the investment world, bestowing
prosperity on millions of Americans, and changing how the middle
class enjoys its golden years.
</P>
<P>
   But after a streak as one of the nation's hottest industries,
the $6.5 trillion fund world has entered an Age of Uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is forcing many fund companies, often conservative
by nature, to grab the bull of innovation by the nose-ring and
offer new services and products. Competition is growing, both
within the industry and from cyber-upstarts. A decline in sales
gains has slashed profits at even the biggest companies. And
expectations from investors accustomed to lofty stock market
returns have some fund firms wondering how they will appeal to
customers in leaner times.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers even wonder if the industry has peaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a mature market in mutual funds in the United
States,'' said Burton Greenwald, a financial services consultant in
Philadelphia. While Greenwald expects the fund industry to double
in size over the next seven years, he said that its growth rate
would drop from 20 percent to 10 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, fund firms were a distinct species, and the
portfolio management business was concentrated in Boston. Now there
are hot players across the country, like Denver-based Janus Funds.
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. is best known as a big brokerage in San
Francisco _ but it has become a huge fund industry player by
selling other companies' products. Schwab competes with
Boston-based Fidelity Investments, the world's biggest fund firm _
but it also views Merrill Lynch, the brokerage giant that just
launched Web investing, as a major threat.
</P>
<P>
   Such a blurring of boundaries has led the fund industry to seek
new ways to help investors cultivate their financial gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the 1990s, the challenge was how fast can
you grab market share and growth,'' observed Avi Nachmany, a
financial services analyst at Strategic Insight, a New York
consulting company. ``Now for many firms, the challenge is to
ensure you're the premier financial relationship for your
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dot.com world, that task is accomplished with the Internet.
Last year, few fund firms had a Web site; now, 80 percent do. With
investors increasingly sophisticated and exposed to ever more
information through investment publications, news programs, and Web
sites, the Internet is allowing fund sellers to offer increasingly
tailored service, including financial planning, investment
education, account statements, daily portfolio pricing, tax
information, and real-time market and other news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant changes you'll see going forward at
Fidelity (come from) the impact of the Internet on our business,''
said Robert Pozen, the company's chief of investments. ``It's going
to allow us to deliver a very customized product.''
</P>
<P>
   For firms that sell funds through banks, brokers, and financial
advisers, the Internet poses special challenges. Such companies,
including Putnam Investments, American Fund Distributors, and MFS
Investment Management, have to balance the shift toward direct,
personalized service with the demands of their
intermediary-sellers, who fear Web services could cut them out.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the threat to the middleman is small. Only 13 percent of
funds are sold directly to investors by fund firms; the remaining
sales are through intermediaries or to employer-sponsored
retirement plans. Still, fund firms are beefing up their Web sites
to give third-party sellers more planning tools. With the Internet,
``we will see more effective, personalized, immediate ways of
communicating'' among fund sellers, investors and intermediaries,
said Putnam's chief executive, Lawrence Lasser.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's technological mindset is a response to fresh
competitive forces.
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourself Web investing, which has jolted Wall Street
enough to cause even staid brokerages to adopt on-line trading, has
put many fund firms on guard. For the fund world, Internet
stockpicking ``is clearly a competitive threat,'' said John
Brennan, chairman and chief executive at The Vanguard Group.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is especially dangerous to Vanguard, whose specialty,
index funds, made the Valley Forge, Pa., company the best-selling
fund group of the 1990s. Because index funds passively mirror a
benchmark's composition and involve no active stockpicking, they
are the antithesis of on-line stock trading. While Meir Statman, a
finance professor at California's Santa Clara University, said
investors appeared to have embraced self-directed stockpicking,
other observers call the trend overhyped. Nachmany said only 1
percent of the investing population had jumped into on-line
trading. And with some of the biggest fund sellers, like Fidelity
and Schwab, operating brokerages with on-line services, fund firms
have an edge in drawing Web traders.
</P>
<P>
   But other problems loom.
</P>
<P>
   After raking in $12.8 billion in net new cash in 1990, stock
funds, the most popular form of mutual fund, saw flows rise nearly
twentyfold, to a peak of $227.1 billion in 1997. The figures
reflect the amount of money going into funds minus sums going out,
or withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Gross sales are still strong. But much of the new money has been
going to flavor-of-the-moment technology funds, a sign that
investors are chasing past gains and are perhaps less inclined to
treat mutual funds as a long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
   More striking is a dramatic rise in withdrawals, or redemptions.
Investors bought $815.3 million worth of stock funds in the first
11 months of 1999, 28 percent more than a year earlier, but they
also increased redemptions by nearly 40 percent, to $661.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The net result is a 6.3 percent drop in net sales of equity
funds last year through November; for some individual firms, the
decline is in double digits. Redemptions in bond funds have been
steeper still. David Haywood, an analyst at Financial Research
Corp., estimates that half of all fund companies are losing more
cash than they are taking in.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawals are costly to firms, since managing less money
produces lower fees. They are also disruptive to portfolio
managers, who must sell holdings to raise cash. And the slowdown
has led stocks of publicly traded fund companies to slump.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers call the fund industry a victim of its own
success, and say investors, who have captured heady gains, are
cashing out of funds to buy expensive goods.
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder if Americans have grown comfortable with saving
less. Another theory posits that investors have become greedy and
are pulling out money to gamble on Internet stocks or to trade on
line. Still another cites lingering investor trauma from Russia's
1998 financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its cause, the sales decline marks a turning point for
the industry, which was born in Boston in 1924, when Massachusetts
Investors Trust, now MFS, sold a fund full of shares in companies
like Union-Pacific Railroad and Edison Electric of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bright but brief beginning. By spoiling investors'
appetite for stocks, the Depression stifled the fund industry's
potential for decades. In the 1980s, the business awakened, as star
portfolio managers like Peter Lynch became household names and the
idea of low-cost, professionally managed portfolios gained mass
appeal. In the early 1990s, funds blossomed, as America's great
bull market took off and investors doubted the government's ability
to provide for their retirement _ a loss of faith that led to the
rise of the 401(k) corporate retirement plan, in which funds are
prominent.
</P>
<P>
   As revolutionary as credit cards and cash machines, the Great
Mutual Fund Revolution had huge consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Once shackled to expensive broker fees, Main Street now had an
affordable way to participate in Wall Street's boom. Scores of fund
owners became millionaires. Money once kept in banks and brokerage
accounts flowed to fund firms _ by 1998, fund assets surpassed bank
holdings for the first time in history. Individual investors now
control nearly 80 percent of the fund industry's assets, making
them a powerful force in markets. (Institutional investors,
insurers, and banks account for the remaining 20 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Riding that wave, the number of fund firms more than quadrupled
last decade, to more than 600. Funds, and their burgeoning
varieties, now outnumber listed stocks. Even other businesses
jumped on the bandwagon, with companies like General Motors and
United Airlines launching their own retail funds.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of uninterrupted growth and extraordinary
prosperity, the fund world is ripe for winnowing.
</P>
<P>
   About 72 percent of net sales were made by the 10 largest
players, according to Financial Research. The crowded field has led
analysts to predict that the largest and the smaller, niche firms
will survive, while mid-tier players, with tens of billions in
assets, will merge with other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The big guns have vowed to sit out the shakeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will definitely not be acquired, and we will not be
acquiring funds companies or banks or going public,'' said
Fidelity's Pozen. ``Although it's possible we could spin off a
non-core part of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   On other fronts, fund executives must now manage investors'
robust expectations. Bolstered by history's longest bull market,
the average US diversified stock fund has posted double-digit gains
for seven out of the past 10 years, including a 27.1 percent rise
in 1999, according to Lipper Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single biggest challenge going forward is the market and
investors' expectations,'' said Vanguard's Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   And firms that sell to 401(k) plans, a major source of profit
and growth to the fund industry, face pressure to lower
administrative fees as well as competition from alternative,
cheaper institutional accounts. The challenges have led Putnam to
introduce record-keeping for retirement plans with company stock,
and Fidelity to court the small-business retirement plan market
through its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders have faith that the business can reinvent
itself. Putnam is launching hedge funds and hungrily eyeing foreign
retirement-plan markets, and most players are plotting ways to
capture money from baby boomers, who will need new homes for their
401(k) money after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there is going to be more competition and more
innovation,'' said David Pottruck, Schwab's president and co-chief
executive. ``Fund firms have to find how to make themselves more
consumer-friendly. We need more new ideas.''

MCCAIN, TAKING SHOTS FROM RIVALS, STAYS SPIRITED AND DEFIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain has his enemies where he wants them: all lined up
right in front of him, and blazing away in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   The maverick Arizona Republican, the least programmed and most
focused of the eight men still running for president, is attracting
all kinds of flak in New Hampshire as the old fighter pilot comes
around for his make-or-break strafing run before New Hampshire
votes.
</P>
<P>
   His enemies aren't the people he's running against. He treats
his fellow competitors with gentlemanly refinement, by and large,
save for his salvos against the incumbent administration. The old
Navy man's real foe is the system _ and the soft money, unlimited
six- and seven-figure sums lavished by wealthy interests on
cash-starved pols, that corrupts it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The billions of dollars in soft money is what corrupted the
political campaigns'' of recent elections, McCain told two dozen
Boston Globe journalists Tuesday at an editorial board meeting.
``The rise in soft money coincided with the drop in voter
participation and the growth of cynicism among the young.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he does not wish to sound defensive after publication of
letters he wrote to federal bureaucrats prodding them for decisions
on matters important to corporations that contributed to his
campaign or let him fly at government-approved rates on corporate
jets for campaign trips, McCain owned up to being part of the very
system he's trying manfully to overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It taints us all,'' he readily acknowledged. ``One reason I
got dinged up by the implication of the Paxon thing,'' he added, is
that it reinforces a perception that every powerful Washington
figure is somehow on the take, or doing favors for rich
contributors, which he should not be doing.
</P>
<P>
   McCain produced letters and tributes from a former Federal
Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hunt, Public Citizen's Joan
Claybrook, a Consumers Union executive, and others to buttress his
claim that he did nothing more than needle the FCC and other
bureaucracies to stop footdragging on decisions pending.
</P>
<P>
   But the disclosure of his letters prodding the bureaucrats,
which are a part of any lawmaker's normal duties, came at a time
when he was vulnerable, running neck-and-neck with Texas Governor
George W. Bush in New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It taints me, it taints everyone,'' said McCain. ``I
understand the implications. I understand why they (voters) would
be cynical about me as well as about everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed as to why he has narrowed his campaign to clean up the
dirty money in politics to just the single point of soft money, the
unregulated transfers of massive amounts of cash to political
parties or political action groups, McCain suggested he decided to
target the most outrageous and flagrant abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think the tobacco industry just gave $7 million to
the Republican Party,'' he asked. ``Good government,'' he laughed,
adding, ``I've watched them try to addict children and lie to
Congress.'' But their money is prized by his own party.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked what a President George W. Bush might do for the
corporate interest of giant Texas energy conglomerate Enron Corp.,
whose executives bundled some $550,000 in campaign gifts to the
Texas governor. McCain chortled: ``They'll get what the tobacco
companies got _ (itals)good government.''(unitals) Some of his
listeners may not get the joke _ but he does.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unusual for a presidential candidate who is only
slightly ahead in New Hampshire, or maybe even with his chief
rival, to be as loose and free-swinging as McCain. But 5 1/2 years
in a North Vietnamese prison camp, enduring torture and deprivation
on top of plane crash wounds that still hamper his arm movement,
toughened McCain to the point of being bullet-proof in the normal
political sense.
</P>
<P>
   Even while he's being targeted by a batch of negative ads from
lobbyists who fear the public ratification of his crusade to clean
up politics, McCain is spirited and defiant. He may not wind up
being elected president. But no one is having more of a blast this
season than McCain, the Annapolis wise guy and irreverent jet
jockey who has sparked the closest thing to a groundswell of
spontaneous support in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   He freely takes on his own party's shibboleths. Though he has
been elaborately polite to Bush and the others, McCain has no
problem training his cannonfire on Bush's extravagant tax giveaway.
Seeking to obliterate political memories of his own father's
vow-breaking (``Read my lips _ no new taxes'' ring a bell?), Bush
Jr. is vowing to hand back to taxpayers an incredible $800-plus
billion, as much as $2,000 a year for a family of four earning
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   This is a huge bribe to the GOP primary voter, a tax giveback
that is twice as much as McCain deems prudent. ``Sixty percent of
his tax cut goes to the richest 10 percent of Americans,'' replies
McCain, and does nothing to save Social Security or Medicaid. He's
not for ``class warfare,'' he grins, he's just for ``giving the
low- and middle-income people a break.''
</P>
<P>
   He flies a high-risk heading, with ack-ack coming from lots of
lobbyists. I won't go negative on anybody, he vows, you just have
to keep your cool, fly straight and level, ``and mostly what you
have to do is do your message, do your campaign, you can't be
knocked off stride.'' That's the thing that makes McCain so
different. You can wing him, you can slow him down, you can shoot
him down, but you cannot cow him.

diplomat from Bahrain, Shamela Begum says she was kept a virtual
prisoner in a apartment on Manhattan's East Side. In a suit filed
in December in U.S. District Court in Manhattan and seeking
unspecified damages, accuses the diplomat who employed her,

A CASUALTY OF HISTORY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1920s, a time of emotional exhaustion, someone asked
James Joyce what he did during the Great War. The author replied:
``I wrote `Ulysses.' What did you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton did not write ``Ulysses,'' but has sometimes lived
it. As the Clinton era, a seven-year run-on sentence, grinds toward
its last chapter, the question of ``legacy'' haunts the Joycean
protagonist in the White House and has for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may never have been a president so widely read in
American history or so covetous of a large place in the history
books as Bill Clinton,'' William E. Leuchtenburg said last year.
``When I encountered the president at a White House picnic in
1994,'' the University of North Carolina historian added, ``Clinton
interrogated me closely, and knowledgeably, on Roosevelt. `This guy
can cite you details about every president,' one of his advisers
has asserted.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton knows that peace and prosperity are poor clay for Mount
Rushmore, which salutes those who handled war and tumult. Lists of
presidential quotes will cite Clinton for memorable denials: what
he didn't inhale and with whom he did not have sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Letters of a Nation,'' compiled in 1997, reprints epistles
from Benjamin Franklin, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Harry Truman, and
others. Bill Clinton is represented for his 1969 letter thanking
Colonel Eugene Holmes ``for saving me from the draft.'' The letter
is honeycombed with classically Clintonian swerves and cadenzas,
the type that baffle his opponents and activate itchy thumbs on
home C-span zappers.
</P>
<P>
   Eloquence was not on Clinton's to-do list. He enjoyed too much
success in Hope and Hot Springs putting the hay down where the
goats can get at it: no flights of fancy, no Kennedysque calls for
sacrifice, no call to arms against a common foe. Lars-Erik Nelson
explains Clinton's luck in the Jan. 20 New York Review of Books:
``Though he is an eloquent speaker, he seldom directs his oratory
against his enemies. Rather he lets them snarl themselves into
inchorence.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rules of legacy are harsher than the rules of life. ``In
this job, I am not worried about my enemies,'' President Warren G.
Harding once remarked. ``It is my friends who are giving me
trouble.'' When history judged Harding, he could not blame Albert
Fall, Harry Daugherty, or ``the Ohio Gang.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton is judged, he also will stand alone, without the
protective phalanx of Kevin Starr, Linda Tripp, and all the Zouaves
and zanies in Congress assembled by Newt Gingrich. The former House
speaker, at first beguiled, overreacted to Clinton's charm with a
self-destructive ferocity matched by Master-at-arms Claggart in
Herman Melville's ``Billy Budd.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, impeachment and investigations repelled more
people than they attracted, turning Clinton into a sympathetic
figure. But people can be fickle and cruel. In 1923, the nation
grieved when Harding died. When his personal and political scandals
were revealed, they laughed at him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would like to be remembered, Clinton has said that
he tried to help better people's lives. He was a strong case, both
at home and overseas. But history has a laugh track. If Mark Twain
is recalled more fondly than Benjamin Harrison, Jay Leno carries
more clout and longevity than Lanny Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legacy may be more comic than tragic, a tragedy in
itself. In 50, 75, or 100 years, readers of history may giggle at
Clinton, asking ``He did what? Where? With whom?''
</P>
<P>
   He has considerable skills and decent instincts, but often
overcalculates them into trivia. Polls and stagecraft can not
soothe Clinton's obsession with legacy because history is an
occupational hazard. ``We cannot escape history,'' Abraham Lincoln
said. James Joyce had a more mordant view, expressed by a character
in Ulysses: ``History,'' he said, ``is a nightmare from which I am
trying to awake.''

MCCAIN STRATEGY UNTRIED BUT TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not a man who cowers in the face of a tough question.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the five years of hostile interrogations as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam, or maybe Senator John McCain really
isn't afraid to lose. Either way, it is clear that the Republican
from Arizona is not playing presidential politics by the same old
rules.
</P>
<P>
   With the New Hampshire primary only three weeks away, the
conventional wisdom is that McCain should be quaking at suggestions
that the GOP candidate of campaign finance reform is a tool of his
corporate supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McCain is adopting an untried political strategy. He is
being direct, not defensive. He is trusting New Hampshire voters to
distinguish between the forest and the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he says, he did press federal regulators for a long-delayed
decision on a Pittsburgh television license transfer for a campaign
donor. Trying to budge the bureaucracy, he says, is part of his
job. What he did not do, all parties agree, is try to pressure the
Federal Communications Commission to approve the license transfer.
(It's a good bet that a guy who once refused to accept his captors'
offer of freedom unless all his fellow POWs were released with him
sets a pretty high bar on the quid pro quo front.)
</P>
<P>
   There is a substantial difference between asking for a decision
and demanding an outcome, although the underdog candidate for the
Republican presidential nomination well understands that in
high-stakes politics appearances alone can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand people's suspicion,'' he says, citing the
insidious and corrosive influence of special-interest money in
national politics. Reducing that influence has been the major
preoccupation of John McCain's Senate career and is now the
cornerstone of his upstart campaign for the presidency. ``I see
campaign finance reform as the gateway to all other reforms,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Such a high-profile commitment to reform certainly invites
serious scrutiny of the senator's record, but McCain is learning
that there are times a presidential candidate cannot win for
losing.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions about his appeal to the FCC on behalf
of Paxson Communications, McCain immediately released hundreds of
letters he has written during his years in the Senate to various
federal agencies. What he called full disclosure, the Associated
Press Tuesday described as a ``tell-all strategy of damage
control.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all so familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, when his political opponents were whispering
that his years as a prisoner of war had left the former US Navy
pilot mentally unstable, McCain authorized the release of thousands
of pages of his private medical records. The records showed no
evidence of mental health problems; to the contrary, they
documented his surprising stability given the trauma he suffered
during the war, including more than two years in solitary
confinement. Still, the anecdotes of his alleged volatility keep
coming.
</P>
<P>
   Had McCain not released his correspondence on behalf of
corporate interests or had he failed to disclose his private
medical records, we would be asking what the candidate had to hide.
When he comes clean with the documents, we characterize the
disclosures as a ``flood of paper'' that is part of McCain's
``damage-control strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a clear political miscalculation on McCain's part to
write his letter to the FCC on Paxson's behalf in the same week
that he joined former Senator Bill Bradley to denounce the
influence of special-interest money in national politics. But a
political miscalculation is not the same as political corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that McCain's five rivals for the Republican
nomination took a pass on the FCC ``scandal'' during the debate in
Grand Rapids, Mich., on Monday night. Who among them has not done
something similar? Who in public life is not susceptible to similar
questions about the access to their office that they have given to
campaign contributors?
</P>
<P>
   Providing access is not the same thing as peddling influence.
The first is a noxious byproduct of this nation's flawed system of
financing political campaigns, a system John McCain is fighting to
change. The latter is already against the law.
</P>
<P>
   Appearance isn't always reality and looks really can be
deceiving. John McCain can only hope that in New Hampshire, voters
look past the forest to the trees.

LUCK RUNS OUT FOR 1976 SLAY SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   MONTREAL _ Just six months after James Anthony Martin allegedly
shot to death a recent Harvard graduate in 1976, he was arrested on
a drug charge in California. Masking himself as Bruce Benjamin, a
small-time drug dealer, the man police in Boston and Cambridge,
Mass. were scrambling to find walked away free as a bird.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a quarter of a century, Martin, now 51, used more
than 20 aliases in slipping from the grips of authorities again and
again. He was arrested 16 times in Montreal alone _ and at least
twice in the United States _ but always stayed one step ahead of
those who hunted him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed his name with the climate,'' said Sergeant
Detective Patrick Nagle of the Cambridge Police Department. ``For
every crime he assumed a new alias.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, for the first time in 23 years, Martin, tall, thin and
graying, was back in the Boston area, being arraigned in Middlesex
Superior Court for the death of 28-year-old Edward Paulsen. Last
week, he was arrested in Montreal, where he has lived since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not guilty,'' he declared firmly.
</P>
<P>
   But to many in the courtroom, the question wasn't whether Martin
was guilty of the Paulsen murder, but how Martin managed to elude
authorities while making almost regular trips to the courthouse and
lock-up in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the rickety and poor neighborhood on the east side
of Montreal where Martin was known simply as ``Tony,'' some of his
Canadian friends described him as a modern-day Pied Piper, loved by
children and pets. A friend, Daniel Gagnon, said, ``He had a hard
life. You can tell by looking in his eyes that he has been through
hard stuff. (But) he changed his life. Tony is a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   But others saw him as a scoundrel who couldn't be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always trying to be what you would call a bad boy,''
said Daniel Bourbonnais, the owner of a local grocery store. ``He
even spit on one of our cashiers when he caught him trying to steal
a package of Kool Aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who spoke publicly last week before Canadian immigration
officials, insisted he is no longer the sly young exile whose only
care was to escape police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was selfish,'' Martin said to officials. ``I have changed
considerably. . . Before, there was no hope in my life. Now it's
different.''
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Sept. 9, 1976, police said, Martin was a drug
dealer and a robber who, in a flash of anger, became a murderer.
</P>
<P>
   At about 9:15 that night, Paulsen and his brother, Richard, went
to a Cambridge apartment carrying $1,600 they planned to exchange
for a kilo of hashish. A friend of Martin's, Gordon Kent Brown, had
offered to sell the drugs to them.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of the Paulsen boys, Edward, known as Ward, was a
recent Harvard graduate whose rise from a South Boston housing
project to one of the nation's most prestigious universities gave
him a sort of hero status, according to his sister Denise Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who apparently knew the Paulsens slightly through his
friend Brown, showed up, intending to rob the two men, according to
court documents. Waving a gun, Martin forced the Paulsens on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down on the floor,'' he ordered. ``Where is the money?''
</P>
<P>
   When Edward Paulsen raised his hands, according to court
documents, Martin, standing five feet away, shot him in the chest.
Richard Paulsen, who now lives in France, was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Martin's then-girlfriend, Meredith ``Patricia''
Weiss, police said, Brown and Martin trucked to New York City,
throwing the gun into the Mystic River on the way. They took a bus
to California, where Martin stayed with a distant cousin. He later
ended up in Richmond, Calif., where he was arrested for a small
drug charge under the name of Bruce Benjamin. By the time
California officials realized who he was, Martin had already left
California and moved to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, now 49, was captured in New Jersey and convicted of
second-degree murder in 1982. Martin, however, began a life in
Montreal, leaving behind his identity and any part he might have
played in Paulsen's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to Canada to flee the charges that we are now dealing
with in Massachusetts,'' he told immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   During his years in Montreal, he gained an extremely long rap
sheet, said Francois Laberge, senior officer at the Immigration and
Refugee Board. Martin was charged with 31 crimes, including petty
theft, armed robbery, forcible confinement, and transporting
narcotics. Although he spent from 1991 to 1993 in a Canadian prison
on drug charges, said police, prison officials never discovered he
was wanted on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Canadian officials, tired of Martin's criminal ways,
deported him to the United States. He returned to Canada just two
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew the system. He was smart,'' said Cambridge detective
Sil Ferreira, who with the help of the FBI tracked Martin down last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Martin managed to cloak his past even from his friends and wife
in Canada. What people who knew him in Montreal believe about
Martin's youth is far from the reality. He was not raised in a
crime-riddled neighborhood somewhere in America, as they were told,
but in middle-class Englewood, N.J., just outside of New York City,
said David Bowman, Englewood's police chief and a high school
classmate of Martin.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, now in her 80s, still lives in the family's Green
Street home where she raised her children alone.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Martin played football and wrote poetry,
according to his younger sister, Julia Martin. Under James Anthony
Martin's photo in the Dwight Morrow High School 1967 yearbook is
his name and the nickname ``Bosco'' _ one of the many aliases
authorities say he used in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew him from going to the school system,'' Bowman
explained. ``I just remember seeing him in school with no sorts of
association. At the time it seemed to me he never had any set
buddies. He was either a loner or with different people all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Paulsen homicide, Englewood police set up surveillance
through the years during the holidays in case Martin showed up, but
police believe he never did.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Martin concentrated on building a new life in Canada.
Friends say he met his common-law wife, Silvie, in a
drug-rehabilitation center in Montreal. Although Martin told police
he has worked steadily, police say he survived by selling drugs,
stealing, and by defrauding the Canadian welfare system. Local
police say Martin apparently used an alias even with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The couple lived in a $325-a-month, two-bedroom apartment in
Montreal's rough eastside. On a snowy day last week, peeking from
his mailbox was a letter addressed to Robert Beal, the latest alias
he was using. Martin was also fond of the names Tony Bosco, Tony
Day, Tony Martin, and Edward Carlson, a name eerily similar in
sound to his alleged murder victim.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, neighbors watched the lean American trek up and
down the street with his Siberian husky and large black mutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tall black man with this big black dog stuck out in this
predominantly white neighborhood,'' said Norman Deshchamps, a
friend of Martin. His race and strong New Jersey accent fanned
suspicions that he was a drug dealer, said Deshchamps, adding, ``He
got his bike stolen three times but he didn't retaliate.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends say his illegal status in the country forced him to take
on under-the-table jobs and work at a scrap metal shop, but mostly
depend on financial help from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   As for Martin's common-law wife, who was unavailable to comment,
Gagnon said, ``She is crying and sad.''

A SHALLOW CASE FOR THE SJC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Depth perception was obviously not a strong suit of Joseph
O'Sullivan's. This deficiency could have evoked some sympathy,
since all of us have hurt ourselves during a rash impulse, a
seizure of stupidity or accidents where the placing of blame was
merely a laugh upon one self. In my family's case, to borrow from
an early 1990s Spike Lee sneaker ad, it was the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   My wife hates high heels because when she was in medical school,
she fell down the stairs at the wedding of a classmate and broke
her arm. I am four and a half years removed from a ripped Achilles
tendon, which occurred while playing tennis in bad shoes I borrowed
from a friend. The soles were already shredded. With every shot,
they disintegrated into debris that littered the court as I was
being driven away with my ice pack.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to my wife to look up a lawyer over her fall.
It never crossed my mind to sue my friend over the shoes. This is
where O'Sullivan goes from sympathy to silly.
</P>
<P>
   On a July night in 1996, O'Sullivan was at the pool of his
girlfriend's grandparents in Methuen, Mass. He decided to dive off
the shallow end. He had swum in the pool before so he knew its
dimensions. Since he was an experienced swimmer, he must have
understood through cultural osmosis that diving off shallow end of
a pool was potentially dangerous and therefore dumb.
</P>
<P>
   In swimming pools, depth does not discriminate. Whether they are
the budget round tubs of the working class, the in-ground concrete
pools of the middle class, the ornate tilings of hotels and
mansions, or the Olympic-length monsters of health clubs and
colleges, pools all have one thing in common: Shallow ends.
</P>
<P>
   Shallow ends are so clearly shallow that they need warning signs
about as much as you need a sign to keep you from walking across a
freeway. Even so-called ``deep'' ends of backyard pools are rarely
mistaken for the dropoff on the continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Shallow ends are a deliberate evolution. A San Diego Tribune
feature last year on home swimming pools said the kind of divable
pools once glamorized by Marilyn Monroe ``has almost disappeared, a
victim of concerns about safety and liability, as well as a deep
end that is getting shallower. The most popular pool configuration
today is two shallow ends, each about 3.5 feet, that gently slope
to a maximum depth of five feet in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there are few home pools where one can stand at the edge
of any end, strech the arms like Greg Louganis, and dive headfirst
with any confidence that you will pop back to the surface without
either a Michael Jackson nosejob or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what O'Sullivan did. He dived, enriching local
neurosurgeons who must have whispered a private ``tsk, tsk, tsk,''
over his two cracked cervical vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   As howling newspaper readers now know, O'Sullivan did not stop
at counting God's blessings that he was not permanently paralyzed.
He turned around and sued the grandparents of the girlfriend in a
case that is being heard by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial
Court.
</P>
<P>
   A lower court said the pool owners were not responsible for
O'Sullivan's injuries under the concept of ``open and obvious''
dangers. Like walking across railroad tracks and getting diced by a
train. Sprinting across I-95 and getting splattered. Wearing
disintegrating tennis shoes. But the SJC, for reasons that may have
as much to do with needing a laugh as trying to draw a sober lines
of liability on pools, chose to hear O'Sullivan's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan wails a bottom line about hitting the bottom that
would appeal only to the personal injury law offices of Slick,
Trick and St. Nick. Despite being 21 at the time, O'Sullivan blamed
the pool owners for not stopping him from hurting himself. He said
others had been allowed to dive at the shallow end. The pool had no
lights, depth markers or depth warnings.
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan's attorney argues that since he received no personal
warning from the owners that diving in the shallows was dangerous,
the owners were negligent. This is nuts. If pool owners are
responsible for adults who choose to disregard one of the most
obvious of backyard dangers, then what about the guest who
volunteers to help you in the kitchen and then lops off a fingertip
with a knife? Or singe their hand on the stove? Or slips a disc
lifting a chair?
</P>
<P>
   The SJC should have its laugh and then dismiss this case. You
may think it was annoying a few years ago when people had yellow
caution ``Baby on board'' signs in their cars. You have not seen
ugly yet. Imagine a Martha Stewart nightmare, with deadly danger
signs on all toys, kitchen utensils, garden tools, heavy furniture,
electric sockets _ and tennis shoes and high heels. It still will
not be enough. There will always still be someone who cannot be
protected from himself, like Joseph O'Sullivan.

   A new independent, multifaith and comprehensive religion and
spirituality Web site has been launched on the Internet.
Beliefnet.com (www.beliefnet.com) intends to offer news,
information, reports, inspiration, and support in a way that treats
all faiths with equal respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike most religious sites, Beliefnet.com offers an open
community where all faiths and belief systems get careful editorial
coverage,'' said Robert Nylen, co-founder of Beliefnet.com and
founding CEO of the now defunct New England Monthly. ``We welcome
the pious as well as the curious, and we don't fear controversy. We
want to spark some healthy arguments. We welcome alternatives to
traditional thinking as well as conventional spiritual views.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet venture is funded by Highland Capital Partners of
Boston.

   --Religious repression in China has worsened in recent weeks
with the sentencing of Falun Gong and Christian leaders, according
to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exercise of state power in trying to quash religious
expression _ including arrests, imprisonment, and the use of
state-run media to slander people because of their religious
practices, worship or teaching _ is alarming to all those who care
about religious freedom,'' said Rabbi David Saperstein, the
commission's chairman. ``This can only set back China's current
efforts to participate fully in a world community committed to
international rights and liberties.''

ICE CUBE DISHES UP `FRIDAY' LITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
NEXT FRIDAY 
Directed by: Steve Carr 
Screenplay by: Ice Cube 
Starring: Ice Cube, John Witherspoon, Don ``DC'' Curry, Mike Epps,
Justin Pierce, Jacob Vargas, Lobo Sebastian, Rolando Molina, Lisa
Rodriguez, Tommy ``Tiny'' Lister, Jr. 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Rated: R (strong language, drug use and sexual content) 
Star rating: 1 1/2 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' is a sequel to 1995's ``Friday,'' which at best
was a sort of ``Boyz N the Hood'' Lite. ``Next Friday'' is Liter
than Lite. Mostly, it's a string of cartoony vignettes pretending
to be a movie. At times, it all but turns invisible as it tries to
reverse the formula by sending Ice Cube's LA South Central dweller
out to the suburbs, where so much stuff comes at him that he soon
finds himself longing for the relative peace and quiet of the
'hood. A lot of energy goes into trying to pick this concept up and
run with it, but it doesn't go far.
</P>
<P>
   Cucamonga, an LA suburban town whose very name was regarded as a
sure-fire knee-slapper decades ago on old radio comedy shows,
apparently is still viewed as a source of mirth, but only in a
script as mediocre as this one. It ranges from lazy to nonexistent,
as it sends Ice Cube's cool dude named Craig out there to lay low
for a while when word gets out that the big bully Craig busted four
years ago is being released from prison and is in payback mode.
Craig's uncle, it seems, has hit the lottery and has bought a house
there.
</P>
<P>
   In Rancho Cucamonga, Craig's Uncle Elroy (Don ``DC'' Curry) is
able to keep himself in a marijuana haze and indulge himself with
kinky sex toys that would get him banned from the 'hood. Because
he's been inattentive to such details as property taxes, he's about
to lose the house, which adds to the woes of Craig's cousin Day-Day
(Mike Epps), who is embroiled with a couple of women far tougher
than he is. Given that, and the activities across their cul-de-sac
of a rough-edged trio of Hispanic drug-dealing brothers who have
taken over their mother's house, Craig, who thought he was fleeing
his problems, finds he has more of them than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The action is mostly witless and predictable. One measure of its
desperation and lack of respect for its audience is the frequency
with which it labors to wring humor from flatulence and excrement
gags. Mostly, it's Craig's father (John Witherspoon) who's saddled
with these, not to mention us.
</P>
<P>
   The only notable aspect of the crude, lame ``Next Friday'' is
that it furthers the producing career of Ice Cube, the rapper
turned movie star. ``Next Friday'' represents a step backward from
the last film he masterminded, ``The Player's Club.'' Still, he's
clearly a presence who not only stars in movies, but can make them
happen, and he's only just getting started.

ANNETTE AND WARREN; INTERNET PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>

   All is perfectly wonderful at the Beatty-Bening house, in case
you were wondering. He's working on a movie, she's working on a
movie, he's flirting with the political press, she's flirting with
an Oscar, he's full of opinions about the candidates, she's
pregnant once again. Vanity Fair for February dines with the couple
of the moment, and there's really not much to report. Oh, except
some giggles about the beginnings of their relationship, when
Warren took Annette aside and said, ``I want to tell you that I'm
not making a pass at you, but if I were to be so lucky as to have
that occurrence happen, that I want to assure you that I would try
to make you pregnant immediately.'' His line worked, of course, and
nine or so months later, their first daughter was born.
</P>
<P>
   Vanity Fair's mogul slot goes to Clive Davis, the legendary and
controversial music honcho who is about to be honored at the Grammy
Awards and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The long
article charts his ups and downs, including his current battle with
BMG Entertainment, but the more interesting bits involve his role
in the making of pop stars like Barry Manilow, Whitney Houston, and
Janis Joplin, who offered him a roll in the hay as a ``fitting and
proper'' way to cement their deal. Joplin wasn't happy when Davis
doctored ``Piece of My Heart'' for radio play _ he cut 65 seconds
and added another chorus _ but she didn't complain when the single
helped sell over a million albums.

   The Forum in the January Harper's focuses on privacy and what
will happen to ours as we continue to spill our personal data _
medical, financial, consumer _ onto the Internet. The conversation,
among the executive VP of Lycos, a law professor specializing in
privacy, a former New York prosecutor, and an academic involved in
Clinton's Internet regulation policy, is very smart stuff, with the
potential to make you more than a little paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the scarier notes are hit by the gentleman from Lycos,
who notes that ``the ultimate power of the Web potentially lies in
my ability to store and reduce your query strings _ what you type
into my search box _ and then give you information based on what
I've learned about your behavior.'' Gives new meaning to that
phrase about ``Be careful what you ask for . . .'' Right now, this
sort of information is anonymous _ the name of the user often
cannot be identified _ but who knows? ``The risk is that we could
become a society in which your future is predestined at birth,''
notes the academic. ``When if you come, informationally, from a
certain neighborhood, that information becomes a self-fulfilling
prophesy, defining the sort of offers that you receive, your credit
opportunities, your school choices, even the banner ads you see
when you get to a certain Web site. When the scope of your future
is limited by information in your profile at each step of your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Literally during the course of writing the previous paragraph, I
received an e-mail promotion from a company offering to help me
``get the facts on anyone using the Internet.'' The service _ a
software program and not a private detective agency _ will ``locate
missing persons'' and ``find out SECRETS about your relatives,
friends, enemies, and everyone else!''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? I hope so.

   If you've ever glanced at the European glossies, you've probably
noticed the intensified candor of the European hype machine.
Celebrities who make guarded chatter with American writers and bare
a shoulder for American photographers often remove quite a few more
veils when visiting the Continent. It's not uncommon to find
inter-celebrity-world insults and even a nipple here and there from
our very own stars (although Cameron Diaz's bun cleavage on the
January Vanity Fair cover was a first for me). They do as the
Romans do, or undo as the case may be.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I wasn't completely surprised to find the usually
buttoned-up Edward Norton revealing his pubic hair on the cover of
The Face, to promote ``The Fight Club.'' Looking like some sort of
London lad _ Norton doing Daniel Day Lewis doing Johnny in ``My
Beautiful Laundrette''? _ the actor pulls his pants right down to
the brim for the hipped-out British magazine, which some US
newsstands import. But Norton clings to his Stateside restraint in
the article itself, unwilling to go all the way in his fashionable
exhibitionism. About queries into his personal life, he reminds the
interviewer, ``Fame is very corrosive and you have to guard very
strictly against it.'' Yes, by pulling down your knickers on the
cover of an international publication . . .

 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALEX A. VARDAMIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL, Calif. _ Russia's military offensive in Chechnya is an
unintended result of NATO's attack on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   There are many similarities between the two conflicts, both in
concept and in execution. Russia has learned from our example.
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombed Serbia into submission. Russia hopes to bomb
Chechnya into submission.
</P>
<P>
   NATO claimed that it did not target Serbian civilians. Russia
claims that it does not target Chechen civilians. A Russian
official complains, ``When you (Americans) bombed civilians in
Kosovo, you called it collateral damage. When we do it, you call it
a violation of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombardment caused hundreds of thousands of refugees to
flee from Kosovo. Russian bombs drive columns of refugees out of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   NATO claimed that the war was necessary to defeat Serbian
terrorists, thugs and murderers. Russia claims it must, similarly,
rout Chechen terrorists, thugs and murderers.
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombed because its credibility was in jeopardy. Russia
bombs, in the words of Soviet-era dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn,
because, ``We have capitulated everywhere. Our country cannot
abandon the right to defend itself, and defense means completing
this operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The acting president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, echoed these
sentiments, saying, ``We will not tolerate any humiliation to the
national pride of Russians or any threat to the integrity of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO avoided a ground war, fearing heavy allied casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening to ``drop the bridges and turn out the lights'' if
Belgrade did not surrender, the West defeated Yugoslavia through
massive aerial bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Russia lost the first war in Chechnya in 1994-96 because it got
bogged down in ground combat.
</P>
<P>
   This time Moscow, seeking to minimize its losses, replicates
NATO's tactics. Recently, though, winter has set in and poor
visibility has made bombing difficult. Russian casualties have
begun to mount.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Russian entreaties against NATO's massive
application of force in Serbia were ignored. This winter, Western
condemnations of Russia's ``indiscriminate bombing'' are
disregarded in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   At a summit in Istanbul in mid-November, President Clinton
warned his ``good friend'' Boris Yeltsin that if attacks on
civilians continued, ``the world would not stand idly by.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who turned over power to Putin two weeks ago, responded
that Clinton could no longer claim the moral high ground. Wasn't
the attack on Serbia a war of ``disproportionate consequence?''
</P>
<P>
   Had not the United States used inflated estimates of hundreds of
thousands of murdered Kosovars as a pretext to interfere in a
sovereign nation's internal affairs?
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Clinton again warned that the offensive must stop.
Yeltsin reminded Washington ``that Russia has a full arsenal of
nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   How did we get to this war of words? What happened to glasnost
and perestroika?
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the Russians drove the Communists out of power
with the expectation that the Free World would embrace them as
allies. It never happened.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the West
promised that it would not expand eastward.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, NATO, with the inclusion of Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary, has moved up to the borders of the former
Soviet Union. It threatens to extend the alliance still further.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, reversing long-standing arms control
policy, seems determined to press ahead with an antimissile defense
that would abrogate the ABM treaty of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-conceived, poorly monitored infusion of billions of
dollars from the International Monetary Fund into Russia has
created a kleptocracy in which the shrewd and corrupt strip the
country of its assets and drive average, law-abiding citizens into
poverty. While criminals with foreign bank accounts live in regal
splendor, Russian pensioners go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   And to add insult to injury, at the very conference in which the
West demanded a withdrawal from Chechnya, a treaty designed to
squeeze Russia out of petroleum profits was signed. With Clinton as
smiling witness, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey agreed to build a
pipeline that, intentionally bypassing Russia, would send Caspian
Sea oil directly into Western markets.
</P>
<P>
   Our idle threats over Chechnya are counterproductive. If we
truly want Moscow to stop targeting civilians, we should set the
example.

BELL HOOKS OFFERS A NEW LOOK AT AN OLD SUBJECT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (bell hooks (lc) is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The subject is love and bell hooks is trying to
explain why she, a feminist theorist who found fame writing
provocative prose about sexism, racism, and other forms of
domination, would devote a whole book to it.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, her answers are hesitant, her focus on the
consumption of a raisin bagel and tea in a rustic cafe a few blocks
from her West Village apartment. Then, as the bread disappears and
she relaxes, her tongue loosens. She embarks on thoughtful
soliloquies about the subject that are punctuated by the hiss of an
espresso machine and the murmur of the thickening crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Hooks first summons up the words of 20-something author
Elizabeth Wurtzel, who wrote, ``My generation is afraid to love.''
Then there's her interview with hip-hop artist Lil' Kim, who told
hooks flatly, ``Love? What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   Hooks mentions the fights about love she and her former
boyfriend Anthony kept having a few years ago. He'd say he didn't
think he knew what love was. She pledged to find a book that would
teach him about it. When she couldn't unearth the right one, hooks
vowed, ``OK, I'm going to write you this book.'' That promise was
kept with ``All About Love: New Visions,'' published last month.
</P>
<P>
   She uses excerpts from books by Jack Kornfield, M. Scott Peck,
and Marianne Williamson and examples from her own life to define
love and discuss factors such as greed and dishonesty that keep
people from finding it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dedicated to (Anthony), you know,'' says hooks, 47, who
spells her name in lower-case letters so that the focus is on the
text, not the author. ``It's all the discussions we've had over
this period of 10 years as we struggled to make meaning out of
failed bonds in our lives. I just feel like it's where the struggle
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooks has become an intellectual superstar by finding the
struggles and writing about them. Her first scholarly work, 1981's
``Ain't I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism,'' explored black
women's roles in the feminist movement. Since then, she's written
18 books.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fierce in insisting that the injustices and political
systems based on both race and sex be seen as connected and be
addressed,'' says Gloria Steinem, a longtime friend. ``She doesn't
let white feminists off the hook on race ever, and she doesn't let
black men and women off the hook on justice for the female half of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As the number of hooks's books rose, so did her national
profile. Her essays on race and feminism have become required
reading in women's studies classes across the country. In the last
few years, The Atlantic Monthly named her a leading intellectual
and Utne Reader included her in a list of the ``100 Visionaries Who
Could Change Your Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooks is now one of the few female members of an
African-American academic elite that includes Henry Gates and
Cornel West, with whom she co-wrote the 1991 book ``Breaking Bread:
Insurgent Black Intellectual Life.'' Try to think of any other
black feminist today who is as high-profile as she.
</P>
<P>
   Success, however, has brought its own problems. As hooks has
climbed the intellectual heights, her prodigious literary output
has made her a punching bag for some critics. And her aggressive
pursuit of the writer's life has kept this self-described
love-obsessed woman from finding the very subject she's enthralled
with: love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would have written all these books had I been
partnered in a living situation,'' says hooks in her
preternaturally girlish voice, while relaxing in the sparsely
decorated living room of her modest one-bedroom apartment. The work
of mixed-media artist Radcliffe Bailey and photographer Carrie Mae
Weems lean casually against a dining room wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sort of create this whole world of ideas and write and
think,'' she continues. ``The truth is that is not a life that you
can easily do in relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The persona of bell hooks was born 28 years ago at Stanford
University. It was there that the 19-year-old student Gloria Jean
Watkins, of Hopkinsville, Ky., took her maternal
great-grandmother's name as a pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   As an undergraduate at Stanford and doctoral candidate at the
University of California at Santa Cruz, hooks built the foundation
for becoming a feminist thinker. Teaching jobs at Yale University,
Oberlin College, and City College of New York, where she's been on
sabbatical for two years, economically sustained her literary
goals.
</P>
<P>
   It took hooks almost 10 years to find a publisher for the first
book. Then she began writing and writing.
</P>
<P>
   There were the fiery scholarly essays that condemned what she
calls a ``white supremacist culture'' for its negative
representation of black women in pop culture and its refusal to
admit black women into discussions about race. Memoirs explored her
childhood and detailed how a 15-year non-monogamous relationship
with a poet and scholar nurtured her own development as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   She even published a children's book, ``Happy to Be Nappy,''
about the joys of natural African-American hair, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is enchanted with hooks's work. This is from a
Washington Post review of ``Remembered Rapture: The Writer at
Work,'' a book of essays about the writing life that was also
published last year: ``Treating hooks as a writer . . . is to
address just how repetitive and ultimately tiresome her essays
often become. An all-purpose litany such as white supremacist
capitalism patriarchal dominance is longer on crude reductiveness
than it is on nuanced complexity _ and the same thing can be said
about the rhythms of her sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Michele Wallace, a feminist best known for her
critically acclaimed 1979 work ``Black Macho and the Myth of the
Superwoman,'' wrote a scathing review of hooks's literary output. A
month ago Wallace called hooks to apologize for the Village Voice
piece. But during a recent interview, she stood by her critique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just amazed by somebody like bell,'' says Wallace, 48, a
professor of English, women's studies, and film studies at City
College, where hooks is a Distinguished Professor of English, ``who
feels as though she has something of use to tell people on a
regular basis, like I mean once a year. It's one thing when Susan
L. Taylor does it or Iyanla Vanzant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when somebody who's as intelligent as bell is does it, you
have to wonder what is going on in her head,'' she continues,
adding sarcastically, ``but I guess you'd have to read all the
books to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooks blames Wallace's outbursts on the subjects she often
writes about.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the things that fueled her anger toward me had to do
with the sexist and very racist ways black women writers are
treated,'' says hooks during a telephone interview. ``People of
color often get pitted against one another by the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Displeasure about hooks's voluminous scholarly output, a theme
in many articles about her, is particularly galling to hooks and
her supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does no one ever say that about a man?'' asks Tracy
Sherrod, a senior editor at Pocket Books who, while at Henry Holt,
edited ``Remembered Rapture'' as well as hooks's memoirs ``Bone
Black: Memories of Girlhood'' and ``Wounds of Passion: A Writing
Life.'' ``No one says that about Joyce Carol Oates. Is it because
(hooks) is a black woman? What is it that makes people want to
silence her in particular?''

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Jimmy Carter was president. Elvis was barely cold
in his grave. And I was an editor at a newspaper in the New York
City metro area.
</P>
<P>
   The photo department had given me a set on contact prints from
which to select shots for the next day's paper. I'd gone back to
photo department with my choices. The photo editor occupied a desk
in the middle of the room. I stood beside him as he bent over the
contact prints, inspecting my choices.
</P>
<P>
   What neither of us knew was that Zippy the Chimp was in the
building that day for some advertising promotion. Bored with it
all, Zippy had gotten loose. As the photo editor and I studied the
contact prints, Zip came roaring through the door. He wore a white
sweatshirt with ``Zip'' emblazoned across his chest in red letters.
Zippy the Chimp was on roller skates.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, Zip furiously circled the desk in the photo
department, grinning up at me with big, yellow, chimpanzee teeth.
Then he rolled back out the door and disappeared down the hall.

   I said to the photo editor, ``What the hell was that?'' He
glanced up from the contact prints he'd been studying with such
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was what?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   I think of that guy every time I ponder the prospect of Sol
Greenberg, the Albany County district attorney, investigating and
prosecuting official corruption. The politicians could be selling
off the state Capitol building, block by block, and Greenberg would
be the very last guy to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if he were to notice, it would break the pattern of a
lengthy professional lifetime. When Jim Coyne was Albany County
executive and got such a bad case of sticky fingers during the
construction of a big downtown sports arena, Greenberg failed to
notice from his office four blocks away, and the feds had to
prosecute the corruption case. When Davis Etkin was making so much
money disappear at the Capital District Off-Track Betting Corp.,
Greenberg didn't notice, and the New York attorney general is stuck
handling that one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to the members of the New York State Temporary
Commission on Lobbying, Greenberg is supposed to investigate
possible criminal activity during this town's most recent lobbying
scandal _ the one in which the Philip Morris Cos. violated state
law with regard to reporting gifts to state legislators and perhaps
by funneling cash to a third party to pay for a trip by Gov. George
Pataki to Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of giving this investigation to Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer, who needs a request from a state agency to look into a
thing like this and has been positively drooling at the prospect,
the commission's five members decided Monday to give it to
Greenberg instead. After all, isn't Greenberg the D.A.? Isn't
prosecuting crime in this county the D.A.'s job and not the
attorney general's? Republicans outnumber Democrats on this
commission, but this wasn't a party line vote. With the exception
of commission member Milton Mollen, a highly respected former
Democratic judge, nobody really wanted this thing looked into.
Neither the commission members nor their patrons in the Legislature
nor in the governor's office want to know who in Philip Morris,
other than the company's Albany lobbyist, knew about the
lawbreaking. And, since Philip Morris has had similar problems in
three other states, it's not unreasonable to suspect that somebody
did.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, could fix this. He has the authority to
supersede Greenberg and name a special prosecutor. He won't,
though. They're all in this together, Democrats and Republicans
alike. Everybody is loudly in favor of honest government until they
have to actually do something to make it honest.
</P>
<P>
   So now Spitzer is shut out of this probe. Greenberg runs an
understaffed office and has spent a career ignoring just this kind
of stuff. And he's supposed to investigate this lobbying scandal?
Even Zippy would be appalled.

&HT;     AOL-TIME WARNER: SOOOOO 20TH CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It had to happen, but it happened awfully soon.
I heard the phrase ``You're too 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   The nasty comment wasn't directed at me, but it might as well
have been. A lot of us are not now and never have been dot-commies.
We're not broadband or multimedia enough to enter the new age
signaled by AOL's purchase of Time Warner _ the merger that's going
to change life on Earth as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   Or as USA Today put it in one of its dozens of headlines about
AOL on Tuesday: ``Will merger repackage life as we now live it?''
</P>
<P>
   Repackaged life, what a concept.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we'll be able to hear Madonna's singing, read Madonna's
book, watch Madonna's bulging arms, order Madonna's line of workout
wear and talk about Madonna in the Madonna chat room, all on one
screen with a click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   And multi-modality Madonna is the good part of the AOL-Time
Warner merger.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow I think this is the media merger that will affect my
life the least in the 21st century. And somehow I don't think AOL
will take over the world.
</P>
<P>
   If AOL does take over the world, does that mean the world is
going to be slow and ``kludgy,'' as the techies put it in their
portmanteau (portalmanteau?) word combining ``klutz'' and
``sludgy?''
</P>
<P>
   As a 20th century kind of guy I hate to say this, but AOL is so
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Little iMac Book,'' author Robin Williams (another one)
put it this way: ``America Online is a nice, friendly place. It's
like a safe, self-contained village. There are guides to help you,
`patrol officers' to make sure people are behaving properly,
instructions on where to go . But America Online is not the
Internet, nor is it the World Wide Web. When you are on America
Online, you are contained within their system of computers that
sits right in Virginia, the home of America Online.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams then said, ``If you think of America Online as a
village in Virginia, then the Internet is the big, wide world.''
</P>
<P>
   So basically, AOL is that great 20th century American concept, a
gated community. Like any other gated community, it offers the
illusion of comfort, but has disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   You actually lose privacy, because the management and anybody
else on AOL can keep track of your comings and goings.
</P>
<P>
   And they do it to sell you things. Spend some time in a Madonna
chat room, and you may find yourself getting spammed with offers to
buy the latest metal-covered book of naked Madonna photos.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than that, people can track their ex-spouses or employees
and see what chat rooms they're in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite looking clean and safe, AOL is built on that great 20th
century concept, talking dirty for fun and profit. It's a
classically seamy vision of American suburban life.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody gets together in the basement chat rooms of AOL's
gated community and anonymously propositions, brags and tells lies
to one another.
</P>
<P>
   AOL didn't invent on-line conversations, but brought them down
to the lowest common denominator. It all comes down to sex and
marketing, with a smiley face on the end.
</P>
<P>
   I have nothing against AOL now that I don't subscribe to it
anymore. Some chat rooms really are useful, like ones for senior
citizens and those with specialized interests, and not just sexual
ones.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that AOL doesn't work on iMacs very well, and I don't
need it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Even I, a technophobe, can get to the Internet without AOL.
</P>
<P>
   I hate AOL's ``buddy lists'' that allow people to spy and see if
I'm on line. They then can send me an instant message that I have
to respond to or seem impolite, which I am.
</P>
<P>
   I don't need the half-dozen anonymous names AOL allows
subscribers to use in chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The one time I went to a sex chat room (just for research, of
course) someone propositioned me within 30 seconds. Talk about
repackaging life. AOL repackaged singles bars in even more
frightening form.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the worst things about the AOL-Time Warner merger are
all the visions of a future we've been subjected to.
</P>
<P>
   Our TVs will be saying ``You've got mail,'' and not just when
that smarmy movie of the same name is on.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be able to shop for the same items of clothing worn by TV
and movie stars as we watch the shows. Just click on Buffy the
Vampire Slayer's mini-skirt or Mel Gibson's leather jacket.
</P>
<P>
   We can watch all the Atlanta Braves, Hawks and Thrashers games
we want _ and buy their logo sweat shirts without getting out of
the recliner.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever there's a school shooting, we'll be able to call up
CNN's bloody footage as many times as we want, and not have to wait
for its half-hourly replays.
</P>
<P>
   According to one vision of ``repackaged life,'' we can even sit
in our remote-control home watching a program produced by Time
Warner's ``Cooking Light'' magazine and send a digital recipe to
our refrigerator, which could order ingredients it lacks from an
on-line grocery delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   That's all I need _ a refrigerator that talks to the world, and
not just to me. This is about as appealing as that old vision of
the future in which we ate food from squeeze tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Visions of the future are so 20th century.

&HT;     A CENTURY OF MUSIC IN ONE SITTING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We kicked it off at 8 p.m., with an unidentified
chorus singing, ``In the Good Old Summertime,'' and we ended it
seven hours and 40 minutes later with REM's ``Losing My Religion.''
</P>
<P>
   In between, Frank Sinatra led all artists with six appearances,
Billie Holiday came in second with four songs, and there was a
three-way tie for third among Giacomo Puccini, Judy Garland and
Glenn Miller, each with three.
</P>
<P>
   These are the results of a marathon music fest that anchored the
New Year's Eve party I attended. Besides black tie, champagne and a
home-cooked gourmet dish, our hostess Karen had required 10 songs
from each guest (and herself) _ one for every decade of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   All songs were submitted a couple of weeks ahead of time in CD,
tape or record form and transcribed onto three master cassettes by
our friend Stephen. Despite forgetting one choice for the 1950's _
Domenico Modugno's ``Volare'' _ Stephen turned in a super-human
performance. He even provided the sound of a train, then
helicopter, then jet, to carry us from one decade to another.
</P>
<P>
   If Karen hadn't exercised her hostess veto power and dinged a
few songs _ Madonna's ``Like a Virgin'' got the hook after six bars
_ we might have seen the sun come up to that last REM tune.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than pick the most important or popular song from a
decade, we'd been told to choose the one song that best represented
our personal view of each 10-year span. Thus, many selections were
both esoteric and eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Todd chose ``Minnie the Moocher's Wedding Day'' for
the '30s; I chose ``Back Home Again in Indiana'' for the Teens, and
Peter chose a cut of his own son singing at the age of 6 for the
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth though, our band of 15 did choose eight
songs that made it onto National Public Radio's ``100 Most
Important American Musical Works of the Century.'' (The list was
compiled by NPR listeners and such musical luminaries as Wynton
Marsalis and San Francisco Symphony conductor Michael Tilson
Thomas.)
</P>
<P>
   Those were:
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy,'' performed by Patsy Cline; ``Give My Regards to
Broadway,'' performed by George M. Cohan; ``In the Mood,''
performed by Glenn Miller; ``Night and Day,'' performed by Bono of
U2; ``Take the A Train,'' performed by Duke Ellington; ``Purple
Haze,'' performed by Jimi Hendrix; ``Rock Around the Clock,''
performed by Bill Haley &AMP; the Comets; and ``Tonight'' from
``Westside Story,'' performed by Larry Kert and Carol Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra proved that, even in death, he's still chairman of our
board with ``One For My Baby,'' ``If You Are But a Dream,'' ``All
the Way,'' ``Young at Heart,'' ``In the Wee Small Hours'' and ``My
Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Holiday grabbed second with ``Love for Sale,'' ``It Had
To Be You,'' ``I Cried for You'' and ``Some Other Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Puccini's winners were E lucevan le stelle from ``Tosca,'' O mio
babbino caro from ``Gianni Schicci'' and Un bel di from ``Madama
Butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland's were ``Rockabye Your Baby,'' ``You Made Me Love You''
and ``Come Rain or Come Shine.''
</P>
<P>
   And Miller made it with ``In the Mood,'' ``Kalamazoo'' and
``Chattanoogo Choo-Choo.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a five-way tie for fourth among Fred Astaire (``The
Way You Look Tonight'' and ``They Can't Take That Away From Me''),
Duke Ellington (``A Train'' and ``Creole Love Call''), the Beatles
(``Hey, Jude'' and ``In My Life''), U2 (``Night and Day'' and
``One'') and REM (``Driver 8'' and ``Religion'').
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, our Most Valuable Player Award went to Shirley, who
couldn't make it to the party because she had the flu. She not only
submitted her 10 songs, she pinch hit in every decade for the less
imaginative among us with extra songs that ranged from ``Come
Josephine in My Flying Machine'' to the Pet Shop Boys' ``It's a
Sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of our '00-'69 highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Paul Robeson's rendition of ``Ol' Man River,'' Walter Huston's
``September Song,'' Bette Midler's ``The Glory of Love,'' Cliff
Edwards' ``When You Wish Upon a Star,'' Doris Day's ``Secret
Love,'' the Shirelles' ``Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?'' Roy
Orbison's ``Only the Lonely,'' Connie Francis' ``Where the Boys
Are'' and The Who's ``My Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   From the '70s through 1999:
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dylan's ``Tangled Up in Blue,'' the Cars' ``Just What I
Needed,'' Odyssey's ``Native New Yorker,'' Pink Floyd's ``The
Gunner's Dream,'' ``Bryan Ferry's ``Name of the Game,'' Cake's
``The Distance,'' Bonnie Raitt's ``Come to Me,'' Kim Carnes'
``Bette Davis Eyes,'' Jane Siberey's ``Love Is Everything'' and the
song ``Without You'' from ``Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   But as I said, those are only highlights. Except for the 10
minutes we took at midnight to ring in 2000, the hits just kept on
coming.

&HT;     BIRTHDAY PARTIES FOR KIDS NO LONGER A PIECE OF CAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KERI P. MATTOX  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Children's birthday parties used to be a simple
affair _ hang some streamers, blow up a few balloons, bake a cake.
</P>
<P>
   But parents no longer throw parties. They buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Dance parties, days at the salon, museum tours, gymnastics
lessons and even $17,000 sleepover parties at F.A.O. Schwartz are
just a few of the lavish get-togethers parents plan for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see, we've had one at a bowling alley, the roller
skating rink and a haunted miniature golf course,'' said Elena
Purritano of Watervliet, a Hudson River town north of Albany. She
says keeping parties exciting for her 10-year-old son, Anthony, and
her 9-year-old daughter, Anastasia, is a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do run out of ideas. It's not like it used to be. It's not
pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey anymore,'' she said. ``I did have one at
home and I had a ventriloquist.''
</P>
<P>
   The push by parents to give their kids the ``perfect party'' has
businesses fighting to outdo one another in their assortment of
party packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think parents over the years have definitely been doing
parties, but I think now parents are really looking for something
unique, for experts to make the birthday fun,'' said Jami Ehring,
owner of Tumbling Tykes of Colonie, an Albany suburb.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts warn that the event _ the birthday, the
graduation, the recital _ can lose some of its meaning if it's too
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly seems to me that over the past generation there
has been an enormous commercialization of family life. We now farm
out to strangers the acts of cleaning, cooking, caring for
children, caring for older loved ones and, in this case,
celebrating,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Berger, author of ``Raising
Children with Character'' and former faculty member at Columbia
University in New York. ``What the ordinary parent needs to focus
on is what is the take-home message for the child,'' she said. ``As
a celebration becomes less and less intimate, the emphasis becomes
more and more on the glossy appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Tumbling Tykes, which specializes in parties for kids ages 6 and
under, offers party plans from the $94 ``Basic'' to the $179
``Super-Duper'' for a 12-child party. Parents can sit back and
relax while Ehring's staff leads parachute play, story time, freeze
dancing and even pinata poking.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Tumbling Tykes hosted about 20 parties a month.
Now, with packed schedules for Thursday and Friday nights and all
day on Saturdays and Sundays, Tumbling Tykes squeezes in 30 parties
every month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It truly is very elaborate. Parents will bring in all kinds of
things. We've had catered parties,'' Ehring said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the New York State Museum in Albany courts parents. For
$100, 18 guests can choose from among eight slots available each
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We begin with a craft activity, an educational component, a
game or story time and then there's time available for presents and
snacks,'' said Barbara Lukas, the museum's public programs
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to turn people away because they just can't get the
date they want,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   But some families who opt for elaborate parties still try to
keep the focus on the family get-together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a family party and they have their own kids party,''
said Janice Chenot of Latham. Chenot's three children, Caitlin, 12,
Christie, 9, and Jordan, 7, have been having birthday bashes since
they started kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   For her 12th birthday, Caitlin and her parents threw a dance
party at a local dance studio for almost 50 preteen friends,
complete with a disc jockey, pizzas and soda. The bill for the
four-hour event, which totaled up at $350, was footed by both
Caitlin and her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a deal with our daughter _ that if she wanted to have
it she could, but she would have to pay for anything over $200,''
Chenot said. The expenses for each child's birthday party usually
run around $200, or $10 per guest, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Chenot kids have had plenty of parties at home _ with
swimming, magicians, ponies _ but almost all of their birthday
celebrations are held elsewhere now, Chenot said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that there isn't that much to do at home, but we're
all running out of ideas on how to keep the kids entertained.''

&HT;     FIRE SIRENS REMAIN A (LOUD) FACT OF LIFE IN SOME COMMUNITIES

<P>
   BETHLEHEM, N.Y. _ For 35 years, Benjamin Castle has lived only
half a block from the Delmar fire station and its wailing siren,
which he says knocks him off the deck of his house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the old siren was replaced three months ago with one
that emits a lower tone, Castle and his Adams Street neighbors
still get an earful.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem is that most of these firemen have two beepers, a
cell phone, a CB radio in their car,'' Castle said. ``I don't
understand. It's overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   The siren rings at 130 decibels _ louder than a jet at take off.
Many of the sirens were first installed as civil air defense
warnings during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, firehouses are silencing sirens in favor of
pagers. Others are restricting use of alarms after midnight and
before 7 a.m. But some fire companies in this slice of upstate New
York cling to tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about going to all pagers, but we have so many of
our people that work outside that just can't hear the pagers
sometimes,'' said Delmar Fire Commissioner Gerald Day. ``I know
when I'm mowing the lawn, there's no way I would hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   The range of the Delmar siren is about a half mile, Day added.
``We have two stations, one on each end of the district, so between
the two of them, we can reach everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delmar fire company, which has 72 volunteers, does use
pagers for some calls.
</P>
<P>
   Delmar's original siren broke three months ago, so officials
decided to install a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first put it up _ it's an awful-looking thing _ there
was some concern, so I met with the neighbors and we talked about
it,'' Day said. ``We were going to have a second meeting, but there
weren't enough people still concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Castle and his neighbors tolerate the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other one was a little bit more screechy,'' Castle said.
``This one's not as bad, I guess.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fledgling filmmakers in search of a producer and
production companies on the lookout for filmmakers will have the
opportunity to hobnob Thursday through Sunday at the International
Film Financing Conference in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   IFFCON, now in its seventh year, is a key networking and funding
event. It includes workshops, panels, film screenings and scheduled
meetings between 60 selected independent filmmakers from North
America, Asia and Europe who have unfinished films in development,
and executives at film and television production houses such as
Home Box Office/Cinemax, Miramax Films, Four Films (United Kingdom)
and the Arte network (France), who can offer completion money for
projects.
</P>
<P>
   IFFCON alumni are not household names, but many are respected in
art-film circles and public broadcasting. They include Lynn
Hershman (``Conceiving Ada''), Lynn O'Donnell and Terry Zwigoff
(the documentary ``Crumb'') and Mitchell B. Robbins (``Next Stop
Wonderland'').
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers at IFFCON are selected by advisory committees of
fellow filmmakers and producers in a competitive application
process.
</P>
<P>
   Such wheeling and dealing outside Hollywood circles is the way
many serious feature films and documentaries are made, said Corey
Tong, the IFFCON director of special projects. Indeed, many are
co-productions with artists and executives from three or four
countries.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: ``Oaxaca Diary,'' a fictional film about a
group of filmmakers in Mexico, is being shot on location in the
Mexican state of Oaxaca. The director is Beijing-born Ning Ying.
The Peruvian screenwriter, Lorenzo O'Brien, studied at the
University of California at Los Angeles. Two of the actors are from
Japan. The finished movie, a $2 million feature, will be in English
and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Such internationalism and eclecticism are integral to IFFCON,
said Tong, who asserts that a movie with true international flavor
``can be very successful in the global marketplace, theatrically as
well as on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Renfrew, producer of ``Groove,'' a film about the San
Francisco underground rave party scene, said IFFCON's scope is part
of what appeals to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to funding, I'm looking for access to the
international market,'' said Renfrew, who applied to IFFCON for
``Groove'' in 1999 and was selected this time on her second try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've done before was done completely in the United
States,'' said Renfrew, who produced and directed ``Dear Dr.
Spencer,'' a documentary about an American physician ``who
performed safe abortions from the 1920s through the 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently the chief financial officer for documentary film
company Concentric Media, Renfrew said about $200,000 of the
$500,000 budget for ``Groove'' has been raised so far.
</P>
<P>
   IFFCON itself operates on a budget of $250,000, according to
Wendy Braitman, the executive director of the conference and a film
producer who aims to help independents focus on the business side
of art.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest source of money for IFFCON, a nonprofit venture, is
the City of San Francisco, which pitched in $65,000 this year.
IFFCON has support from the National Endowment for the Arts and
corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Expanded this year are global partners, such as Telefilm Canada
and the Ontario Film Development Corp., which underwrite Canadian
filmmakers who trek to IFFCON; Cinemart, an annual film marketing
session in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, which reserves slots for a
selected IFFCON filmmaker; and the New Zealand Film Commission,
which underwrites filmmakers from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand partnership, especially, ``signals a sign of
expansion into non-North American territories,'' said Tong, who
added that filmmakers from Japan and China also will be attending
for the first time.

&HT;     KOREAN-AMERICANS, CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS BACK ANTI-GAY
INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JULIE CHAO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In what is believed to be the first large-scale
political mobilization by Korean-American clergy, Korean churches
in California have launched an all-out effort to collect signatures
for an anti-gay initiative that is unlikely to appear on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance the churches have forged with the conservative
Christian Coalition is deeply troubling to the Korean-Americans who
have formed a new organization to counter what they believe is
misinformation the churches are spreading.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed initiative, titled the California Defense of Sexual
Responsibility Act, was written by an Orange County engineer and
has received virtually no major organizational or financial
support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Korean-American pastors have seized the issue. They
have distributed petitions in church, enlisted volunteers to gather
signatures on the street and have taken up collections.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality ``is absolutely a violation to the conscience and
to biblical teaching and principle,'' said the Rev. Peter Kim, who
lives in Los Angeles. ``We firmly believe, what we are doing as
pastors, we are delivering this society from destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballot measure is simple but sweeping. It would prohibit
``public entities from endorsing, educating, recognizing or
promoting homosexuality as acceptable, moral behavior, and
prohibits public entities from using the phrase `sexual
orientation.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's laughable but it is outrageous,'' said Chris Hwang, staff
attorney at the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco
and a supporter of the newly formed Korean Americans for Civil
Rights, organized to support rights for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Also among those opposing the initiative is State Sen. Pete
Knight, R-Palmdale, the author a gay marriage proposition that will
appear on the March 7 ballot. Knight's Proposition 22 would define
marriage as between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind the Defense of Sexual Responsibility Act, Lee
Olson of Huntington Beach, has done no fund-raising or organizing
beyond a World Wide Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not forcing it. I'm letting it happen on its own,'' Olson
said. ``People are either going to respond to the move of God or
they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   His goal is to repeal three bills signed into law by Gov. Gray
Davis that were considered major advances in rights for
homosexuals. They strengthen anti-discrimination laws in public
schools, housing and employment, and allow unmarried partners of
state employees to qualify for health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Since learning of Olson's initiative late last year, Korean
pastors of all denominations, with assistance from the Christian
Coalition, have been working throughout the state to get 700,000
signatures by Jan. 18, Kim said. He would not say how many he has;
419,260 valid signatures are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Full-page advertisements announcing the petition drive, with 267
names signed, ran in Korean-language newspapers last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of names in itself is unheard of, coming out in
these numbers for a single issue,'' said Roy Hong, executive
director of Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates in Los Angeles and a
founder of Korean Americans for Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Also vying for the November ballot is an initiative to legalize
gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census counted 260,000 Korean-Americans in California,
the vast majority in Southern California. Hong estimated there are
at least twice that number now. Less than half are eligible to
vote, Hong said, and voter registration and turnout have
historically been very low.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of Korean-Americans are either Christian or
Buddhist, Hong said. Southern California is home to roughly 600
Korean Protestant churches of all sizes. He said they have stayed
away from political and social issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition does not believe the anti-gay initiative
will succeed but sees the ties with Korean-American churches as the
beginning of a new relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they're not going to get enough signatures for
this,'' said Miriam Archer, director of the Christian Coalition of
California. ``These are wonderful people who are not very savvy
politically, and they know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this effort, Archer said the Korean-Americans would
probably form their own chapter of the Christian Coalition and get
more politically involved. She said she was only aware of one other
minority chapter in the state, a Chinese-American group in Southern
California that is now inactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to turn out to be a very good thing,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of an alliance with the Christian Coalition
troubles Hwang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worried this kind of mobilization is going to bring
people to the polls and say it's OK to be homophobic and vote for
the Knight initiative,'' Hwang said.

police officer. By Linda Greenhouse.

<P>
   SCOTUS-LICENSE-DATA (Washington) _ Congress can protect
motorists' privacy by barring states from selling the personal
information on driver's licenses, the Supreme Court ruled
Wednesday. The law does not violate states' rights, the justices
said in a unanimous decision that ran counter to their recent trend
of reining in Congress' power over the states. By Linda Greenhouse.

</P>
<P>
   NH-VOICES (Dateline to kum, N.H.) _ In more than 50 interviews,
voters were hard pressed to come up with a nagging issue upon which
they would select their candidate. Instead, in a contrast to four
or eight years ago, when voters here were bursting with worries
about the economy, this year they seem relatively content. That
leaves them the luxury of tuning their political antenna on the
personal attributes of the candidates, their spouses, their parents
and, in case of Gore, their bosses. By Richard L. Berke.

   TURKEY-OCALAN (Istanbul) _ Turkish leaders on Wednesday decided

   AOL-WIRELESS (Undated) _ America Online, the company that made
the Internet invisible and less frightening, has been at the
forefront of developing so-called post-PC Internet appliances.
Indeed, while much of the talk about the Time Warner deal has been
about broadband, the next big thing is expected to be wireless, and
AOL is determined to be at the forefront. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-ASIA (Hong Kong) _ It is not clear that a combined AOL-Time
Warner will be able to make inroads into the potentially huge
market of Asia. Unlike in Europe, where AOL has built a valuable
regional franchise through its partnership with Bertelsmann, the
Internet in Asia remains a fractured business with few large
players and virtually none that cross national boundaries. By Mark
Landler.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-INVESTORS (Undated) _ Shares of America Online and Time
Warner extend their slide.
</P>
<P>
   LUXURY-CARS (Detroit) _ After capturing a big share of the
American market for small and mid-sized cars, Japanese auto makers
set their sights a decade ago on the luxury market long dominated
by Cadillac and Lincoln. Indeed, both Cadillac and Lincoln were
dethroned in 1999 for the first time since the 1930s. Yet the
upstart was not Japanese, but European: Mercedes-Benz. There is
rare unanimity here about how the Europeans surged into first
place. They have the strongest brands, at a time when a rising
stock market and strong economy have meant that money is no object
for many buyers. The European ascendance in luxury cars has come at
a particularly disappointing time for American and Japanese
executives in the market segment. By Keith Bradsher.

   MERRILL-APPOINT (Undated) _ Merrill Lynch says David Bowers, its
chief European equity strategist, will become its chief investment
strategist, replacing Charles Clough. By Patrick McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-BANKS (Singapore) _ The Indonesia government dismisses
Glenn Yusuf, the head of the agency responsible for cleaning up the
country's insolvent banking system. The announcement ends months of
speculation about the fate of Yusuf, a favorite of Western
financiers and one of the few holdover officials from the
administration of former President B.J. Habibie. By Wayne Arnold.

 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    KANSAS CITY, Missouri _ When Euphonix, a Palo Alto,
California-based manufacturer of sound and recording equipment,
wanted to expand its market, it didn't think small.
 &HT;    The company, which generates annual sales of just over US$15
million, decided to head southto Rio de Janeiro, to be exact. One
of Brazil's largest recording studios, Clausferma Servicos e
Locacao de Equipamentos, better known as Cia. Dos Tecnicos, wanted
to buy $475,000 worth of Euphonix' products.
 &HT;    But how does a mid-sized manufacturer with no real experience in
cross-border sales find trade financing for an export order worth
almost half a million dollars? ``You go to any finance company in
the States and start talking about export financing, and the line
goes dead,'' says Dave Christenson, Euphonix' director of
international sales. ``They don't want to hear about it.''
 &HT;    Leawood Export Finance, however, was all ears. This past May,
the Overland Park, Kansas-based trading company managed to obtain a
trade finance guarantee for Euphonix' equipment from the
Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank), allowing the
company to make the sale.
 &HT;    While trading companies are commonplace in Europe, Asia and
Latin America, they all but died off in the United States several
years ago. Leawood is one of just a few such firms left operating.
``Between 1965 and 1980, you had a large number of companies like
Leawood,'' notes Bill Redway, group vice president for small
business at the Ex-Im Bank. ``But after the Latin American debt
crisis, they were all gone.''
 &HT;    Trade abhors a vacuum. Leawood's approach is simple: Find small
firms of 75 to 100 employees with one or two exportable product
lines, then either purchase their goods and find markets abroad or
undertake the risk involved in exporting them to buyers identified
by the manufacturer. Small firms can thereby export their goods
without risk. ``They [the small firms are so focused on producing
the product that they're looking for people to partner with,'' says
Kathleen Williams, a principal at Leawood.
 &HT;    The disappearance of trading companies in the U.S. has created a
voidsomething that Leawood has been able to exploit, according to
Robert Duncan, 56, the firm's president and majority owner. ``Our
market research shows there is very, very strong interest in
this,'' he says. ``Leawood has a number of tentacles out there, and
we're using them as a basis to grow our business.''
 &HT;    One of those tentacles is Leawood's El Paso Texas-based
subsidiary, TerraMar. The company sells a number of items,
including metals, medical supplies and equipment, to Mexico.
``Mexico is a huge market for medical supplies,'' Duncan says.
 &HT;    Latin America in general has been a major market for Leawoodand
growing. The firm's sales have taken off over the last several
years, from $4 million in 1996 to $6.7 million in 1997 to $10
million last year _ 95 percent of which comes from trading with
Latin America. Duncan estimates that total export sales this year
will reach $20 million, the majority of which will come from the
region. Williams says doubling the company's sales has been fairly
easy. ``Nobody's in our space,'' she says.
 &HT;    Leawood makes money one of two ways. If it has to find a buyer
for the merchandise, it charges a mark-up of between 5 percent and
20 percent. If the supplier already has a buyer but needs fiancing,
Leawood simply adds a handling fee based on the volume and the
terms of the financing. And despite the risks of operating in the
region, Duncan says the firm has never been stiffed; it's always
found a buyer for the merchandise it's brokered or financed.
 &HT;    Those who work with Leawood say the company's approach is its
greatest strength. ``The kind of business that Bob [Duncan does is
very good for small businesses,'' Redway says. ``He's linking up
with small U.S. manufacturers and Latin buyers. Ex-Im Bank is eager
to expand into that sector.''
 &HT;    So eager, in fact, that Leawood is the only non-bank to have
received a master guarantee from the Ex-Im Bank. This allows
Leawood to provide overseas buyers with financing of up to $10
million, with terms lasting up to seven years. Despite Leawood's
relatively small size, Duncan says it is the 51st-largest user of
Ex-Im bank guarantees and the 12th-largest user of Ex-Im Bank
export insurance.
 &HT;    Because of its focus, Leawood has opened up the export market to
the small fry. Fortune 500 companies have tended to dominate
American exports because they are large enough to handle their own
trade financing and negotiate their own guarantees. But smaller
firms don't generate the kinds of export orders that large banks
want to finance, and many smaller banks able to underwrite trade of
less than $5 million don't know how to do it.
 &HT;    Gary Mendell, president of Los Angeles-based Meridian Insurance
Group, which brokers insurance to cover export payments, says he
spent several years looking for a company like Leawoodone that
could help smaller firms looking to break into foreign trade. He
discovered the firm by chance after he and Duncan were both slated
to address a trade conference. ``They [small firms really need
somebody to do more than just set up some systems internally,''
Mendell says. ``They really need somebody to take it over and
handle everything from soup to nuts.''
 &HT;    Duncan started several decades ago in the export business,
handling distribution and financing for Caterpillar. He left in
1978, having watched the Latin debt crisis lead to a precipitous
drop in exports from the United States, which killed off the
trading companies.
 &HT;    But Duncan found that most of these companies were set up by
banks. As the Latin countries began having troubles servicing their
debts, and trade levels dropped, the clash of cultures between the
risk-averse banks and their risk-taking trading-company
subsidiaries became more and more apparent. So he started Leawood
seven years ago to help small companies that couldn't find
financing to export their product.
 &HT;    Despite having very little competition, the company isn't
sitting still. It expects to have an e-commerce web site up in
January that will allow potential overseas buyers to view the
products available and even submit their credit applications over
the web. The site will be in English and Spanish, with Portuguese
added later. Says Duncan: ``We've found a niche, we're developing a
market and we're growing from it.''
 &HT;    Euphonix' Christenson is glad he hooked up with Leawood. Before,
the company was losing business to British competitors, which were
able to arrange financing through a government export guarantee
program. ``We were very often coming up short because we couldn't
offer instant, in-house finance,'' he says. ``It allows us to
compete on a more level playing field.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Late last year, a brutal army _ acting on the orders
of a ruthlessly ambitious politician _ laid waste to one of its
historic provinces, slaughtering thousands, driving up to a half a
million people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers, the European Union and the United States
warned that the killing must stop. The rampaging army claimed it
was fighting separatist ``terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did we in the West do about it? Absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't bomb Russia's bridges or power stations or railway
lines or barracks or television transmitters or _ by mistake, of
course _ buses and a passenger train and a hospital and refugee
convoys.
</P>
<P>
   No, we tut-tutted and appealed for a political solution in
Chechnya. And U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the
scourge of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, told us how
important it was to keep good relations with Russia, that Moscow
should not be ostracized.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the double standards would have been sharper had the two
events coincided. If the Russian army had bombarded Grozny as NATO
was bombing Belgrade, a few more questions would have been asked
about the ``human values'' which the West was supposedly upholding
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If we can go to war because Albanians were being persecuted in
Kosovo by the Serbs, why couldn't we go to war when Chechens were
being dispossessed of their homes and driven from their villages?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, NATO's campaign closed just in time for Russia's
newly-resigned president, Boris Yeltsin, and his prime
minister-turned-successor, Vladimir Putin, to claim that it gave
Russia the right to crush the rebels of its recalcitrant southern
province.
</P>
<P>
   One day, perhaps, historians will add the Chechen dead to the
casualties of Kosovo and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   If, that is, we ever know the casualty figures. For the dead of
the only war fought by the European powers since 1945 have still to
be counted; more than half the mass graves of Kosovo have still to
be opened and the Serbs have still to give a final figure for their
civilian and military losses.
</P>
<P>
   There may be 4,000 Albanian corpses _ victims of Serb forces _
still undiscovered in the frozen soil of Kosovo this winter; around
2,000 have already been dug up.
</P>
<P>
   And the town war memorials of Serbia suggest that the Yugoslav
army's dead may be more than the 600 claimed by Milosevic. Perhaps
1,500 Serb civilians were killed by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 8,000 people were killed in the war for
Kosovo. Not one of them was a soldier of the NATO alliance. For if
we went to war with the Kosovo Albanians, we were not prepared to
die for them.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, another variation of the old joke _ that NATO was
ready to fight to the last Albanian _ is making the rounds. As one
survivor put it to a French reporter when NATO troops eventually
entered the ruins of Kosovo: ``While you were flying high in the
skies above us, we down here were dying.'' And it is true. &QL;

<P>
   Once the NATO bombardment began, the Serbs turned with far
greater savagery upon their Kosovo Albanian enemies who _ having
waited with enthusiasm for the bombs that would free them from
their Serb oppressors _ found that NATO could not save them.
</P>
<P>
   While Franco Stamatovic and the other Serb war criminals were
unleashing their cruelty upon the Albanians, up to half a million
men, women and children were driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Only more than four months later would NATO's
``bloke-in-the-street'' spokesman, James Shea, cynically sum it all
up. ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``things have to get worse in order to
get better.'' They didn't tell the Albanians that at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the war _ to force the Serbs to accept a political
settlement in Kosovo that would also give the Albanians a
referendum to decide their own future _ had quickly to be
redefined.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bombing Serbia to save the Albanians, we were now
apparently bombing Serbia to get the Albanian refugees ``back into
their homes'' _ most of whom were still in their homes when the war
began.
</P>
<P>
   And when, after 79 days of bombing, NATO marched into Kosovo,
the referendum that might have given the Kosovo Albanians
independence was quietly dropped from the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independence for Kosovo _ the only way to peace in the
Balkans,'' say the Albanian bumper stickers in Pristina today. But
the honeymoon is over. Soldiers from the NATO-led ``peacekeeping''
force are tearing the stickers off cars entering the few remaining
Serb areas. U.N. police forces in the province are being abused in
public.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians want their own land, not a U.N.-created
administration linked to Serbia. As for the remaining minority
Serbs, only around 40,000 of the prewar population of 250,000 are
still there.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia drove 50 percent of the Albanian population out of the
province. Now Kosovo Albanians have driven 80 percent of the
minority Serb population out of the province. The ``peacekeepers''
could not keep the ``peace.'' &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Should we have tried to save the Albanians in their moment of
agony? Could we have crossed the frontier and fought the Serbs
instead of skulking along the Macedonian border while U.S.
President Bill Clinton opposed a ground offensive? At the least,
the Serbs would not have had time to slaughter so many innocent
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But war for the West must now be cost-free. We bomb. Others die.
We got a taste of this in the 1991 Gulf war, then again in the
year-long bombing campaign against Iraq that started once more in
December, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo war reached perfection. Not a single Serb bullet hit
a single NATO soldier. Just one NATO pilot was shot down _ and he
was rescued.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO didn't have the guts to send a single heavily-armed
NATO soldier into Kosovo to save the Albanians. Our soldiers never
engaged the enemy. Instead, fearful that the Western alliance might
start to disintegrate as the bombing failed to bring Milosevic to
heel, NATO's bombing targets became more promiscuous.
</P>
<P>
   Power stations, housing tracts, small bridges were hit, even a
tobacco factory.
</P>
<P>
   NATO apologized when it bombed a mass convoy of refugees being
driven from their homes by the Serbs. But just over half way
through the air bombardment, NATO took a strategic decision. It
would no longer apologize for anything it did.
</P>
<P>
   So when American jets struck a narrow bridge at Varvarin at
midday on the village's market day _ blasting Serb civilians into
the Morava River _ and then came back 20 minutes later and killed
the rescue workers, there was not a word of regret.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO arrived in Kosovo, it watched the Serb war criminals
streaming out in their trucks along with the Yugoslav army. And did
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't worth a single NATO casualty to arrest a single Serb
paramilitary _ even though hundreds of Hague war-crimes
investigators would subsequently be working for months in the
province to identify the very same criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Serb killers retired to Montenegro or central
Serbia, confident that NATO would not pursue them. And they were
right. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,225) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   NATO's original demand for complete access to all of Serbia _
made at the ``peace'' talks in Paris which preceded the war and
refused by the Serbs _ was also quietly dropped once Milosevic
allowed NATO troops into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For now, NATO will stay in Kosovo, just as it will stay in
Bosnia. And for now, Milosevic will remain in power.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents cannot stir a people who are using all their
energy to survive a winter any more than American exhortation can
provoke the crushed people of Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Milosevic's enemies in Belgrade are only protesting at
his mistakes _ not at the atrocities committed in Serbia's name in
Kosovo. &QL;

   We have taken our revenge on Milosevic for Bosnia. We have

   As for Chechnya, that's too bad. Russia has nuclear weapons.
Serbia does not. &QL;

 &HT;    
 &HT;    KANSAS CITY, Missouri - Cuando Euphonix, un fabricante de
equipos de sonido radicado en Palo Alto, California, decidio
ampliar su mercado, penso en grande.
 &HT;    La compania, que genera ventas anuales de poco mas de US$15
millones, puso la mira en el sur, en Rio de Janeiro, para ser mas
exactos. Uno de los mayores estudios de grabacion de Brasil,
Clausferma Servicos e Locacao de Equipamentos, mas conocido como
Cia. Dos Tecnicos, queria comprar productos de Euphonix por
US$475.000.
 &HT;    Pero como un fabricante mediano sin experiencia en ventas
internacionales puede conseguir financiamiento comercial para un
pedido de casi medio millon de dolares? ``Uno llama a cualquier
compania de financiacion en Estados Unidos y en cuanto empieza a
hablar de financiar exportaciones, le cuelgan el telefono,'' dice
Dave Christenson, director de ventas internacionales de Euphonix.
``No quieren saber nada de eso.''
 &HT;    Sin embargo, Leawood Export Finance fue todo oidos. En mayo, la
comercializadora radicada en Overland Park, Kansas, consiguio una
garantia de financiamiento comercial para los equipos de Euphonix
del Export-Import Bank de Estados Unidos (Ex-Im Bank), lo que
permitio a la compania llevar a cabo la venta.
 &HT;    Las comercializadoras son comunes en Europa, Asia y America
Latina, pero en Estados Unidos practicamente se extinguieron hace
unos anos. Leawood es una de las pocas que siguen en operacion.
``Entre 1965 y 1980, habia muchas companias como Leawood,'' senala
Bill Redway, vicepresidente de pequenos negocios del Ex-Im Bank.
``Pero despues de la crisis de la deuda en America Latina, todas
desaparecieron.''
 &HT;    El enfoque de Leawood es simple: busca empresas pequenas, de 75
a 100 empleados, con una o dos lineas de productos exportables,
compra sus productos y busca mercados en el extranjero o asume el
riesgo de exportarlos a compradores senalados por el fabricante.
Las firmas pequenas pueden exportar de esa manera sus productos sin
peligro. ``[Las empresas pequenas estan tan concentradas en
elaborar el producto que buscan con quien asociarse,'' dice
Kathleen Williams, directora en Leawood.
 &HT;    La desaparicion de las comercializadoras en Estados Unidos ha
creado un vacio que ha aprovechado Leawood, segun Robert Duncan,
presidente y propietario mayoritario de la firma. ``Nuestra
investigacion de mercado muestra que hay un enorme interes,'' dice.
``Leawood extiende sus tentaculos, que nos sirven de base para
hacer crecer nuestro negocio.'' Uno de esos tentaculos es TerraMar,
subsidiaria de Leawood en El Paso, Texas. La compania vende
diversos productos, como metales, equipos y suministros medicos a
Mexico.
 &HT;    America Latina ha sido un importante mercado para Leawood, y
sigue creciendo. Las ventas de la firma se han disparado en los
ultimos anos, de US$4 millones en 1996 a US$6,7 millones en 1997 y
a US$10 millones el ano pasado. El 95 por ciento de ese volumen se
origino en America Latina. Duncan calcula que el total de ventas
por exportacion este ano llegara a US$20 millones, la mayor parte
del cual provendra de Latinoamerica. Williams dice que duplicar las
ventas de la compania ha sido bastante facil. ``No hay nadie mas en
nuestro terreno,'' senala.
 &HT;    Leawood gana dinero de dos maneras. Si tiene que buscar un
comprador para la mercancia, cobra un margen de ganancia bruta del
5 por ciento al 20 por ciento. Si el suministrador ya tiene un
comprador pero necesita financiamiento, Leawood agrega una cuota de
manejo basada en el volumen y en los terminos de la financiacion. Y
a pesar de los riesgos de operar en la region, Duncan dice que la
firma nunca ha tenido grandes problemas: siempre ha encontrado un
comprador para los articulos que vende como intermediaria o que
financia.
 &HT;    Los que trabajan en Leawood dicen que la fuerza de la compania
esta en su enfoque. ``La clase de negocios que Bob [Duncan hace es
excelente para pequenas firmas,'' dice Redway. ``Se vincula con
pequenos fabricantes norteamericanos y compradores
latinoamericanos. Ex-Im Bank esta ansioso por expandirse en ese
sector.''
 &HT;    Tan ansioso que Leawood es la unica institucion no bancaria que
ha recibido una garantia del Ex-Im Bank. Esta garantia permite a
Leawood ofrecer a compradores extranjeros un financiamiento de
hasta US$10 millones, con plazos hasta siete anos. A pesar del
tamano relativamente pequeno de Leawood, Duncan dice que es el
usuario numero 51 de las garantias del Ex-Im Bank y el duodecimo
usuario de su seguro de exportacion.
 &HT;    Debido a su enfoque, Leawood ha abierto el mercado de las
exportaciones a los peces pequenos. Las companias de la lista de
500 de la revista Fortune suelen dominar las exportaciones
norteamericanas porque su envergadura les permite ocuparse de su
financiamiento comercial y negociar sus garantias. Pero las firmas
menores no generan la clase de pedidos de exportacion que los
grandes bancos quieren financiar, y muchos bancos menores capaces
de asegurar transacciones de menos de US$5 millones no saben como
hacerlo.
 &HT;    Gary Mendell, presidente de Meridian Insurance Group, de Los
Angeles, que ofrece seguros para cubrir pagos por exportaciones,
paso varios anos buscando una firma como Leawood, capaz de ayudar a
empresas pequenas en su afan de entrar en el comercio exterior.
''[Las firmas pequenas no solo necesitan a alguien que organice
sistemas internos,'' dice, ``sino a alguien que lo maneje todo.''
 &HT;    Duncan comenzo hace varias decadas en el negocio de las
exportaciones, a cargo de la distribucion y el financiamiento de
Caterpillar. Dejo el negocio en 1978, cuando la crisis de la deuda
en America Latina dio lugar al derrumbe de las exportaciones de
Estados Unidos y a la desaparicion de las comercializadoras.
 &HT;    Pero Duncan descubrio que la mayor parte de esas companias
estaban organizadas por bancos. Cuando los paises latinoamericanos
tuvieron dificultades para pagar la deuda y bajo el nivel del
comercio, el choque cultural entre los bancos, enemigos del riesgo,
y las filiales comercializadoras, dispuestas a correr riesgos, se
hizo mas evidente. De modo que Duncan creo Leawood hace siete anos
para ayudar a las pequenas companias que no encontraban
financiamiento para exportar sus productos.
 &HT;    A pesar de que la competencia es escasa, la compania no se
duerme en los laureles. Espera inaugurar una pagina de comercio
electronico en la Web en enero, para que los posibles compradores
extranjeros puedan ver los productos y envien sus solicitudes de
credito a traves de Internet. La pagina estara en ingles y en
espanol, y mas tarde en portugues.
 &HT;    Christenson, de Euphonix, esta satisfecho de su asociacion con
Leawood. Antes, la compania perdia negocios frente a sus rivales
britanicos, que conseguian financiamiento mediante un programa
gubernamental de garantia a las exportaciones. ``Muchas veces
perdiamos oportunidades porque no podiamos ofrecer financiamiento
al instante,'' dice. ``Ahora podemos competir en condiciones menos
desiguales.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Late last year, a brutal army _ acting on the orders
of a ruthlessly ambitious politician _ laid waste to one of its
historic provinces, slaughtering thousands, driving up to a half a
million people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers, the European Union and the United States
warned that the killing must stop. The rampaging army claimed it
was fighting separatist ``terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did we in the West do about it? Absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't bomb Russia's bridges or power stations or railway
lines or barracks or television transmitters or _ by mistake, of
course _ buses and a passenger train and a hospital and refugee
convoys.
</P>
<P>
   No, we tut-tutted and appealed for a political solution in
Chechnya. And U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the
scourge of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, told us how
important it was to keep good relations with Russia, that Moscow
should not be ostracized.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the double standards would have been sharper had the two
events coincided. If the Russian army had bombarded Grozny as NATO
was bombing Belgrade, a few more questions would have been asked
about the ``human values'' which the West was supposedly upholding
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If we can go to war because Albanians were being persecuted in
Kosovo by the Serbs, why couldn't we go to war when Chechens were
being dispossessed of their homes and driven from their villages?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, NATO's campaign closed just in time for Russia's
newly-resigned president, Boris Yeltsin, and his prime
minister-turned-successor, Vladimir Putin, to claim that it gave
Russia the right to crush the rebels of its recalcitrant southern
province.
</P>
<P>
   One day, perhaps, historians will add the Chechen dead to the
casualties of Kosovo and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   If, that is, we ever know the casualty figures. For the dead of
the only war fought by the European powers since 1945 have still to
be counted; more than half the mass graves of Kosovo have still to
be opened and the Serbs have still to give a final figure for their
civilian and military losses.
</P>
<P>
   There may be 4,000 Albanian corpses _ victims of Serb forces _
still undiscovered in the frozen soil of Kosovo this winter; around
2,000 have already been dug up.
</P>
<P>
   And the town war memorials of Serbia suggest that the Yugoslav
army's dead may be more than the 600 claimed by Milosevic. Perhaps
1,500 Serb civilians were killed by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 8,000 people were killed in the war for
Kosovo. Not one of them was a soldier of the NATO alliance. For if
we went to war with the Kosovo Albanians, we were not prepared to
die for them.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, another variation of the old joke _ that NATO was
ready to fight to the last Albanian _ is making the rounds. As one
survivor put it to a French reporter when NATO troops eventually
entered the ruins of Kosovo: ``While you were flying high in the
skies above us, we down here were dying.'' And it is true. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ The biggest deal the world has seen was born not in
New York or anywhere else in America.
</P>
<P>
   It was planted as the seed of an idea in the remote provinces of
southern China, and in Peking and Shanghai where Steve Case and
Gerald Levin spent a week together last October on a Time
magazine-sponsored news tour of China.
</P>
<P>
   Case, head of America Online (AOL), and Levin, chairman of Time
and the putative CEO of the new company, became friendly about a
year ago when they met at a conference. They kept in touch, purely
on a personal basis, after that.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until shortly after their China sojourn that Case
picked up a telephone in AOL headquarters in Dulles, Va., on the
outskirts of Washington, and speed-dialed Levin. (No, he did not
apparently, use his e-mail.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an idea,'' he said, ``let's put our two companies
together.'' Clearly, Levin did not take much persuading. The call
was placed barely two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said Monday that in considering AOL's advances, he knew
that if he didn't enter into such a marriage by the end of 2000 one
of the other media giants would have done so. And he didn't want to
be second.
</P>
<P>
   Both in terms of numbers and brand names, the merger is
dazzling. Time Warner brings the largest number of household brands
to the marriage: Time magazine, CNN, Warner Brothers, People, HBO,
Sports Illustrated, Warner Music Group, Fortune, Entertainment
Weekly, Looney Tunes and Cartoon Network, which features, among
others The Flintstones.
</P>
<P>
   AOL with its cyber assistant Connie is a brand in its own right,
of course. Among its other assets, however, you have Compuserve,
Netscape, Digital City and AOL Moviephone.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer reach that the new company will have can also be seen
in the subscriber numbers. Add them up and you have a mighty chunk
of our world.
</P>
<P>
   AOL has 20 million members, Time magazines have 30 million
subscribers and CNN is available to one billion television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable, the cable television network that AOL will be
able to tap into to distribute its product at super high speed, has
13 million subscribers. (Only AT&AMP;T's network in the U.S. is
bigger.)
</P>
<P>
   Transcending the deal itself, meanwhile, is the message it
delivers about our new Internet age and about the myriad new
companies crowding for a piece of it. It means we can believe in
it.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner is venerable, it is mighty and it is safe, but
Monday it sent an unmistakable message: the Internet is the future.
</P>
<P>
   A truth that has been creeping up on all of the media industry
for so many months has now been spelled out in blaring neon. The
future is called the broadband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something profound is taking place,'' Levin told a crammed New
York press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said something else terribly important too. The crazy,
insane, untenable valuations that have been put on Internet
companies in recent months _ on the Amazons and other dot-com
pioneers that are roaring up the information highway, and the stock
indices, with little early prospect of making any actual money _
are not crazy or insane at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the present valuations,'' he said. ``Their future
cash flow is so significant, that is how you justify it.'' And the
amounts of cash washing around the merger are mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner Monday described putting his name to the mega-merger
last Sunday night as not unlike his first experience of having sex
some four decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Putting ink to the proposed combination was, it would appear,
almost a religious experience for the old maverick from Atlanta.
You can understand that.
</P>
<P>
   With the 100 million shares that he owns in Time Warner,
acquired through the sale of his own beloved CNN to Time three
years ago, Turner was making himself roughly $2.5 billion richer.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, however, there was still more behind his excitement.
When the rest of the world learned about what was happening in the
boardroom that night, it would stand back in awe and amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Mega-mergers, where the figures are in billions not millions,
are commonplace. But this deal was clearly different and not just
because it was the biggest in corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   No single event could better capture what is happening to the
media industry as one millennium turns into the next.
</P>
<P>
   With one of the world's leading information and entertainment
companies linking up with the largest audience in cyberspace, it is
bound to influence the nature of what we see and hear.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will speed the rush among media providers to offer
tailored news and football results straight to customers' mobile
phones. Before long, trips to the video shop will be obsolete, as
films become available on demand through cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the ultimate symbol of the old media opening the
door to the new universe of digital and broadband communications _
a universe that both fascinates and frightens it _ and deciding to
abandon caution and leap through. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875, OR CONTINUE TO 1,100 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Time Warner, a company with decades of history, is flinging
itself into the arms of AOL, a business just 15 years old and
barely known a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining event for Time Warner and America Online as
well as a pivotal moment in the unfolding of the Internet age,''
said Time Warner president Richard Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Historians will also note the special timing. It was on Jan. 10,
1990 _ exactly 10 years ago _ that Time Warner was created out of
the fusion between the Time Inc. and Warner Communications, two
companies that had been founded in 1922. Time was the creation of
Henry Luce, whose name was repeatedly invoked in Monday's merger
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkable, however, may be the fact that this deal, or one
like it _ say between Disney and Yahoo! _ has not happened before.
Case said Monday with admirable restraint: ``This is the first time
a major Internet company has merged with a major media company and
the possibilities are endless.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the really observant among us would have seen this
merger coming a few short months ago when Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan
starred in a cute little romantic film called ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Any AOL users will know where that phrase is from and will
recognize the on-screen icons that are featured in the film. They
are the signatures of that company. And who made the film? Warner
Brothers, of course. &QL;

&HT;     CHEVRON CUTS SPENDING BECAUSE OF '99 DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GEORGE RAINE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Chevron Corp. plans to spend $5.2 billion in
2000, of which $3.6 billion will be for worldwide exploration and
production and $1.3 billion for projects in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The spending plan is about 16.5 percent less than estimated 1999
spending because of major acquisitions in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One was the purchase of Rutherford Moran Oil Corp. as well as
taking over the operation of a gas and oil area in the Gulf of
Thailand. Chevron also acquired Petrolera Argentina San Jorge, an
exploration and producing company that accounts for 8 percent of
the oil production in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron said it is not disclosing the price it paid for San
Jorge. ``It's a business decision not to disclose the figure,''
said Fred Gorell, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Precise numbers for 1999 will not be known until the fourth
quarter and full-year reports are completed in a few weeks, said
Gorell.
</P>
<P>
   The spending plan was announced by Dave O'Reilly, a chemical
engineer who became Chevron's chairman and CEO Jan. 1, succeeding
Kenneth T. Derr, who retired.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly, along with about 50 other Chevron employees, staffed
an office in San Ramon, Calif., over the New Year's Day weekend to
monitor Y2K roll-over in the 90 nations in which the company has
business interests. There were no disruptions as the new millennium
began seamlessly, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our spending program reflects continued confidence in our
company's prospects for growth,'' said O'Reilly, who joined Chevron
in 1968 and was elected vice chairman in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first operations O'Reilly is overseeing is the
transfer of all but 200 of 1,350 employees from the company's San
Francisco office space to the East Bay, mostly to offices in San
Ramon. The transfer will take place throughout the year, although
most of the people will move during the first quarter, said Gorell.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the spending will be on projects in Kazakhstan,
Africa, Thailand and Canada. The U.S. projects include deep-water
oil fields called Gemini and Genesis in the Gulf of Mexico and
another underwater project off the coast of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it also plans to drill six deep-water
exploratory wildcat wells in 2000 and to increase its participation
in the U.S. power sector through increased investment in Dynegy
Inc. of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron expects to spend about $420 million for transportation,
most of it in Russia where the Caspian Pipeline Consortium is
laying pipe to connect the Tengiz Field to the Russian Black Sea
port of Novorossiysk. That is expected to be completed in mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately $830 million will be spent on worldwide refining
and marketing, of which $530 million will be spent in the U.S.,
said Chevron. Most of the remainder will be invested by Chevron's
50 percent-owned affiliate, Caltex Petroleum Corp., which operates
in about 60 countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.

<P>
   Levin said Monday that in considering AOL's advances, he knew
that if he didn't enter into such a marriage by the end of 2000 one
of the other media giants would have done so. And he didn't want to
be second.
</P>
<P>
   Both in terms of numbers and brand names, the merger is
dazzling. Time Warner brings the largest number of household brands
to the marriage: Time magazine, CNN, Warner Brothers, People, HBO,
Sports Illustrated, Warner Music Group, Fortune, Entertainment
Weekly, Looney Tunes and Cartoon Network, which features, among
others The Flintstones.
</P>
<P>
   AOL with its cyber assistant Connie is a brand in its own right,
of course. Among its other assets, however, you have Compuserve,
Netscape, Digital City and AOL Moviephone.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer reach that the new company will have can also be seen
in the subscriber numbers. Add them up and you have a mighty chunk
of our world.
</P>
<P>
   AOL has 20 million members, Time magazines have 30 million
subscribers and CNN is available to one billion television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable, the cable television network that AOL will be
able to tap into to distribute its product at super high speed, has
13 million subscribers. (Only AT&AMP;T's network in the U.S. is
bigger.)
</P>
<P>
   Transcending the deal itself, meanwhile, is the message it
delivers about our new Internet age and about the myriad new
companies crowding for a piece of it. It means we can believe in
it.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner is venerable, it is mighty and it is safe, but
Monday it sent an unmistakable message: the Internet is the future.
</P>
<P>
   A truth that has been creeping up on all of the media industry
for so many months has now been spelled out in blaring neon. The
future is called the broadband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something profound is taking place,'' Levin told a crammed New
York press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said something else terribly important too. The crazy,
insane, untenable valuations that have been put on Internet
companies in recent months _ on the Amazons and other dot-com
pioneers that are roaring up the information highway, and the stock
indices, with little early prospect of making any actual money _
are not crazy or insane at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the present valuations,'' he said. ``Their future
cash flow is so significant, that is how you justify it.'' And the
amounts of cash washing around the merger are mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner Monday described putting his name to the mega-merger
last Sunday night as not unlike his first experience of having sex
some four decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Putting ink to the proposed combination was, it would appear,
almost a religious experience for the old maverick from Atlanta.
You can understand that.
</P>
<P>
   With the 100 million shares that he owns in Time Warner,
acquired through the sale of his own beloved CNN to Time three
years ago, Turner was making himself roughly $2.5 billion richer.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, however, there was still more behind his excitement.
When the rest of the world learned about what was happening in the
boardroom that night, it would stand back in awe and amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Mega-mergers, where the figures are in billions not millions,
are commonplace. But this deal was clearly different and not just
because it was the biggest in corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   No single event could better capture what is happening to the
media industry as one millennium turns into the next.
</P>
<P>
   With one of the world's leading information and entertainment
companies linking up with the largest audience in cyberspace, it is
bound to influence the nature of what we see and hear.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will speed the rush among media providers to offer
tailored news and football results straight to customers' mobile
phones. Before long, trips to the video shop will be obsolete, as
films become available on demand through cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the ultimate symbol of the old media opening the
door to the new universe of digital and broadband communications _
a universe that both fascinates and frightens it _ and deciding to
abandon caution and leap through. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875, OR CONTINUE TO 1,100 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Time Warner, a company with decades of history, is flinging
itself into the arms of AOL, a business just 15 years old and
barely known a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining event for Time Warner and America Online as
well as a pivotal moment in the unfolding of the Internet age,''
said Time Warner president Richard Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Historians will also note the special timing. It was on Jan. 10,
1990 _ exactly 10 years ago _ that Time Warner was created out of
the fusion between the Time Inc. and Warner Communications, two
companies that had been founded in 1922. Time was the creation of
Henry Luce, whose name was repeatedly invoked in Monday's merger
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkable, however, may be the fact that this deal, or one
like it _ say between Disney and Yahoo! _ has not happened before.
Case said Monday with admirable restraint: ``This is the first time
a major Internet company has merged with a major media company and
the possibilities are endless.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the really observant among us would have seen this
merger coming a few short months ago when Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan
starred in a cute little romantic film called ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Any AOL users will know where that phrase is from and will
recognize the on-screen icons that are featured in the film. They
are the signatures of that company. And who made the film? Warner
Brothers, of course. &QL;

   LONDON _ Monday was the day the Internet grew up.
</P>
<P>
   We knew this strange, amorphous communications network, tied
together by a few amateurs from personal computers, telephone wires
and a lot of clever software, would become the dominant technology
of the first quarter of this century.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Net was still dominated by the stand-alone
companies that helped to popularize it, it would remain outside the
corporate mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Internet companies are worth an enormous amount on the
stock exchanges. Sure, they are growing amazingly fast. But while
they have immense promise, they don't employ many people and have
not, in the main, been making any money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all is different. The merger between the world's biggest
Internet service provider and the world's largest media group means
the might of American capitalism will be devoted to pushing the new
technology into every aspect of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   There will now be a string of mergers, including British and
European ones, as other media groups try to gain electronic access
to our homes.
</P>
<P>
   Any firm with a message or a brand name in media will be
clamoring for our attention, trying to create services we will want
to buy.
</P>
<P>
   How they reach us _ whether through the PCs as at present, or by
interactive television, or by mobile phones, or even by video games
consoles _ is still for grabs. But over the next 10 years the
technology will race ahead and the variety of entertainment and
information services on offer will explode.
</P>
<P>
   The limit will not be technology; it will be our taste and our
time.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reasonable presumption that the American dominance of
the Internet will continue _ though the key invention, the World
Wide Web, was made by a Briton working in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   But while it would be right to expect the tidal wave of American
popular culture to flow even more strongly, the Net is ultimately a
democratic technology. It will do what we want of it.
</P>
<P>
   If we want to use it to watch Hollywood movies, we will download
them in seconds. If we want to revitalize local government, it will
create local discussion forums. If we want to buy shares, a few
clicks of the mouse will do that. And if we want to use the great
global library to educate ourselves better, then that too is
available for all.
</P>
<P>
   Not all giant mergers succeed. Companies _ and mergers _ succeed
only if they can create goods and services we want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   We, the consumers, are about to be offered an explosion of
choice: choice of entertainment, of education, of information. A
few years ago we had only four television channels. In 10 more
years there will be hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   This world will be as different as our supermarkets are now from
the family grocers of the Fifties. But it will be our choice: we,
as consumers, will win. &QL;

&HT;     COOKING GREENS DON'T HAVE TO GIVE YOU THE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUTH FANTASIA  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greens give people the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Leafy green vegetables are known for being hard to clean, stinky
to cook and bitter to taste. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for
foods that are full of fiber and virtually fat-free. But in recent
years, chefs have developed recipes for greens that make cooking
the leaves faster and eating them, well easier.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule to handling greens, advises James Peterson in his
cookbook ``Vegetables,'' is cut first, wash later.
</P>
<P>
   Minute particles of dirt and sand can become trapped in the
veins of the leaves and between the stalks. So the more the head of
greens is separated, the easier it is to wash clean.
</P>
<P>
   To trim collards, kale and Swiss chard, which have tough,
unappetizing stems, separate the leaves and stack them on top of
each other, lining them up where the bottom of the leaf meets the
stem. With a chef's knife, chop off the stems and discard. Then,
using the tip of the chef's knife, or a paring knife, cut along
each side of the stem into the leaf to remove the remaining stem.
Hold the leftover leaf parts in a bunch and chop into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   When trimming bok choy, savoy cabbage, chicory, escarole or
other greens with more tender stems, simply cut off the tough
bottoms of the stems, then chop the leaves into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Once the greens are cut, fill a clean sink with cold water and
add the greens. Swish the greens around for a few minutes and then
let them rest for 10 to 15 minutes so any dirt or grit can settle
to the bottom of the sink. Using your hands, gently lift the washed
greens out of the sink, letting the water escape through your
fingers. Try not to disturb the water too much; you don't want to
stir up the grit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the leaves are very sandy or mud-caked, as they can be
in rainy seasons, this trick works well to get greens squeaky clean
in just one washing,'' says Victoria Wise in the ``Smith &AMP; Hawken
Gardeners' Community Cookbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Once there was only one way to cook greens such as kale and
collards: simmer them for hours, even days, in a pot of water with
a slab of fatback or a ham hock, until even the stems were tender,
then they were served up with a bottle of chili-laced vinegar on
the side.
</P>
<P>
   These days, chefs say, you can cook a good pot of greens in as
little as 3 minutes. It all depends on which green you choose.
</P>
<P>
   Soft greens, like savoy cabbage, bok choy and spinach, cook the
quickest while collards, kale, chicory and escarole may take 10 to
15 minutes to become tender enough to eat. The only way to know
when the greens are done is to keep a careful watch on the pot.
When buying greens, keep in mind that smaller, younger leaves cook
faster.
</P>
<P>
   All greens don't have to be boiled. Softer ones, such as bok
choy, spinach, savoy cabbage (which also happen to be less bitter
than the tougher-leaf greens) can be sauteed in oil and seasoned
with accompaniments such as feta cheese, bacon, olives and
sun-dried tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes here include a couple of cooking methods and these
are just the start. Whenever you're in the store, buy what looks
freshest. You can substitute collards for kale, chicory for
escarole and bok choy for spinach.

   EGG ROLLS WITH SWEET-AND-SOUR DIPPING SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 5)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Sweet-and-Sour Dipping Sauce (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound bok choy or other Asian green, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   10 egg roll wrappers
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil for deep frying
</P>
<P>
   Prepare dipping sauce and set aside. (A store-bought sauce can
be used as well).
</P>
<P>
   Place the bok choy, spring onions, garlic, cilantro and ginger
in a bowl and toss to mix. Add soy sauce and toss again. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   To form the egg rolls, place a wrapper on the counter. Spread 2
tablespoons of the green mixture in the center. Roll up the
wrapper, envelope style, and, if necessary, seal the final fold
with a little water to keep the envelope from springing open.
Continue with the remaining egg roll wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 3/4-inch oil into a heavy skillet and heat until smoking.
Place as many egg rolls in the frying pan as will fit without
crowding and fry, turning once, until lightly browned and crispy, 1
minute. Lift the rolls out of the oil and transfer to paper towels
to drain. Continue with another batch until all the rolls are
fried.
</P>
<P>
   Serve right away with dipping sauce.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: The filling mixture may be made in advance, but the
vegetables will wilt and release liquid. Drain the filling before
making the rolls or they will burst when fried.

   (UNDATED) _ Napping at work is one of the best ways of
increasing productivity and reducing human error, according to
psychologists, who found that the majority of employees already
sneak off for a quick kip during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are taking the idea so seriously that they are
introducing sleeping rooms in their offices so employees can have a
midday snooze without feeling guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Research conducted by Bill Anthony, a professor at Boston
University, and published last week in a book called ``The Art of
Napping at Work,'' has shown that 70 percent of employees admit to
sneaking naps at work.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Anthony believes that napping is not only natural but
also essential to health and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workplace napping is a natural, no-cost way to increase worker
productivity,'' he said. ``Business need to introduce a workplace
napping policy outlining the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   His book, which he wrote with his wife Camille, is designed to
help people overcome environmental barriers and skepticism that the
workplace napper faces.
</P>
<P>
   Companies who have taken part in their research have found it
boosts staff morale and business benefits from having ``two
mornings.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous research has shown that most people now get one to two
hours less sleep per night than before the invention of the light
bulb and it well recognized that modern living has introduced a
nationwide sleep deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses who ignore the financial and health benefits of
napping at work are asleep at the switch.'' Following Bill and
Camille Anthony's advice will lead to greater productivity,
increased job satisfaction, and better health, a win-win situation
for everyone, said Dr. James Maas, author of ``Power Sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   One convert to the napping at work is David Johnson, managing
director of a consulting firm in Pittsburgh. ``We have experienced
an increase in productivity and seen less human error as a result
of our nap room,'' he said. `` We are proud to be part of this
forward-thinking movement.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Thursday, Jan. 13:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-POLICE (Washington) _ The Supreme Court rules, 5-4, that
police can stop and question someone who runs at the sight of a
police officer. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-LICENSE-DATA (Washington) _ Congress can protect
motorists' privacy by barring states from selling the personal
information on driver's licenses, the Supreme Court ruled
Wednesday. The law does not violate states' rights, the justices
said in a unanimous decision that ran counter to their recent trend
of reining in Congress' power over the states. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)

<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (``p'' code)
</P>
<P>
   NH-VOICES (Dateline to kum, N.H.) _ In more than 50 interviews,
voters were hard pressed to come up with a nagging issue upon which
they would select their candidate. Instead, in a contrast to four
or eight years ago, when voters here were bursting with worries
about the economy, this year they seem relatively content. That
leaves them the luxury of tuning their political antenna on the
personal attributes of the candidates, their spouses, their parents
and, in case of Gore, their bosses. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>

developments. By Barbara Crossette.

that killed 300 people.
</P>

American-based Chinese scholar collecting historical documents.
They say the arrest threatens research and future exchanges. By

<P>

<P>
   AOL-WIRELESS (Undated) _ America Online, the company that made
the Internet invisible and less frightening, has been at the
forefront of developing so-called post-PC Internet appliances.
Indeed, while much of the talk about the Time Warner deal has been
about broadband, the next big thing is expected to be wireless, and
AOL is determined to be at the forefront. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-ASIA (Hong Kong) _ It is not clear that a combined AOL-Time
Warner will be able to make inroads into the potentially huge
market of Asia. Unlike in Europe, where AOL has built a valuable
regional franchise through its partnership with Bertelsmann, the
Internet in Asia remains a fractured business with few large
players and virtually none that cross national boundaries. By Mark
Landler.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-INVESTORS (Undated) _ Shares of America Online and Time
Warner extend their slide.
</P>
<P>
   LUXURY-CARS (Detroit) _ After capturing a big share of the
American market for small and mid-sized cars, Japanese auto makers
set their sights a decade ago on the luxury market long dominated
by Cadillac and Lincoln. Indeed, both Cadillac and Lincoln were
dethroned in 1999 for the first time since the 1930s. Yet the
upstart was not Japanese, but European: Mercedes-Benz. There is
rare unanimity here about how the Europeans surged into first
place. They have the strongest brands, at a time when a rising
stock market and strong economy have meant that money is no object
for many buyers. The European ascendance in luxury cars has come at
a particularly disappointing time for American and Japanese
executives in the market segment. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ The daily Marketplace column.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ Stocks were mixed in mid-afternoon trading.

Robert D. Hershey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   FUND-MANAGERS (Undated) _ George Vanderheiden, manager of a
number of large stock mutual funds, plans to retire. Fidelity also
names 11 new stock fund managers. By Richard A. Oppel Jr.
</P>
<P>
   MERRILL-APPOINT (Undated) _ Merrill Lynch says David Bowers, its
chief European equity strategist, will become its chief investment
strategist, replacing Charles Clough. By Patrick McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-BANKS (Singapore) _ The Indonesia government dismisses
Glenn Yusuf, the head of the agency responsible for cleaning up the
country's insolvent banking system. The announcement ends months of
speculation about the fate of Yusuf, a favorite of Western
financiers and one of the few holdover officials from the
administration of former President B.J. Habibie. By Wayne Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-DAEWOO (Seoul) _ Looking at what is happening on the sale
of Daewoo Motor. Hyundai Motor says it may make a joint bid with an
unidentified foreign partner, while General Motors says it is
reconsidering its earlier bid.

   CUBABOY-US _ WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on
Wednesday upheld immigration officials' decision that 6-year-old

   LEWIS-MLK _ ATLANTA _ Months ago, the Catholic Archdiocese of
Atlanta invited Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., to deliver a speech
commemorating Martin Luther King Jr. The speech was to be delivered
this Saturday before an audience of thousands. Two weeks ago, Lewis
got a call from the archdiocese folks withdrawing the invitation.
Their reason? He is pro-choice Lewis, who makes a point out of

   FLA-BIBLE _ Bible classes taught in Florida's public schools
violate federal law, according to the People for the American Way.
On Thursday in Tallahassee, the advocacy group will release a
report on how the 15 school districts throughout the Sunshine State
teach the Bible to public school students. The main complaint is
that the classes draw on a Christian perspective instead of
non-sectarian instruction. The report takes particular aim at the
National Council on Bible Curriculum in Greensboro, N.C., the same
group that's trying to start a bible curriculum in Georgia.

   VIRGINMARY-SUIT _ Nancy Fowler, the Conyers woman who claims to

from the massive gatherings for books and other publications. The

use the information from the gatherings. (Farber, Atlanta

&HT;     `NEXT FRIDAY' DESERVES A GOOD FLUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union

<P>
   Calling all fans of excrement: Your time has come.
</P>
<P>
   Fond of flatulence? Got a soft spot for stinky-toilet jokes?
Laugh uncontrollably when someone falls back-first into a massive
pile of Chihuahua poo, then stumbles through the rest of the movie
with an aromatic smear on the back of his overalls?
</P>
<P>
   If so _ if BMs are your be-all and end-all _ then run, don't
walk, to the nearest neighborhood screening of ``Next Friday,''
where you can soak in scatology to your heart's (or whatever's)
content. That the film tempers plop jokes with racist stereotypes
and near-constant ``Cheech &AMP; Chong''-esque marijuana consumption
will make it either more or less palatable to the individual
viewer. You decide.
</P>
<P>
   Helmed by video director Steve Carr, ``Next Friday'' is the
sequel to 1995's ``Friday,'' an exploitative, sort-of-funny film
about a pair of guys (Ice Cube and Chris Tucker) in South Central
L.A. who smoke $200 worth of dope and then scramble to pay the
dealer by Friday night. Ice Cube co-wrote that film, and he
co-wrote this one (both with the aptly named D.J. Pooh), and the
world would be a better place if he hadn't. Despite the man's
proven abilities as rapper and actor, when it comes to
screenwriting he ought to keep his anal fixations to himself.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, good egg Craig (Mr. Cube) is on the run from
escaped convict and hulking grudge-bearer Debo (Tommy ``Tiny''
Lister), last seen getting whupped by our hero in the first film.
Craig's Dad (John Witherspoon), a frequent voider, sends Craig to
live with his cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps) and Uncle Elroy (Don
``D.C.'' Curry), who hit it big in the lottery and now reside in a
sprawling suburban palazzo.
</P>
<P>
   Elroy is a leopard-printed Ladies Man who collects and displays
artificial phalluses in his bedroom. Day-Day, who does not, is
plagued by woman troubles that extend beyond his ex-girlfriend to
his ex-girlfriend's menacing sister; among the film's few comic
strokes is the fact that Day-Day holds court injunctions against
them both. On the Friday in question, Day-Day goes off to work at
Pinky's record shop while Craig, Elroy and Elroy's nymphomaniacal
squeeze, Sugar, smoke a blunt the size of a pickle.
</P>
<P>
   Craig soon learns that Elroy is about to lose the house for
failure to pay taxes. Concerned, he moseys down to Day-Day's place
of employ and meets an affable skateboarder, Roach (Justin Pierce).
Guess what Roach likes to do in his spare time? Craig, Day-Day and
Roach smoke a joint the size of a green bean. They get stoned. They
get fired. Then they head to Day-Day's house, where they ponder the
comings and goings of neighboring thugs (embodiments of Hispanic
stereotypes) and speculate about a hidden stash of cash. How much
is it? Is it drug money? Could they use it to pay Elroy's back
taxes?
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes, and so it goes, with numerous weak attempts at
humor and an even weaker attempt at romance. It seems the thugs'
babe-ola sister, Carla (Lisa Rodriguez), has a thing for Craig. Of
course! Of course they find true love! Of course Debo tracks down
Craig! Of course Craig's father never removes the dog crap from his
back!
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' does have a few things going for it, among them
a brisk pace (93 minutes) and a couple of truly funny bits:
subtitles pop up at unexpected moments, and a sight gag involving a
vacuum cleaner almost redeems the feces.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the film is little more than a lot of trash. One
minute it's dwelling on a used prophylactic; the next it's telling
us that ``Fat b----es need love, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And as empowering as it is to have African-Americans up high in
Hollywood _ writing movies, directing them, producing them,
starring in them _ a film that portray blacks as drugged-addicted,
sex-obsessed, tax-avoiding, lax-boweled, lazy thieves is just
another form of blaxploitation. It trots out vile racist cliches,
and it asks us to laugh at them. Don't.

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, Jan. 13:
</P>
<P>
   SMART-HOUSES (Undated) _ If the 1990s brought widespread
consumer acceptance of in-home theater, wireless communications,
home PC's and smart appliances, the new decade brings promise _ or
threat _ of ``convergence,'' the ultimate integration of audio,
video and data systems. Some 7.5 million American homes _ about 7
percent _ are currently equipped with a degree of computer
networking that links automated security, entertainment and
lighting. The most advanced homes _ fewer than 4 percent _ can
coordinate heating and air conditioning; security, lighting and
home entertainment; Internet and e-mail devices even from afar _ by
cable, computer and satellite, through telephone lines and modem
connections. Appliances like vacuum cleaners or even window shades
can be taught to monitor themselves according to internal codes. By
Julie V. Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   ZIA-SUN-SIGN (Undated) _ In a strange coda to a decade obsessed
with branding, controversy has broken out over a surprising symbol:
the Zia sun sign. The symbol _ a circle with lines radiating in
four directions _ is one of the best-known images in New Mexico. It
is on the state flag and on license plates. The 850-person Zia
pueblo, about 35 miles northwest of Albuquerque has been using the
symbol since the year 1200, tribal officials say. And now the
pueblo has asked the state of New Mexico to pay it $74 million in
compensation for employing without permission what the tribe's
elders variously call ``a sacred symbol'' and ``the symbol of our
collective identity.'' By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   AUCTION-ESTIMATES (New York) _ When the Nathaniel Appleton
silver-mounted secretary sold a year ago for $8.3 million _ after
an estimate by Sotheby's of $500,000 to $800,000 _ newcomers to the
auction game may have been shell-shocked, but the pros were not.
What the newcomers may not have known is that estimates at the
city's largest auction houses are kept deliberately, artificially
low, as a matter of strategy to bring in bidders and, at the same
time, make themselves look good. By Tracie Rozhon.

one-bedroom apartment. ``I see a bridge,'' Schulaner, a designer,
said. He meant it. Literally. For an apartment in Chelsea, he
imagined a bridge or catwalk that would slice across the
double-height living room, connecting the upper-level sleeping area
with a new adjacent home office. By Mitchel Owens.

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The guests at William R. Carver's
birthday party wound their way around displays of caulking, varnish
and anchor lines into the back room of Hopkins Marine Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Bill is as much a fixture there as the paint counter where he's
been stationed for the past 25 years. He's made a powerful
impression on a lot of people _ not the least, his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's amazing,'' says store manager Chris Janes. ``He knows
everything. He keeps track of everything in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill earned his expertise by caring for five boats of his own
(he dearly misses that 35-footer he left behind in Ocean City,
N.J.) and by guiding countless others to safe harbor in 45 years
with the Coast Guard Auxiliary.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for everyone, Carver rarely misses a day's work. ``He
doesn't call in sick,'' Janes says. ``Even if he has a doctor's
appointment, he comes in right after.'' Such dedication may sound
more admirable than remarkable, except for this: This birthday is
his 95th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to stay active,'' he says. ``I keep moving. If you sit
too much, time passes too slowly. I like to work.''
</P>
<P>
   So work he does, every weekday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. He enjoys
the company of his co-worker and customers such as yacht captain
Mitch Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here two or three times a day, and I always look for
Bill,'' Armstrong says. ``He's been to my house. He knows my
children. We talk about boats and I enjoy listening to his
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Carver has a store of sea tales, and many more. He retired as
superintendent of a Gulf Oil plant in 1968 and moved to West Palm
Beach with his wife, Mary Elizabeth. They met at a barn dance in
1921.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in and saw her standing under a light in the very the
center of the floor,'' he says. ``I knew God was trying to tell me
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth died in 1981. They'd been married 57 years. ``I
still miss her,'' he says. She's the one who nudged Bill toward the
store that has become his second home. He'd taken a post-retirement
job as a bridge tender, but he wound up on the night shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't like being alone at night, so she asked me to look
for a day job,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So one night on the way to work at the Flagler Memorial Bridge,
he strolled up to the Sixth Street store and asked the manager for
a job. ``I told him about my boats and my experience and he hired
me,'' Bill says.
</P>
<P>
   Bill was 70 years old then. He's the only one from that era
still working in the store. He continues as a matter of love, not
money. ``You don't get rich working five hours a day,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He has no plans to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor says you use it or you lose it,'' Bill says. ``I'm
going to keep using it as long as I can.''

   Gail Perry writes, looking for a recipe for the queso dip served
years ago at Luminarias restaurant. This recipe first ran in the
food section when Joanne Vachule was editor during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   LUMINARIAS CHEESE DIP
</P>
<P>
   Yields 5 cups
</P>
<P>
   1 stick melted butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup plus 1/8 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 chopped onion, diced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 green bell pepper, diced
</P>
<P>
   1 jalapeno, diced
</P>
<P>
   4 cups milk, heated
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   8-ounce jar Cheez Whiz
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Saute onion, bell pepper and jalapeno in butter for 5 minutes.
Add flour and stir with a whisk to make a roux. You will think
you've failed at this point because the mixture will clump up on
the whisk. Don't worry. Cook just until brown.
</P>
<P>
   Heat milk and add gradually to the roux mixture, stirring
constantly. Still whisking, add Cheez Whiz, Worcestershire sauce
and spices to flour/milk mixture. Cook until the mixture just
begins to boil, stirring with whisk constantly. Do not allow to
boil, or mixture will break down.

&HT;     SUIT SEEKS TO BLOCK SALE OF SAN FRANCISCO DAILY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A former candidate for mayor is suing to stop
the Hearst Corporation, owner of the San Francisco Examiner, from
buying the morning San Francisco Chronicle and merging the city's
two daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in The City,
Clint Reilly asked a judge to order Hearst and the Chronicle
Publishing Co. to abandon the reported $660 million transaction,
arguing that the deal would violate federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The sale was announced in August, and has been under Justice
Department review since then.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's lawsuit faces an uncertain future, and a labor leader
said that if the merger were blocked, hundreds of newspaper workers
might lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   By filing the lawsuit, Reilly upstaged Mayor Willie Brown, who
in his inaugural address earlier this month said he wanted to
preserve two dailies in San Francisco. City Attorney Louise Renne
and District Attorney Terence Hallinan also have said they were
considering a legal challenge to the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's doing anything,'' said Joseph M. Alioto, Reilly's
lawyer. ``I think the evidence is clear that private people are
required to enforce the antitrust laws because the officials won't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly is a veteran political consultant who finished fourth in
the mayor's race in November.
</P>
<P>
   It was his second lawsuit against Hearst. In 1993, Reilly
claimed that his ankle was broken in a conference-room altercation
with Phil Bronstein, executive editor of the Examiner. That case
was settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly describes himself as a subscriber to both newspapers and
contends in the lawsuit that a merged San Francisco daily would
harm consumers by raising the price of subscriptions and
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Merging the papers would also deprive readers of differing
editorial and reportorial voices, the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said Reilly hoped to prevent layoffs that he claimed were
inevitable if the merger occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always say that no one is going to be fired, but that
never happens,'' Alioto said. ``As soon as they do the deal, it's
`adios.'''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a court order blocking the deal, Reilly asks the
judge to order the newspapers to pay his legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both the Hearst Corporation and the Chronicle
declined to comment on the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ammiano, the president of the Board of Supervisors and
another unsuccessful candidate for mayor, said he welcomed Reilly's
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the merrier,'' he said. ``I'm on the same page. I
would like a two-newspaper town.''
</P>
<P>
   But Doug Cuthbertson, executive officer of the Northern
California Media Workers Guild, which represents union writers and
editors, said he feared ``massive job losses'' unless Hearst was
allowed to purchase the Chronicle and merge the dailies.
</P>
<P>
   Cuthbertson said that Hearst had agreed to abide by existing
union contracts and had guaranteed jobs for the entire 2,700 work
force of the two newspapers. Any other buyer is almost certain to
lay off workers, Cuthbertson said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Reilly was a disappointed office seeker who
was ``causing trouble'' with the lawsuit because he didn't like
press coverage of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of look at Reilly's action here _ after a $4 million
campaign, in which he finished fourth _ and I would hope the court
would take a look at that and throw the whole thing out,'' he said.

<P>
   For nearly a century, the Examiner and the Chronicle were
morning rivals. But in 1965, the newspapers entered into a joint
operating agreement (JOA) under which the Examiner switched to
afternoon publication. The newspapers maintain separate news staffs
and compete for stories, but the companies share printing and
business operations and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Such arrangements were later authorized by the Newspaper
Preservation Act of 1970, a federal law aimed at preserving
newspapers that would be forced to close without relief from the
expense of head-to-head economic competition.
</P>
<P>
   As the media business has changed, JOAs themselves have become
less profitable, and in the past 15 years the Justice Department
has allowed the agreements to be dissolved in a dozen cities. In
each case, the morning paper has survived while the afternoon paper
has ceased publication.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco JOA expires in 2005, but last year the owners
of Chronicle Publishing decided to sell all the company's assets.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department must approve the sale of the Chronicle to
Hearst. A decision is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has interests in publishing, broadcasting, syndication
and the Internet. It owns daily newspapers in Albany, N.Y.;
Edwardsville, Ill.; Bad Axe and Midland, Mich.; Seattle; and in the
Texas cities of Beaumont, Houston, Laredo, Midland, Plainview and
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing owns several television stations as well as
the Telegram &AMP; Gazette in Worcester, Mass., and the Bloomington
Pantagraph in Illinois.

pueblo, about 35 miles northwest of Albuquerque has been using the
symbol since the year 1200, tribal officials say. And now the
pueblo has asked the state of New Mexico to pay it $74 million in

A GOOD ROUX IS THE MOTHER OF ALL GUMBOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is time to make gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that the rich, dark blend is supposed to be reserved
for blustery winter days, but we've waited long enough. We'll go by
the calendar now if we can't rely on the temperature. It's January,
and it's time.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbo is one of those wonderful dishes in which a written recipe
is simply a crude sketch. Gumbo is a free-form food; you add what
you want and leave out what you don't.
</P>
<P>
   There are no rights or wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe one.
</P>
<P>
   It is my opinion that you must make a roux to make a good gumbo.
There are those who will argue. I've found recipes for roux-less
gumbos in Cajun cookbooks, but they've never enticed me. The taste
isn't the same.
</P>
<P>
   We have to have rules in our society, hard-and-fast rules. Roux
in the gumbo should be one of the most inviolate. The rest of life,
and the gumbo ingredients, should be left to personal
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The gumbo pot is a unifying place. Generally, meat and seafood
don't mix very well in a single dish, but the best gumbos have
combinations of oysters and shrimp and crawfish, right along with
rabbit, duck, chicken sausage and ham.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of your gumbo depends on how hard you want to work.
</P>
<P>
   When a recipe calls for chicken stock, you can use regular
canned stock and make a decent dish. Or, you can scatter poultry
bones in a roasting pan and roast them until they have a deep
caramelized sheen. Then, place the roasted bones in the canned
stock and let the pot simmer for a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   The difference will be worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   While you've got the roasting pan handy, you can deglaze with a
little stock, toss in carrots, onions and celery, and let them
roast, as well. The vegetables and juices add well to the stock.
Strain before using and you will have a deep broth with extra
taste.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you can spend about a half-hour making the roux _ a
combination of oil and flour _ which in that much time will
probably look like peanut butter. Or, you can double the time and
come up with a chocolate-colored roux that will add body and taste
to the gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   It's all up to you. Just remember: Go slow, use a wooden spoon,
and don't get any on you. Some folks say they can make a great roux
in the microwave, or in the oven, and I don't doubt them, but it's
not for me. I always use a heavy cast-iron skillet on top of the
stove, and once I start stirring the flour in the oil, I never stop
until it's ready.
</P>
<P>
   Purists say you should thicken your gumbo with fil, which is
ground sassafras leaves, but they hasten to explain that it should
be stirred into the individual bowls, not the big pot.
</P>
<P>
   Others insist that okra should be used to thicken the brew.
Everyone says you shouldn't use both.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer using neither. I control the thickness of the gumbo by
closely watching how much stock I add to the roux. To me, gumbo
should have enough body to easily coat the back of a spoon. I don't
like it too thick, stewlike, but I don't want it soupy either.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that gumbo should be served over rice.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a recipe to get you started. It is from Marcelle
Bienvenu's wonderful cookbook ``Who's Your Mama, Are You Catholic,
and Can You Make a Roux?''
</P>
<P>
   Bienvenu says her father once told her the roux should cook as
long as it took to drink two beers. Not being a beer drinker, she
adjusted the time. She cooks the roux as long as it takes to play
two record albums. You'll have to make your own adjustments for CDs
and tapes.

   CHICKEN, ANDOUILLE AND OYSTER GUMBO
</P>
<P>
   Serves 10
</P>
<P>
   3- to 4-pound hen, cut into frying pieces; salt and cayenne
pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   2 medium onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 green bell pepper, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 stalks celery, chopped
</P>
<P>
   10 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 pound andouille sausage, cut into 1/4-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   1 pint oysters with their liquor
</P>
<P>
   Season the hen well with salt and cayenne pepper. Warm chicken
broth in a sauce pan. In a heavy black iron pot, make a dark roux
by slowly browning the oil and flour, stirring constantly.
</P>
<P>
   When roux is the color of a pecan, add the onions, green bell
pepper and celery; cook until vegetables are wilted, about 10-15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add warmed chicken broth to vegetable mixture. Add chicken. Add
bay leaves and thyme. Cook over medium heat for 1 hour. Add
andouille and cook for at least another hour or until hen is
tender. Check seasonings. A few minutes before serving, add oysters
and their liquor; simmer just until oysters curl. If gumbo becomes
too thick during cooking, simply add more chicken broth or water.

<P>
   The roots of hot chocolate
</P>
<P>
   We owe our neighbors to the south a huge debt when it comes to
chocolate. It was the pre-Columbian Mayans who were the first to
cultivate chocolate in plantations in the Yucatan in 600.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztecs ground cacao beans, mixed them with chile peppers,
vanilla, corn and annatto. The resulting paste was dried in discs
and rehydrated with cold water. Montezuma is said to have consumed
50 cups of chocolate a day.
</P>
<P>
   When Cortez returned to Spain with chocolate, the Mexican
version was considered far too bitter. It was the Spanish who added
sugar and other spices as well as occasional additions of nuts or
flower waters. It was also the Spanish who invented the molinillo,
a beater that frothed the warm chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   So taken were the Spanish with the exotic bounty of their
acquisition, they kept their discovery of chocolate a secret for
nearly a century.
</P>
<P>
   When the French, in their so-civilized way, designed the
chocolate pot, they devised a hole in the lid through which their
version of the chocolate beater could be inserted.
</P>
<P>
   Abuelita and Ibarra brands of chocolate are familiar sights at
Hispanic supermarkets. The individual discs, packaged in a yellow
and red box, are a combination of sugar, cocoa nibs, almonds,
cinnamon and lecithin. Consumed cold, this combination is not far
from the chocolate of the Aztecs, though they often added chiles
and/or honey to the mix. Mexican chocolate is grainy, so if you'd
like to achieve the same flavor with higher-quality chocolate,
simply add a pinch of cinnamon to processed cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Which ready-made mix makes a great stir?
</P>
<P>
   Land O' Lakes individual packets of dry milk, cocoa, sugar and
flavorings, such as raspberry, cinnamon and mocha, are designed to
be dissolved in hot water. About 69 cents each at most
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Hershey's Goodnight Kisses Hot Cocoa Mix is four packets of
cocoa that include miniature versions of the company's trademark
chocolate candies, which melt into the hot water or hot milk used
to make the drink. About $1.49 at most grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Godiva Dark Chocolate Truffle Cocoa is designed to pair with hot
milk _ no water for this aristocrat. Also available in milk
chocolate flavor. A package of four individual packets is $5 at
Godiva shops and Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Ghirardelli Double Chocolate is one of the company's five
varieties that combine chocolate, cocoa and sugar with flavoring.
Package directions recommend using milk, not water, with the mix.
$4.49 for a 20-serving tin at most supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Nestle Carnation Fat Free with Marshmallows is everything moms
and dads want. It's easy, it's quick and it includes the mandatory
floating bits of white spun sugar. Although it's not advertised as
such, this brand is also low in sugar. Eight packets are $2.59 at
most supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Nestle NesQuik _ new name but the same flavor we remember from
childhood. A plastic resealable canister (we like this) of 19
servings is $2.39.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss Miss No Sugar Added is made with Splenda sweetener. Mixed
with hot water, each serving yields only 6 grams of sugar instead
of the 17 to 22 grams of most other brands. $2.29 at most
supermarkets.

<P>
   Grown-ups and college English majors have coffee. The cosmic and
organic crowd has tea. But what about the rest of us? We're only
adults when the boss is watching, and we think ``cosmic'' was a TV
show by Carl Sagan.
</P>
<P>
   Our comfort lies in hot chocolate, the first warm drink that
most of us sample as children. Surely this most-comforting of
cold-weather drinks deserves its day in the sun. Topped with
bobbing miniature marshmallows, or crowned with a cloud of
marshmallow creme, hot cocoa gives the face a mustache and the
tummy a glow.
</P>
<P>
   It can be elegant, served in porcelain chocolate cups
accompanied by a crystal bowl of whipped cream, waving its excess
in peaks for all to see. Or it can be proletarian: Pour it into a
thick-walled institutional beaker, add some declasse marshmallows,
and curl up with the remote and Lifetime for Women.

SITES TRACK TRUMPETER SWAN'S COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(af) 
 By MICHAEL C. POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since you're already rereading ``Stuart Little,'' do yourself a
favor and reread another E.B. White masterpiece, ``The Trumpet of
the Swan'' (Harper &AMP; Row, 1970).
</P>
<P>
   White's perfect sentences are alive and well. (``Almost
everything delights a chickadee.'') And so, thankfully, are
trumpeter swans, the largest waterfowl in North America and one of
conservation's great success stories.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1930s, when the count had dropped to about 70 in
the United States, trumpeter swans were almost as rare as whooping
cranes because they had been hunted for food and fashion (the
feathers for hats, the skins for powder puffs). Cooperation between
the United States and Canada helped save the swan.
</P>
<P>
   Previously unknown remnant populations were discovered in Alaska
and northwestern Canada. Habitat protection and restrictions on
hunting and on poisonous lead shot have brought trumpeters back
from the edge of extinction to a Rocky Mountain population of more
than 2,500 and an Alaska-Pacific Coast population of perhaps
15,000, according to the Trumpeter Swan Society,
www.taiga.net/swans/mission.html.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit society, founded in 1968, is based in Maple Plain,
Minn., and publishes two newsletters, Trumpetings (which appears
online) and North American Swans. Its site has information on the
history, diet and identification of the swans, which have a
wingspan of more than seven feet and a height of about four feet.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has a link to a thorough overview of the swans
from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, on an Adobe
Acrobat file, at www.taiga.net/swans/g3647.pdf. The overview, as
well as other papers available through the society, will help a
reader distinguish the trumpeter swan from its cousin, the tundra
swan (formerly known as the whistling swan).
</P>
<P>
   It is sometimes hard to do if you cannot hear them. If you have
Real Player, you can hear a trumpeter swan at
www.wpt.org/getreal!/300/swans/swans.htm.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller but active trumpeter organization is the Trumpeter
Swan Sentinel Society, based in Courtenay, British Columbia
(www.vquest.com/swan). The society has an annual festival in
February to mark the nearby wintering of some 2,000 trumpeters in
the Comox Valley on Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   For New Yorkers and nearby residents, the local swans are
probably mute swans. They were introduced from Europe to grace the
ponds of the wealthy and soon muscled into Northeastern coastal
regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mute swans are not highly regarded by most bird
conservationists,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Wells, director of bird
conservation for the National Audubon Society of New York State.
``They're such big birds, they're very capable of moving other
birds out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mute swans have orange bills and hold their necks in an S-curve;
trumpeter swans have black bills and straighter necks. Mute swans
are occasionally considered a pest, but a check with New York and
federal health authorities turned up no reports of diseases
transmitted by them.
</P>
<P>
   Wells is stationed at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology,
which, along with the Audubon Society, cosponsors the BirdSource
program (birdsource.cornell.edu). BirdSource has online maps of a
huge number of species, by territory, abundance and sightings
locations, from the early 1900s to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Trumpeter swans have been reintroduced to several sites in the
Midwest and central Canada, and the Trumpeter Swan Society has
accounts of those efforts. Wildlife managers would like to see them
farther east, wild and free, but there is a problem: since Eastern
trumpeter populations became extinct, there have been no adult
birds to show cygnets the flyway.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, scientists discovered that swans will follow an
ultralight airplane. (The same thing has been tried on Canada geese
and whooping cranes.)
</P>
<P>
   An account of one such program is at
www3.sympatico.ca/trumpeter.swan. It traces the successful 1997-98
effort to condition a group of trumpeters to migrate 700 to 800
miles with an ultralight from Ontario to a refuge in southern
Indiana. Wayne Bezner Kerr, project leader of the nonprofit
Migratory Bird Research Group in Guelph, Ontario, wrote by e-mail
that the swans returned to Sudbury, Ontario, last year unassisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``More spectacularly,'' he wrote, ``they returned after being on
their own for at least two months'' and without any reports of
having approached humans for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last month we had some sightings that suggested the birds had
moved south again,'' he wrote. If he can get the financing, he
hopes to establish 30 cygnets taken from Alaska on a migration
route between upper New York state and the Atlantic coast near
Chesapeake Bay.

<P>
   Anyone who has sought to avoid mouse-inflicted wrist pain has
probably heard some version of the following: Move the mouse closer
to your body, avoid clutching the mouse when you`re not actually
using it, and in extreme circumstances avoid using the contraption
altogether. New research from Cornell University suggests another
option: Try a bigger mouse.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted last summer by Alan Hedge, a Cornell professor
of ergonomics, compared how people responded in two-minute sessions
to a basic Microsoft mouse with the familiar raised bulge that fits
under the palm and a lesser-known variant called the Whale.
</P>
<P>
   The Whale mouse is a $99 device developed by a company called
Humanscale in New York and, befitting its name, is at least an inch
longer than the Microsoft mouse and can be extended up to another
inch for larger hands. The Whale is designed to keep fingers flat
and prevent the hand from curling around it.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge said he chose the Whale because it was the largest mouse
on the market, and he wanted to find out if a larger mouse might
keep people from extending their wrist beyond a neutral, relatively
flat position.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Hedge found, was yes. He and two graduate students,
Timothy Muss and Marisol Barrero, analyzed the wrist movements of
12 men and 12 women. Each wore sensors to track wrist extension
while scrolling and clicking. A wrist extension, in ergonomic
parlance, is the position of the wrist when the hand is tilted
upward while the lower arm is parallel to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors believe that carpal tunnel syndrome _ caused by a
pinched nerve and associated with tingling in the fingers _ is
exacerbated when the wrist is continually moved out of its neutral
position. ``You have a problem,'' Hedge said, ``when the extension
angle goes beyond 15 to 20 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the study who used the larger mouse maintained an
acceptable wrist angle of less than 15.5 degrees twice as often as
with the smaller one. The larger mouse, Hedge said, required arm
movement rather than just hand movement.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge's study is not the final word on the carpal tunnel
problem. A report is available on the Cornell University Web site
at ergo.human.cornell.edu/CUEHnews.html, but the study has not been
published in a research journal or subjected to peer review. Many
ergonomics experts expressed reservations that such a small study
could shed light on an ailment that is associated with conflicting
and sometimes controversial reports of cures.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Stephen Burastero, who runs an ergonomics
research program at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, in
Livermore, Calif., noted that wrist angle is only one factor
related to carpal tunnel syndrome. ``Force, muscle activity and
repetition also play a role,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Howard M. Sandler, of Melville, N.Y., who has worked on
occupational safety studies for the federal government and private
organizations, warned against putting too much stock in how
products are designed and not enough in how people actually use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge considers his study a first step. ``We are not claiming
this is a solution to carpal tunnel,'' he said. ``But I think we've
established the principle that mouse design is important and that
is something we should start looking at it.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT WAGES DEFENSIVE STRUGGLE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. found itself Wednesday waging a
series of defensive battles driven by its antitrust problems,
potential fallout from high-tech mega-mergers and its waning power
to set industry standards.
</P>
<P>
   How the software giant copes with these multiple challenges will
have bear heavily on its prospects well into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   One option _ breaking up the world's most valued corporation _
could end up benefiting investors, as did the breakup of the
telephone monopoly a generation ago. Despite a report in USA Today
that government lawyers favor such a step, such a split is not seen
as a viable solution by Justice Department trust-busters.
</P>
<P>
   The account is ``inaccurate in several important respects, and
it does not accurately represent our views,'' a spokeswoman for the
antitrust division of the Department of Justice said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said that while it was
premature to discuss any settlement in the antitrust case, no basis
exists for any such ``outrageous remedy'' as a breakup. ``We
believe Microsoft and our innovations and products have been a boon
for consumers, for the personal computer industry and for the
high-tech industry in general,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, top Microsoft executives have cast a wary eye on
Monday's merger announcement by America Online Inc. and Time
Warner. That huge combination could imperil Microsoft's own bid to
become a key player in the converging entertainment and media
fields, chiefly by having its Windows CE software emerge as the de
facto standard on the next generation of interactive TV-cable
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, other technology giants are battling Microsoft in
their bid to gain a major share of the rapidly emerging wireless
Internet market. Earlier this week, both IBM and Oracle rolled out
separate deals to develop wireless access to cyberspace that would
effectively turn mobile phones into versatile hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is committed to its own wireless data service, dubbed
MSN Mobile 2.0. Scheduled for general release in the spring, it
promises to offer users ``tight integration'' with such other
Microsoft products as MSN Hotmail, MSN MoneyCentral, Expedia,
MSNBC, and MSN Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's combination, with the European giant Vodafone Airtouch,
came only days after it said it would make the Linux operating
system a centerpiece of its hardware strategy, as an alternative to
Microsoft's dominant Windows technology.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the power of Windows, one respected research firm,
International Data Corp., has concluded that Microsoft should be
broken up as a remedy in the federal antitrust lawsuit, with
Windows emerging as a separate corporate entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best outcome for consumers, for the industry and for
Microsoft is for the company to break itself up along functional
product lines,'' the new the 10-page analysis concluded.
``Microsoft would then gain access to more markets and repair its
reputation,'' it argued.
</P>
<P>
   While the researchers contend the best remedy would be to break
up Microsoft, they also say that such a move is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Microsoft prefers business as usual,'' the report
said. ``It will settle the suit only if it can do so without
jeopardizing its ability to build upon its dominant position on the
desktop to gain dominance in server operating environments.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the clock continues to run for a final ruling
from U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. It could be
averted if a deal is struck in Chicago through the efforts of
Richard Posner, chief judge of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals,
who seeks to broker a deal at Jackson's behest.
</P>
<P>
   With those close to the case are reluctant to discuss the
specifics, much of the discussion is being prompted by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most sensitive matters is the on-going rift between
the Justice Department and several key state attorneys general who
are partners in the case. Nevertheless, they are yoked together
legally.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that Microsoft would settle on the federal level
and continue to litigate with the states, who originally had
brought a wider lawsuit. It is equally unlikely that Jackson would
agree to sever twin complaints after combining them.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Microsoft lawyers are set to file with Jackson their
response to the government's proposed findings of law in the case.
That will be followed by a government reply, due the following
Tuesday, and a final Microsoft filing a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Final oral arguments are scheduled for Feb. 22.

   IBM's combination, with the European giant Vodafone Airtouch,
came only days after it said it would make the Linux operating
system a centerpiece of its hardware strategy, as an alternative to
Microsoft's dominant Windows technology.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the power of Windows, one respected research firm,
International Data Corp., has concluded that Microsoft should be
broken up as a remedy in the federal antitrust lawsuit, with
Windows emerging as a separate corporate entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best outcome for consumers, for the industry and for
Microsoft is for the company to break itself up along functional
product lines,'' the new the 10-page analysis concluded.
``Microsoft would then gain access to more markets and repair its
reputation,'' it argued.
</P>
<P>
   While the researchers contend the best remedy would be to break
up Microsoft, they also say that such a move is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Microsoft prefers business as usual,'' the report
said. ``It will settle the suit only if it can do so without
jeopardizing its ability to build upon its dominant position on the
desktop to gain dominance in server operating environments.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the clock continues to run for a final ruling
from U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. It could be
averted if a deal is struck in Chicago through the efforts of
Richard Posner, chief judge of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals,
who seeks to broker a deal at Jackson's behest.
</P>
<P>
   With those close to the case are reluctant to discuss the
specifics, much of the discussion is being prompted by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most sensitive matters is the on-going rift between
the Justice Department and several key state attorneys general who
are partners in the case. Nevertheless, they are yoked together
legally.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that Microsoft would settle on the federal level
and continue to litigate with the states, who originally had
brought a wider lawsuit. It is equally unlikely that Jackson would
agree to sever twin complaints after combining them.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Microsoft lawyers are set to file with Jackson their
response to the government's proposed findings of law in the case.
That will be followed by a government reply, due the following
Tuesday, and a final Microsoft filing a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Final oral arguments are scheduled for Feb. 22.

   ``The Essential Clive Barker''
</P>
<P>
   by Clive Barker
</P>
<P>
   Collected fiction
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, $27.50
</P>
<P>
   I can scarcely approach a Clive Barker yarn these days without
cringing in the dreadful anticipation that Something Wonderful Is
About To Happen. Wonderful, not spine-shivering. 'Twasn't always
thus, and in fact there was a splendid time when any Barker book
might have packed a written guarantee to do the reader irreparable,
if worthwhile, harm.
</P>
<P>
   That was longer ago than I care to reckon, back in the day when
a well-intentioned Stephen King could declare, ``I have seen the
future of horror, and it is Clive Barker,'' and mean every word of
it. Thus did King make life immeasurably easier for the
book-mongers who faced the daunting task of selling Barker, a
highfalutin Englishman who occupied a precarious ledge in the
history of hair-raising literature. With one foot planted squarely
in the grave of Edgar Allan Poe and the other on the slick new
surface of splatterpunk storytelling, Barker seemed to offer
extravagant promise _ and often made good on that promise, on the
spot. His work was as righteous as it was irrepressible _ and
hence, in a word, essential. It was at once a literature of ideas
and a literature of sensations, forcing those ill-matched values
into uneasily close quarters as a means of giving the reader a
heady mixture of shock value and provocative intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Barker's chosen idiom, the horror yarn, hadn't seen such
wide-awake ferocity since the Depression-era heyday of H.P.
Lovecraft and Hugh B. Cave. All during this past lapsed decade,
unfortunately, Barker has moved from Grand Guignol to epic-scale
``dark fantasy,'' a literary realm that might more honestly be
called ``horror lite.'' Barker prefers the highfalutin term
``fantastique,'' which is baloney any way you slice it. Tracking
his progress in this realm is rather like observing filmmaker James
Cameron move from the ragged-but-right terrors of ``Piranha 2: The
Spawning'' (1982) and ``The Terminator'' (1984) to the Something
Wonderful mock-horrors of ``The Abyss'' (1989) and, finally, to the
monument to insipidity that is ``Titanic'' (1997). (Barker, of
course, has pursued a parallel moviemaking career, with severely
mixed but often intriguing results. With the exception of his
crucial behind-the-scenes involvement on Bill Condon's ``Gods &AMP;
Monsters'' (1998), Barker has yet to top his work on the
``Hellraiser'' series' earliest pictures of 1987-88.)
</P>
<P>
   The Barker print opus of the moment is ``The Essential Clive
Barker,'' a regular Hungry Man TV dinner of a book _ more filling
than satisfying, and burdened with a culturally intimidating title
that values the presumptuous over the provocative. Hey! If I'm a
Serious Reader of Clive Barker, and this book has ``Essential''
written all over it, then how can I live without it?
</P>
<P>
   The first-blush reaction is to mistake ``The Essential C.B.''
for some definitive collection of the seminal ``Books of Blood,''
those collections whose outlandish yarns first announced Barker's
premature pre-eminence. But no: More a 570-page Cliff's Notes than
any fitting retrospective, the volume comprises 70-some odd
excerpts and only a scant clutch of short stories that are
available elsewhere. These are all tidily compartmentalized, like a
frozen dinner, into subsets with such precious designations as
``Doorways'' and ``Lives'' and ``Journeys'' and ``Visions and
Dreams.'' Some of these bits and pieces are self-contained and
effective enough, in their McNugget-ized way. Others seem
arbitrarily yanked from a sturdier context, the roots severed in
the process. The scraps of self-conscious fantastique, so to speak,
are at least mercifully brief. The short stories, including the
Kafkaesque political terrors of ``In the Hills, the Cities,'' are
fine _ but even these work better by far in their original
settings, surrounded by kindred audacious pieces, all written
before Clive Barker learned the greater importance of being Clive
Barker.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas filmmaker Tom Rainone, an occasional colleague of
Barker's in the horror-picture racket, once cobbled together a
feature-length presentation from nothing but short
coming-attractions trailers, one after the other, in bludgeoning
rapid-fire order. Now, a trailer can be a keen thing to watch,
especially for viewers with short attention spans, but even a
gee-whiz mentality will balk at watching more than half a dozen
trailers in unrelieved sequence. The blasted things will spoil your
appetite for the main feature, and they contain nothing of
satisfying dramatic substance to compensate for the intrusion.
``The Essential Clive Barker'' is a literary equivalent of
Rainone's pageant of short commercials-for-movies, giving the
reader only a teasing hint of the expected terrors, unexpected
delights and gag-reflex flights of Forced Wonderfulness that these
excerpts represent.
</P>
<P>
   The more genuinely essential Clive Barker, just in case the
point wants hammering, is that small set of ``Books of Blood,''
where gods and monsters (no metaphorical baggage intended) roam at
large and the sense of Edgar Allan Poe animates the nihilistic
sensibilities of the punk movement. Better a yarn you can sink your
teeth into, lest it sink its teeth into you first, than any volume
of Something Wonderful excursions along the Dream Sea of Quiddity
and the Dominions of Imajica.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate of deterioration, I should scarcely be surprised to
find Barker showing up next with a volume of ``Chicken Soup for the
(Lost) Soul.'' &QL;

&HT;     49ERS IN SEARCH OF SOMEONE TO BLAME FOR POOR SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAY RATTO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN Francisco _ The news from the 49ers was as refreshing as it
was pleasing. The equipment guys are not being blamed for 1999, or
regarded as retardants to progress in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else? As ever, still guilty until proven innocent, with
no resolution in sight _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   The latest development in the 49ers' angst-o-rama came Monday
when Bill Walsh publicly snarled at the platoon of amateur jewelers
measuring his wrist for a retirement watch.
</P>
<P>
   He covered everything from ignorance to lack of respect to age
discrimination, and came very close to just dropping a blanket
``Shut your cakeholes!'' on the assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he may be saving that for his next press conference.
This
</P>
<P>
   is, after all, a very resourceful fellow when he puts his skull
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, though, he did something bad, which puts him in not
very exclusive company.
</P>
<P>
   Assembling all the 49ers post-mortems, we discover that the
following people have helped blow up the ammo dump: Eddie DeBartolo
Jr., Denise DeBartolo York, John York, Terry Donahue, Carmen
Policy, Dwight Clark, Vinny Cerrato, Paul Tagliabue, George
Seifert, Steve Mariucci, Steve Young, Ty Detmer, Jim Druckenmiller,
Jerry Rice, Terrell Owens, J.J. Stokes, Brent Jones, Greg Clark,
Ken Norton, Tim McDonald, Darnell Walker, Charles Haley, Deion
Sanders, ignorant writers, know-nothing TV types, oatmeal-headed
radio personalities, crypto-psychotic fans.
</P>
<P>
   And because he should never be left out of any Bay Area football
discussion, Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has his or her favorites.
</P>
<P>
   The players get it because they're all making too much money for
the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Policy/Clark/Cerrato get it for blowing too much money on old
guys and drafting lousy young ones.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie The Younger gets it for trying to outsmart a Louisiana
politician. Denise gets it for being related to Eddie, and John
gets it for being related to Denise. Mariucci gets it for being the
coach, Walsh gets it for being the general manager, and Donahue
gets it because of the time-honored legal concept of guilt by
association.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the media get it for reporting that the 49ers
finished 4-12 instead of staying with more popular figures like
12-4 and 13-3.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's been able, though, to provide the single smoking
bazooka with the set of fingerprints that solves the crime.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the way everyone could agree that Joe Thomas was the
source of all evil in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   This everyone-did-it deal, though, isn't working out for
anybody. Too
</P>
<P>
   much confusion, too much ambiguity. We need a villain. Or two.
Or in this case, everyone.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Whack everybody. The works. Whether they're named
York or Young, Walsh or Walker, Mariucci or McDonald. Every one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   They all did it (whatever ``it'' happens to be), so they all
have to go _ run off the land like diseased sheep in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about building for the future. This is about the
clarity of the past, which most 49ers understand far too readily.
The franchise was horrible, then it was great, with none of that
messy intermediate stage.
</P>
<P>
   Villains, then heroes. Very linear. Very easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   This chemical spill, on the other hand, is anything but linear.
There's more blame than potholes on the freeway on-ramps, more
screwups than Willie Brown has hat blockers.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the interest of keeping it simple for everyone, we urge
complete administrative annihilation. Anyone who drew a payroll
check from the team last week gets a severance check this week, and
a decorative Gold Rush 2000 calendar.
</P>
<P>
   You know, just to be fair, until someone stands up and says,
``I'm the one. I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this won't help the 49ers any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   No owner, no coach, no front office, no players _ that's a lot
to overcome, no matter how many old trophies sit a'moldering in the
lobby. This is precisely the sort of thing that made the Cincinnati
Bengals what they are today.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, nobody has come up with a specific bright-eyed
replacement for any of the aforementioned guilty. Oh, Matt Millen's
name has been mentioned as a potential replacement for Walsh, but
he spends his football seasons talking on the radio next to Howard
David, and if you think that doesn't rust your brain _ man, you
still believe in the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the plot
lines on ``Jerry Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we're still in the blame-delegation stage, and if you
can't be specific, you may as well be comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   So congratulations to the equipment staff for a sensational
year, and thanks for your service to everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   And first dibs on the downstairs Coke machine.

   ``Stephen F. Austin: Empresario of Texas''
</P>
<P>
   by Gregg Cantrell
</P>
<P>
   Biography
</P>
<P>
   Yale University Press, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   Philatelists treasure a 1936 Texas Centennial commemorative
stamp containing portraits of Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston.
They are the twin icons of Texas history, but the stature of one is
national, whereas the other is known only by Texans and then often
too vaguely. Adult latecomers to the Lone Star State, lacking
elementary-school orientation to Texas history, may wonder why this
Stephen Austin fellow has a great city, a university and so many
streets named for him, and why he's called the ``Father of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Cantrell doesn't honor that title. His biography of the
state's strategic colonizer is subtitled ``Empresario of Texas,''
and it's evident from the start that Cantrell intends to
demythologize his subject. The author in his introduction
acknowledges as ``classic'' the only full-length biography of
Austin _ Eugene Barker's ``The Life of Stephen F. Austin,''
published almost 75 years ago _ and then downgrades it as
hagiography and insinuates an aim to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   This he surely has done. ``Exhaustively researched'' has become
a reviewer's cliche, but Cantrell has gone beyond exhaustion into
obsession for every important fact and trivial minutiae of his
subject's life and times.
</P>
<P>
   Cantrell writes clearly and well, if unexcitingly. He does
endeavor to pump more drama into a tale not deficient of it, with
such teasing pronouncements as: ``Throughout his life Stephen F.
Austin would chafe under this burden, which at times seemed
impossibly heavy. It would often bring him hardship and
frustration, and he could never escape it.''
</P>
<P>
   The historical narrative precedes the cradle. The author rather
laboriously fills in his subject's family background, with expected
substantial attention to Moses Austin, Stephen's quixotic,
ever-speculating father who had a get-rich-quick scheme to colonize
Mexican Texas with emigrants from the young United States.
</P>
<P>
   This mission was passed on to his son, and although Stephen was
reluctant, he was emotionally mortgaged (somewhat mysteriously) to
his father's will and whims. After Moses' death, the father's dream
became Stephen's obsession. He does not appear to have enjoyed the
quest or, indeed, to have enjoyed much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Fuller Austin, a handsome fellow who liked dancing with
attractive women but granted them little time and never married,
must have had some charm. The author grants him that, but it seldom
shows for the reader. Cantrell, though, makes Austin interesting in
his essential dullness.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is incomparably patient, and he perseveres against those
well-known overwhelming odds. Yet he seems unable to exult in any
triumph, so there's no surprise when, after Texas has gained its
independence, Austin loses the presidency to the charismatic
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Austin and Houston are not friends and bear their mutual respect
somewhat guardedly. After Houston appoints Austin his secretary of
state, the latter sets in motion the move for annexation to the
United States shortly before his
</P>
<P>
   death at age 43 and nine years before annexation becomes a fact.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, before 1836 when it all happened _ the Alamo, San
Jacinto, independence, a new government _ the familiar story of
Texas history is reprised in all its particulars, perhaps more
coherently than ever before. Through the progression from the
initial transplanting of 300 Anglo families in Mexican Texas in
1821 to the birth of the short-lived republic 15 years later, the
reader accrues admiration for Stephen F. Austin, even a sense of
wonder about him.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's true gift undoubtedly was diplomacy. His was not the
only Texas colonization effort, and he viewed others such as
Sterling Robertson's as rivals. Yet it seems that Austin alone had
faculties for dealing first with the Spanish government of Mexico,
then with the new government during a transition awkward for the
colonists as Mexico acquired its own independence, and ultimately
with Texans whose thirst for independence he came to share.
</P>
<P>
   The pageant of early Texas history has been imparted more
thrillingly by T.R. Fehrenbach and other chroniclers, but
Cantrell's contribution can hardly be faulted as historical
biography. One may wonder, though, if the author is fully aware of
how keenly his narrative illuminates the undoubted greatness of its
subject.
</P>
<P>
   So is, or is not, Stephen F. Austin justifiably the ``Father of
Texas''? More so, we'll say, than any other possible candidate for
a title so awesome.

   TURKEY-OCALAN (ANKARA) _ The Turkish government on Wednesday
decided to put a hold on the death sentence of the Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan until a European court can review it. The
Ecevit government agreed to wait for the European Court of Human
Rights to review Ocalan's appeal before sending it to Turkey's
parliament for approval. Ecevit had warned that failing to comply
with the European court's request that the sentence be delayed
pending appeal would seriously damage Turkey's recently improved
relations with the European Union. (Summary from wires.) By Stephen

   BRITAIN-GAYS-MILITARY (London) _ Left with no other choice after
a sweeping ruling by a European court last fall, the British
government announced Wednesday that it would no longer bar openly
gay men and women from serving in the military. The new policy,
which at a stroke ends Britain's decades-old practice of subjecting
gay men and women in the military to intrusive personal
investigations and dishonorable discharges, brings Britain into
line with most other NATO countries, including France, Canada and
Germany, all of which allow openly gay men and lesbians to serve in
armed forces. By Sarah Lyall.

justify the police in conducting a stop-and-frisk search. Although
all nine justices agreed with that broadly stated view, the court
split 5 to 4 on how to apply it to the facts of a Chicago case in

   TERROR-U.S. (Burlington, Vt.) _ Prosecutors said Wednesday that
a Canadian woman arrested at a remote Vermont border crossing last
month telephoned associates of an Algerian man arrested in

month on charges that he was involved in a possible bomb plot in

   AOL-INVESTORS (Undated) _ The blockbuster America Online-Time
Warner merger hit more air pockets Wednesday as shares in both
companies plunged for the second straight day. America Online has
now fallen nearly 20 percent since the deal was announced, costing
AOL shareholders more than $30 billion. Investors on both sides
expressed concerns, with AOL shareholders worried that the merger
will slow the torrid growth of their company, while owners of Time
Warner stock complained that they were receiving less than half of
the combined company even though Time Warner has far more revenue
and cash flow than AOL. Nevertheless, both companies expressed
confidence that the deal would go forward, and some important
shareholders, including Janus Capital, which will likely be the
largest owner of the combined company, said the merger had their
full support. By Alex Berenson.

   LYNCHING-EXHIBIT (New York) _ The photographs that go on view
Friday at a Manhattan gallery may never fit comfortably into the
history of art, or for that matter, of photography. This is because
they are so deeply embedded in the history of hatred, specifically
the American history of hatred, which is often a matter of race.
They manifest this hatred shockingly, remorselessly, tragically.
The 60 photographs are of American lynchings that took place
between 1883 and 1960, mostly but not always in the South. Most of
them were taken by professional photographers immediately or a
short while after the crime, sometimes during. All but a few of the
victims were African-American men and women. By Roberta Smith.

<P>
   Coaxing the sleek jet's airspeed down to 134 knots for landing,
I eased the yoke forward and waited. Suddenly, breaking out of
thick, menacing clouds at 200 feet, the brash but welcome lead-in
lights of Runway 01 at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington
pointed home. The sweet chirp of tires touching down followed, and
another flight _ and another ordinary night _ was logged.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary for professional pilots perhaps, but for me, a private
pilot still learning in single-engine planes and a veteran of
desktop flight-simulation programs, it was a flight that changed
forever my notion of flying. I was playing the ultimate video game,
the Boeing 757 simulator at United Airlines' high-flight center in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   United began offering practice time at the center in the fall of
1996, in part to help defray the cost of its fleet of 30 very
expensive simulators, which are used by flight crews from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not intend to offer a training course for
aspiring professionals. You do not have to have a pilot's license,
or even a driver's license, to use the simulator, just be ``an
able-bodied adult and at least 18 years old,'' according to a
United brochure.
</P>
<P>
   You also have to be able to pay the hefty price, ranging from
$950 for an hour on an Airbus A320 simulator to $1,550 for the
Boeing 777. (There are more expensive packages available for up to
two hours in the simulator.)
</P>
<P>
   The experience is probably the closest that amateur pilots like
me will get to flying ``the big iron,'' large, multi-engine
passenger jets. These sophisticated simulators duplicate more than
150 irregular and emergency procedures for things like wind shear
and snow, engine failures and landing gear collapses. Probably the
only part of flight the simulator cannot replicate is crashing.
When you crash a simulator _ and that happens quite often _ the
screen simply turns red.
</P>
<P>
   Susan M. Davis, the owner of a California printing business,
bought time in the 747 simulator for her 76-year-old father,
Richard, as a gift. He had been a P-51 fighter pilot during the
Second World War. Ms. Davis doesn't even fly on a home PC. ``He
flew, he landed,'' she said when their flights were over. ``I
crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   From the minute I set foot on the metal bridge crossing a
20-feet-wide divide between ``land'' and a large, white, windowless
box mounted on a huge, six-axis shaker platform housing the
simulator, something inside my pilot's brain said, ``This is
real.'' And once inside the cockpit with the door shut, I realized,
of course, that it was a real cockpit, right down to the two seats
that ride on L-shaped floor rails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience is so real,'' said Second Officer Dan
Tiedemann, a junior pilot with United. ``I've seen people in
multiple emergency situations act as if they'd forgotten it's a
simulator, it's so real.'' And, he added with a touch of macabre
humor, ``the instructor's in the back, laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   For my flight, I took along my own co-pilot, Andy Smith, a
friend who is also a private pilot. We decided to start from Runway
01, the principal north-south runway at Reagan Airport to work on
our takeoff and landing skills. The instructor for our flight was
John Ackerman, 31, who had previously flown Harrier jets in the
Marines. (Remember the plane Arnold Schwarzenegger flew in the
movie ``True Lies''?) Ackerman now trains pilots in Boeing's 757
and 767 models.
</P>
<P>
   I was co-pilot first and John, standing behind the pilot's
chair, patiently took me through the drill. I turned a switch on
the ceiling console and moved a toggle switch forward on the main
conson listened as the turbine spooled and set the fuel
valve to ``on.'' With that, I had just started two of the most
powerful jet engines made.
</P>
<P>
   Andy then took his turn at the controls, steering the plane
along the blue taxiway lights as we prepared to take off. The
simulator was set for nighttime, a more challenging environment
that sharply increased our sense of flying a real 757. ``Taxi into
position and hold,'' came the recorded instructions from tower.
</P>
<P>
   John had us line up, then reviewed takeoff procedures, using the
same small notebook that flight crews use for checklists. Flaps
were set with a lever on my side, and John told Andy what air
speeds to look for: ``In our configuration, V1 is 137 knots and
we'll rotate the nose at 140 knots. As we climb to 3,000 feet, our
initial clearance, flaps will be retracted at 188 knots and then
we'll trim for cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was my turn to try a takeoff, there was a pleasant
surprise in store. I had always wondered how the big planes were
steered on the ground. The Cessna Skyhawk I fly principally uses a
combination of power and a rudder controlled by the pilot's feet.
It prepared me well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're holding the center line better than some of my
students,'' he said, as the aircraft rumbled along at 80 knots.
</P>
<P>
   After a steep ascent, we turned the plane on course to the
northwest, the Washington Monument to our right and P-56, the
prohibited area around the White House, looming ahead. Staying
clear of Dulles Airport's airspace to the west, we began a circling
turn.
</P>
<P>
   From a point south of Mount Vernon, George Washington's home on
the Potomac River, we were guided by John, acting as the tower,
into an instrument landing on Runway 01, watching our speed and
position on the screen of the electronic flight director.
</P>
<P>
   While flying programs like Flight Simulator cannot compare with
the sensation of sitting inside the United cockpit, the view of the
ground from the simulator does match up. The program's ability to
mimic the pitch and yaw of actual flight is uncanny, so real that
when we braved an approach to San Francisco International Airport
on the United simulator, it all felt very familiar. ``Hey,'' I said
to Andy, ``we've done this before.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is where the comparison to video games ended. For me,
gone now are the innocent, if raucous, joys of arcade fighter
games. They chew up too many quarters and provide too few thrills.
And Flight Simulator, steady friend to thousands of desktop Walter
Mittys: you're good but a little too tame. A trip inside the United
simulator has ruined those simple pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   The evening flight home from Denver just did not seem the same.
Sitting in my seat, as the streetlights and buildings passed below,
I knew we were heading for Runway 36 at Dulles. But in my mind, I
was coaxing the sleek jet down to 134 knots and pushing the yoke.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Christmas party at the new Manhattan town house
of Robert Soros and his wife, Melissa Schiff-Soros, was in full
swing. As adults sipped Champagne in the candle-lit parlor,
children raced upstairs to experience the electronic high life in
its latest flowering: a home theater screening of the Disney
classic ``Peter Pan.''
</P>
<P>
   The large screen descended from the ceiling on cue and with an
extraterrestrial hum, but the house lights refused to dim _ despite
a horde of caterers stabbing frantically at a panel of small
buttons on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   As bright spots flashed and faded overhead, Soros, an investment
manager and philanthropist, bent prayerfully over a control panel,
playing its glowing touch-screen like a pipe organ as he tried to
raise the volume on Tinkerbell. He had given up when the sound
suddenly surged to Imax level. Children screeched _ and Soros sank
to his knees for some more screen adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give anything to go back to good old toggle
switches,'' his wife, a filmmaker, said later, sighing at the
memory.
</P>
<P>
   On their own living room wall in upstate New York, John Markus,
a screenwriter and television producer, and his wife, Ardith
Truhan, an artist, have 14 buttons that control lighting; 22
buttons for the stereo and CD; and four buttons for the window
shades. Another panel operates the DVD, satellite service and laser
discs in their home theater system. Six lines accommodate the
couple's telephones, fax machines and modems. By phoning the
control ``brain,'' he can regulate every device even from the
middle of studio set in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm tempted to raise the bedroom blinds from the
city just to scare my wife when she's there alone,'' Markus said.
``But I'm worried that if I make the wrong command, I might shut
down the entire house.''
</P>
<P>
   In high-end homes around the country _ think of them as test
labs with decor _ advancing technology is outpacing people's
ability to deploy it.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1990s brought widespread consumer acceptance of in-home
theater, wireless communications, home PCs and smart appliances,
the new decade brings promise _ or threat _ of ``convergence,'' the
ultimate integration of everything in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7.5 million American homes _ about 7 percent _ are
currently equipped with a degree of computer networking that
automates security, entertainment and lighting, mechanical systems
and climate control, a leap from less than 2 million homes in 1995,
said Todd Thibodeaux, vice president of market research at the
Consumer Electronics Association in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The most advanced homes _ 3 percent to 4 percent, according to
the National Association of Home Builders _ can coordinate heating
and air conditioning, security, lighting and home entertainment,
Internet and e-mail even from afar, by cable, computer and
satellite, through telephone lines and modem connections.
Appliances like window shades or even vacuum cleaners can be taught
to monitor themselves according to internal codes.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a houseful of gizmos designed to be more helpful than
a geisha-in-training and options as varied and complex as the
Kamasutra's, homeowners are vacillating between childlike thrill
and abject helplessness. Even the adept say they feel inept.
</P>
<P>
   ``People haven't even figured out how to control the
thermostat,'' observed Raymond Boggs, a technology analyst at
International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., market research
company. ``It's scary that people haven't asked themselves why they
really need to open the front door for the plumber by remote.''
</P>
<P>
   Or why it can take three computer-savvy consultants from
different fields to figure out why a homeowner's window shades
aren't working. Architects like Scott Phillips, in Manhattan, say
they are watching in dismay as some of their jobs _ and budgets _
go to specialists setting up the new machines for living. ``It's
all gotten very complicated, far beyond the architect's means,''
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Fishkin of Innovative Audio, a showroom with branches in
Manhattan and Brooklyn, is one of the new digital caretakers, on
24-hour call, seven days a week (at about $75 per hour). Fishkin
watched as one client sold a house, lock, stock and remotes soon
after it was wired because he found the controls too daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Most clients don't abandon ship: they just call Fishkin, day or
night, weekend or holiday, when control panels start flashing
incomprehensible messages. He once got up from Thanksgiving dinner
to drive 40 minutes to a client's home to fix a stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem,'' Fishkin said, ``is that people start to
panic and push too many buttons taking them down pathways where
they have no idea what to do,'' and end up undoing hours of
previous programming.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1879 _ long before Michael Mozer was heckled by his
computer _ the German scholar Friedrich Theodor Vischer coined an
expression for a particularly modern paranoia, ``the cunning of
objects.''
</P>
<P>
   When he comes home at night, Mozer, a computer science professor
at the University of Colorado at Boulder, is accosted not by a
spouse (he's single) but by his computer screen. ``Ack!'' it
flashes, ``You're home 23 minutes early today.''
</P>
<P>
   Mozer, an extreme adopter, has turned the 19th-century
schoolhouse he inhabits into a lab for experimental technologies,
with computers, video cameras and multiple sound and motion sensors
to anticipate his every move.
</P>
<P>
   It turns on the lights at 6 p.m. (his usual arrival time). It
sets the temperature at 70 degrees (his ideal). When he's working
into the night, the computer lights the way to his bedroom; when he
gets out of bed, sound sensors pick up the creaking floorboards and
turn on the bathroom lights.
</P>
<P>
   There are glitches. Those same sensors trigger the bathroom
lights whenever Mozer rolls over on a windy night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house is just trying to understand my activities based on
patterns,'' he said, ``but sometimes I find it playing with my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And programming his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm out late with friends,'' Mozer admitted, ``I start
thinking maybe I better get back home because that's what the
system expects me to do and I don't want to let it down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in limbo right now,'' said Alex Pentland, the academic
head of MIT's Media Lab, where much of the new home technology is
incubated. ``If you stand back and forget the hype, you have to ask
yourself: Do you really want your microwave to talk to your
refrigerator? What's it going to say? We have yet to come up with
something that people really care about. And that's why a lot of
these things aren't going to last.''
</P>
<P>
   Gopal Ahluwalia, head of research at the National Association of
Home Builders, predicted that many of them would not even happen.
He is among the first to hear about technological upgrades, from
high-speed Internet connections to talking appliances, that
builders think of adding to new homes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, new
frontiers in home networking were all the rage. Panasonic
contributed a microwave that could respond to recipe instructions
delivered by Internet. From Home Automated Living, a small Maryland
company, there was a voice-controlled house, called HAL 3000, in
homage to ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' Microsoft presented a
refrigerator that kept track of groceries and made its own shopping
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no good reason for a lot of it,'' Ahluwalia said,
citing the linking of telephones and vacuum cleaners as an example.
``When the phone rings, the vacuum cleaner automatically turns off.
I say: `Don't do it! No one will ever be able to vacuum again.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Common sense, however, is not what attracts early adopters like
Soros and Markus to spend the money _ $50,000 is an entry-level
figure on what is primarily custom work and is constantly being
updated.
</P>
<P>
   In a home-automated conspiracy to make his teen-age son take out
the trash, one Long Island homeowner temporarily installed a
program that activated speakers and a timer when security cameras
showed the boy hanging out in his bedroom. A buzzer went off and
didn't stop until the chore was done.
</P>
<P>
   For many homeowners, living with the future has become more
chore than challenge. Take the automated LiteTouch lighting system
at the Markus residence. Each panel has a multitude of Tic-Tac-size
buttons inscribed with tiny lettering to indicate different light
schemes _ ``cabinet lights'' to ``zombie,'' a setting low enough so
that Markus, an insomniac, can wander about. But every time his
wife goes to turn on the lights, she has to put on her glasses. As
she does, Markus said, she shoots him a dirty look.
</P>
<P>
   Architects have their own complaints. Where once their clients
were focused on aesthetic issues, now they are fixated on where to
put the flat-screen monitor and the six surround-sound speakers.
Retrofitting, or rewiring a house that is already built or
significantly underway, can be a headache. Wiring with coaxial
cable or fiber optics and hiding everything under rugs (or
carefully threading it along the wall) might take a specialist 40
hours to 4 weeks. Fiber-optic wires can be especially tricky, as
they must be coiled, not bent, to avoid upsetting the flow of data.
Installing the equipment and its behind-the-scenes ``brain'' might
add another three to five days. Add three to five hours of
intensive tutorials for the owners to learn how to master their new
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing is that people get the stuff and don't
use it,'' said Dennis Wedlick, a New York architect. ``They set the
lighting once and never change it. They leave the shades somewhere
in the middle to avoid the hassle. The systems are not user
friendly. And they're difficult to integrate into the house. But
people still want it all.''
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of Wedlick's residential work now involves
smart technology. At one house for a client who works at home,
there is an audio system that broadcasts background office noise _
both to make the homeowner feel more motivated and also to make
phone-callers take him more seriously than they might if they
heard, for instance, the dishwasher in the background.
</P>
<P>
   William Georgis, a Manhattan architect with blue-chip clients,
is already predicting a backlash. ``People are extremely busy, and
they don't have the time or the inclination to learn how to use it
all,'' he said. ``Clients are telling me, `No more, please!' Of
course, these are people who can fall back on their staff to take
care of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Rigatti, an operations manager on Wall Street, plans to
spend $90,000 to give her Staten Island home some smarts, with a
master plan drawn by Michael Gargiulo of Audio House in Brooklyn.
She'll be able to de-ice her sidewalk from her laptop when she's
abroad if she hears it's snowing in New York. Cameras let her
monitor who's at the front door and watch her nephews horsing
around in the basement. ``Luckily, Michael is on 24-hour call,''
she said, recalling the night she returned home from Las Vegas and
couldn't remember the code to turn off the alarm.

   ``We are not there yet when it comes to the smart house,'' said
Paul Saffo, the director of the Institute for the Future, a Silicon
Valley forecasting center. ``People need to ask themselves first,
`What fits into my life?' Whatever doesn't work should go into the
trash, or rather into the garage, where it can be sold a few years
later on eBay.''

<P>
   Like other advanced home networks in the R&AMP;D stage, Easy Living
incorporates wireless technology but does not completely escape
cables, wires and interfaces. Gathering clues from voice commands
as well as from constant video surveillance, a homeowner's recorded
patterns or even the wave of a hand, a computer network might make
tea or note the location of the car keys.

   Steven Shafer, a senior researcher at Microsoft, expects some of
the Jeevesian technology to be available within two years. But the
entire system, he said, will take longer to perfect. ``The big
question is how to make it all simple enough,'' he said. ``Anyone
using this technology in the next 10 years had better be a techie
or else be prepared to be very confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Shafer confessed that he lives ``in a very conventional house.''g automated.
</P>
<P>
   His reason? ``I'm one of the people,'' he said, ``who believe a
little bit of knowledge can make home a distressing place to try
and live in.''

<P>
   Following is a highly selective lexicon of terms that homeowners
might encounter when trying to set up a house with smarts:
</P>
<P>
   CAT 5: For Category 5, a rating system that refers to the number
of twisted pairs of wires in a telephone cable. The more twists,
the greater bandwidth and speed and the less interference in the
transmission of voice and computer data. Specifying Cat 5, over the
more common Cat 3, is an inexpensive upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   CRESTRON: A popular total home control product based on a
wireless radio-frequency touch panel and central control processor
capable of interacting with everything from the thermostat to
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   DSL: Digital subscriber line, one of several methods for
delivering high-speed, ever-ready access to the Internet, 100 times
faster than traditional telephone-line modems. It also lets users
make and receive phone calls while surfing the net.
</P>
<P>
   EARLY ADOPTER: Beloved by high-tech manufacturers, the early
adopter is a consumer willing to try any new technology.
</P>
<P>
   MACRO: A lengthy series of instructions dictated to a home
controller that reduces a complex process to a single command, so
one button can dim the lights, lower the shades and start a movie.
</P>
<P>
   PLASMA SCREEN: A flat-screen monitor, approximately three to
five inches thick, for screening digital, satellite, video, cable
and television programs. It can also be used as a computer. Note:
Not all plasma screens are HD-TV compatible.
</P>
<P>
   RF TECHNOLOGY: Radio frequency technology allows wireless
appliances to work. In most point-and-change remote controls,
infrared technology may be more common, but RF is the wave of the
future. The advantage is that it doesn't have to be pointed and
that its signals penetrate even walls. The disadvantage: its range
is only 150 to 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   SAF: Spousal acceptance factor, a term found most frequently in
esoteric stereophile magazines and the tags used by showrooms _ as
in, ``the SAF on these six-foot-tall electrostatic speakers is
zero.'' For ``spouse,'' of course, read ``wife.''

A WORLD WITHOUT END FOR FANS OF JANE AUSTEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(bl) 
 By PAMELA LiCALZI O'CONNELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is universally acknowledged that Jane Austen wrote too
little. For years, publishers have sought to capitalize on the
craving for more Austen prose with a steady stream of sequels to
her mere six completed novels. Many of these ``continuations,''
unsurprisingly, have been found wanting by Austen devotees and
literary critics alike.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a grass-roots publishing platform available, Janeites,
as fans of the English novelist are known, have taken to the Web to
extend the author's oeuvre themselves, creating online libraries of
hundreds of stories inspired by her novels.
</P>
<P>
   These stories are an example of a widespread Web phenomenon
known as fan fiction, or fanfic, creative writing that uses
existing characters. Most such fiction grows out of science-fiction
television shows (``Star Trek'' stories alone number in the tens of
thousands). But Austen's works represents the only classic
literature to inspire a sizable collection of online fan fiction,
said Karen Nicholas, who maintains a comprehensive Web site on the
topic (members.aol.com/ksnicholas/fanfic/index.html).
</P>
<P>
   The two largest libraries of Austen fan fiction can be found at
Austen.com (austen.com) and The Republic of Pemberley
(www.pemberley.com), noncommercial sites devoted to all things
Jane.
</P>
<P>
   Several explanations have been offered as to why Austen, who
died in Winchester, England, in 1817 at age 41, has inspired such
an explosion of fan writing. Ann Haker, the founder of Austen.com
and a structural engineer in Minneapolis, points foremost to the
dearth of Austen prose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fanfic writers make no claims to be able to reach the literary
heights of Miss Austen,'' she said. ``But we feel the need to
expand on the world, the characters and the stories, that she
created. There just is not enough of Jane Austen's own words to
read, so we write our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fanfic authors also cite Austen's restrained style and
tendency to leave out critical scenes (in ``Pride and Prejudice,''
Darcy's second marriage proposal to Elizabeth Bennett is not
described, for example) as spurs to their own creativity. ``The
implicit nature of Austen's writing collides with our modern
sensibilities and desires for the explicit,'' Ms. Haker said. ``As
Jane Austen failed to write of these things, we feel compelled to
do so in her place.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Kaplan, a professor of English at Goucher College in
Baltimore and editor of Persuasions, an academic journal published
by the Jane Austen Society of North America
(www.jasna.org/pol01/index.html), is no fan of Austen sequels,
published or otherwise. Yet she sees how they could naturally arise
from what she terms Austen's ``non-endings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her summaries at the end of her novels are never as neatly
packaged as those of other authors of that time,'' Professor Kaplan
said. ``There's always change and trouble hinted at _ it's almost
satiric _ and the story isn't projected very far into the future.
It makes the reader want to push it further.''
</P>
<P>
   Most fanfic authors would probably agree with Ann Rydberg, a
librarian in Orebro, Sweden, and a prolific fanfic writer, that the
sheer volume of Austen fan fiction is but more ``proof of the rich
material she left her readers to build imaginings on.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Austen Web sites represent two schools of fan fiction.
The Republic of Pemberley's stories try to mimic more closely
Austen's style with plots that remain ``in period,'' or true to
Regency-era England. They range from straightforward sequels and
``missing scenes'' (those that readers wish had been in the novels)
to retellings from different characters' points of view and stories
that imitate Austen's style without being a sequel to, or a
completion of, any specific original.
</P>
<P>
   Austen.com, however, allows more fanciful interpretations, like
``crossover'' stories in which Austen characters mix with those
from other novels or even modern television characters like Buffy
the Vampire Slayer. A recent story inspired by ``Pride and
Prejudice,'' for example, was set in the antebellum South. ``That
was our first black Lizzie!'' Ms. Haker sighed, happily.
</P>
<P>
   Stories based on ``Pride and Prejudice'' dominate both sites,
and not just because it is arguably Austen's best-loved work. Many
fanfic authors date their interest in writing Austen-inspired
stories to the 1996 broadcast in the United States of a BBC
adaptation of that novel, starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That broadcast brought a lot of obsessives out of the
woodwork,'' said Myretta Robens, a founder of The Republic of
Pemberley and the technology and operations editor at Harvard
Business School Publishing in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Esau, an author of more than 20 fanfic stories and a
secretary for a chemistry journal published by the University of
Virginia, conceded that she found herself wishing she could see her
dialogue acted out by Firth and Ms. Ehle. ``I often think, `If only
I could have seen this in the screenplay,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of her fellow fanfic authors, Ms. Esau limits her
creative writing to Austen fan fiction and has few pretensions that
her stories will find a wider audience, much less pique the
interest of a commercial publisher. In a way, she said, posting her
stories at Pemberley was like publishing them. ``It's exposing
yourself to a lot of people,'' she said, ``since there's a lot of
lurkers,'' people who read the fan fiction but post no comments on
it.
</P>
<P>
   While the audience for both sites is small in overall Net terms,
it remains steady. Austen.com draws nearly 30,000 page views a
week, and about 25 percent of those represent people looking at the
board where the fanfic stories are posted, Ms. Haker said. The
Republic of Pemberley has a larger audience, with 1 million page
views of its fan-fiction area each year, Ms. Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Most fanfic authors are women, and in the case of Austen fanfic,
nearly all are. Ms. Robinson suggested that was because ``most fan
fiction is romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The authors are drawn to the relationship aspect,'' she
continued. ``Also, Austen didn't write scenes for men _ we don't
ever get Darcy's point of view, for example _ so perhaps that has
something to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   .com. ``Austen's examination of the mating dance may have led
some males to falsely conclude that she is a romance novelist and
so want nothing to do with her,'' he said via e-mail. ``Or perhaps
men are intimidated to join an activity so heavily dominated by
women, although I have never found that to be a particular
deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Birchalls may be the only Austen fanfic writer to have her
work published. Ms. Birchalls, who evaluates novels for the Warner
Brothers film studio from her home in Santa Monica, Calif., began
posting her sequel to ``Emma,'' entitled ``In Defense of Mrs.
Elton,'' to an academic-oriented Internet mailing list devoted to
Austen. It was eventually published by the Jane Austen Society for
distribution at one of its conferences, and Ms. Birchalls is
planning a sequel to the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Birchalls characterizes the fan fiction at the decidedly
nonacademic Austen.com and Republic of Pemberley as ``short
romantic fiction _ fun to do, a pasttime,'' and that is a fair
assessment of most of the stories. Too many refer to Darcy,
incongruously, as Fitzwilliam and overuse words thought to lend
Regency flavor, like ``exceedingly'' (as in ``I am exceedingly
happy to see you here, Fitzwilliam''). And the stories tend toward
the overly romantic, a complaint often leveled at many of the
published sequels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some of the more serious stories are enjoyable for their
efforts to think through missing scenes and get period details just
right. Other stories introduce characters who prove so popular that
they begin appearing in stories by other fanfic writers. Some
authors play intellectual games, incorporating dialogue from the
actual novels, or disguise existing Austen characters and challenge
readers to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Where some might see hubris in any attempt to mimic Austen, Ms.
Robinson of The Republic of Pemberley, argues that the best fan
fiction is very conscious of Austen. ``It doesn't just use her as a
vehicle,'' she said, ``but pays homage to her work.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether hubris or homage, the wealth of fanfic may well prove,
in Ms. Rydberg's words, that ``Austen's novels can take any amount
of bungling amateurism and still remain unsoiled, remain the
exquisite and well-polished bits of ivory she once presented us.''

<P>
   For the first time, an opinion poll reveals what the Russian
public thinks about a wide range of nuclear security issues, from
the Strategic Arms Control Treaty to nuclear smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, ``Examining Attitudes of Russians Towards Nuclear
Weapons and Nuclear Threats,'' was jointly sponsored by Moscow's
Center for Policy Studies in Russia and the Center for
Nonproliferation Studies of the Monterey Institute in California.
</P>
<P>
   It was based on interviews with 1,500 people in 56 localities
throughout the Russian Federation, and was released Nov. 16. The
research was conducted by Fond Obshestvennoye Mneniye _ a well
respected, politically independent Russian polling company.
</P>
<P>
   The survey helps to clarify how Russians think about nuclear
weapons _ including the role they play in world politics, how much
Russia needs them for its own security and how they could be
diverted for use by international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The results also demonstrate that, as elsewhere, the public on
this issue does not always agree with the official government and
military positions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the end of the Cold War and a halt to the U.S.-Soviet
superpower arms race, the survey showed that a significant number
of Russians find comfort in their country's nuclear weapons; 77
percent supported the Russian National Security Concept provision
that says: ``Nuclear weapons play a decisive role in providing
national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those polled, 24 percent acknowledged that it is costly for
Russia to maintain its nuclear arsenal, but 32 percent said Russia
ought to have as many nukes as the United States _ while 26 percent
supported the idea of a Russia with more nuclear weapons than
America.
</P>
<P>
   As for totally deactivating their nuclear weapons, it wasn't a
popular idea: 82 percent thought Russia's nuclear arsenal must be
on active duty and ready for use; a mere 12 percent said that the
nukes should be kept in storage. Only 18 percent of those polled
thought Russia didn't need any nukes at all.
</P>
<P>
   That such weapons could fall into the hands of the wrong people
weighed heavily on respondents, with fear voiced about possible
sabotage of Russian nuclear facilities, including power plants and
nuclear munitions storage sites _ 90 percent of those polled
expressed such a fear.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the survey was taken after a devastating series of
terrorist bombs in Moscow and other Russian cities killed more than
300 people _ attacks blamed by the Kremlin on Chechen warlords and
bandits, although solid evidence of guilt remains absent. This
continues to be used as rationale for the bloody Russian military
campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the fact that nine out of every 10 of Russian
adults polled said that nuclear sabotage is possible demonstrates
how great the fear is. It also shows how little the Russian people
trust the official statements which claim that ``all strategic
facilities are under control.''
</P>
<P>
   While only 52 percent of those polled expressed concern about a
nuclear attack by foreign states, 86 percent expressed fear that
international terrorists might use nuclear weapons against Russia.
Only 10 percent considered such terrorism to be improbable; only 4
percent had difficulty answering this question, which suggests that
the majority are indeed living with concern about nuclear
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians, the poll revealed, simply don't buy the
assurances of their senior government officials that there is no
way for nuclear thieves to steal weapons-grade fissile materials
from domestic nuclear facilities. The majority, 83 percent of
respondents, believed it possible to smuggle such lethal materials
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Russians generally valued the concept of curbing the spread of
nukes, with 76 percent saying the world would be far less stable if
more countries had nuclear weapons. Education played a role in
this: 81 percent of those with a higher education said nuclear
proliferation would diminish global stability; so did 74 percent of
those with a secondary education and 64 percent with a primary
education.
</P>
<P>
   Even those respondents who believed that world stability could
be improved by the proliferation of nuclear weapons opposed the
idea of selling Russian nuclear arms and technologies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Russians don't balk at the idea of total world
nuclear disarmament. Of those polled, 57 percent believed the world
would be a more stable place if all nuclear weapons were abolished.
Russians 60 years of age or older were the biggest supporters _ 67
percent of the elderly Russians believed that eliminating all
nuclear arms would add to international stability.
</P>
<P>
   As for cutbacks, 55 percent of those polled supported
ratification of the START II treaty, which has languished in the
Russian Duma, or parliament, since 1993, and only 25 percent were
opposed. Interestingly, 72 percent of those polled said America
would implement only those treaty provisions of benefit to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Being a nuclear power is linked to global influence, many
Russians believed. Of those polled, 40 percent said Russia will
have a say in world politics if it kept its nuclear weapons; 37
percent thought other nations wouldn't dare attack a nurmed
Russia. Only 23 percent said nuclear weapons were necessary because
developing nuclear technology promotes technical progress.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of respondents, 47 percent, also thought that Russia
should retain the right to launch a first strike _ which is the
official position of their government. However, a large minority,
38 percent, held the opposite view, and the rest found the question
difficult to answer.
</P>
<P>
   As to politics, people's political preferences generally had
very little impact on the opinions reflected in their answers. But
among the more illuminating data:
</P>
<P>
   __ Seventy-nine percent of those polled who were followers of
Yevgeny M. Primakov, former prime minister and leader of
Fatherland-All Russia, a centrist electoral alliance, said the
United States could not be trusted to act fairly in fulfilling its
international arms-control treaty obligations. Primakov is
currently the most likely competitor to Acting President Vladimir
V. Putin in the March 26 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   __ Twenty-three percent of those polled who were supporters of
Gennadi A. Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, maintained that
Russia should have the same number of nuclear weapons as the United
States; 31 percent were sure that Russia needed more. Moreover, his
supporters accounted for the largest number of those opposed to the
six-year-old START II treaty, which calls for the reduction of
nuclear stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fifty-four percent of those polled who were followers of
Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist leader, believed that
Russian nukes should be permanently targeted at certain states.
</P>
<P>
   __ Eighty-seven percent of supporters of Sergei Kiriyenko,
another former prime minister and leader of the Union of Right
Forces, a pro-capitalist group, were sure the world would be less
stable if more countries possessed nuclear weapons.

idea of selling Russian nuclear arms and technologies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Russians don't balk at the idea of total world
nuclear disarmament. Of those polled, 57 percent believed the world
would be a more stable place if all nuclear weapons were abolished.
Russians 60 years of age or older were the biggest supporters _ 67
percent of the elderly Russians believed that eliminating all
nuclear arms would add to international stability.
</P>
<P>
   As for cutbacks, 55 percent of those polled supported
ratification of the START II treaty, which has languished in the
Russian Duma, or parliament, since 1993, and only 25 percent were
opposed. Interestingly, 72 percent of those polled said America
would implement only those treaty provisions of benefit to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Being a nuclear power is linked to global influence, many
Russians believed. Of those polled, 40 percent said Russia will
have a say in world politics if it kept its nuclear weapons; 37
percent thought other nations wouldn't dare attack a nuclear-armed
Russia. Only 23 percent said nuclear weapons were necessary because
developing nuclear technology promotes technical progress.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of respondents, 47 percent, also thought that Russia
should retain the right to launch a first strike _ which is the
official position of their government. However, a large minority,
38 percent, held the opposite view, and the rest found the question
difficult to answer.
</P>
<P>
   As to politics, people's political preferences generally had
very little impact on the opinions reflected in their answers. But
among the more illuminating data:
</P>
<P>
   __ Seventy-nine percent of those polled who were followers of
Yevgeny M. Primakov, former prime minister and leader of
Fatherland-All Russia, a centrist electoral alliance, said the
United States could not be trusted to act fairly in fulfilling its
international arms-control treaty obligations. Primakov is
currently the most likely competitor to Acting President Vladimir
V. Putin in the March 26 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   __ Twenty-three percent of those polled who were supporters of
Gennadi A. Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, maintained that
Russia should have the same number of nuclear weapons as the United
States; 31 percent were sure that Russia needed more. Moreover, his
supporters accounted for the largest number of those opposed to the
six-year-old START II treaty, which calls for the reduction of
nuclear stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fifty-four percent of those polled who were followers of
Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist leader, believed that
Russian nukes should be permanently targeted at certain states.
</P>
<P>
   __ Eighty-seven percent of supporters of Sergei Kiriyenko,
another former prime minister and leader of the Union of Right
Forces, a pro-capitalist group, were sure the world would be less
stable if more countries possessed nuclear weapons.

 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas,
hundreds of companies show the new products they plan to offer in
the coming year, and tell lies about when the products will be
available, how well they will work and how they will magically
transform our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, new products emerge that really do have the
potential to change the electronics landscape for the better.
Recent examples include DVD players, high-definition television and
a device that jams and blocks cell phone calls in restaurants and
movie theaters. (Tragically, it is not yet available in this
country.)
</P>
<P>
   At this year's show, which ended Sunday, the most important
products were evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Small devices
like cameras and cell phones got smaller, big devices like
television sets got bigger and cheaper, and nearly everything in
between, including computers and VCRs, was offered in a choice of
colors. Oh, and AOL, soon the proud owner of Time Warner, offered a
glimpse of its version of the future of television.
</P>
<P>
   Digital was the key word. There were digital televisions,
cameras, video recorders, music players and books. There was even a
digital Hula Hoop that played tunes with a bit of pelvic
persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   A few products and technologies stood out from the crowd. Most
of them were shown as prototypes, and some will not appear in
stores until late this year.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo, one of the creators last year _ along with Replay Networks
_ of the exciting new category of digital video recorders,
announced new alliances with Sony and Blockbuster that promise to
further change how people watch television. With its Sony alliance,
TiVo gets another brand-name maker of TiVo recorders, which allow
customers to automatically search TV listings for interesting
shows, create customized channels based on their preferences,
record up to 30 hours of programming on a hard disk drive, pause
live programming and otherwise take nearly full control of the
broadcast schedule.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Sony could conceivably add TiVo recording
technology to its television sets, DVD players, set-top controller
boxes and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the Blockbuster alliance were not divulged, but one
can easily imagine the giant video rental company offering its many
thousands of movie and game titles online through the TiVo program
guides, creating the first widespread video-on-demand system.
</P>
<P>
   One might click on the Blockbuster channel, scan the Blockbuster
catalog and rent a classic or new-release movie that would be
downloaded to the TiVo recorder over a high-speed cable or digital
subscriber line Internet connection. Again, TiVo and Blockbuster
declined to elaborate, but the technology exists to permit movies
to be rented, downloaded, locked or erased after the rental period
is up, or purchased outright using a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   While TiVo was touting its new Blockbuster alliance, the
company's archrival Replay Networks was also showing the
Blockbuster logo on its demonstrations at the show. Replay is in a
``quiet pern advance of a planned initial public stock
offering on Wall Street, but the Blockbuster insignia in Replay's
booth suggests that ``video on demand'' may be a common feature in
living rooms sooner than we think.
</P>
<P>
   The actress Pamela Anderson Lee was in Replay's booth touting
its product. TiVo boasted of an endorsement by Howard Stern. The
dueling bad girl, bad boy celebrity endorsements may be
significant, but I can't imagine why.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the wide-screen digital television receivers incited
the greatest lust.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that prices have fallen sharply for HDTV-ready
receivers. Thomson showed one that will cost $3,999 when it reaches
the market this summer, half the cost of similar sets last year.
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-good news is that digital televisions are still more
confusing and much more expensive than analog sets, and many of
them still require a separate decoder box for receiving the handful
of available HDTV programs. But the major satellite television
services _ DirecTV and the DiSH Network _ announced that they will
be transmitting more high-definition movies this year, which means
that many people will not have to wait for local broadcast stations
to switch to digital.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, William E. Kennard, warned cable television companies
at the show that they have until April to stop their bickering and
figure out a standard way to provide digital programming to their
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   All of the digital sets on display at the show were impressive,
compared with analog sets, but a prototype by Sharp Electronics
topped them all with a 64-inch display that incorporated a new
technology, called continuous grain silicon, that made other
digital TV sets _ even HDTV units _ appear drab in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, its $50,000 price tag was as breathtaking as the
pictures. The good news is that the new continuous grain technology
will find its way down to more affordable sets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dolby Laboratories demonstrated a new technology, Dolby
Headphone, that creates the audio illusion of full surround sound
in any set of headphones. Unlike traditional stereo headphones that
resolve left and right channels and create sound that seems to
emanate from a center channel between the user's ears, Dolby
Headphone creates the impression of sound coming from forward left,
center and right, and rear left and right by using sound principles
called psychoacoustics.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers study how the brain processes sounds, then modify
the electronics to fool the brain into perceiving more sonic
information than is actually being delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Dolby Headphone, which works with any stereo headphones, is
expected to be a feature on selected DVD players, receivers,
personal computers and video game consoles later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar way, Microsoft is using psychovisual techniques
with a technology called Cleartype, which is being incorporated
into software called Microsoft Reader. Reader, which was
demonstrated at the show, works with laptop PCs, pocket computers
and other electronic book devices.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have determined that text on a computer screen
approaches the appearance of text on a printed page at a
resolution, or sharpness, greater than 300 dots per inch. But the
typical liquid crystal displays found on the new class of consumer
e-books typically have resolutions of less than 100 dots per inch.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that electronic text can appear jagged or fuzzy,
and the reader's eye spends so much time resolving the jagged edges
that reading on a computer screen is unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   With Cleartype, text on the electronic screen appears almost as
sharp as text on a paper page. That is a major advance and will
contribute significantly to the adoption of versatile reader
devices, including hand-held units and larger tablet displays that
have many technical advantages over printed books.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also announced an alliance with the Barnes &AMP; Noble
bookstore chain last week that will enable users of
Cleartype-enabled reading devices to download thousands of books
from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Microsoft wants to change the way people use books,
America Online wants to change the way people use television. And
now that AOL has announced plans to acquire Time Warner and become
the world's largest media company, not to mention a major force in
cable television, the idea of AOLTV suddenly makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   AOL gave a sneak peek at the new television services it plans to
offer nationwide later this year. The key is a set-top box that
will connect the television receiver to a satellite or cable TV
connection and to the Internet at the same time (the box shown at
the show had a 56K modem and came with a wireless keyboard and
remote control).
</P>
<P>
   AOL will superimpose a menu bar and notification bar on the
television screen, alerting the user whenever a new e-mail or
instant message arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Without changing the television channel, the AOL subscriber can
participate in chat sessions about the show, check stock quotes,
browse Web sites, participate in instant Time magazine polls and
maybe shop for Sylvester and Tweetie T-shirts online while
listening to streaming audio from the Warner Brothers music
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The rumble you hear in the distance is Microsoft preparing for
battle with the new AOL Time Warner, but this time as an underdog.
Microsoft operates MSN, which is one-tenth the size of AOL; it has
WebTV, which is now challenged by AOLTV, and it too has been
binge-buying cable television systems.
</P>
<P>
   The battle will be epic, and you'll want to take pictures. One
option is Canon's pocket-size, 3.1-megapixel Powershot S20, which
is expected to go on sale in the United States before summer. The
price has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   At its highest-resolution setting of 2,048-by-1,536 pixels, this
may be the first consumer digital camera to seriously rival the
picture sharpness of traditional 35-mm film cameras, even when
producing 8-by-10-inch photographic prints. The prototype on
display worked with IBM's matchbook-size 340-megabyte microdrive,
which will be a coveted option for a camera that creates picture
files as large as 9 MB.

 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a strange coda to a decade obsessed with branding,
controversy has broken out over a surprising symbol: the Zia sun
sign. The symbol _ a circle with lines radiating in four directions
_ is one of the best-known images in New Mexico. It is on the state
flag and license plates. It appears in the Yellow Pages with about
the same frequency as the oversize apple used to promote New York
City. It shows up on everything from dishes and linens to
motorcycles and portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The 850-member Zia pueblo, about 35 miles northwest of
Albuquerque, has been using the symbol since the year 1200, tribal
officials say. Now the pueblo has asked the state, in testimony
before a legislative committee, to pay it $74 million for employing
without permission what the tribe's elders variously call ``a
sacred symbol'' and ``the symbol of our collective identity.'' The
figure represents $1 million for each year the design has appeared
on the flag, up to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in response to the dispute, the federal Patent and
Trademark Office recently issued a report on the status of Native
American symbols in which it acknowledged a problem in trademarking
the symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The issue surfaced two years ago when American Frontier
Motorcycle Tours, which runs tours of the state using
Harley-Davidson motorcycles, received a trademark incorporating a
version of the symbol. Roberta Price, a lawyer for the tribe,
protested to the patent office but was told she was too late in the
trademark consideration process.
</P>
<P>
   She was outraged. ``You couldn't imagine Star of David
motorcycles or Virgin Mary Porta Pottis, could you?'' she asked.
Ms. Price and Peter Pino, the tribe's administrator, asked Sen.
Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat, to seek changes in the
trademark law.
</P>
<P>
   Bingaman said: ``Since we do provide legal protection for
symbols of other government entities, it's not a difficult argument
to say we should do the same with tribes and pueblos. The way
things stand today, a municipality that was incorporated yesterday
is still guaranteed more legal protection for its symbol than a
100-year-old tribal government.''
</P>
<P>
   In fall 1998, at Bingaman's behest, Congress ordered the Patent
and Trademark Office to begin an investigation of the legal status
of Native American tribal symbols. Hearings were held, some with
representatives of not only the tribes but also DaimlerChrysler,
the maker of the Jeep Cherokee and Mohawk Carpets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price has tried to have the symbol protected through an
amendment to trademark law that would put it and other tribal
symbols under the same rules as the symbols of nations, states and
municipalities. Such symbols are already protected by law, and
trademark applications seeking to use them are rejected.
</P>
<P>
   While trademarking the symbol itself might be a solution, the
tribe does not have the money to fend off unauthorized users of its
symbol, Ms. Price said.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the trademark agency recommended no changes in
the law, but suggested that existing legislation was sufficient to
protect tribal symbols. It also recommended drawing up a list of
the symbols. The agency does not have the power to choose which
symbols would go on the list, the report continued; Native American
tribes have special legal status as ``domestic dependent nations.''
But the agency said it would regard a tribal resolution as
sufficient authorization for a tribe to claim a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the agency would maintain a database of such
official tribal insignia. In 1994, it said, the agency queried some
500 tribes and groups for such a list, but got only 10 responses.
</P>
<P>
   If a symbol is put on the list, the agency will have the power
to reject applications for similar marks, since it can forbid
copyrights that suggest a ``likely false association'' _ as for
example, a food product that buyers might conclude was produced by
the tribe, or anything that implied ``possible disparagement'' of a
group that owns a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The Zia pueblo had hoped for more. ``It is a very George Orwell,
bureaucratic document,'' Ms. Price said, adding that it didn't
commit the agency ``to do anything two or three years hence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable that some are disappointed,'' said the
report's primary author, Eleanor K. Meltzer, a lawyer and adviser
to the Patent and Trademark Office. But she argued that the
official listing of tribal symbols and the existing law would do
the job. While listing did not work well in 1994, she said that
this time, ``we are going to take the initiative _ we will make it
clear to the tribes that we will do the work and make it as easy as
possible for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency, she said, will not only protect the symbols, but
also promote them. ``We are going to be very aggressive in
publicizing them among the public,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribes have an avenue for asserting their rights through
the Indian Arts and Crafts Board of the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
part of the Department of the Interior,'' Ms. Meltzer said. An
earlier draft of the report, she said, placed responsibility for
listing with the bureau, but officials of both agencies agreed that
the trademark agency had more financial resources available for the
job. ``Protecting symbols this way will cost the tribe nothing,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Once the list is established, in theory a tribe or another party
_ say a coalition supporting Native American rights _ could push
for the cancellation of existing trademarks incorporating the Zia
sun or other Native American symbols. Trademark cancellation is not
uncommon, but none of those who appeared at the trademark hearings
pushed for it.
</P>
<P>
   Pino, a Zia who has lived all his life at the pueblo and served
as assistant war chief and war chief before becoming the tribal
administrator, has traced the story of how the symbol became the
center of the state flag.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, the Daughters of the American Revolution held a contest
for a design for the flag. The winner, a Santa Fe physician named
Dr. Harry Mera, suggested the sun symbol he had seen on a Zia
ceremonial pot in the Museum of Fine Arts in Santa Fe, and the
Legislature approved it.
</P>
<P>
   That pot, Pino said, had been stolen: only ceremonial pottery
was allowed to bear the Zia, and no ceremonial pottery was ever to
leave the pueblo. Only the pueblo's elders can give permission for
use of the symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the tribe not object in 1925? ``They were not even
citizens,'' Ms. Price said. ``They had no power and no money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't the pueblo deserve as much protection as the smallest
town in North Dakota?'' she asked. ``Shouldn't it be given the same
security as the 4-H Club or Boy Scouts?''
</P>
<P>
   Tribal officials do not really expect the state to pony up $74
million for use of the symbol, Pino said, but they do hope there
will be a recognition of the tribe's rights, a contract for the
state's continued use of the symbol and a symbolic payment. It's
probably a little late, however, to do anything about the fact that
in his last campaign, Gov. Gary E. Johnson substituted the Zia sun
for one ``O'' in his name.

&HT;     CALIF. GOVERNOR URGES SPECIAL ZONES WHERE PUBLIC SERVICE
WORKERS CAN LIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Gray Davis said he is working with
Mayor Willie Brown to create special zones in San Francisco and San
Jose so teachers, police, paramedics and firefighters can afford to
live where they work.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came a day after critics attacked his budget for
affordable housing as disgraceful.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Tuesday with the Sacramento Press Club, Davis
blamed the San Francisco Bay area's critical housing shortage on
the area's incredible new wealth that has prompted the rich to
overbid on houses and send the middle-class to Central Valley towns
like Modesto and Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor said this new economic reality fueled by
the high-tech industry ``isn't a problem,'' but he added, ``There
is no way the taxpayers will give us enough money to compensate
teachers at the same rate they could get in the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Davis, who are close political allies, are working on
a plan to create special zones in this city and other expensive
areas of the state where public-service workers could get taxpayer
help to buy homes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown already has proposed setting up a special area on Treasure
Island near the San Francisco Bay Bridge for city workers who are
now priced out of the market and forced to live miles from the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways the housing problem in the Bay Area is the flip
side of (bay area workers') financial success. I bless them for it.
I think it's wonderful that they're successful,'' Davis said.
``Now, what can we do? We can try and get communities to understand
that at least (people in) certain professions warrant subsidies so
they can afford to live in the communities in which they serve.''
</P>
<P>
   After Davis unveiled his 2000-01 budget this week, he faced
intense criticism from housing advocates who said his request for
$11 million statewide for low-interest housing loans was too low.
Davis' budget also includes $35 million to $50 million in tax
credits for low-income housing, money for cold-weather homeless
shelters and migrant farm worker housing. Davis is offering cash
incentives, including a $10,000 forgivable-down-payment loan to
teachers who agree to work in low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Housing advocates say there is nothing dramatic in the budget to
address the lack of affordable homes and rental places for people
who don't work in schools, firehouses or police stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That budget is a disgrace,'' said Randy Shaw, executive
director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic. ``What message is he
sending when poll after poll shows affordable housing to be the No.
1 issue, and the only thing in his budget is home ownership for
teachers and police.''
</P>
<P>
   When confronted Tuesday with similar comments, Davis said he was
working with Brown and San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales to find areas
they can zone for subsidized housing for public service workers. If
they can, the governor said, then more money for the housing zones
will be proposed when the state budget is revised in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe those professions ought to include all emergencies
services _ paramedics, fire, police and teachers,'' Davis said,
``because you always run up against the NIMBY (not in my back yard)
problem when you say you want to have housing for the middle class
or low-income personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Kevin Shelley, a San Francisco Democrat, who will
push the housing-zone bill in the state legislature, said details
are being worked out on such issues as where the zones would be,
how much the subsidy would provide and whether it would be loan
assistance, matching grants or tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preferred option is to not have it geographically
specific,'' Shelley said, ``so there would be maximum choice for
the workers. But if we're limited in how we can apply the law, I'll
take affordable housing in an incredibly beautiful environment such
as Treasure Island over something else.''
</P>
<P>
   A report released Monday by the National Association of Home
Builders said only 11.9 percent of San Francisco families, those
earning a median $72,400 annual income, can afford a home in the
city. The median home price in San Francisco is $407,000.

 &HT;    Korean opera star in priceless form on `Les Bijoux'
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Korean coloratura Sumi Jo has been on the world opera scene for
a decade, but she's been getting a lot of media attention in recent
months _ especially when she repeated the role of Gilda in
``Rigoletto'' at the Metropolitan Opera just last month. This
caused a New York Times critic to praise her as ``even more
technically exquisite and stylistically informed'' than when she
made her Met debut in this role 10 years ago. Atlanta opera fans
can judge for themselves when she gives a recital Wednesday in
Symphony Hall _ or they can check out this elegant CD of French
opera arias. Some are as familiar as ``Ah! je ris'' (the ``Jewel
Song'') from Gounod's ``Faust.'' Others are as rarely heard as
Ophelia's mad scene from Ambroise Thomas' Reader's Digest Condensed
Opera version of ``Hamlet.'' All are sung with a clarity and
delicacy and fresh golden sound that's a joy to the ear. Jo is
equally at home with the sensuous perfumed lines of ``Depuis le
jour'' from Gustave Charpentier's ``Louise'' and the glittering
fireworks of ``Je suis Titania'' from Thomas' ``Mignon.'' And who
could resist any recording that includes an aria from Jacques
Offenbach's ``Robinson Crusoe''? (Umlaut and all.)

   NEW YORK _ The four friends had met in college and moved here
two years ago to make it as performers, as young people have done
for generations. But on a recent Sunday, they were participating in
a series of meetings of an Internet start-up company, a company so
new it did not even have a name yet.
</P>
<P>
   What it had was a concept _ an all-powerful, all-purpose,
artificially intelligent concept _ that they called Wally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get across the concept of Wally, to create that
buzz before it launches,'' said the company's chief marketing
officer. ``Maybe we can get Al Sharpton to do a series of ads
arguing with Wally. Yes, Wally's omnipotent, but if someone
disagrees with him, it makes him more human.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the dot-com madness, the meeting was almost plausible. But
in fact, it was a spoof. The 12 people around the conference table
were making all of it up on the spot for an advanced class in
comedy improvisation. But an Internet start-up company is not just
something for them to joke about. Seven of the people in the class,
including the four friends, actually have day jobs in the computer
business, which is becoming an attractive alternative to waiting
tables for many aspiring performers.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Ari Voukydis, who had been playing the information
services director, started his first day on the job as an editor at
Bolt.com, which bills itself as ``one of the Internet's most
popular hangouts for high school and college students.'' It is just
the latest of his online jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, Voukydis joined Peter Olson, an old Wesleyan
classmate who was the chief applications developer in the
improvisation and has worked as a designer for Bolt.com for six
months. A third friend, Chad Carter, who played the chief
technology consultant, works as a programmer for Comvision.com, a
Web design firm.
</P>
<P>
   And the fourth friend, who goes by the stage name Dyna Moe and
was playing the art director, freelances as a Web graphic artist
and designer. Several more students in the class also have online
or technology jobs. Only one waits tables.
</P>
<P>
   That so many members of this one class of performers have online
jobs has a lot to do with their ages. Almost all of them are in
their early 20s. ``We sort of grew up with computers,'' Olson said,
``and that's where the jobs are.''
</P>
<P>
   But older performers are getting into the act as well. For Sal
Midolo, 35, a classically trained singer with steady work in church
choirs and light opera companies, working with computers has been a
return to an old love that has brought new income. ``When I was in
college,'' Midolo said, ``my music teachers used to say, `You're
spending too much time on your computers.''' When he moved to New
York a decade ago, he gave up computers completely.
</P>
<P>
   But four years ago, Midolo bought a new computer and had a Rip
Van Winkle experience. He discovered the new world of graphics
programs. In the next few years, he studied his way up from
Microangelo to Photoshop, then to 3D Studio Max, a program used to
create special effects in film and television (like the 3-D baby on
``Ally McBeal''). Now he is starting to get freelance work, but he
is aiming to be hired at an animation house.
</P>
<P>
   And his singing career? He paused. ``I'm not sure where it's
going to go,'' he said. ``I know I still get a sense of
satisfaction from it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to come by concrete statistics about how many
performing artists find day jobs in technology industries, but some
say the two pursuits make a good fit. ``Working online makes a lot
of sense for performers,'' said Kathy Schrier, the head of the
Actors' Work Program, a project of the Actors' Fund of America. The
program has been assisting performers of all kinds since 1987 to
find what Ms. Schrier calls ``dignified sideline careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Most performers, whether actors, singers, dancers, stand-up
comics or musicians, must find other ways to make a living. ``It's
a tough, tough business,'' Ms. Schrier said. ``You're always
looking for work. There is high unemployment: as many as 90 percent
are not performing at any given time. It's always temporary work;
that's the nature of the business.'' Even permanent employees of
repertory theaters, dance troupes, orchestras and opera companies
perform for a season that lasts only part of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For sideline careers, Ms. Schrier said, ``professional
entertainers want flexible, temporary work so they can go on
auditions and so that when they get cast, they can leave their
sideline job to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said Web jobs could fit into performers' lives. ``The
hours are long, but they're flexible,'' he said. ``It's unheard of
to clock in or clock out.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Computer jobs will not replace waiting tables anytime soon for
professional performers, who number about 25,000 in New York City,
according to New York state statistics, nor for the countless
thousands more aspiring to become professionals. In 1998, the
latest year for which state statistics are available, the city had
37,000 jobs in computer-related fields and 142,000 jobs in
restaurants and bars.
</P>
<P>
   But in the city and nation, computer-related employment is
growing faster than occupations in any other industry, including
the restaurant business, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics
reports. The number of workers in such jobs will more than double
by 2008, while the overall economy will grow by 15 percent, the
bureau said. .
</P>
<P>
   Some performers, like the ones in the comedy improvisation, turn
to computers while they try to break into their profession. But
others, like Frank Dellapolla, a 40-year-old dancer who now works
full time as a computer systems analyst and developer at the
brokerage Lazard Freres &AMP; Co., look at technology jobs as a way to
make an elegant exit. Still others learn computer skills in the
middle of their performing careers.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Carr, 50, has had the quintessential nonlinear career in
three decades as a singer, a dancer and an actress in Boston, Los
Angeles and Washington. She moved to New York last July with her
eye on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   She took classes offered by the Actors' Work Program in basic
computer skills and now works in two sideline careers _ as a
bartender in Broadway theaters (she is serving drinks at ``Miss
Saigon'') and as a weekend proofreader of computer graphics at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. With the money she is making, she plans
to buy her first computer. ``My aim is to start a home-based
business, for the flexibility and the income, and knowing computers
will allow me to do that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Izzy Flores, 40, an actor and model who was previously a
professional pianist and who was once nominated for a Grammy as a
songwriter, got inspired when his brother-in-law gave him a
hand-me-down Power Mac 6100 two years ago. With financing through
the Actors' Work Program, Flores took some courses at the Parsons
School of Design. Now, when he is not performing, he spends more
than a third of his time (between auditions) designing CD covers
for independent record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some performers complain that their technology jobs are a kind
of tyranny rather than an opportunity, leading to a left
brain-right brain clash between their need to make a living and
their artistic bent. But Griff Braun, a dancer, doesn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a popular myth that there are two sides of the
brain, a linear side and a spatial side, and that some people are
creative and some scientific,'' said Braun, 31, who is both a
dancer with the American Ballet Theater and a Webmaster and site
designer. One of his Web clients is his dance company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carr agrees. ``I know a lot of actors who know the technical
aspect of the business,'' she said, ``who, for example, can program
the computers for the lighting design.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 75 dancers in his company, Braun said, about 30 own
computers. One of them, Tamara Barden, is as skilled with a
computer as he is, finding time to create Web sites after
performances and between rehearsals. ``To me, putting together a
Web site is a lot like putting together a dance,'' said Braun, who
designed the ballet company's site. ``It's just as creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Braun hopes that the often cited divide between art and business
is as artificial as the one between art and technology; he is
developing an Internet start-up, a dance education site. ``Right
now, I have a collection of names that I purchased, and I have a
concept,'' he said, though it is not an all-purpose, all-powerful
concept like Wally. He wouldn't even call it cool. ``I'm not going
for cool,'' he said. ``I'm going for something useful.''

&HT;     BICYCLISTS WANT POLICE TO BE MORE DILIGENT IN HANDLING
ACCIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RYAN KIM  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When bicycles and cars collide in San Francisco,
cyclists say, police officers haven't been responsive enough, too
often automatically siding with motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Use and Transportation Committee of the Board of
Supervisors on Tuesday took a step toward leveling the playing
field after approving a resolution urging the police to give
motorists and bicyclists involved in an accident equal treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution addresses a long-running complaint by bicyclists,
who say police officers have many times failed to take down
accident reports when a bicycle is involved.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution would require:
</P>
<P>
   _ Additional training of officers on traffic laws.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Police Department and the district attorney's office to
keep detailed records on the nature and number of bike riders who
are injured in accidents.
</P>
<P>
   _ The authorities to track the number of criminal charges filed
in those collisions for a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, approved by Supervisors Leslie Katz, Michael
Yaki and Leland Yee, was also amended to include the same
protections for pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Bicycle Coalition began a cyclists' rights hot
line in November to document the way the police handled bicycle
accidents. It found police officers had failed to take a report for
three accidents involving injuries of the 19 incidents reported.
Officers filed three other reports on injury accidents only after
being pressured by the victims in the incident, according to the
coalition's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is a systematic bias against bicyclists on
the street,'' said Leah Shahum, program director for the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Several traffic officers appeared Tuesday at the committee
meeting and acknowledged that, in some cases, officers might not
have been following proper procedure in failing to take down
reports on accidents with injuries. But they said they were
isolated incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deny that that has happened,'' Sgt. Ray Shine said of
the bicyclists' complaints. ``But I'm not sure it's a big epidemic
problem in the Police Department.''

&HT;     CALIF. GOVERNOR URGES SPECIAL ZONES WHERE PUBLIC SERVICE
WORKERS CAN LIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Gray Davis said he is working with
Mayor Willie Brown to create special zones in San Francisco and San
Jose so teachers, police, paramedics and firefighters can afford to
live where they work.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came a day after critics attacked his budget for
affordable housing as disgraceful.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Tuesday with the Sacramento Press Club, Davis
blamed the San Francisco Bay area's critical housing shortage on
the area's incredible new wealth that has prompted the rich to
overbid on houses and send the middle-class to Central Valley towns
like Modesto and Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor said this new economic reality fueled by
the high-tech industry ``isn't a problem,'' but he added, ``There
is no way the taxpayers will give us enough money to compensate
teachers at the same rate they could get in the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Davis, who are close political allies, are working on
a plan to create special zones in this city and other expensive
areas of the state where public-service workers could get taxpayer
help to buy homes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown already has proposed setting up a special area on Treasure
Island near the San Francisco Bay Bridge for city workers who are
now priced out of the market and forced to live miles from the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways the housing problem in the Bay Area is the flip
side of (bay area workers') financial success. I bless them for it.
I think it's wonderful that they're successful,'' Davis said.
``Now, what can we do? We can try and get communities to understand
that at least (people in) certain professions warrant subsidies so
they can afford to live in the communities in which they serve.''
</P>
<P>
   After Davis unveiled his 2000-01 budget this week, he faced
intense criticism from housing advocates who said his request for
$11 million statewide for low-interest housing loans was too low.
Davis' budget also includes $35 million to $50 million in tax
credits for low-income housing, money for cold-weather homeless
shelters and migrant farm worker housing. Davis is offering cash
incentives, including a $10,000 forgivable-down-payment loan to
teachers who agree to work in low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Housing advocates say there is nothing dramatic in the budget to
address the lack of affordable homes and rental places for people
who don't work in schools, firehouses or police stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That budget is a disgrace,'' said Randy Shaw, executive
director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic. ``What message is he
sending when poll after poll shows affordable housing to be the No.
1 issue, and the only thing in his budget is home ownership for
teachers and police.''
</P>
<P>
   When confronted Tuesday with similar comments, Davis said he was
working with Brown and San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales to find areas
they can zone for subsidized housing for public service workers. If
they can, the governor said, then more money for the housing zones
will be proposed when the state budget is revised in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe those professions ought to include all emergencies
services _ paramedics, fire, police and teachers,'' Davis said,
``because you always run up against the NIMBY (not in my back yard)
problem when you say you want to have housing for the middle class
or low-income personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Kevin Shelley, a San Francisco Democrat, who will
push the housing-zone bill in the state legislature, said details
are being worked out on such issues as where the zones would be,
how much the subsidy would provide and whether it would be loan
assistance, matching grants or tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preferred option is to not have it geographically
specific,'' Shelley said, ``so there would be maximum choice for
the workers. But if we're limited in how we can apply the law, I'll
take affordable housing in an incredibly beautiful environment such
as Treasure Island over something else.''
</P>
<P>
   A report released Monday by the National Association of Home
Builders said only 11.9 percent of San Francisco families, those
earning a median $72,400 annual income, can afford a home in the
city. The median home price in San Francisco is $407,000.

   Perhaps it really is about the company you keep. Because on this
soundtrack to Oliver Stone's football film the abundant rap acts
take their contributions to the extremes that Stone takes
conspiracy theories. Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott adds an almost
overpowering orchestra to a reminder to her boyfriend that she was
there before the money (``Who You Gonna Call''). The ``Reunion'' of
Capone-N-Noreaga is overblown by electronic horns. And at the other
end of the volume knob, LL Cool J whispers uncharacteristic
profanities in ``Shut 'Em Down.'' At least when rockers Hole and
P.O.D. pile on the guitars later it's what you expect. And with the
exception of actor/comedian Jamie Foxx's surprisingly smart team-up
with rappers Guru and Common on ``Any Given Sunday,'' many could
have scored with that: the expected.

<P>
   &QR;  ``Lake Placid'' (R) _ In this sometimes watchable,
underpopulated ``Jaws'' retread about a giant crocodile, the croc
attacks are predictable and rudimentary. This is the sort of movie
in which no one but bit players get their heads bitten off. Pity.
The scares aren't scary, the laughs aren't funny, and poor Bridget
Fonda has to keep falling off moving vehicles (boats, trucks)
directly into the path of the monster croc, like some 1940s hapless
heroine. Grade: C-

   &QR;  ``Relax ... It's Just Sex'' (unrated) _ Mitchell Anderson,
Jennifer Tilly and Lori Petty star in this big ensemble
comedy-drama about a group of gay and straight friends in Los
Angeles, falling in and out of love. The repartee and observations
are often sharp and witty, but midway through the movie loses its
focus. Grade: B-

   &QR;  ``Detroit Rock City'' (R) _ Kiss it off. This lame rip-off of
Robert Zemeckis' ``I Wanna Hold Your Hand'' chronicles the
misadventures of four die-hard Kiss fans as they try to crash their
idols' concert. Set in 1978, the film has a few amusing nostalgic
touches, but mostly it's a sorry collection of adolescent fantasies
that look almost quaint compared to what else went on in teen
movies last summer. Grade: D+

 &HT;    `Mystery Men' set out to save the city
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   It's a spoof! It's an adventure! No, it's an amiable mess! The
mystery about ``Mystery Men'' is why so many sharp actors signed on
for a movie needing several more rewrites. The good news is, it
provides some giggles. It's unpretentious and goofy. And the
presence of the masterfully deadpan Janeane Garofalo (as the
Bowler) elevates any party.
</P>
<P>
   She's part of a cast including William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and
Ben Stiller, playing would-be superheroes with dubious powers.
(Azaria, for instance, throws forks.) Their goal is to win some of
the crime-fighting glory enjoyed by Champion City's Captain Amazing
(Greg Kinnear, in fine sneering mode), but to do so they have to
battle master criminal Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush).
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the movie doesn't seem to know when it's mocking other
superhero flicks and when it's mocking itself. It's a comedy in
search of a real target and consistent rules. The movie is like its
hapless heroes. It's a wannabe that has the best intentions _
including a pronounced anti-gun stance _ but none of the knack it
takes to save the day, or itself.

 &HT;    A mind-blowing menagerie of maddening movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mental hospitals have often been the way to go for the
Oscar-hungry actor. Jack Nicholson won one for ``One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest.'' So did his co-star, Louise Fletcher. Olivia de
Havilland snagged a nomination for ``The Snake Pit,'' as did Brad
Dourif for ``Cuckoo's Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted,'' which opens Friday, may offer similar
opportunities for its two stars, Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie.
Here are some madhouse movies you might go nuts over:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' (1975; R): Ken Kesey's
'60s counterculture the-loonies-are-running-the-asylum novel was
just right as an anthem of anti-Establishment rebellion for early
'70s moviegoers. Kirk Douglas had been trying to make a movie out
of the material since 1963, when he brought a failed version to
Broadway. But it took his son Michael to finally get the project
onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson was first choice to play Randle P. McMurphy, the
social misfit (by the way, a convicted rapist in the book) who
feigns insanity to avoid prison for the ``cushier'' life in a state
mental institution. His antagonist, Nurse Ratched, was harder to
find because so many actresses found the role misogynistic. A
number of names turned it down _ reportedly, everyone from Jane
Fonda and Anne Bancroft to Ellen Burstyn and Geraldine Page _
before Fletcher, a relative unknown, was cast. Accepting the Oscar
for best actor, Nicholson deadpanned, ``Well, I guess this proves
there are as many nuts in the Academy as anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Snake Pit'' (1948; unrated): Though somewhat dated today
in terms of its attitude toward women and its methods of
psychiatric treatment, this is still a very watchable and sometimes
disturbing film. No wonder it was both a popular and a critical
success (six Academy Award nominations, including best picture). As
a depressed woman who suffers a breakdown and is committed, De
Havilland runs through a gamut of emotions _ including the
requisite transferal crush on her pipe-smoking therapist, Mark
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to the ward where they put the incurable cases
and where De Havilland, after a second breakdown, is temporarily
interred. Director Anatole Litvak's spiraling overhead shot,
receding from the mad inmates and reducing them to abstract
twitching figures, is still powerful 50 years later as is one
patient's plaintive rendition of ``Going Home'' that turns into an
eerie group sing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Bedlam'' (1946; unrated): The last of the Val Lewton horror
pictures for RKO (the run that began with ``Cat People''),
``Bedlam'' is actually more of a terrifying historical drama than a
horror flick.
</P>
<P>
   Based on William Hogarth's painting _ that's how the credits
read _ the movie stars Boris Karloff as the sadistic Master Sims,
villainous director of the celebrated 18th-century madhouse. When a
young actress (Anna Lee) tries to expose the asylum's unsavory
practices, she herself is falsely committed.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is far more lurid than Lewton's other pictures,
possibly because he was determined to show Bedlam _ or the St. Mary
Hospital for the Insane as it was fully known _ as accurately as
possible. As for Karloff, he always referred to Lewton as ``the man
who rescued me from the living dead and restored my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as
Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the
Direction of the Marquis de Sade'' (1966; R): The title is a
mouthful; the movie's a mind-full. No wonder Peter Brook's
production of Peter Weiss' brilliant Brechtian madhouse epic is
usually referred to by the shorthand title, ``Marat/Sade.''
</P>
<P>
   The film version retains the original cast, most of them members
of the Royal Shakespeare Company. It's still more theater piece
than film, despite the director's efforts to make it ``cinematic.''
But it retains every bit of its chaotic power as the assorted
lunatics act out their version of the French Revolution before an
invited audience of lacy aristocrats.
</P>
<P>
   And look for two-time Oscar winner Glenda Jackson as Charlotte
Corday. It was her first time in a movie and in her opinion, ``I
gave an over-the-top performance. Much too much.'' Many critics
disagreed.

 &HT;    Mann's melancholia blooms on `Magnolia'
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aimee Mann has mastered the art of sounding fragile. Reaching
back to ``Voices Carry,'' her 1985 hit with 'Til Tuesday, the
singer-songwriter's quavery, pitch-challenged voice and pain-soaked
lyrics have projected a wounded, world-weary image. There are
hordes of angsty artists out there, but few can nail low
self-esteem as Mann does, with lines such as ``Now that I've met
you, would you object to never seeing each other again?''
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson was so taken with that line
_ from Mann's melancholy ballad ``Deathly'' _ that he claims he
constructed his new movie ``Magnolia'' around it. A key character
in the sprawling drama utters a variation on the line, and Mann's
songs flutter throughout the movie, even, in one odd scene, landing
on the lips of all the main characters.
</P>
<P>
   If Mann's songs help drive ``Magnolia,'' they also stand on
their own in this collection. Her nine cuts, including a searingly
beautiful cover of Harry Nilsson's ``One,'' unfold with the
delicate grace of the title blossom. In the past, Mann's tentative
delivery has bordered on wan, but she's in full flower here, aided
by such hot-shot producers as Jon Brion and Brendan O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   If only Anderson, who compiled the soundtrack, had stuck with
Mann all the way through. The inclusion of two old chestnuts by
Supertramp and a disco trifle by Gabrielle breaks the mood. If you
want a pure slice of Mann's heartbreaking anguish, stop the CD
after the ninth track. If you want Supertramp, buy ``Breakfast in
America.''
</P>

 &HT;    Turn up the heat with horseradish-like wasabi
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless you are a fan of sushi, you may not be familiar with
wasabi, the horseradish-like condiment most often served as a dip
with Japanese delicacies. But if the prediction of food and dining
trend watcher and cookbook author Rozanne Gold pans out, that is
about to change. If the inclinations of New York foodies spread
elsewhere, and they often do, people will be giving hot chile
peppers a break as they look to wasabi to turn up the amps on not
only traditional Japanese dishes but all kinds of other foods, too.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gold, wasabi is beginning to be appreciated as a
complement to just about anything that needs a little heat. Readily
available in Asian markets, it's starting to show up on supermarket
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Fine wasabi is difficult to grow and prized like fine wine by
Japanese chefs. It fetches more than $100 a pound in Japan and $45
over here.
</P>
<P>
   We checked the Internet and in 10 minutes learned all about
wasabi except what it tastes like.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Many people call wasabi Japanese horseradish, but we learned
at www.wasabi.co.nz/meet.html that it's in the mustard family,
similar to brussels sprouts. What you eat from the plant is the
thickened stem or exposed root, which is ground into a
sinus-clearing, pungent green paste. The site also provides more
detailed botanical information and relates a news service article
reporting that some researchers claim wasabi may stop the growth of
stomach cancer cd that it is commonly regarded to be
effective in preventing food poisoning. There are recipes for a
host of spicy dips, dressings, marinades and sauces and many
Japanese recipes as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pacific Farms, a supplier of fresh wasabi at
www.freshwasabi.com/recipes.html, says not to be fooled. The green
paste on the side of your sushi dish is rarely real wasabi. More
commonly it is ordinary horseradish with food coloring added. When
wasabi is used fresh, they say, it has a heat component that,
unlike chile peppers, is not long-lived on the palette and subsides
into an extremely pleasant, mild vegetable that even people who
normally dislike spicy foods can enjoy. The site includes other
interesting facts and recipes, including those for marinated
vegetables and wasabi and garlic wings. A sample box of fresh
plants, enough for eight people, cold packed and shipped overnight,
runs $22.90. They also include a special grater and instructions.
Wasabi releases its heat only when grated finely, not when chopped
up like a carrot. After grating it should be allowed to stand for
about 15 minutes to release its full flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It's hard to stay ahead of the Internet on much of anything,
but as far as wasabi recipes, we found that instead of the usual 10
million recipes available for any other given ingredient, wasabi
had comparatively few. The sites mentioned above have the best
variety of recipes, enough to get you started and ahead of the
curve. For an intriguing recipe for Crabmeat Batons With Soy
Dipping Sauce and Wasabi Cream by chef Robert Bruce of New Orleans'
Palace Cafe, see www.nawlins.com/rec23.html.
</P>
<P>

wasabi, see www.seattletimes.com

 &HT;    Hershey's classic is frosting on cake for chocolate lovers
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After running Doris Goodin's e-mail request for the
chocolate icing from a Hershey's Cocoa can from about 1980, we
learned that some people have held on to the familiar dark brown
cans as if they were collectors' tins.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Parella of Tucker, Ga., took one she said is at least 30
years old off her shelf and copied the recipe for us. Yvonne
Roberts of Snellville, Ga., referred to hers purchased in 1972, the
year she was married; and Marcy Sproull of Rockmart, Ga., sent a
photocopy of the side of a tin from the '80s that she saved when
she cleaned out her father's house after his death.
</P>
<P>
   The frosting recipe, tested and given here along with the
Chocolate Town Special Cake on the cocoa cans, was the same through
the decades.
</P>
<P>
   Proving once again that some good things never change.

OMIKRON'S NETHER WORLD OF CYBERKARMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(af) 
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In David Cronenberg's science-fiction horror film, ``Existenz,''
there is a moment when a character is seized by the impulse to eat
a dubious plate of food in the virtual reality game he's playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disgusting,'' he says, ``but I can't help myself.'' It
turns out that the crustacean he's eating contains parts of a gun
he must use later in the game. His vocal cords were temporarily
possessed by the system, to further the plot.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of moments like this in Omikron: The Nomad Soul,
a cyberpunk sci-fi adventure developed in France. Like most French
games, it's aesthetically gorgeous _ the interactive love child of
``Blade Runner'' and ``The Fifth Element,'' with a soundtrack by
David Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   It's highly cinematic, constantly segueing into letter-boxed
dramatic sequences in which the player has no participation. In
fact, it's less of a game than a fractured film on a 3-D sound
stage that the player must traverse in a particular fashion, sans
script.
</P>
<P>
   The game's conceit is that the player has been drawn through a
portal into the fantasy world of Omikron. On the other side of the
computer screen, your soul inhabits the body of Kay'l, a police
officer enmeshed in a conspiracy that involves the criminal
underworld, a revolutionary cult, the corrupt military government
and insidious high-tech corporations in league with Canaanite
demons _ standard fare.
</P>
<P>
   If Kay'l dies, your soul transfers into the next character who
touches him. Hence the game's subtitle, The Nomad Soul. Later in
the game, you can hop between characters at will, possessing the
bodies of guards, thugs, mercenaries and a number of innocent
bystanders, male and female. That ostensibly gives you a lot of
control and freedom to maneuver with impunity through Omikron's
dark streets, back alleys and dives.
</P>
<P>
   But your sense of control and the illusion of freedom are
frequently shattered by the game's tendency to take hold of the
puppet strings, prompting your character to take actions that have
no rational basis. For instance, you visit Sergeant Boog, head of
internal affairs at the police station. After some small talk, your
character says, ``I have a gift for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The game prompts you to call up your inventory. Meanwhile, the
burly sergeant looks up from his desk expectantly. You tap
everything you're carrying: police badge, weapon and ammunition,
money, scraps of paper. A beverage? Sandwich? The situation rapidly
becomes awkward.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that you were supposed to pick up a girlie poster
at the local sex shop to curry favor with Sarge. (Even though
Omikron is listed as being for ages 13 and up, it seems more
appropriate for people 17 and up.) In return, he's supposed to give
you the security headquarters master key, which gets you into your
dead partner's office. But if you didn't procure the nude pinup,
you're pitched into a schizophrenic conversational cul-de-sac from
which you can only pedal backward.
</P>
<P>
   You have lunch with your wife. You're about to tell her
something important when you're paged _ there's a supermarket
holdup nearby. You are invisible to your wife after that. Even
after you take down the supermarket gunmen and return to the
restaurant, she is oblivious to your presence.
</P>
<P>
   But then, most of Omikron is oblivious to your presence.
Hundreds of people are on the street but don't see you. If you step
into their paths, they simply continue on their way. Call girls
sidle up and shift their weight suggestively, but you can't hire
them. You can't even talk to them. The only people who will talk to
you are beggars, and they say only one sentence after you give them
money.
</P>
<P>
   So when story characters come out of the woodwork, it feels
stagy.
</P>
<P>
   Like, oh, you're talking to me, so I'm supposed to do something
really obvious now, and I'll be cued with the right line in a
second. How's the movie so far?
</P>
<P>
   That sort of scripted interaction didn't seem so jarring in
early computer games, in which the graphics were equally crude. But
in a universe whose surface is so finely detailed, it's surreal to
be surrounded by automatons (particularly when there are no street
signs). Especially if you've spent any time in a persistent
multiplayer world like Everquest or Ultima Online, where there are
thousands of characters animated by human beings and their subplots
and relationships and histories.
</P>
<P>
   Those worlds feel full because they convey a sense of human
presence. Omikron feels empty because its characters are walking
props. The buildings seem hollow because you know that no one is
living in them.
</P>
<P>
   No one is home, anywhere, ever. Everybody who acknowledges you
is a robot.
</P>

 &HT;    JUSTICES SEEM SKEPTICAL OF GRANDPARENTS' VISITATION RIGHTS
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Supreme Court justices seemed skeptical
Wednesday about laws guaranteeing child visitation rights as they
heard a case brought by a Washington state couple seeking a bigger
role in their grandchildren's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mark D. Olson, representing the grandparents, Jennifer
and Gary Troxel, argued that it would be in the best interests of
Isabelle, 8, and Natalie, 10, be able to visit their grandparents
more often.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said that if the grandparents were allowed to play a
bigger role in the girls' lives, the memory of their deceased
father would be preserved, and they will know kinship and where
they came from.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Catherine Smith responded that parents are in
the best position to decide what's best for their children and who
they can visit, and the courts should give parents that freedom as
long as the children are not being harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our society, parents decide who their children are going to
be with, what TV shows they watch and what candy they eat,'' Smith
said. ``We should not take that right away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the justices expressed doubts about the Washington
law the Troxels cited in their suit. The broadly worded law allows
visitation rights if the visits are in the child's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be in the best interest of a lot of children to be
taken from their parents, but parents have rights,'' said Justice
Antonin Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and several others said the ``best
interest'' argument would make it possible for anyone _ relative or
not _ to petition the court for visitation rights.
</P>
<P>
   Olson responded that the argument has been used in 48 states for
more than 40 years, to determine similar cases, and that it should
apply to this one.
</P>
<P>
   Some justices who criticized the Washington law, including
Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens, also
acknowledged the ``special relationship'' between some grandparents
and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' father, Brad Troxel, committed suicide in 1993, and
their mother, Tommie Granville, who is being sued by the Troxels,
has had custody of them. Granville limited the time the children
could spend with the Troxels, leading to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a trial judge decided that the grandparents should be
allowed visitation one weekend per month, one week during the
summer and four hours on each of the girls' birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Washington Court of Appeals reversed the visitation
order, saying that ``nonparents lack standing to petition for
visitation, unless there is a pending custody proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, the Washington Supreme Court struck down the
visitation law, saying the state could not interfere with parents'
fundamental rights in raising their children when there is no proof
that the children are being harmed.

INTERNET GIVES RISE TO A NEW WAVE OF PORNOGRAPHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(mk) 
 By BRUCE HEADLAM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may have started as an academic exercise, but the Internet
most days looks more like the top shelf of a corner-store magazine
rack. From search results clogged with sex sites to e-mail boxes
that fill up with ``XXX'' subject lines to innocent-looking links
that lead to red-light sites, pornography seems inescapable online.
And, to the dismay of most parents, the Internet does not come
wrapped in plain brown paper.
</P>
<P>
   Have centerfolds simply migrated to the Web, or has there been a
more profound shift in the nature and the influence of pornography?
In ``Obscene Profits: The Entrepreneurs of Pornography in the Cyber
Age'' (Routledge; $27.50.), Frederick S. Lane III argues the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   Modern technology, from deregulated phone services to the
Internet, changed the pornography business and has enabled
pornography to make an impressive advance into the mainstream. For
the cost of a server and a Web cam, anyone can become an online
pornographer.
</P>
<P>
   A new wave of entrepreneurs, including, Lane tells us, many
women, is threatening the hegemony of old-style men's publications
like Playboy and Penthouse with not only the sheer amount of online
images but also their explicitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nightmare out there,'' Larry Flynt, the publisher of
Hustler, told Forbes magazine in 1996. ``This has to be affecting
revenues of people like myself.''
</P>
<P>
   If Flynt is having nightmares, maybe we should all be scared.
Lane estimates that there are between 30,000 and 60,000
sex-oriented Web sites and innumerable phone-sex lines, chat rooms
and video mail-order services. The pornography industry is ``an
increasingly significant sector of the economy,'' he writes,
grossing at least $10 billion a year in this country. That is more,
the book says, than Americans spend on sports events and live music
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, a lawyer with more than a touch of the moralist, will get
a sympathetic reading from most casual Web surfers. One reason sex
on the Web seems increasingly alarming is aesthetic. Online
pornography isn't simply Playboy for people who think that staples
ruin the mood. With its raunchy home-grown fare and pixelated
images, the Net takes the velvet smoking jacket off pornography and
replaces it with the technological crudity of an 8-mm film. Even
``soft porn'' images on the Web appear to have what Simone de
Beauvoir called the ``intention to defile.'' They not only look
dirty; they feel dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Depressing as all that may be, the ubiquity of sex sites does
not mean that pornography has entered the cultural or financial
mainstream, as Lane suggests. In fact, much of the evidence in his
book suggests the opposite: that although pornography occupies the
same niche on the Internet as in the rest of society, it is neither
as prevalent nor as profitable as critics might think.
</P>
<P>
   Let' with the money. Pornographers may profit from
obscenity, but the profits themselves aren't all that obscene.
Although $10 billion may seem like a lot of money, compared with
national vices like tobacco ($45 billion) or gambling ($50
billion), it is small potatoes. Some of the entrepreneurs Lane
interviews make, at best, a reasonable living. Jane Duvall, who
runs the popular Jane's 'Net Sex Guide site, said that she made
more money at her previous job, handling advertising accounts at a
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Playboy sites, which are among the most popular sex-related
destinations on the Web, have yet to turn a profit. Internet
Entertainment Group is probably the best known of the new class of
pornography companies, thanks to its lucrative Club Love site and
its nude pictures of B-list celebrities. Its founder, Seth
Warshavsky, is often regarded in the press as a technological
wunderkind, but his company has been continually frustrated in its
attempts to go public on a Wall Street where the gold standard is
just about anything followed by the dot-com suffix.
</P>
<P>
   Other pornographic video and Internet companies that have gone
public have hardly set the market on fire, so although investors
may like the novelty of a stock certificate showing naked women,
they would be better off buying bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Lane's book is that it is long on history but
short on historical perspective. Pornography has tried _ and failed
_ to gain mainstream acceptance before, usually by attaching itself
to another social current. Hugh Hefner built Playboy in the
corporate image of 1950s Madison Avenue. In the early '70s, the
sex-film business rose and fell in the wake of the sexual
revolution. Today, as Lane's subtitle suggests, pornography
attaches to the preoccupation with entrepreneurs, particularly
online entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But entrepreneurship, even in the Digital Age, has limits. Until
recently, sex sites had been operating with limited opposition from
the courts, aiming at a group that was demographically and
psychographically handpicked for pornography (young, male,
maladjusted) at a time when very few sites were making money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, competition is squeezing profits, and Lane notes that
pornographic sites that once charged $29.95 for monthly access are
now hard-pressed to charge $10. And pornographic sites are facing
more competition from the Web as a whole. As the online world
continues to grow, pornography will probably occupy a smaller place
in it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a more interesting question is what the social effects
of the technology migration of pornography might be. To buy or see
dirty pictures 15 years ago, you needed money, adult identification
and no sense of shame. Today, all you need is a modem and a credit
card. That means that marginal tastes, including dangerous ones
like pedophilia, are more easily satisfied. But it could also mean
that pornography's public blight _ the sex shops and peep shows _
will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   For both social conservatives who wanted Times Square cleaned up
and for liberals concerned with the First Amendment, that would
seem like a partial victory. Maybe that is why nobody seems happy.

 &HT;    HISTORIAN IS PRESSED IN COURT TO REJECT HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    600&AMP;add 
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON Jr. 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Maverick historical writer David Irving on Wednesday
evaded attempts in court to show that his public statements prove
that he rejects the conventional understanding of the Holocaust _ a
central issue in his libel suit against a professor from Atlanta's
Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the judge to give his interpretation of the Holocaust,
Irving offered a cautiously worded response. ``The Holocaust is the
tragedy that befell the Jewish in World War II,'' he said. ``But it
was the whole of the Second World War and the people who died were
not just Jews but gypsies and homosexuals, the people of Coventry
and the people of Hiroshima.''
</P>
<P>
   But later on cross examination, he denied as a ``big lie'' that
millions of Jews were killed in gas chambers at Nazi death camps or
that their extermination was part of a systematic campaign by the
Third Reich and its leader, Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Irving is suing professor Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher
Penguin Books for libel over her 1994 book, ``Denying the
Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.'' The book
depicts the self-made historian as a ``Holocaust denier'' who
twists history to support his belief that the scope of the mass
murder has been greatly exaggerated. He believes Jews have sought
to use the Holocaust story in a campaign to get increased
reparations from the German people.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream historians and others who accept the traditional
story of the Nazi's systematic slaughter of more than 6 million
Jews see the case as an opportunity to confront a well-known source
of what they consider misinformation over what really happened.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's public position on the Holocaust is central to his
argument that the book defamed him by untruthfully asserting that
he denies the Holocaust occurred. While many of Irving's public
statements seem to indicate that he has disputed the existence of
the Holocaust, Irving insisted that he only denied certain aspects
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deny that the Nazis could have liquidated millions of people
at gas chambers at any of their locations during the Third Reich,''
he said. He believes the gas chambers at Auschwitz were actually
built after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who is representing himself, said the logistics of
disposing of so many bodies would have been overwhelming, even for
the Germans. ``One million people weigh 100,000 tons _ it's a major
logistical problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nazis did murder many Jews, said Irving, who offered an estimate
of between 1 million and 4 million victim. But he said the evidence
indicates that the killing program was operated at a level below
Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Irving contends that Hitler was unaware of mass killings of Jews
until 1943. He also believes that Hitler actually was opposed to
such mass killings early in the war and gave orders to prevent the
slaughter of Jews and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a chain of documents that show that Hitler was a
negative influence (on the campaign to kill Jews),'' Irving said.
``There is no equal document chain to indicate that he was a
positive influence.''
</P>
<P>
   However, lead defense attorney Richard Rampton introduced a 1942
document sent to Hitler that reported that more than 363,000 Jews
had been killed in Poland. The defense intends to rely upon scores
of documents and expert witnesses to assail Irving's unorthodox
view of history.
</P>
<P>
   Irving responded that Hitler was probably too busy to take note
of this. ``He had a lot on his plate at that time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who has been accused of twisting facts to exonerate
Hitler, said he believed the dictator's reign was not all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when he was on the course and then he ran off
the rails,'' he said. ``You cannot praise his racial programs or
his penal methods, but he did pick his nation up out of the mire
and reunify it and gave it a sense of pride again.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving also defended himself against the book's passages linking
him to radical groups such as the Iranian-backed Hamas and
Hezbollah, the Nation of Islam and the Russian neo-Nazi group
Pamyat. While he didn't specifically deny any ties to these groups,
he said it was unfair to consider him guilty by association.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in general he did not consort with terrorists but
acknowledged that he knows people with views that others may
consider extreme. ``These people are extremists in the views of the
expert witnesses,'' he said. ``This is a very subjective
viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who is not a lawyer, often sounded more like someone
involved in a dissertation rather than someone trying to craft a
legal case. As an indicator of the mass of material he intends to
introduce into evidence, he said he had provided court reporters
with a spelling guide to 5,000 names he will be mentioning over the
course of what is expected to be a three-month trial.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Rampton said he was puzzled by Irving's
intentions. ``I don't have a clue what his case is,'' he told the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Charles Gray, a former libel lawyer, patiently
prodded Irving with questions and advice as the historian took the
stand as the first witness in his own case.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Irving appeared to be wearing the judge's patience thin
on only the second day of the trial. After introducing two
videotapes _ one of them lengthy _ with debatable relevance, Gray
warned him that he needed to deal with challenges to his
credibility as a historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's got to be grappled with _ the sooner the better
as far as I'm concerned,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial resumes Thursday.

EBAY ADDICT'S DIARY: BUY HIGH, SELL LOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am an eBay addict. I write that now with barely a twinge.
</P>
<P>
   For a long timeuded myself into thinking I only bought
essential items, like the 37 pieces of green glassware that I
needed to fill the alarmingly large and empty shelves of the
(third) desk on the first floor. Or the Cultural Revolution poster
that almost hides the crack on the den wall. Or the vintage flour
sifter, which my husband claims also sifts a little rust into cake
batter. ``That's cinnamon,'' I said (addiction symptom: lying).
</P>
<P>
   Then a few weeks ago, I saw an eBay listing for a used doll:
``Baby All Gone eats with a `magic spoon,' has soft pink body and
hard head, hardly played with.'' I bid $11 (symptom: failing to
think to self, `Yecch').
</P>
<P>
   I was outbid. I pored over the bid history (symptom: feeling
envious of person who buys worthless junk) and saw that the had bid $26.
</P>
<P>
   That astronomical amount jolted me. I had assumed that the
online auction bubble had burst, or at least deflated a little.
Sure, eBay has grown into a giant, becoming the world's biggest
flea market and offering 2.9 million items last week alone. But the
site has become increasingly complicated to navigate. Categories of
merchandise overlap. And bidders were bound to grow more
sophisticated. Even I was unwilling to bid at times, remembering an
identical item offered earlier at a better price. The crazy auction
madness of 1999 that saw millions of people trading the contents of
their attic for the contents of someone else's seemed as distant as
Dutch tulip-bulb mania.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there was no way to gauge this because eBay
refuses to release statistics on the percentage of items that sell
_ or even get a single bid. ``That statistic is not released by any
auction house, and it's too bad,'' said Martin De Bono, a senior
analyst at Gomez Advisors, which ranks online auctioneers at
www.gomez.com. An eBay spokeswoman told me that the company
considers sales figures proprietary. But, she added, $8 million
worth of merchandise sells every day.
</P>
<P>
   It then occurred to me that I could test eBay's staying power.
Instead of buying truckloads of stuff, I could sell, maybe from the
same pile of, er, collectibles that I had amassed over the last
year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   I had the perfect test item: a certain pink Depression-era glass
vase I had purchased a few months ago for about $12. (According to
De Bono, 70 percent of online auction buyers purchase items that
cost less than $100.) And, while not the sort of item that would
necessarily elicit a Baby All Gone level of demand, it had a subtle
charm.
</P>
<P>
   Would I make money after eBay took its cut? The site's charges
can add up fast. First, there is a listing fee, ranging from 25
cents to $2, depending on an item's opening value. The site also
takes a percentage _ generally from 1.25 percent to 5 percent _ of
the sale price. Sellers also pay to set a reserve price or to
include a photo in eBay's Gallery (where buyers preview thumbnails
of items) or even to list their items in bold type. If I did
without boldface, I would need only to sell at $12.85 to break
even.
</P>
<P>
   I followed the remarkably easy listing process on the eBay site.
I registered so that eBay would be able to charge my credit card.
Then I set the length of the auction (seven days), to choose from
among hundreds of listing categories (Pottery and Glass:
Depression: Anchor Hocking) and to upload an image to accompany my
listing. Here I deviated from the instructions slightly, playing
cards online while my husband took a digital photo of the vase,
edited it, uploaded it to my AOL home page, then embedded a link in
my listing. Although I was distracted by a particularly tense
online game of hearts, I think he worked for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, at 7:38:05 PST, Item No. 226,790,186, ``Pink Fired
On Deco Vase,'' went live on eBay, soliciting an opening bid of $8.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly one week later, the auction closed _ with no bids.
</P>
<P>
   I was out 25 cents and my suspicions about online auctions were
strengthened. I could relist the item, and if it sold, I would not
have to pay an additional 25-cent listing fee. But if I failed
again? I'd be out 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Then I considered a worse possibility: no one liked my vase. At
that moment, it didn't matter to me that none of the three listings
described as ``fired on vases'' had gotten a single bid that week.
Nor did I care that neither did 17 of the 46 items in my category
whose auctions ended in the same five-hour period. No, my personal
taste was in question. I had spent (approximately) $12 for a vase
that apparently no one else wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Or did I just have a bad listing?
</P>
<P>
   For advice, I phoned Annette Graf, an online seller since early
1998 whose many successes _ she once sold a vintage Raggedy Ann
sewing pattern on eBay for more than $100 _ prompted her to write
and self-publish a book called ``How to Sell on eBay and Other
Online Auctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Critiquing my listing, Ms. Graf offered these tips: ``Relist it
in the middle of the day, when the most people are online, because
it will go to the top of the chronological list in the category.
Also, give it a good description so people will want to buy it. And
you might want to list it in a more general category, where more
people will see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The very existence of books like Ms. Graf's _ Amazon.com sells
more than a dozen books on the same topic _ suggests that selling
on eBay may require a lot more work than merely listing on Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   I made the changes. This time, I got one bid and sold my
``WONDERFUL Fired On Deco Vase.'' For $8. So, I went down to the
kitchen and dug out the rusty sifter. I am an eBay addict. And I'm
not alone.

Q&AMP;A: GEARING UP FOR USB 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(mk) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is there any way I can use USB devices if my computer has no
USB ports?
</P>
<P>
   A: Computers made before 1997 do not generally support the
Universal Serial Bus standard, but it might be possible to upgrade
your machine, depending on the type of computer and operating
system you are using. But there are a few hardware and software
factors to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies make USB add-in cards that will fit in one of a
computer's PCI slots on the motherboard. Adding such a card, which
can be as simple as adding a network card or a sound card, can give
you two or four USB ports on the back of your computer. A two-port
card for either a Windows PC or a Macintosh costs about $40. You
must have an available PCI slot on your motherboard and operating
system software that can handle USB.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95 has only limited support for USB, so it would be
advisable to upgrade to Windows 98, which offers full support.
Windows 98 users can download a free USB evaluation utility program
from www.usb.org/faq/ans3.html(NU)q1 that will check their hardware
and software for compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   Some USB cards require Macintosh users to be running recent
versions of the Mac operating system, and Mac owners may want to
download the USB Card Support patch from the software updates area
of Apple's Web site (asu.info.apple.com).

   The ball was dropped. There were no Y2K bugs. Now, what to do
with those goofy year 2000 eyeglasses, the plastic-stemmed wine
glasses, bottle openers, sequin-encrusted party hats, paper plates,
calendars and the Evian millennium bottle of water?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's wacko, wonderful or wow, save it,'' said Alex Shear, a
collector of popular American culture. (For him, that meant a sign
from a grocery store advertising ``Y2K water.'')
</P>
<P>
   But historically, few huge events have created valuable
keepsakes. Even if you acquire a collection of millennial hats and
swizzle sticks, you are not likely to make a killing. ``It's rarity
that makes things valuable,'' said Matthew Weigman, a spokesman for
Sotheby's. ``There were too many Y2K souvenirs made for most of
them to appreciate.''
</P>
<P>
   To put it in perspective, 1939 World's Fair souvenirs are just
now becoming desirable holdings. So you should be in it for the
long haul. Find a sturdy cardboard box and create a home-grown time
capsule. When you fill the carton, put a family spin on it: write a
letter describing what you did on New Year's Eve 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Allan, a 12-year-old British boy who lives in London and
was lucky enough to have watched the spectacular fireworks display
on the Thames, recalled his most cherished memory of the festive
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating an entire package of Twisties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If his parents save a Twisties package along with the millennial
mugs, banners, T-shirts, magazines, newspapers and cereal boxes,
that memory will be there if he opens the time capsule with his
children and grandchildren in the year 2050. The highest guaranteed
value for millennial keepsakes is that they will remind descendants
who those dowdy old Twistie-eating ancestors were. &QL;

COMING TO A SUPERMARKET NEAR YOU: FOOD IN MULTIPACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Supermarkets are starting to look a lot like warehouse clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Multipacks, once the province of Sam's and Costco, are now
stocked in neighborhood grocery stores in every department, from
pet food to canned soup to the refrigerator cases.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first beneficiaries of bundling was the family pet.
Nine Lives began by shrink-wrapping four cans of cat food and
selling them, in the North Texas market, for 99 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that consumers would buy a certain amount of pet food
per visit,'' says Michael Mullen, company spokesman. ``If they
usually buy seven cans per visit they can grab two four-packs.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost savings, Mullen says, really go to the retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's faster to stock the four-packs on the shelves,'' he says,
``and it's faster to scan one unit than four individual cans.''
</P>
<P>
   Too, labels are less likely to tear, and cans packed together
are less likely to get dented, meaning that fewer items have to be
discarded or marked down.
</P>
<P>
   A year after it introduced the packaging, Nine Lives sells all
27 of its varieties in four-packs only. Although it all sounds like
retailing and consumer convenience, Mullen does say that one upshot
of the multipack packaging is that his brand is taking market share
from other cat-food brands.
</P>
<P>
   It was only natural for Nine Lives' parent company, Starkist, to
move the bulk-packaging concept to its tuna line. After all, 70
percent of all supermarket shoppers buy canned tuna. Because it's
such a pantry staple, it's logical to offer it in three-packs.
</P>
<P>
   Product popularity was also the reason that Campbell has been
offering its chicken noodle and tomato soups in four-packs. Both
soups, along with the company's cream of mushroom soup, rank in the
top 10 sellers in U.S. grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered 12-packs of soup as a short-term promotion in the
fall for Y2K. The promotion was in response to trade requests to a
lot of other people in the (grocery) business,'' says John Faulkner
of Campbell Soup Co. ``It was a short-term thing that we don't plan
to continue right now.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the company is offering four-packs of its chicken
noodle soup and its tomato soup in some national markets.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt's is selling its tomato soup in four-packs, and Chef
Boyardee is bundling its canned ravioli into six-packs. Because
they're canned, both products make bulk sense. But look in the
refrigerator case, and you'll find a product that might be
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury's is selling its Poppin' Fresh refrigerated biscuits
in four-packs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've surveyed consumers to find out how often they use
refrigerated biscuits, and they way overestimate how often they use
them,'' Pillsbury spokesman Marlene Johnson says. ``They do that
with a lot of products they like. So we figure if we offer them in
multipacks, and they've got them in the refrigerator, they'll use
them.''

   ``Andy Kaufman Revealed!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Bob Zmuda with Matthew Scott Hansen &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Biography &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown, $24 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andy Kaufman was so weird that he imitated Elvis Presley BEFORE
ELVIS DIED.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that. Consider that this was also a man who was a firm
believer in transcendental meditation AND who sang the ``Mighty
Mouse'' theme on ``Saturday Night Live'' _ AND took an entire Radio
City Music Hall audience out for milk and cookies after a show AND
botched his career by insisting on wrestling women, even when it
became apparent that most of America found said wrestling
spectacularly unfunny.
</P>
<P>
   Was he a complex guy or just a troubled nut job who came up with
some great groundbreaking anti-comedy before imploding his career?
A genius or a troubled soul who retreated into a world of fantasy
at a young age and never came back?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows. But whatever he was, Kaufman is now a genuine big
deal all over again: lionized in song by R.E.M. and the subject of
a Milos Forman biopic, ``Man on the Moon'' starring Jim Carrey,
Kaufman is also the subject of two new biographies, ``Lost in the
Funhouse: The Life and Mind of Andy Kaufman,'' by Bill Zehme, and
``Andy Kaufman Revealed!,'' by his old pal Bob Zmuda (with help
from Matthew Scott Hansen).
</P>
<P>
   My advice to anyone interested in the man? Read both. This may
sound like overkill, but both books are so interesting _ and so
different stylistically and in point of view _ that reading both
never feels like an exercise or a chore.
</P>
<P>
   Zehme is a well-known journalist and the author of ``The Way You
Wear Your Hat,'' a fascinating study of Frank Sinatra's life and
style. ``Funhouse'' is every bit as readable; Zehme writes with a
verve that is rare among biographers, sometimes letting the prose
go into a voice reminiscent of Kaufman's own speech patterns. His
is a more true biography, with more info on Kaufman's life and the
perspective of people around him.
</P>
<P>
   Zmuda, on the other hand, provides a fly-on-the-wall view: He
was Kaufman's pal and partner in crime. Zmuda's book is also nicely
loose in style and portrays daily life with Kaufman _ which appears
to have been at once exhilarating and disquieting.
</P>
<P>
   Reading both books together is rewarding because of the
differences in point of view, and how much emphasis is put on
different events in Kaufman's life. And, truly, Kaufman's strange
and ultimately sad life warrant such close examination: That
neither effort really solves the mystery of how far Kaufman was
taking the joke (or if he even knew where the line was between
funny and merely obnoxious) makes both books (and Kaufman) all the
more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   We can examine this guy's life all we want, and interview as
many old cronies and former cast members as we would like, but the
lurking truth is that nobody will ever really know what was going
on in Kaufman's mind _ that it may have been a territory that
defied understanding, even by him.

BETTER DIGITAL IMAGES IN SMALLER FILES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(mk) 
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer science may seem like mathematics to outsiders, but to
real mathematicians it is closer to basic arithmetic than it is to
the higher mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   But computer science is discovering that sophisticated math can
be very helpful in one of the most important and potentially
lucrative Web activities: the delivery of images and audio signals.
The math is needed for the compression of big files into smaller
files that take less time to download.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most anticipated compression technologies for images,
JPEG 2000, uses a set of math functions called ``wavelets.'' Using
waves to describe repetitive areas of an image is a standard part
of compression. Instead of all the ones and zeroes to represent
each spot of dark or light, for instance, the formula for a wave
can provide the information for repetitive variations, making it
possible to reconstruct the image with a much smaller pot of
digital data.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most image compression systems used cosines,
familiar to most former high school trigonometry students. Both the
JPEG and MPEG systems, common today in digital cameras and digital
satellite systems, model a picture as a combination of several
cosine waves.
</P>
<P>
   The wavelet approaches also model the image as the combination
of a number of different waves, but they rely on a wider variety of
more complicated waves. Having a larger selection means that fewer
waves can do a better job of describing an image.
</P>
<P>
   Some new compression programs select particular waves that work
best for particular subjects. A picture of a text document, for
instance, has many sharp, high-contrast edges outlining the
letters. Sharply varying waves do a better job in modeling the
photo, so they also do a better job in compressing it. A photo of a
cloud-filled sky, however, has many subtle variations in blues and
whites. Smoother waves often produce smaller compressed files in
those cases.
</P>
<P>
   The original JPEG format, named after the Joint Photographic
Experts Group, which developed it, emerged in 1988. The same group,
made up of both academics and industry representatives, decided to
update the format using some of the latest wavelet research in
1995. When the group set a schedule that would produce a new
standard file format in 2000, it chose the name JPEG 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The wavelet software also uses what is called multiresolution
analysis to do more complicated compression. The first step is to
compress the whole photograph without paying much attention to
details. Then the program measures the quality of that
approximation and devotes more time to analyzing the regions that
are rendered poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a photo of mountains and a perfectly blue sky. The first
round of the multiresolution wavelet compression would do a good
job of modeling the sky, which has little detail, but it would fail
to capture all the detail of the mountains' majesty. The algorithm
would then reanalyze the lower part of the picture at a greater
resolution while ignoring the top part.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, multiresolution analysis is responsible for the
great success that many are reporting with the trial versions of
the JPEG 2000 format. The older JPEG format simply broke up each
image into 8-by-8 blocks of pixels, which was quite wasteful when
the sky turned out to be a 100-by-100 block of blue.
</P>
<P>
   The German company Luratech is a major contributor to the JPEG
2000 committee and is also trying to develop more advanced
solutions that it might keep proprietary. At this time, the JPEG
2000 group suggests that Part One of the standard will be available
free but Part Two can contain proprietary technology protected by
patents. Anyone who wanted to use the more advanced solutions would
need to negotiate a license.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Luo, director of marketing for the U.S. branch of Luratech,
said the company had already developed a proposed Part 2 extension
of the JPEG 2000 algorithm that identifies text and uses a special
wave for those regions. ``It separates the document into text and
image regions,'' she said, ``and it compresses the image using a
standard wave and the text region using a bitonal compression
algorithm. You can get 200-to-1 compression rates and keep the text
legible.''
</P>
<P>
   Segregating the free and patented parts of the format is a
challenge for the JPEG 2000 committee. Many Web developers are
frustrated by the fact that part of the popular GIF format is
protected by patents, and some Web designers are moving to a
royalty-free version known as PNG, for portable network graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The committee must tread a fine line. If the format has too many
patented pieces and requires too many license fees, no one will
adopt it. But if it is too open, the companies that paid for the
research behind the standard will not get any revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The JPEG 2000 format also promises to take new steps to address
the concerns of copyright holders. It will include two mechanisms
for adding tags that designate an image's ownership. One solution,
referred to as a ``license plate,'' will attach a number to each
image. That will help copyright holders track the use of the image
and collect royalties. JPEG 2000 will also allow invisible
watermarks to be embedded in an image. The watermarks will remain
even if an artist transfers the image to another document by
cutting and pasting.
</P>
<P>
   The JPEG 2000 standard will encounter plenty of competition.
There are already dozens of wavelet-based tools for special
applications on the market. Apple's Quicktime software, for
instance, lets the user add many extra algorithms, including ones
based on even more mathematical notions, like fractals.
</P>
<P>
   Still others wonder if there will be that much gain. Several
independent observers who posted their thoughts on the Internet and
the bulletin board Slashdot.org noted that an intelligent user
could coax better performance out of the older standards. One
poster on the Net commented that JPEG 2000 would succeed just
because it combines an acronym with a good history with an
up-to-date suffix.

AN END TO COMPUTER CHIPS SPEED?

 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last 50 years, the increasing speed of computers has
been as much a constant as the outstretched arm of the tax
collector. While that good fortune is bound to come to an end
eventually, teams of scientists and engineers continue to produce
faster and faster machines. They accomplish that by a mixture of
clever new designs and an old-fashioned devotion to cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
   None of the dire predictions about the end of innovation have
come true yet, said Robert Dreyer, a former Intel chip designer who
is now studying at Harvard. ``The end is always 10 years away,'' he
said. ``As you get closer to the end, the engineers find new ways
to push it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer chips are enormously complicated machines, but their
operation can be explained by a few simple principles. All the
decision-making about where the pop-up windows will be on the
screen, which monster will explode or how the modem will squawk
depends upon the movement of packets of electrons between
transistors, the switches that direct the flow of current on a
chip.
</P>
<P>
   A full packet means one thing to a transistor, and an empty
packet or, more precisely, the absence of a packet, means the
opposite. Each chip has millions of tiny packets moving among
millions of transistors at the same time, and somehow they manage
to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   The chip designers make computers faster with two basic tricks.
First, they arrange for the packets to get where they're going just
a bit sooner. That is usually accomplished by making the chip
smaller. If the wires are shorter, the electrons will arrive
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the best and most consistent trick for computer
designers, but it requires a huge investment in the plants for
manufacturing the chips. Today, many of the cutting-edge chips are
made with wires 0.18 microns wide. The next generation will be 0.15
microns wide. A human hair is about 100 microns wide. Specks of
dirt or any other contaminants can foul the chips, so the plants
must be kept very clean.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, chip designers stumble upon an entirely new
chemical process for building chips that also accelerates the
movement of the electrons. Recently, IBM discovered how to build
the wires out of copper instead of aluminum. In the past, copper
was not used because no one could prevent it from dissolving into
the silicon foundation of the chip and creating short circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Now the better conductivity of copper ensures that the electrons
get there with less effort, making it possible for the whole chip
to run faster. That process is used in many of IBM's chips and is
also licensed to Motorola for the new G4 chips it makes for Apple
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the packets of electrons to their destinations faster is
only half the battle. Chip designers also try to maximize the work
chips can do by packing each chip with more transistors. Building a
chip with smaller wires means that there's more space for
transistors. If these transistors can be used intelligently, more
work can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, twice as many transistors means doing twice as many
multiplications and additions, and that means finishing each
calculation in half the time.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, chip designers have many restrictions that prevent
them from using all the new transistors. In some cases, the
designers are constrained by the desire to keep their new chips
compatible with their old ones.
</P>
<P>
   One of Intel's strengths, for example, is that different
generations of its chips are compatible, but that is also a
liability. Intel's chip designers are forced to use many
transistors to make sure that the company's latest chips can still
run software that is more than 20 years old. Comparable chips from
Motorola used in Apple machines are often one-third the size of
Intel's chips, and that makes them easier to manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of backward compatibility also limits the flexibility
of designers. The MMX technology incorporated into Intel's latest
Pentium chips can speed up many graphics instructions, but the
chips can have only eight temporary storage bins for the numbers
used in computation.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the information in these bins, known as
registers, is erased every time it is used. The chip designers
could have added new registers with the extra transistors, but that
would have led to incompatibilities with older chips.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's latest G4 chips, used in Apple's new line of
computers, contain 32 storage registers for their MMX-like
hardware, which is known as AltiVec. These extra registers give
programmers more room to juggle data in long computations, which
often leads to a substantial increase in speed for complicated
tasks. These registers also retain data, which saves programmers
the trouble of reloading pieces of data that are used repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola was able to make that jump because its core design is
much newer than Intel's and it has less need for backward
compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp increase in computer speed in recent years has
occurred largely because chip makers have learned to build smaller,
faster wires and to pack more transistors onto a chip. While those
solutions are powerful, they are far from perfect and cannot get
around every roadblock. One of the biggest headaches for computer
designers in the last 10 years has been the speed of the main
memory chips: the RAM chips.
</P>
<P>
   Before the data in RAM (random access memory) can be used by the
main central processing unit, signals must travel from the RAM chip
to the CPU along circuit board wires known as the system bus. The
speed of this bus is often a better gauge of the speed of a
computer than the speed of the processor because most software
spends most of its time fetching information from the RAM chips.
(Some tasks, however, like encryption or some graphics, require
computations but not a lot of data from the RAM. They often run at
the full speed of the processor.)
</P>
<P>
   The gap in speed between the CPU and the bus is usually great.
The CPU of a computer may be capable of doing 500 million additions
or multiplications a second (500 megahertz), but the bus may be
delivering only 66 million chunks of data from the RAM per second
(66 MHz).
</P>
<P>
   So if you have upgraded from a 300-MHz machine to 600 Mhz but
haven't really seen your computer speed double, it's probably not
your perceptions that are off. Both machines may have 66-MHz buses
that limit the arrival of data. And even when you are able to work
at higher speeds, you are likely to find that you enjoy that more
for some applications, like games, than for others, like tax
preparation software.

   Let's get it out of the way, right upfront; altogether, now,
There's no global warming. Having said that, I must add: There's a
whole lot of Atlanta warming. Ask the orange.
</P>
<P>
   It and much else in my garden have reflected what some experts
insist is a warm blip in our long-term weather pattern. The blip
meant that, despite a cold snap here and there, January arrived
wrapped in green leaves that used to be gone. Or at least browned.
Before the blip.

   Nearby, jutting from the base of the brick wall where it has
naturalized, grows old fennel, which was cut back to nothing a few
months ago. By the beginning of the year, however, it had risen to
become something again, coppery and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The chrysanthemum just refused to go away, still green after all
these months. Bloomless by New Year's Day, but still green. And the
banana shrub, which usually feels obligated to show the burn that
proves it's growing out of its range, remained as green as if it
were in Florida. Why not? It certainly has felt like Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Or Charleston. Or Savannah. Which is why the creeping fig vine
that I've been growing on the brick wall for years has reached its
greatest height ever; it's three bricks shy of the top. In past
times, it died to the ground in late autumn or early winter,
returning in the spring to start over in its effort to scale the
wall. If this Atlanta warming keeps up, this could be the year.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many gardeners, I have mixed feelings about these warm
times. El Nino, La Nina _ call them what what you will. Sure, I
enjoy piddling around the garden in shirt-sleeves when I know the
season ``should'' demand heavy wear. It's seductive in a tropical
kind of way to go outside and dig a hole, when you know the ground
might be frozen in ``normal'' years. To dream that the fig will
make it to the top.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, I don't quite feel right; there's something
out-of-sync about this excess of fine weather. Yes, at this writing
in January's second week, there's plenty of time for bitter cold to
bite, for heavy snows to sock us in. But so much warmth for so long
already has skewed my expectations. What is normal these days? What
bears embracing? What should be rejected?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing raises these questions more than the orange.
</P>
<P>
   Winters ago, I stopped moving a whole lot of plants indoors for
the winter, outside for the spring. What goes out must stay out, I
decided, reaching the point where time and energy were more
important than proving I could keep every geranium alive forever.
</P>
<P>
   So, last spring, when I put the orange outside, I was saying
goodbye. It wasn't easy, as I had started this common, unhardy tree
from seed of an after-dinner piece of fruit more than a dozen years
ago, in Washington, moved it to Atlanta and pruned it carefully to
its height of 4 feet, with a trunk the diameter of a walking stick.
It produced no fruit, never even bloomed, but it always stood as a
vivid reminder of the magic that comes when a seed touches dirt.
Despite our history, I decided to let it go _ in the interest of
paring down. Simplifying.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the calendar turn from summer to autumn to winter, I
felt a little of what Eskimos must have felt when they set the old
people on the ice to die.
</P>
<P>
   But the orange didn't die.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it weathered the cold snaps, a few leaves burning from
deep green to light olive color. Still, it hung on, proving its
perseverance each time its mottled green-and-gray trunk showed
lively lime when I scratched it.
</P>
<P>
   The orange was still around when the calendar flipped to
January. Imagine. Ever since then, I have bounced between hope that
it will survive winter and resignation that this old friend will be
gone come April. A couple of nights, I've even been on the verge of
bringing it inside, thinking a tender tree so determined deserves a
little help. Resisting, I decide its tough will is its own reward.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of my garden's eerily persistent greenery, the
orange faces life-and-death uncertainty, its fate hanging on the
vagaries of weather in our time of not global warming.

   Q: We moved here 10 years ago and discovered pepper bacon. At
that time I bought it at Cub Foods but have not been able to find
it for the last two to three years. Do you think you could locate
it for me? My husband really enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carol Conlin, Stone Mountain, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can bring home the bacon once again. We found tasty
Hamtastic Peppered Bacon at Harry's Farmers Market, 2025 Satellite
Pointe, Duluth (770-416-6900). Distributed by Harper's Country Hams
in Clinton, Ky., it's cured with salt, sugar and pepper, which you
can see on each slice. A 12-ounce package is $3.69.
</P>
<P>
   It's also available at $2.69 for a 12-ounce package at Echol's

</P>
<P>
   Q: So far, I'm having lousy luck trying to find the Joel
Williams Thin-Profile Wallet. Originally, it was available on the
Internet at www.fieldtrips.com, but a salesman told me they no
longer carry this wallet, which, according to manufacturer
information, conforms to your body's contours. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Zachary Willat, Pacific Grove, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A: This wallet just may be good for your health. Jerry Enebo,
owner of McDandee, which manufactures the Joel Williams wallet,
once worked in the same building with the inventor of the wallet.
``I told the man my back hurt,'' said Enebo. ``He in turn asked to
see my wallet, a bulky, overstuffed trifold that I carried in my
back pocket. Immediately, he gave me one of his wallets, and after
carrying this awhile, my back problems stopped. Now I give them as
gifts to friends who sit or stand for long periods of time with a
conventional billfold in their back pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thin-Profile Wallet contains four pockets for cards. A
second crease allows the leather to conform to your body. To carry
the wallet, wear the zippered pocket toward your body for proper
contouring. Each wallet is $49. To order, call 1-888-925-5388. Or
order on the Internet at home.att.net/(tilde)mcdandee.

<P>
   _ Beth Welch, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: This yummy-sounding pizza is hard to find, but we managed to
unearth it at Publix, 1265 Pleasant Hill Road, Duluth, Ga.
(770-806-2780). A 12.93-ounce pie is $4.99. The crust is topped
with bordelaise butter sauce, garlic white chicken, mozzarella
cheese, roasted rosemary potatoes and oregano.

</P>
<P>
   Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: You can now get rid of ``crocodile'' skin with Mapo Bath Oil,
distributed by Merz Skin Care Products in Greensboro, N.C.
Unfortunately, the oil, which according to the label,``softens,
smooths and soothes dry, flaky, itchy skin,'' is not widely
distributed. However, you can order it at 1-800-334-0514. An
8-ounce bottle is $5.88, including shipping; a 16-ounce bottle is
$10.08 including shipping.

 &HT;    Mecca of galleries, restaurants rich in history

<P>
   ROSWELL, Ga. _ While the search for gold brought Roswell's
founder to North Georgia in the 1820s, it was with water and cotton
that Roswell King made his fortune. Traveling through Cherokee land
that now makes up Roswell, King noticed the abundant water supply
from Vickery's Creek, a tributary of the Chattahoochee River, and
envisioned it as a source of power for a textile mill.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   From King's dream sprang a robust local industry in the form of
the Roswell Manufacturing Co., incorporated in 1839. The successful
company turned out cloth, tenting, rope, flannels, yarn and
woolens, including the famous Roswell Grey used in Confederate
uniforms. From the mill village, the community of Roswell emerged
and became one of the most important manufacturing towns in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Roswell's rich history is evident in its many magnificent homes
and churches. Bulloch Hall, the antebellum home of President
Theodore Roosevelt's mother, was built in 1840. The Greek Revival
structure, with its graceful columns, has been described as one of
the most significant houses in Georgia. Open daily for tours, the
home hosts exhibits and special events year-round.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith Plantation Home also offers visitors a peek at the
19th-century life of a well-to-do family. Here you can see the
original furnishings and outbuildings of 1840-1880.
</P>
<P>
   King's vision of a thriving community lives on in Roswell.
Visitors taking in the town's historic aspects can also find a
little shopping mecca in what locals call the heart of Roswell.
This area, which takes up much of Canton Street from Woodstock Road
to the north and Magnolia Street to the south, offers an eclectic
blend of antique and gift shops, art galleries and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the lovely houses lining the section of Canton
Street leading to the commercial area are now home to day spas,
architects and doctors offices as well as restaurants and shops,
you'll also notice that many residential properties remain. Folks
not only shop and work in the district, but many also call it home.
</P>
<P>
   As part owner of Ann Jackson Gallery and a member of the
merchants' association, Valerie Jackson has seen her share of
changes in historic Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got almost 30 years under our belt,'' she says. ``This
is part of the original 1840s shopping district. This area where
our gallery is _ and Fratelli's Restaurant and Heaven Blue Rose
next door _ used to be the Roswell Motor Co. back in the 1920s,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you wander to the rear of the gallery, you'll find a
door leading to the back of the building, and below are a handful
of working garages still in business.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street at Go With the Flow, shoppers can outfit
themselves for the thrill of white-water rafting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider ourselves the rogues of the area, since
historically this has been an antique and restaurant type of
shopping district,'' says owner David Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find antiques here, unless you count the building
itself. However, what you will encounter are more than 350 canoes,
kayaks and rafts, along with a variety of outdoor gear.
</P>
<P>
   Wander two doors down into Calico Quilter, and you'll find
notions, fabric and anything else needed to make a quilt _ even
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quilting is very popular right now. It's a very pleasant craft
and has a strong American tradition,'' says Ellen Jennings, Calico
Quilter's co-owner.
</P>
<P>
   For Sara Stadler who moved to Roswell last year from the Midwest
to be near her family, the historic district is now her stomping
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to come out here about once a week,'' she says. ``It's
so relaxing just to walk around, look in the shops and stop for a
bite of lunch. And the merchants are so friendly and gracious here.
It's just like the Southern hospitality I've always heard about.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: From I-285, take Ga. 400 north to Exit 6
(Northridge Road). Bear right off the exit, crossing over Ga. 400.
Take a hard right onto Dunwoody Place. Turn right onto Roswell Road
and cross the Chattahoochee River. (Roswell Road turns into Atlanta
Street.) One mile down is the historic town square. Continue on
Atlanta Street and bear left onto Canton Street, and you'll be in
the heart of Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most businesses are open 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
Tuesdays-Saturdays. Several stores are closed Sundays and Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Free. On-street parking and parking behind some
stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: Located in the Historic Roswell Convention and
Visitors Bureau, 617 Atlanta St.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Most stores are wheelchair-accessible.
Plenty of sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: The Historic Roswell Convention and Visitors
Bureau is open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-Fridays; 10 a.m.-4 p.m.
Saturdays; noon-3 p.m. Sundays. 770-640-3253.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For a taste of southern France in the old South, stop by
Pastis Restaurant and Bar (936 Canton St., 770-640-3870). Snag one
of the tables on the balcony, and you can enjoy Salade Nicoise
($7.50) and Mussels Mariniere ($6.95) as you look down on the
milling crowds. Open for lunch and dinner daily.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fratelli di Napoli (928 Canton St., 770-642-9917)
doesn't offer lunch, try to stick around fearly dinner at
this exceptional Italian restaurant. Don't miss the rigatoni with
vodka sauce and wild mushrooms ($14) or veal Genovese ($18)
smothered beneath artichoke hearts, tomatoes, roasted peppers and
mushrooms. Note that all orders serve two or more, but half-orders
are available. Opening later this month, Asher restaurant (1085
Canton St., 770-650-9838) makes its home in a refurbished
blue-and-white Victorian built in the 1890s. Look for a four-course
prix fixe dinner menu ($39) Tuesdays-Saturdays and a three-course
prix fixe menu ($29) Monday evenings. The menu will change daily
according to what's available, but the sample winter menu includes
grilled scallops with warm potato salad, creme fraiche and caviar;
lobster wrapped in savoy cabbage and accompanied by a creamy
lobster broth; and fillet of beef poached in consomme with
chanterelles and horseradish cream.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond shopping
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bulloch Hall. Located at 180 Bulloch Ave., the antebellum
Greek Revival home of President Theodore Roosevelt's mother, Mittie
Bulloch, is open with tours on the hour from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Mondays-Satur-
</P>
<P>
   days and from 1 to 3 p.m. Sundays. Admission is $5 per person

 &HT;    ARE WE MARTIANS? SCIENTISTS SAY LIFE MAY HAVE ORIGINATED ON MARS
 &HT;    Eds: This story includes the separately skedded ASTRONOMY-FUSE,

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Life may have appeared on the Earth when microbes were
hurled from Mars aboard debris kicked up by crashing comets or
asteroids, an international team of scientists reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During the first 500 million years of the Earth's existence, as
many as 50 billion Martian meteoroids probably fell to this planet
under conditions that would have allowed bacteria from the red
planet to survive the trip, the scientists calculated.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether life ever existed on Mars, but early in its
history it appears to have had a warm atmosphere and an abundance
of surface water.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the calculations _ which one of the scientists
admitted may be something of an intellectual exercise without
immediate importance _ was to lay out conditions necessary for the
interplanetary or interstellar spread of living forms.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the history of the solar system, so many comets and
other bodies were colliding with planets that debris was being
exchanged frequently, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, earthly life forms may have been transported to Mars by
the reverse route, the scientists reported at the annual meeting of
the American Astronomical Society here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life spreads very fast,'' said Swedish scientist Curt
Mileikowsky. ``Even if life did not form on Mars, the probability
of life forming on Earth and going to Mars and then coming back is
actually quite high, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mileikowsky said, life on Earth could have been
hurled to Mars, where it might have flourished. Then a cataclysmic
collision could have wiped out life on this planet by causing the
oceans to evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it might have been blown back to Earth from Mars after
the water rained back down out of the atmosphere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chances that life forms could have spread to the Earth from
another star system are far smaller, but even that would have been
theoretically possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mileikowsky was leader of the scientific team, which also
included scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, as well as researchers from France, Germany and
Finland. The scientists, from widely different fields, set out to
determine:
</P>
<P>
   _ How well and for how long could colonies of microbes survive
in the harsh environment of interplanetary or interstellar space?
</P>
<P>
   _ How frequently are large rocks ejected from planetary surfaces
in cosmic impacts that do not overheat them and thus kill bacteria
that may exist within them?
</P>
<P>
   _ What is the likelihood that a meteoroid from one planet
collides with another planet?
</P>
<P>
   One type of stress that would threaten the survival of Martian
bacteria would be the sudden and massive acceleration caused by the
initial impact by comet or asteroid. The scientists calculated the
amount of acceleration that would be required to hurl pieces of the
Martian surface out of the planet's gravitational grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments in which common Earth bacteria were literally fired
from a gun showed that they could survive that kind of jolt,
Mileikowsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Another hazard would be the harsh radiation of space.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments conducted by NASA show that when two species of
common Earth bacteria _ ``deinococcus radioduranus'' and ``bacillu
subtillis'' _ were left unprotected in space for six years, a small
portion survived.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists calculated the amount of heat the interplanetary
``ejecta'' would endure because of collisions or high-speed flights
through an atmosphere and concluded it was likely some of the rock
would be heated to no more than 212 degrees Fahrenheit _ a level
below which some Earth bacteria have been shown to endure.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first 500 million years of the solar system's history,
the number of collisions that might generate conditions that could
have moved life between the Earth and Mars have dropped off
drastically, Mileikowsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 5 billion meteorites from Mars reached the Earth
under conditions that could have supported life during those 4
billion years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists calculated that the likelihood that life from a
different solar system could have survived a ride to the Earth on
planetary debris was approximately one chance in 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In another series of reports during the conference, scientists
described ``fountains'' of extremely hot gases that surround the
Milky Way, the galaxy in which the Earth is found.
</P>
<P>
   Observations with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer
show the gases are blown out of the galaxy by exploding stars at
extreme temperatures and pumped in gigantic clouds above the flat
plane of the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting from 5,000 to 10,000 light years into
intergalactic space, the clouds slow down, stop and rain back into
the galaxy, where they likely form the raw material of future
stars, said astronomer Blair Savage of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.

 &HT;    JUSTICES SEEM SKEPTICAL OF GRANDPARENTS' VISITATION RIGHTS
 &HT;    Eds: Inserts 11th graf with timing of decision.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Supreme Court justices seemed skeptical
Wednesday about laws guaranteeing child visitation rights as they
heard a case brought by a Washington state couple seeking a bigger
role in their grandchildren's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mark D. Olson, representing the grandparents, Jennifer
and Gary Troxel, argued that it would be in the best interests of
Isabelle, 8, and Natalie, 10, be able to visit their grandparents
more often.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said that if the grandparents were allowed to play a
bigger role in the girls' lives, the memory of their deceased
father would be preserved, and they will know kinship and where
they came from.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Catherine Smith responded that parents are in
the best position to decide what's best for their children and who
they can visit, and the courts should give parents that freedom as
long as the children are not being harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our society, parents decide who their children are going to
be with, what TV shows they watch and what candy they eat,'' Smith
said. ``We should not take that right away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the justices expressed doubts about the Washington
law the Troxels cited in their suit. The broadly worded law allows
visitation rights if the visits are in the child's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be in the best interest of a lot of children to be
taken from their parents, but parents have rights,'' said Justice
Antonin Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and several others said the ``best
interest'' argument would make it possible for anyone _ relative or
not _ to petition the court for visitation rights.
</P>
<P>
   Olson responded that the argument has been used in 48 states for
more than 40 years, to determine similar cases, and that it should
apply to this one.
</P>
<P>
   Some justices who criticized the Washington law, including
Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens, also
acknowledged the ``special relationship'' between some grandparents
and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A decision in the case is expected by summer.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' father, Brad Troxel, committed suicide in 1993, and
their mother, Tommie Granville, who is being sued by the Troxels,
has had custody of them. Granville limited the time the children
could spend with the Troxels, leading to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a trial judge decided that the grandparents should be
allowed visitation one weekend per month, one week during the
summer and four hours on each of the girls' birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Washington Court of Appeals reversed the visitation
order, saying that ``nonparents lack standing to petition for
visitation, unless there is a pending custody proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, the Washington Supreme Court struck down the
visitation law, saying the state could not interfere with parents'
fundamental rights in raising their children when there is no proof
that the children are being harmed.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first widespread snow of the season in the Northeastern
states will fall from northern Pennsylvania to central and southern
New England as strengthening low-pressure streaks eastward south of
Long Island. The steadiest snow will streak from northeastern
Pennsylvania early Thursday morning across central New England at
midday. Snow will be mixed with rain and sleet near the southern
New England Coast and Long Island during the morning and midday,
but the precipitation will change to snow later in the day before
ending. The greatest accumulations are expected in a narrow band
from the Catskills to near Boston where over four inches will fall.
Locally higher amounts will occur in hilly terrain and in some
east-facing coastal areas. Much colder air will surge into the
Northeast at night on gusty winds from the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Wintry chill will cover the upper Middle West. Clouds and
scattered flurries will linger from the eastern Dakotas to the
Great Lakes States. Farther south, cooler air will spread into the
interior Southeast in the wake of a cold front.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably mild weather will prevail over the southern parts
of the Rockies and Plains where sunshine will be plentiful. A trend
toward drier and milder conditions will develop in the northern
Rockies although variable clouds and a few mountain snow showers
will linger.
</P>
<P>
   Another Pacific disturbance will bring rain and mountain snow to
the northwest. The heaviest rain is expected near a low pressure
center as it approaches the southern Oregon coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Clippers
</P>
<P>
   Clipper is the nickname for fast-moving low-pressure systems
that dart across southern Canada and the northern United States
during winter. The name comes from the sleek mid-19th century
sailing ships that traveled at great speeds. Because of their speed
and lack of moisture along their paths, snowfalls with clippers
typically are no more than a few inches. Heavier accumulations can
occur near the Great Lakes and the Northeast Coast, where
additional moisture can be gleaned. In most cases, the light to
moderate snows that accompany clippers are followed by a surge of
arctic air.

<P>
   Measured against other struggles that throw a family into crisis
_ war, disaster, control of the television remote control _ the
trials and tribulations of ordering DSL service may not loom large.
But it has been a bit of a tough time recently for Peggy Stout and
her three adult children, all members of one family, to be sure,
but not all able to get fast DSL connections for their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do not own computers _ 60 percent of the population _
may laugh. People who are just getting dial-up modems may smile.
But bandwidth envy is real enough, and there is a DSL stampede
nationwide. Ms. Stout and her children are in the middle of one in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, some people have been able to hook up to DSL
service with ease, while others have had miserable experiences.
Many other home computer users are facing the same problems and
trying to figure out who can get the service, which telephone
company or other kind of company to go with, how DSL service works
and when it will be available.
</P>
<P>
   DSL, which stands for digital subscriber line, delivers fast
Internet connections to homes and businesses over ordinary
telephone lines. It first came on the market in a big way early
last year, competing with cable and satellites in the rush to offer
high-bandwidth Internet connections. The competition has been
fierce, and Time Warner's cable operation was one of the things
that made it attractive to America Online, Time Warner's
prospective owner.
</P>
<P>
   But while cable television providers generally offer, or don't
offer, cable modem service in broad service areas, and satellite
links are widely available, DSL service is spottier.Your phone
company may provide it, but you may not be able to get it. And that
has confused consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for DSL is easy to understand. Web sites are
increasingly crammed with images and plug-ins that consume great
gulps of bandwidth and can tie up a dial-up modem seemingly
forever. And many e-mail files are loaded with bandwidth-greedy
images, video clips and sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed is king _ speed is everything,'' said Steve Dimmitt,
vice president of consumer marketing at SBC Communications, whose
subsidiaries include Pacific Bell, Ameritech and Southwestern Bell.
``And that's why broadband in the home is more and more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Downloading data via DSL is anywhere from 8 to 100 times as fast
as with the fastest dial-up modems, depending on the type of DSL
service. Pieces of data travel over the same copper line that is
used for voice transmissions yet do not interfere with voice
conversations, which means that you can make or receive calls on
the same line you are using to connect to the Internet. Unlike
cable modem service, where neighbors share a line, DSL service
gives each customer a dedicated line, which makes the speed
fluctuate far less and can make the connection more secure. Basic
DSL service costs about $50, roughly comparable to cable modem
service.
</P>
<P>
   But getting DSL service can be tricky. In the flood of
advertising on the part of DSL companies, little mention is made of
the fact that if you live more than 17,500 feet (a little more than
three miles) from your phone company's closest central office, you
cannot get DSL service. That is because the signal rapidly weakens
with distance.
</P>
<P>
   If you call your local phone company to inquire about DSL
service, the phone company first checks to see if the nearest
central office has been upgraded to offer digital service. Then it
checks to see if your home or business is within 17,500 feet of the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Do not assume that this is a calculation you can make on your
own. Even if you get in your car and measure the most direct route
to the switching office, the distance you get is likely to differ
from the number the telephone company gets. What matters is the
actual length of the wire, which can take a circuitous route to
your house.
</P>
<P>
   DSL is just getting started in many areas. Among the nation's
30,000 central phone offices, 4,300 were equipped for DSL as of the
end of September, according to TeleChoice, a consulting firm in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz McCormick, an analyst at the Yankee Group, said there were
300,000 residential DSL subscribers and 1.1 million cable modem
subscribers at the end of 1999. The number of residential DSL
subscribers is expected to grow to 900,000 by the end of 2000.
McCormick, by the way, recently tried and failed to get DSL service
at his home in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies are trying to engineer a way around the
three-mile problem faced by many of the country's homes. But for
now, said John Britton, a spokesman for Pacific Bell, ``if you're
beyond the three miles, you're basically out of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a vexation, to be sure. Back in the 20th century, no one
thought to inquire about the distance to the nearest phone company
central office when purchasing a home or renting an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stout, who bought herin the Hollywood Hills in Los
Angeles last year, certainly didn't. When her son, Peter Black, 48,
an entrepreneur who lives 15 miles to the west, got DSL service
without a hitch in 1998 and told her how wonderful it was, Ms.
Stout began to covet it. She figured that getting it would be a
snap. ``I'm living in the middle of a hip, affluent neighborhood,''
she said. ``Ninety percent have computers, and many work in the
studios.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the phone company checked the line, she got bad news:
no service. Ms. Stout is still trying to determine whether that is
because she is too far from her local central office or because
that office has yet to be properly equipped. ``It's definitely a
disappointment,'' she said, but remained philosophical. ``It's not
the end of the world, but it's very frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Amy Corral, 34, who lives a few blocks away, has
also been unsuccessful in her attempts to get DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   Another daughter, Susan Black, 46, a graphic designer who lives
about 10 miles west of her mother, in west Los Angeles, got a bit
further. She signed up with a company called Flashcom, a DSL
provider that is one of dozens of new companies competing with
regional phone companies. But after many phone calls and a visit
from a Flashcom technician, Ms. Black was finally told that her
phone lines needed work and that she should hire a private
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had three different entities I was dealing with,'' said Ms.
Black, referring to Flashcom, Pacific Bell and Covad
Communications. Covad leases a separate copper line from phone
companies, then supplies it to Flashcom, which in turn sells the
DSL connection, along with Internet access, to each customer. ``It
wasn't coordinated at all,'' she said. ``I got the feeling that
they were not prepared for the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, while still in the throes of her ordeal, Ms. Black was
walking her dog and spotted a truck from GTE, a local phone
company, on a service call. She stopped to ask the technicians
about DSL service, and they persuaded her to order it from GTE,
which is the Los Angeles area's second-biggest local phone carrier.
She did. The installation was trouble-free; she was hooked up Dec.
30.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are below the magic threshold of 17,500 feet, you
could face other hurdles. Once the phone company has established
that you live close enough to the central office, the company must
check the line itself to see if it can handle DSL. The potential
impediments are devices that can be found on the phone lines
leading to your house called load coils and bridged taps, which let
phone lines serve more customers.
</P>
<P>
   DSL Customer service is another source of frustration for
subscribers and would-be subscribers. Phone companies and other
companies offering DSL need hundreds of customer service
representatives to handle the flood of inquiries and service
requests, so they are retraining and hiring workers. The result of
the shortage of trained personnel has been a multitude of mix-ups
and messes.
</P>
<P>
   John Bailin, a writer who lives in Brooklyn and works out of his
own office in Manhattan, said it had taken several weeks before
Bell Atlantic returned his call to say he could get DSL service at
work. So Bailin canceled an order he had already placed with
Flashcom.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bailin called Bell Atlantic to set up an installation
date, he was told that he could not get service after all. ``I got
a sense of complete disorganization,'' he said. A home installation
by Flashcom, on the other hand, went smoothly. Partly because of
his annoying experience, Bailin is now considering working from
home and may not renew his office lease.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Simpson, a Web site builder who lives in Brooklyn, also
ordered DSL from Flashcom. But when Bell Atlantic checked the line,
Simpson was told that he was too far from the closest central
office.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, Simpson moved six blocks to the southwest,
and his hopes soared when he heard that neighbors had DSL service.
He called a DSL company called Internet Connect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weeks went by and finally I called and harassed them enough to
actually talk to me,'' he said. An appointment was finally set up
for Bell Atlantic to check the line, but when technicians
repeatedly failed to arrive, Simpson gave up. Now he makes do with
a 56-kilobits-per-second modem.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the DSL problems, Ells Edwards, a Bell Atlantic
spokesman, said: ``We try to make the customer experience as good
as we possibly can. Sometimes there are miscommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   Some seasoned early adopters of new technology are impatient
with the complainers. They are quick to point out that all new
technologies are susceptible to glitchesDSL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so tired of hearing people whine about DSL horror
stories,'' said Eric Goldhagen, a technology consultant in New
York. ``DSL is a very new technology, and with that come problems
and delays in installation. The only problem is getting it
installed. After that, it seems to be very stable.'' Goldhagen
pointed out that he was referring to technologically adept people,
who, he said, should know better than to curse a technology still
in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications has a $6 billion program called Project
Pronto, which uses new fiber-optic lines and remote terminals to
extend the area that can be served by DSL The company promises to
make DSL available to 80 percent of its telephone customers by the
end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Competition could speed things up. The Federal Communications
Commission ruled recently that regional phone companies must share
lines with competitors like Covad. Companies like Covad must now
install a second phone line to offer DSL service, which increases
prices and delays.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stout, meanwhile, hasn't given up hope. She has resurrected
her application for service with Pacific Bell and has talked to
other companies, DSL but has come away more confused than ever.
``It's all baloney as far as I'm concerned,'' she said. ``I don't
even know what they're talking about. But this isn't going to
become the issue of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER, AT LEAST NOT TOO READILY
</P>
<P>
   If the prospect of ordering DSL is enticing but intimidating,
take heart. When it comes to getting DSL, a little legwork and a
lot of perseverance are likely to pay off. The first thing to do is
determine whether you are close enough to your local phone company
central office. If you are told that you cannot get service, do not
take no for an answer. The customer service representative is
likely to be still in training and could be wrong. Persist, even if
it means asking to speak with a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the definitive answer from the phone company is no, you
have an option: Call a competitor, like Covad, Rhythms or Flashcom,
or go to their Web sites. You might get lucky because on occasion,
competitors have installed DSL equipment in central offices that
the phone company itself has not yet upgraded. That is an oddity of
DSL, that competitors can set up their hardware in phone company
locations. You should also call local Internet service providers,
because many of them are now in partnership with phone companies to
offer DSL.
</P>
<P>
   If you are truly out of luck, then you will have to wait until
DSL service areas expand or new technologies overcome the distance
problem.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   If you can get service, call around for prices. ``Get as many
different quotes as you can,'' advised Laurie Falconer, an analyst
with Telechoice, a consulting firm in Boston. Prices from phone
company competitors will probably drop in the months to come
because of a recent federal ruling that phone companies must allow
competitors to share their phone lines instead of installing
separate lines. &QL;

<P>
   By now, the excitement caused by Boris Yeltsin's New Year's Eve
bombshell-resignation as Russia's president has subsided.
</P>
<P>
   The experts and the pundits have had their say. The more honest
of them are admitting that they find Russia's prospects
unpredictable, but they still aren't shy about giving advice to
business and government leaders who solicit it.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, the advice offered now is a bit different from what
Russian and Western policy makers heard from many so-called experts
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In those heady first post-Soviet months, few doubted and even
fewer challenged the ``Washington consensus,'' which unreservedly
stated that Russia could achieve overnight economic success if it
followed a few simple prescriptions. It was taken for granted, of
course, that an economically Westernized Russia would not only be a
democracy but also a faithful ally of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, despite zig-zagging events, Western and particularly
U.S. leaders have been claiming their ideas and policies toward
Russia worked well _ which, some skeptics say, has meant closing
one's eyes to the failures and disasters so plentiful in recent
Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   And so today, despite an urgent desire to figure out what's
going on in Russia, there is uncertainty on the core questions
crucial to its place in the emerging world order: Who is in charge?
Is Russia a democracy? Whither its relations with the West?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to the first two questions are by no means simple
but the manner in which the handover of power from the ailing
Yeltsin to Acting President Vladimir Putin, the former KGB spy, was
accomplished speaks volumes. Rather than ``facilitating the
democratic process'' (in fact, the word democracy was not even
mentioned in Yeltsin's resignation speech), it was aimed at
clearing the way for Yeltsin's hand-picked successor while he is
riding the jingoistic wave of the military campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Russian government's virtually total control over the
electronic media and the dependence of most regional governors on
the Kremlin's good will, it is clear that what remains for the
Russian voters on March 26 is to ratify the choice made by Yeltsin
and his ``extended family'' _ the small group of compromised
officials and business tycoons whose greed is largely responsible
for Russia's current mess.
</P>
<P>
   As Lyudmila Telen, deputy editor of the weekly Moskovskiye
Novosti, or Moscow News, wrote in their special edition, ``having
appointed Putin acting president, Yeltsin in essence has appointed
us acting voters.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the March 26 election in Russia is likely to
resemble the polls held in the Central Asian republics of the
former Soviet Union or in some of the ethnic republics, where the
victory of ``the boss'' is 100 percent assured.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western commentators actually say that this ``stability''
is an inevitable and even welcome phase in Russia's ``evolving
democracy,'' or democratic evolution, depending on one's
predilection for phraseology. And the observers from various
European organizations are likely to deem the spring elections free
and fair.
</P>
<P>
   But surely this is not what most of us wanted or expected 10
years ago, nor is it the best that Russia could achieve.
</P>
<P>
   The hot topic of debate now is what policies Putin will pursue
once elected. Experts are already lining up to make pronouncements
but they have little on which to base their analysis. Putin's
recent ``mission statement'' _ an apparently well-meaning, eclectic
article about his policies and views and published on the
government's web site _ contains something for every taste.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of it (the patriotism, the need for Russia to
become competitive in the world market) could be endorsed by just
about everyone in Russia's political spectrum _ from the
pro-capitalist former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko to the
Communist Party leader Gennadi A. Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Very soon, however, Putin will have to show his true colors. No
litmus test will be more important than what he does and the
attitude he shows toward corruption and crime. Will Putin act as
someone beholden to the likes of the shady businessman and
political operator Boris Berezovsky, or will he take the risk of
challenging their power?
</P>
<P>
   The initial signs do not look good _ in fact it was on Putin's
watch as head of the FSB, or domestic intelligence agency, that the
books on a number of criminal investigations involving Russia's
``oligarchs'' were closed. But some believe that Putin could yet
surprise us.
</P>
<P>
   Another test will of course come in Chechnya, a test not just
for Putin but for the entire Russian society, which so uncritically
and apparently eagerly and proudly has been supporting a war in
which there will be no victors.
</P>
<P>
   So Russia is at best an imperfect or distorted democracy. Its
ruling class deserves no plaudits. As for the West, after years of
routine praise for Yeltsin because he was a good ally, does it mean
that relations with Russia are bound to deteriorate? Not
necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   There is no alternative to the policy of ``engaging Russia.''
Russia must be engaged not because it is good or bad but because it
is there. It would be wrong to call Russia nearly irrelevant, as
one Republican policy adviser recently did, just because its
``nuclear missiles are rusting in their silos.'' Even if that were
true, relations with Moscow should not be confined to the security
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the only specific bilateral issue President Clinton's
national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, mentioned in a recent
speech was to get Russia's agreement on U.S. efforts to build a
national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   What would best suit both Russian and American interests now is
a return to a wide-ranging and realistic dialogue unaffected either
by a sentimental attachment to Russia's ``democrats'' and
``reformers'' or by any residual Cold War mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Yeltsin's departure will make such a dialogue more
likely.

<P>
   By now, the excitement caused by Boris Yeltsin's New Year's Eve
bombshell-resignation as Russia's president has subsided.
</P>
<P>
   The experts and the pundits have had their say. The more honest
of them are admitting that they find Russia's prospects
unpredictable, but they still aren't shy about giving advice to
business and government leaders who solicit it.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, the advice offered now is a bit different from what
Russian and Western policy makers heard from many so-called experts
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In those heady first post-Soviet months, few doubted and even
fewer challenged the ``Washington consensus,'' which unreservedly
stated that Russia could achieve overnight economic success if it
followed a few simple prescriptions. It was taken for granted, of
course, that an economically Westernized Russia would not only be a
democracy but also a faithful ally of the West.

   CUBABOY-US _ WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on
Wednesday upheld immigration officials' decision that 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez must be returned to his father in Cuba. Reno said
any challenge to the decision must come in federal, not state
courts. The government is not expected to enforce its Friday
deadline for returning the boy. (Lipman, Cox News Service).

   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _ Justice Department prosecutors appear
ready to propose that Microsoft Corp. be broken up in a negotiated
setllement to the federal government's antitrust suit. Microsoft is
expected to resist the plan, reported Wednesday in USA Today just

AOL-Time Warner merger on the software giant. (Glass, Cox News

   EDUCATION-QUALITY _ WASHINGTON _ How your state stacks up in the
influential Quality Counts annual report, which says most states
don't make sure that all their teachers have the knowledge or
skills to instruct students or to see that they're paid as much as
similarly educated professionals in other fields. The report is to
be released here and on the Web at 10 a.m. Wednesday by Education
Week. This year's report emphasizes teacher quality, but includes
some 75 other indicators of the health of each state's education
system. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

   COURT-GRANDPARENTS _ WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court hears
oral arguments in Troxel v. Granville, on whether a state statute

   AOL-OPTIONS _ Turner employees, like those of AOL, have for
years been paid in stock. When Time Warner bought Turner, they
jumped for joy because the stock finally became worth something.
Since Monday, it has become worth even more. Also, those with
options (we think) will immediately be able to exercise them. A

   LEWIS-MLK _ ATLANTA _ Months ago, the Catholic Archdiocese of
Atlanta invited Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., to deliver a speech
commemorating Martin Luther King Jr. The speech was to be delivered
this Saturday before an audience of thousands. Two weeks ago, Lewis
got a call from the archdiocese folks withdrawing the invitation.
Their reason? He is pro-choice Lewis, who makes a point out of
urging people to ``vote their conscience,'' is miffed. He had no
plans to discuss the A-word and he has turned down 10-15 offers to
speak on that day to other groups. (Carr/White, Atlanta

   TEXSKOL-FUNDS _ AUSTIN _ A State Board of Education Committee on
Wednesday will recommend which company should be hired to oversee
private managers of part of the Texas school trust fund. This comes

   FLA-BIBLE _ Bible classes taught in Florida's public schools
violate federal law, according to the People for the American Way.
On Thursday in Tallahassee, the advocacy group will release a
report on how the 15 school districts throughout the Sunshine State
teach the Bible to public school students. The main complaint is
that the classes draw on a Christian perspective instead of
non-sectarian instruction. The report takes particular aim at the
National Council on Bible Curriculum in Greensboro, N.C., the same
group that's trying to start a bible curriculum in Georgia.

   VIRGINMARY-SUIT _ Nancy Fowler, the Conyers woman who claims to
get visions from the Virgin Mary, has largely settled a lawsuit
against a group of pilgrims who helped her to stage the events. At
issue was whether the former pilgrims could use words and images
from the massive gatherings for books and other publications. The

ADDING A ROOM IN THE AIR REQUIRES A BRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MITCHELL OWENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seth Schulaner had a vision that would forever change
his client's life _ or at least her one-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a bridge,'' Schulaner, a designer, said.
</P>
<P>
   He meant it. Literally. For an apartment in Chelsea, he imagined
a bridge or catwalk that would slice across the double-height
living room, connecting the upper-level sleeping area with a new
adjacent home office. As Schulaner's client, a bubbly woman in her
late 30s, recalled, ``That's when I panicked.''
</P>
<P>
   She had many plans for her new apartment. She needed an office
with a lot of bookshelves _ she works as an international human
resources consultant _ a second bathroom, significantly more
storage space and a chaise longue.
</P>
<P>
   ``All girls want a chaise,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of her daydreams, however, included a bridge. But
Schulaner, 36, got it, though not without compromise. ``In a
perfect world, it would have been cantilevered, but you can't have
everything,'' he said of the wood-floor plaster passage. A friend
of the client's for several years, he persuaded her to gut the
kitchen; she had planned to save it. The client did get her chaise
longue, though not the iron version she craved. ``Seth thought it
was too primitive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The job totaled $150,000 ``to the penny exactly,'' the client
said: $80,000 was allotted for construction, $70,000 was spent on
furnishings. ( Schulaner's fees were extra.)
</P>
<P>
   Good things may come in small packages, as any homeowner in
Manhattan knows, but this does not apply to real estate. On this
overbuilt isle, a small apartment is rarely a gem of opportunity:
awkward in proportion, deficient in natural light, more often than
not a considerable style challenge. When the client threw a
prerenovation party for 100 friends, no amount of Champagne could
detract from the apartment's mock-loft shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Guests funneled through a long, low-ceiling hall to a two-story
living area that was just large enough to provoke envy and just
high and narrow enough to give more than one person the atmospheric
jitters. Even though the living space at the time clocked in at
about 800 square feet, the effect was like crawling through a
tunnel only to end up at the bottom of a well. And the only natural
light came through a pair of sliding doors, above which,
inexplicably, floated a quartet of metal-frame windows.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it has all the variety of a home,'' the owner said,
pointing out the multiple levels, the walled garden, the
below-ground storage area. ``Since I would be working here, too, it
had an open feeling, so I wouldn't feel enclosed all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the heart of the renovation meant reducing the volume of
the living area. ``A bridge would maintain the space while
confining it,'' said Schulaner, who is an admirer of the organic
architecture practiced in the 1960s by the iconoclastic Bruce Goff.
``It's not about punching holes in walls. This is about space
evolving into a cohesive whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrow plaster uprights of the living area's built-in
storage niches connect, visually though not literally, to the
verticals of the bookcases that line the bridge above. Materials
repeat, too: birch plywood cabinets below, birch shelves above, a
birch island in the open kitchen. Another theme is tailoring. The
refrigerator is an under-counter model by Marvel; the full-size
original lives in the basement, used for large parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're paying $300 a square foot for an apartment, how
you utilize the space is crucial,'' said Schulaner, a New Jersey
native who studied design in Florida and briefly worked for Vicente
Wolf, the high priest of black-white-and-gold minimalism. ``You
have to cram in as much as you can without making it look
crammed.''
</P>
<P>
   Which explains, in part, why some elements of the client's life
_ books, china, linens _ are kept out of sight while others are
exposed, their casualness contrasting with the rigidly formatted
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The television is right out in the open, its black carcass
blending with the black granite shelf in the built-in storage space
of the living area. Compact discs are tucked into gridlike openings
in the living area's storage units. The cords of the 14
wall-mounted white-enamel lamps from Ikea openly dangle (they cost
$7 each). And the storage units are lighted by bare bulbs screwed
into old-fashioned porcelain light sockets in a sort of
retro-Edison chic.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an aesthetic for everyone. The client's more
traditional-minded family ``was horrified when they saw the bare
bulbs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulaner shook his head and said, ``People have the weirdest
taboos.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When he decided to splurge, he bought choice items, like dining
chairs by the white-hot French designer Christian Liaigre, or
appliances specially scaled for tight spaces, like the barely
22-inch-deep Miele dishwasher. Otherwise, it was
style-on-a-shoestring all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Crate &AMP; Barrel is the provenance for the low-rise sofa, which
Schulaner upgraded with butter-cream-tone Ultrasuede. The glass
cocktail tables also are from Crate &AMP; Barrel. The leather for the
Liaigre dining chairs is from a shop on West 34th Street. ``It's
the same kind that the guys in the D.&AMP;D. use and mark up
incredibly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we hit Ikea for a lot of stuff,'' he added. The best buy?
The four over-counter kitchen cabinets, whose frosted-glass doors
gently glow thanks to interior lights. Cost: $250 each. Another
budget-conscious decision was to recycle the kitchen sink and to
work with, rather than against, the existing pipes and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Though designer and client are simpatico modernists, ``I wasn't
entirely convinced that everything had to show,'' the client said,
adding, ``What did you call it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Realism,'' he answered dryly.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for the apartment was a huge learning experience, the
client learned. ``Luckily, I had the time to tag along,'' she said.
One day the pair would visit the leather supplier. Another day
would be spent scouting sofas or dining chairs or hardware. ``For
two hours or so, we'd go looking at things,'' she said. ``It was
more of a pupil-teacher relationship. The one thing I learned was
the importance of scale. I found that fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the kitchen was done and the walls of the formerly
small enclosed room came tumbling down, she panicked again. ``The
apartment looked huge, and I thought we hadn't ordered enough
furniture,'' she said. ``As each piece of furniture was delivered,
the shape of the room changed. It put everything into perspective,
because I thought, `Oh, my God, we didn't buy enough stuff.'''
</P>
<P>
   The designer's sense of appropriate extended to fabrics, too.
``No satins, no silks, it wouldn't be fitting,'' he said. Not that
there aren't touches of luxury. For about $300, the client had Hy
Fishman, a Manhattan furrier, recycle a beaver coat into a lap robe
and matching bolster pillows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a princess, OK?'' she said with a burst of laughter. ``And
it was a very good coat.''

ONLY THE SISTERLY THING TO DO
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday Jan. 18)  
(nk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Madeline Armitage learned that her sister Bee Hogan was
leaving the hospital and needed special care, there was no question
who would provide it. Madeline made space for a hospital bed in her
mobile home in Windsor, Calif., and moved Bee in.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline, at 91, says she's always been the big sister and is
determined to care for 88-year-old Bee ``until I fall on my face.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy work. Madeline moves slowly but determinedly,
cooking meals and making sure Bee takes her medication. ``Best
nurse I can find,'' says Bee.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline says they don't do much but ``get through the day.''
Yet it's obviously important to both that they do it together. Bee,
who has cancer, sleeps when she can, and Madeline says, ``When the
patient naps, the nurse naps.'' They have help from hospice, but
most of the work falls to Madeline who begins the day bringing a
warm wet washcloth to Bee and then starting breakfast. Usually tea
and toast.
</P>
<P>
   After all the years it comes down to the two of them plus a
third sister, Alice Finnegan, who is 86 and lives in a nearby
convalescent home. Before Bee got sick, she looked after Alice,
visiting her every Sunday. Now Madeline takes care of Bee.
</P>
<P>
   Bee and Madeline sit and reminisce about old vacation spots,
family dinners and their childhoods in San Francisco. Both are
widowed and neither has children. Madeline miscarried three times
in the first five years of her marriage, and Bee's son died of
polio when he was 12 years old. He got sick at dinnertime and died
in the night. It was two years before polio vaccine became
available, says Bee, a fact that still makes her cry.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline is practiced at her big sister role. When she was 10
years old, her mother was sick in bed for a year with rheumatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised to take care of the others,'' she says. ``We were
always a clanny bunch, together a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Madeline made hats for a living and then became a nurse,
``specializing in geriatrics of all things,'' she says, referring
to its usefulness now. She got out of nursing because, she says,
``I couldn't stand the pressure of losing patients,'' and worked in
a department store. ``Ladies lingerie _ we called it the
meatpacking department,'' she laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Bee was a waitress most of her working life.
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters try to keep it light. They watch a little TV.
Bee reads her Unity Church ``Daily Word'' book and the Reader's
Digest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laugh more than we cry,'' says Bee. Asked what it means to
live to the year 2000, Bee answers, ``I could care less,'' and her
sister chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   They don't talk much about death, although Madeline says ``You
never know when you go to bed if you're going to be here tomorrow
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   They both have made funeral arrangements, and Madeline plans on
going to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   She had a preview once. She was in an accident in 1980 when the
car she was in slid off the road and tumbled 125 feet, landing in a
gully and throwing Madeline into the brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out of my body for a long time looking down at the whole
scene, and then I came back. You tell people that, and they think
you're crazy. But I believe that will happen to me again, and then
I'll go to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Other place is too darned hot,'' says her sister.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a pretty ordinary life for both, they say. They had
some great years when Bee and her husband, William, lived in a
cabin and Madeline and her husband, Clinton, would come for the
summer. They had different tastes. Bee liked night clubs. Madeline
liked the theater.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have a life plan. ``We just lived and here we are,''
says Madeline.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline says her only regret is she never got to Niagara Falls
or to Illinois, where her husband was from.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally they disagree. Regarding women's equality, which
was a new concept when they were girls, Bee says, ``I believe a
woman should have as much say as a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Madeline says, ``I think some women go too far. I like the
distinction of being a lady. I never wanted to be the counterpart
of my husband. I believe in the same pay for the same job, but I
liked having a man open the door for me, pull out my chair and look
at me like he idolized me.''
</P>
<P>
   They agree on most things. Madeline says, ``the world used to be
a lot simpler,'' and Bee adds, ``people used to be more sociable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I think you feel more like a stranger in a sea of strange
people.''
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason to have someone you've known all your life
bringing you tea and toast.

HE COURTS JUSTICE, ONE MATCHSTICK AT A TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Justice hasn't always been forthcoming in
Mirsad Malkoc's life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he and his family fled Travnik, Bosnia, just ahead of
the war's deadly grasp. The family left a home with two gardens, a
swing beloved by their 5-year-old daughter, and rabbits, chickens
and the pet dog. They boarded a bus for Germany and tried not to
look back.
</P>
<P>
   Almost eight years later, Malkoc still pursues justice a little
each day. In his three-bedroom Fort Worth apartment, he has built a
sort of monument to his hopes, matchstick by matchstick, mimicking
the curves and angles of a Texas landmark: the Tarrant County
Courthouse in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Malkoc's finely wrought replica is 3 1/2 feet long, 2 feet high
and 2 feet deep. It's made of approximately 50,000 matches and has
more than 300 plastic windows. All the matches have been lit and
blown out, blackening their tops and giving the courthouse a
striped design.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the artwork sits on a table in the small living room,
obscuring the fireplace and vying for attention with the flickering
television.
</P>
<P>
   Malkoc loves his matchstick buildings _ he's halfway through the
Dallas County Courthouse right now _ but he'd like to make a living
from them, and regain for his family the financial security they
lost since fleeing their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give lifetime guarantee,'' he says, smiling and sweeping a
hand in front of his merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Malkoc first saw the Tarrant County Courthouse less than a year
ago, when he and his family arrived in Fort Worth from South
Dakota. Something about the architecture spoke to him. ``I like
history, I like culture,'' he says. ``I like Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned downtown on several occasions to sketch the 1895
building from various angles. He poked through archives for
photographs to copy and take home. He used only a handful of basic
materials: tweezers, an X-Acto knife, glue, paper and matches.
</P>
<P>
   Malkoc's four children, ages 5 to 17, think the sculpture is
``awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never get to first base doing something like that,''
says Alex Brensike, a friend of the family who took Malkoc on his
first tour of downtown Fort Worth. ``It's amazing. He's so
meticulous.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Bosnia, the Malkoc family settled in Cologne,
Germany. Anica Malkoc resumed her career as a nurse. Mirsad,
formerly a machinist, went to work in a friend's restaurant. There,
he designed his first matchstick sculpture, a replica of the diner.
His reproduction of a European castle later sold for 7,000 German
marks, Mirsad says. (That's about $3,600 today.)
</P>
<P>
   The family has not been so financially lucky since coming to the
United States in 1997. Anica, whose English is rudimentary, cannot
yet earn her nursing certification and works in a nursing-home
kitchen. Mirsad, 48, who had a good job for eight months in a South
Dakota meat-packing plant, developed serious back problems. The
family moved to Texas a year ago for his health, but his physical
limitations have made it difficult for him to find work.
</P>
<P>
   So he returned to his matchstick hobby, toiling on the
courthouse every day for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, he would like to see his project end up in a public
space _ such as inside the real courthouse. ``Somewhere,'' says
12-year-old daughter Dina, ``where he can visit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Malkoc has his eye on the Denton County courthouse next. And
when he can afford fancier materials, he's eager to attempt the
White House and the Capitol building _ symbols of the justice his
new country might yet offer.

   ``Lost in the Funhouse: The Life and Mind of Andy Kaufman'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Zehme &QL;

<P>
   ``Andy Kaufman Revealed!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Bob Zmuda with Matthew Scott Hansen &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Biography &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown, $24 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andy Kaufman was so weird that he imitated Elvis Presley BEFORE
ELVIS DIED.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that. Consider that this was also a man who was a firm
believer in transcendental meditation AND who sang the ``Mighty
Mouse'' theme on ``Saturday Night Live'' _ AND took an entire Radio
City Music Hall audience out for milk and cookies after a show AND
botched his career by insisting on wrestling women, even when it
became apparent that most of America found said wrestling
spectacularly unfunny.
</P>
<P>
   Was he a complex guy or just a troubled nut job who came up with
some great groundbreaking anti-comedy before imploding his career?
A genius or a troubled soul who retreated into a world of fantasy
at a young age and never came back?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows. But whatever he was, Kaufman is now a genuine big
deal all over again: lionized in song by R.E.M. and the subject of
a Milos Forman biopic, ``Man on the Moon'' starring Jim Carrey,
Kaufman is also the subject of two new biographies, ``Lost in the
Funhouse: The Life and Mind of Andy Kaufman,'' by Bill Zehme, and
``Andy Kaufman Revealed!,'' by his old pal Bob Zmuda (with help
from Matthew Scott Hansen).
</P>
<P>
   My advice to anyone interested in the man? Read both. This may
sound like overkill, but both books are so interesting _ and so
different stylistically and in point of view _ that reading both
never feels like an exercise or a chore.
</P>
<P>
   Zehme is a well-known journalist and the author of ``The Way You
Wear Your Hat,'' a fascinating study of Frank Sinatra's life and
style. ``Funhouse'' is every bit as readable; Zehme writes with a
verve that is rare among biographers, sometimes letting the prose
go into a voice reminiscent of Kaufman's own speech patterns. His
is a more true biography, with more info on Kaufman's life and the
perspective of people around him.
</P>
<P>
   Zmuda, on the other hand, provides a fly-on-the-wall view: He
was Kaufman's pal and partner in crime. Zmuda's book is also nicely
loose in style and portrays daily life with Kaufman _ which appears
to have been at once exhilarating and disquieting.
</P>
<P>
   Reading both books together is rewarding because of the
differences in point of view, and how much emphasis is put on
different events in Kaufman's life. And, truly, Kaufman's strange
and ultimately sad life warrant such close examination: That
neither effort really solves the mystery of how far Kaufman was
taking the joke (or if he even knew where the line was between
funny and merely obnoxious) makes both books (and Kaufman) all the
more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   We can examine this guy's life all we want, and interview as
many old cronies and former cast members as we would like, but the
lurking truth is that nobody will ever really know what was going
on in Kaufman's mind _ that it may have been a territory that
defied understanding, even by him.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Mamet's work doesn't generally elicit feelings
of nostalgia. Still, when Deborah and Danny, the briefly coupled
characters in his comedy of manners from the 1970s, ``Sexual
Perversity in Chicago,'' go to bed together shortly after they meet
(they arrange a dinner date afterward), the play, even with its
wicked humor and gleeful vulgarity, creates a strangely innocent
aura. In 1975, when it was first performed in New York, this
one-act was shocking in its portrayal of the war between men and
women as played out between 20-somethings in Chicago. The
selfishness and suspicion, the fornication as foreplay, the extreme
ungentleness with which the four characters _ two men and two women
_ assault one another's self-esteem (and undermine their own)
constituted a vicious satire of a world run amok with
permissiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Time goes, though, doesn't it? In the straight-faced revival
that opened last night at the Atlantic Theater Company in Chelsea _
coupled, as it was a quarter century ago, with Mamet's youthful
homage to Beckett, ``The Duck Variations'' _ the play recalls a
post-sexual-revolution, pre-AIDS era in which there wasn't much at
risk from profligate behavior  &UR; except &LR;  self-esteem. Which, in
retrospect, doesn't seem like much at all. And as a result,
``Sexual Perversity'' _ in this production anyway _ seems more of
an entertaining period piece than anything else, an almost campy
artifact that would fit right in on ``Nick at Night'' if it weren't
so ``Midnight Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Presented on Alexander Dodge's multitiered set, which manages to
contain and economically suggest half a dozen separate rooms, the
play uses brief, jittery scenes separated by blackouts to follow
the consummation and subsequent courtship and breakup of Danny and
Deborah as witnessed by their best friends. These are Bernard, whom
Danny works with in a warehouse office, and Joan, the roommate
Deborah leaves and then returns to when she moves in with and then
out on Danny.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard and Joan are the angrier pair. He is a vulgar sexist
prone to explosive rants against the behavior of women, though he
is equally ardent in admiration of their body parts; she, a
schoolteacher, is prematurely bitter and prone to take out her
frustrations on her preschoolers. Their bilious influence
eventually reclaims the friends they were in danger of losing to
love, leaving everyone energetically miserable at the end.
</P>
<P>
   In the service of this story, the young actors are reasonably
deft with Mamet's peppery rhythms (and salty language). The women
seem period-perfect, managing to capture the 1970s-style of
feminism, which found all manner of young women trying on newly
encouraged postures of self-empowerment. Kate Blumberg plays
Deborah as someone in the midst of trying to transform a perky,
pliant girl into a tougher young woman with indignation at the
ready, and Kristin Reddick, as Joan, finds the note of loneliness
that makes her man-weary, world-weary posture transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Gregg (Bernard) and Josh Hamilton (Danny) _ perhaps
because the dynamic of their relationship (boastful leader and
marginally more sensible follower) is familiar in any generation _
have a harder time suggesting the era. Gregg actually brings a bit
of 1990s detachment to the role of Bernard, an anachronism that
doesn't help a character whose most salient feature is excess;
Bernard's wild story about making love to a girl turned on by a
military combat fantasy remains the play's most famous and funniest
set piece. Still, anyone who fondly remembers wide striped ties,
spread collars and polyester pants will feel instant camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic is celebrating its 15th anniversary with a
seasonful of early plays by Mamet, one of the company's founders.
(``The Water Engine'' and ``Mr. Happiness'' were presented in the
fall; ``American Buffalo'' is scheduled for a March opening.)
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Duck Variations,'' which introduces the evening, will
be of interest particularly (if not exclusively) to followers of
the playwright's career. It is something of an anomaly in Mamet's
work, a series of seemingly benign conversation snippets between
two old men on a bench looking out over Lake Michigan. The
recurring subject is ducks _ their lives, their deaths _ and in the
end, of course, the conversations suggest something both desperate
and satisfying about the lives of the men themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The play, written when Mamet was in his early 20s, winks
appreciatively, even gratefully, at Beckett. But the competitive
banter between the two old men also foreshadows Mamet's later
persistent probing of abrasive male relationships. Held against
Mamet's other plays of this type _ ``American Buffalo'' and
``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' for example _ this is a trifle, but it is
daunting for actors. Peter Maloney and John Tormey manage to
sustain both the tension and humor of a friendship that must endure
without much to talk about.

   &UR; RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EDITORS: THERE IS A LIST OF EXAMPLE BELOW STORY ON THIS TAKE:
``Begin at the beginning,'' Alice was advised in Wonderland, ``and
go on till you come to the end: then stop.'' If only it were that
easy in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Writers have been struggling since Homer to find the art of
opening a story. There is pretty general agreement on which ones
have succeeded best. What true reader hasn't thrilled, at some age,
to the passage that begins, ``It was the best of times, it was the
worst of times''? Dickens' ``Tale of Two Cities'' is among the
classic examples.
</P>
<P>
   The question, then, is not so much which, but why.
</P>
<P>
   People who know books have their own answers and, of course,
their own favorites. Anne Stephenson, who writes the New &AMP; Notable
books column for ``The Arizona Republic,'' said she was hooked
immediately by the ``jazzy'' voice of Vladimir Nabokov's Humbert
Humbert: ``Lolita, light of my life,'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita,'' indeed, puts the reader right into the grip of its
extraordinary narrator, who, Stephenson said, `` &UR; commands the
reader to look at his obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there's a clue there.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting that most of the people polled for this
article named a work spoken in the first person. That directness
seems to grab readers.
</P>
<P>
   A skilled writer can bait the same hook twice, introducing the
character and establishing the mood simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Peters, owner of the Scottsdale bookshop the Poisoned
Pen, cited, among others, Daphne du Maurier's ``Rebecca'': ``Last
night I dreamt I went to Manderly again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a book as a conversation between the author and the
reader,'' Peters said. ``Based on the opening, the reader decides
if he is interested in pursuing the conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   People buy books on the strength of the beginning paragraphs,
she said, and in a competitive field, a ``crackerjack opening'' is
critical.
</P>
<P>
   The most quotable writer in English, needless to say, was not a
novelist at all. Barbara Riggs, public-relations manager of the
Scottsdale Cultural Council, noted that ``the best opening lines
are all in Shakespeare's plays.'' Riggs gave the example of ``Henry
V'': ``O for a muse of fire, that would ascend / The brightest
heaven of invention.'' It's hard to argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   In every discussion of this kind, there is one American
masterpiece that inevitably comes up _ the three-word opening to
Herman Melville's ``Moby Dick.'' And Jay Boyer, a creative writing
instructor at Arizona State University, knows why.
</P>
<P>
   That sentence turns the focus ring for the novel, ``which is not
about going after a white whale but about finding one's place in an
uncertain universe'' in which evil exists, Boyer said. The question
is the most baffling faced by man, and Boyer pointed out that the
very tone of the questioner is uncertain, seeking _ not ``My name
is Ishmael'' or ``I am Ishmael,'' but ``Call me Ishmael.''
</P>
<P>
   From genre writers to literary giants, then, that is how the
masters do it, somewhat like musicians. A note is struck, a tone is
caught, a theme is stated. Good books, it seems, grow out of good
beginnings. Obviously, we'd be unwise to make the first sentence of
any book a litmus test. But it's not a bad guide. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME GREAT FIRST LINES: &QL; 
``Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in
its own way.'' &QL; 
_ Leo Tolstoy, ``Anna Karenina.''

   ``Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.
Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down
the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Validmir Nabokov, ``Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel
Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his
father took him to discover ice.'' &QL; 
_ Gabriel Garcia Marquez, ``One Hundred Years of Solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in
possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.'' &QL; 
_ Jane Austen, ``Pride and Prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll
probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy
childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before
they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I
don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   _ J.D. Salinger, ``The Catcher in the Rye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the saddest story I have ever heard.'' &QL; 
_ Ford Madox Ford, ``The Good Soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever my mother talks to me, she begins the conversation as
if we were already in the middle of an argument.'' &QL; 
_ Amy Tan, ``The Kitchen God's Wife''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Tench went out to look for his ether cylinder: out into
the blazing Mexican sun and the bleaching dust. A few buzzards
looked down from the roof with shabby indifference: he wasn't
carrion yet.'' &QL; 
_ Graham Greene, ``The Power and the Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am out of my mind, it's all right with me, thought Moses
Herzog.'' &QL; 
_ Saul Bellow, ``Herzog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was love at first sight. The first time Yossarian saw the
chaplain he fell madly in love with him.'' &QL; 
_ Joseph Heller, ``Catch-22.'' &QL;

   &UR; RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAV MISSED. &QL; 
Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``NAT KING COLE'' &QL; 
By Daniel Mark Epstein (FSG, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The kid was wearing a light green gabardine suit that draped
his long, slender frame so loosely it looked like the first
high-note blast of a trumpet might blow his coat off.'' Nat Cole
was 16 then, shy but bold enough to know how good he was. It's this
image of the young Cole in 1935, about to go up against Earl Hines
in the ``Battle of Rhythm'' in Chicago's Savoy Ballroom that begins
Epstein's biography. Cole died of cancer when he was 45, yet his
story is rich enough for several lives. There were his formative
years in Chicago as what Epstein calls ``a kitten on the keys.''
There were his marriages and infidelities, bad business decisions,
and troubles with the IRS. There was the racial tension that
buffeted his career (in 1956, he was attacked onstage by White
assailants during a performance in Birmingham, Ala.). And there
were Cole's affability and pragmatism, which helped him skirt
racial politics, court a White audience, and make an amazing
crossover from jazz to popular (and frequently schlocky) music.
Epstein creates an engaging portrait of this romantic figure in
American music. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``IN THE GLOAMING'' &QL; 
By Alice Elliott Dark (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Triage,'' a mother and her adult daughter pursue an uneasy
truce as they jockey for position in each other's lives. In ``The
Tower,'' an aging bachelor falls for a young woman whose background
hints at a very unpleasant surprise. In ``Dreadful Language,'' a
woman moves through youthful rebellion to true love and on to
sorrow and resignation. But the big draw in this story collection
is the title piece, which was published in ``The New Yorker'' in
1994, made into a HBO film starring Glenn Close, and chosen by John
Updike for ``The Best American Short Stories of the Century.'' ``In
the Gloaming'' is a story about conversations _ they take place
always at twilight, the time called ``the gloaming'' _ between a
woman and her 33-year-old son, who is dying of AIDS. With austere
precision, Dark charts the mother's heart as she comes to know both
her son and herself and as she begins to understand that these
daily talks are her dying child's way of returning her love to her.
It's a wonderful story _ moving, understated and as true as the
emotional secrets it unveils.
</P>
<P>
   ``100 BEST ALBUM COVERS: THE STORIES BEHIND THE SLEEVES'' &QL; 
By Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell (DK, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At 4 a.m. every morning for a week, three adults and two
children were sprayed silver and gold from head to toe and driven
from the hotel to the location to await a glorious sunrise that
never happened,'' write Thorgerson and Powell. It rained, it was
cold, it was boring, and after the makeup ran out, they had to use
car paint, which they removed with turpentine. In the end, the
adult models were dumped (they used just the naked children, a
brother and sister who had already appeared nude in a Japanese
version of ``Alice in Wonderland'') and the sunrise was faked, but
the album cover for Led Zeppelin's ``Houses of the Holy'' is
memorable enough to appear here, a full 26 years later. Also
included are the stories behind the covers for Santana's
``Abraxas,'' the Grateful Dead's ``Aoxomoxoa,'' Big Brother &AMP; the
Holding Company's ``Cheap Thrills'' and John Lennon and Yoko Ono's
``Two Virgins'' and many more.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``FLU'' &QL; 
By Gina Kolata (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flu of 1918 came in two waves. The first showed up in the
spring, bringing its victims chills and fevers but rarely lasting
more than three days. It was, Kolata writes, ``banal, and easily
forgotten.'' In September, however, it came back with a vengeance,
and this time it was a killer that altered countless lives.
Children were orphaned, families were destroyed. Thousands of
people die horribly. More than 25 percent of the United States
population became ill, and between 20 million and 100 million
people died worldwide. If a similar plague were to strike today, it
would kill more people in a single year than heart disease,
cancers, strokes, pulmonary disease, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease
combined. But is this possible? Are authorities prepared to the outbreak of another virus with such mysterious and deadly
power? Kolata, a science writer for the ``New York Times,'' looks
at the history of the 1918 flu and at the lessons it offers for
averting a similar disaster today. It's fascinating but sobering
reading _ if you feel a chill coming on, save it for another day.  &QL;

&HT;     PUBLIC FOUND TO HAVE UNREALISTIC VIEWS OF IMPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ A panel of 14 independent scientific and legal
experts called on the federal government Wednesday to develop an
information clearinghouse on medical implants so that patients can
be better informed about the lifespan of the devices and possible
complications that might arise.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations about the risks, benefits and lifespans of medical
implants are often unrealistic, the advisory panel concluded in a
20-page report delivered to the National Institutes of Health
(NIH).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julia Weertman, co-chair of the panel and a materials
science professor at Northwesteersity in Evanston, Ill.,
said there is widespread misperception among consumers about the
durability of implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``People never think that they are going to wear out,'' she told
a news conference. Manufactured items implanted into the body
``don't last forever,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Wulf, president of the National Academy of
Engineering in Washington, D.C., said consumers should be advised
that, in general, a medical device could be expected to last
between 10 and 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to misperceptions about durability, consumers often
are unaware implants can spark medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Brandt, panel co-chair and a professor at the
University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City,
Okla., said many people mistakenly believe that a seal of approval
from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the government agency
with responsibility over medical devices, means that implants are
trouble-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the sense that if the FDA approves it, it's going to
be perfect,'' Brandt said.
</P>
<P>
   Breast implants, for example, can cause serious local
complications such as painful hardening of the breast. In addition,
some models leak either saline or silicone solutions, requiring
repeat surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been implanting medical devices for over 40 years.
An estimated 25 million U.S. citizens _ 8 to 10 percent of the
population _ currently have some type of implanted medical device.
</P>
<P>
   There are three categories of implants:
</P>
<P>
   __ Form-enhancing implants, such as breast implants either for
cosmetic purposes or following breast cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   __ Life-saving implants, such as pacemakers and artificial heart
valves, which help regulate the functioning of a heart.
</P>
<P>
   __ Life-enhancing implants, such as an artificial hip, which
allow a patient better mobility and improved quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Implants are big business. In 1997, $49 billion was spent in the
United States on more than 65,000 different types of medical
devices made by almost 12,000 manufacturers, according to the
General Accounting Office, the congressional investigative branch.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's report called on the NIH and FDA to help develop an
Internet Web site to provide information on medical devices and how
they have performed in the past. In addition, the Web site should
urged scientists to ``retrieve'' the implants ``when they are no
longer of use.''
</P>
<P>
   This would enable researchers to develop a detailed database on
how well the devices perform. This data could lead to the
development of better, longer lasting medical implants. There are
now no systematic programs for the retrieval and analysis of
implants, the panel concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Implant retrievals, either after surgery or autopsy, are only
conducted on an ``ad hoc basis'' by manufacturers and some
university research centers, the panel found.
</P>
<P>
   The panel proposed that implant recipients receive a card to
carry in their wallets or purses, much like an organ donor consent
card, outlining the type of implant, make, model, serial number and
date of implantation. It would function as implant donor consent.
</P>
<P>
   The panel noted other barriers to the establishment of a
national implant retrieval system include not only the cost, but
fear of litigation for manufacturers, hospitals and doctors, and
the religious objections of patients and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's recommendations are advisory and are not binding for
NIH.
</P>
<P>
   NIH officials had no immediate reaction to the panel's report,
but in a statement the scientific agency agreed that researchers
need a better system for analyzing implants after removal in order
to develop improved models.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of such as system has impeded research in this
area,'' NIH said.

`SCAR VEGAS': SHE STOLE HIS KIDNEY AND OTHER BAD LUCK TALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``For Ken Saro-Wiwa,'' reads the dedication of ``Scar Vegas,''
Tom Paine's arresting first collection of stories, ``Nigerian
writer and activist hanged for our insatiable oil gluttony Nov. 20,
1995.'' The ``our'' is presumably the United States or the West in
general, since Paine is identified on the dust jacket as a graduate
of Princeton and the Columbia master of fine arts program and as a
teacher of creative writing at Middlebury College.
</P>
<P>
   So we're into colonialist oppression here, and immediately one's
antennae go up for any ideological bias in the book's 10 stories,
which appeared in The New Yorker, Harper's, The New England Review
and Playboy, among other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the opening piece, ``Will You Say Something,
Monsieur Eliot?'' is about a wealthy American whose yacht is
wrecked in a storm during a single-handed sail. After drifting with
part of his mast for days, he is picked up by a boat full of
Haitians whose sails have been destroyed by the storm. They are
ecstatic to learn that Eliot is a rich American because they are
naively certain that with him aboard they will all be rescued under
orders from the president of the United States. But when a
helicopter finally arrives, only Eliot is taken away and the
Haitians are left to go on drifting.
</P>
<P>
   Another story, ``The Hotel on Monkey Forest Road,'' concerns a
construction crew assigned to build a hotel complex on Bali. One of
the crew's leaders goes ``local'' and insists on appeasing the
area's spirits before construction begins, much to the detriment of
the project. The story's narrator leaves the question open about
whose outlook is correct.
</P>
<P>
   In the powerful final story, ``The Battle of Khafji,'' a bus
driver is mistakenly assigned to a reconnaissance platoon ``sent to
Saudi shortly after Saddam entered Kuwait,'' the narrator says.
After proving himself more able than anyone expects, the driver
asks: ``Is it still a war if nobody dies on one side? . . . I mean,
if thousands die on one side, and nobody at all dies on the other,
is that still a war? Maybe we should have a new word for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the stories, several of which have won prizes, can be
viewed as variations on the theme of how the powerful oppress the
weak. This even includes ``General Markman's Last Stand,'' about a
retiring Marine commander stealing a bra from the local post
exchange. In the story the general's fetish is paradoxically made
to stand for his humanity, whereas those who ridicule his weakness
come off as brutal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what impresses the reader about Paine's stories is not so
much their ideology as their extraordinary variety and narrative
verve. In each of them, the author immediately establishes an
extreme situation that rivets your attention, whether it is the
plight of Melanie Applebee, an out-of-work brokerage executive who
suddenly finds herself a derelict in ``A Predictable Nightmare on
the Eve of the Stock Market First Breaking 6,000,'' or the twin
brothers in ``Ceausescu's Cat,'' who struggle with their feeling of
being invisible in totalitarian Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In each story Paine shows himself to be a master mimic, whether
he is detailing the shipwreck in ``Will You Say Something, Monsieur
Eliot'' or parroting the cool dude language of the druggies
traveling to the Anarchist Convention in Portland, Ore., in ``The
Spoon Children,'' or doing the drawl of Johnny Loops, fresh out of
prison in Galveston, Tex., as he attends his sister's wedding in
``Scar Vegas.'' The message, however ideological, is rarely the
point. The issue in ``Unapproved Minutes of the Carthage, Vermont,
Zoning Board of Adjustment (As Recorded by Town Secretary Betty
Bradley)'' is whether station WIKD's 250-foot communications tower
is causing people to get cancer, appliances to malfunction and
rock-and-roll music to sound in people's teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it's corporate America versus the people. But a
sense of outrage isn't what carries the story along. Rather it's
the droll contrast between the townspeople's hysteria and the
deadpan language of the recording secretary: ``The oral cavity,
Cato noted, seemed to amplify the music, particularly in the
presence of saliva. The experience was not unlike having an
interior Walkman, and it would not have been a painful experience
except that he was a fan of bluegrass music and rock-and-roll made
his teeth ache.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Paine goes over the edge in the title story, ``Scar
Vegas,'' which was reprinted in ``The 1998 Pushcart Prize XXII.''
Having left his sister's bridal suite because, as the prospective
groom tells him, ``Fruit is in heat,'' Johnny wanders down to the
hotel lobby, meets a semipro football player and falls into a
discussion with him over what constitutes luck. `` `Luck ain't
something that don't happen,' I says. `Lots of things don't happen.
Luck is something that happens. When you been fingered out.'''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting a woman in a bar who is ``10 times better looking
than any woman who ever looked at me twice in my entire life,''
Johnny wakes up in the hospital to find that his kidney has been
surgically removed. His friend tells him he had found him in the
bar ``all messed up'' and complaining that his back hurt and took
him to the hospital. A doctor tells Johnny he has seen three
similar cases this year: ``On the black market your kidney might be
worth a hundred thousand or more. Some people are desperate. . . .
Consider yourself lucky to be alive, Loop. They might have taken
both kidneys.'' After admiring the scar on his back Johnny falls
asleep imagining ``over and over them fingering me, Johnny Loop,
out of all the crowds of nobodies and losers.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Paine saying here that nothing is safe from American
gluttony? Maybe so, but as an image of exploitation, stealing
Johnny's kidney seems so bizarre as to transcend ideology. Finally
it is the author's fervent imagination that rescues most of the
stories in ``Scar Vegas.''

&HT;     POLICE PREPARE BACK-UP FORCE TO DEAL WITH DIALLO TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MELISSA GRACE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The police have arranged for back-up security
forces if needed at demonstrations outside the upcoming Amadou
Diallo trial and backed away from a statement last week that
bullhorns would be banned.
</P>
<P>
   Chief John C. Nielsen said Tuesday that the police have not yet
made a decision regarding the use of bullhorns by demonstrators on
both sides of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the sound became so loud that it interfered with the rest
of the community, then we would deal with that issue at that
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief also said that if the number of demonstrators for the
trial grows into the thousands, he may call for assistance from the
Albany County Sheriff's Department and State Police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at all the contingencies,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection in the case is set for Jan. 31 at the Albany
County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen said it was too early to predict what numbers of
protesters may arrive for the trial, and predictions from various
sources have ranged from very few to thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a 300-mile round trip from New York City and
because the weather may turn cold, law enforcement officials are
predicting that the turnout will be low. Nonetheless they are
making plans for larger demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, 22, who was black, was hit by 19 out of 41 shots fired
by four white police officers in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building on Feb. 4, 1999. The officers said they opened
fire when they thought the unarmed street vendor was reaching for a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   The racially charged case _ which drew widespread protests in
New York City last winter and spring _ was transferred to Albany
last month by a state appeals court, which ruled that media
attention on the case had been so extensive that a fair jury could
not be picked in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, each charged with second-degree murder and
reckless endangerment in the shooting, are Kenneth Boss, Sean
Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy. If convicted, they
each face 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   If demonstrators plan to protest in Albany, they will have to
apply for a permit and the police have said that depending on the
size of the crowds, restrictions may be placed on demonstrators _
who are expected to come to support the Diallo family and the
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen had said in an interview last week that bullhorns would
be banned to keep the noise down and that if any were used they
would be confiscated. However, he said Tuesday that he had never
committed to a policy that would ban bullhorns, and said that he
had only talked about it as an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the location of the courthouse, in the midst of an
area that has both residences and businesses as well as ... other
courtrooms, the people that are conducting their lives and
business, separate and uninvolved with Diallo, have a right to a
normal day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief also said that restricting protesters to Academy Park
in downtown Albany was also only an option under consideration, but
that no final plan had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep the streets open ... if we try not to negatively
impact the streets, the most likely spot in close proximity to the
courthouse to put thousands of people is in that field,'' he said
referring to the park.
</P>
<P>
   A local activist who plans to be involved in the protests said
that her group wants to meet with Mayor Jerry Jennings and Nielsen
to see if they would be allowed to use bullhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a right to free speech,'' said Vickie A. Smith,
spokeswoman for the Capital Region Justice for Diallo Committee.
``We can exercise that in many ways, with signs, silently, or we
may also have bullhorns. We do not want to have that restriction
place on us. If we are peaceful and orderly that is the most
important thing.''

   SCOTUS-POLICE (Washington) _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday
that flight at the mere sight of a police officer could often, in
the context of other factors, be such suspicious behavior as to
justify a stop-and-frisk search by police. Although all nine
justices agreed with that broadly stated view, the court split 5-4
on how to apply it to the facts of a Chicago case in which a man
bolted at the sight of a convoy of police cars. By Linda
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   NH-VOICES (Madbury, N.J.) _ In more than 50 interviews, voters
here were hard pressed to come up with a nagging issue upon which
they would select their candidate. Instead, in a contrast to four
or eight years ago, when voters were bursting with worries about
the economy, this year they seem relatively content. That leaves
them the luxury of tuning their political antenna on the personal
attributes of the candidates, their spouses, their parents and, in
case of Al Gore, their bosses. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-OCALAN (Ankara) _ Responding to European pressure and
hoping to end a civil conflict that has shaken this country for 15
years, Turkish leaders decided on Wednesday to postpone executing
the country's most prominent rebel leader until a European rights
court has heard the case. The prisoner, Abdullah Ocalan, who
directed a guerrilla war aimed at winning more rights for Turkey's
Kurdish minority, was convicted of treason in June and sentenced to
die. Wednesday's decision means that he will probably remain alive
for at least a year. The decision may accelerate Turkey's move
toward membership in the European Union, which has become a
transcendent national goal. European leaders have urged Turkey not
to execute Ocalan. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-NUKE (Tokyo) _ More than any previous event in a history
full of serious mishaps, the nuclear accident in Japan last fall
rattled the coalition between industry and government that has long
made Japan the world's most ambitious user of nuclear energy.
Strikingly, in a country known for its political quiescence, the
sharp movement of public opinion against nuclear power has taken
the form of a genuine groundswell. By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-GAYS-MILITARY (London) _ Left with no other choice after
a sweeping ruling by a European court last fall, the British
government announced Wednesday that it would no longer bar openly
gay men and women from serving in the military. The new policy,
which at a stroke ends Britain's decades-old practice of subjecting
gay men and women in the military to intrusive personal
investigations and dishonorable discharges, brings Britain into
line with most other NATO countries, including France, Canada and
Germany, all of which allow openly gay men and lesbians to serve in
armed forces. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>

   ENCRYPTION-EXPORT (Washington) _ The Clinton administration
substantially relaxes export controls on technology related to
computer encryption. By David E. Sanger.

IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME AS ROE FACES WADE IN TRESPASSING CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Roe was there and so was Wade, facing each other across
a nearly empty courtroom and the chasm of a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everything was different this time. Jane Roe was still
Norma McCorvey but Wade was Kristin, the Dallas Country criminal
court judge who bears the name of her legendary father-in-law,
former District Attorney Henry Wade.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was still abortion, sort of, but rather than being in
court to pursue a monumental legal precedent, Roe was in Wade's
court to defend one of the country's most ardent anti-abortion
activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference Jesus makes,'' said the Rev. Flip Benham,
who was on trial for yet another charge of misdemeanor trespass.
</P>
<P>
   McCorvey filed the lawsuit, styled Roe vs. Wade, nearly 30 years
ago that led to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized
abortion. The district attorney she sued has long since retired,
but both his namesake son and daughter-in-law now serve on the
bench in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The two famous names were fated to be linked again when Benham's
case, stemming from a June 1999 charge of trespassing while
picketing a Dallas abortion clinic, was assigned to Kristin Wade's
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems more than a little ironic,'' Benham said during a
recess of the trial, which is expected to end Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As he picketed clinics across the country and sought souls to
convert, Benham never thought he would bag the biggest trophy of
all _ the woman who bulldozed the legal barriers to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But, in July 1995, she reversed her position on abortion and was
baptized by Benham in a backyard swimming pool the following month.
She has since started her own ministry, the church of No More Roe.
</P>
<P>
   With a handful of other witnesses, Roe filed into the courtroom
Wednesday afternoon, raised her right hand and was officially sworn
in by Wade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll get to testify or not,'' she said,
waiting in the corridor as the trial began. ``I hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, she has no quarrel with Wade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met her,'' she said.

   TOO MANY PERIPHERALS? CLONE THAT USB PORT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Universal Serial Bus has made life easier for Macintosh and
PC users, giving them an easy way to connect monitors, scanners,
digital cameras and other devices to their hearts' content (up to
127 peripherals, at least in theory). While some devices can be
daisy-chained, saving USB port space on the computer, many users
find that the two ports commonly found on many computers are
quickly used up.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to buy a hub, and Belkin Components of Compton,
Calif., showed off a new one at the Consumer Electronics Show in
Las Vegas. The device is called the Bus Station and retails for
about $100. The basic unit consists of a stack of four modules that
add seven USB ports.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Bus Station particularly handy is the other
modules that can be added to the basic unit or swapped for one or
more of the basic modules. If you need more U.S.B. ports, for
example, you can buy (for $69.95) a module with four USB ports.
That can be added to the basic unit, or simply swapped out for a
basic module with one port (giving a net gain of three). Other
modules are for serial, Ethernet or SCSI ports.
</P>
<P>
   So if your goal is to hook up 127 peripherals, the Bus Station
can probably help you achieve it. You might have to add another
``hub'' in the basement, however, to handle the extra drain on your
electrical system.

   A PHONE DEVICE THAT `HEARS' BY PICKING UP JAW VIBRATIONS
</P>
<P>
   So maybe you are one of those cellular phone users who is
concerned that using a phone may be hazardous to your health.
You've tried one of those earpiece-microphone combinations intended
to keep the phone away from your head, but you don't like having a
microphone dangling below your chin or pinned to your clothes.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to try a new product from EarHugger, a company
based in Provo, Utah, that markets cell phone accessories. The
device, which looks like a standard ear bud with a short stem on
it, includes a microphone that picks up sound through vibrations in
the jaw. The company says that sound quality is as good as other
more conventional hands-free sets.
</P>
<P>
   The EarHugger, which has a suggested retail price of $14.99, is
available for most major brands of phones, including Nokia and
Ericsson. &QL;

<P>
   KEEPING YOUR PHONE DRY IN THE WILD
</P>
<P>
   What's the great outdoors without a cell phone?
</P>
<P>
   For those people who aren't shocked by that question, MDX
Industries of Newbury, Mass., has just the thing: a watertight
plastic canister for keeping your phone or other electronic device
safe during your next biking, hiking or kayaking trip.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Cell Safe, the canister is made of yellow hard
plastic, with interior foam to cushion any blows. It's big enough
to accommodate most cell phones, with a little space left over for
money, keys or other valuables. It opens like a book, and an O-ring
seal keeps out water. The device, which has a suggested retail
price of $24.99, can fit into the water bottle cage on a bicycle,
be hung from a belt or be strapped to a backpack or the top of a
kayak.
</P>
<P>
   Cell Safe offers one more advantage not listed by the
manufacturer: it will protect a cell phone from the angry campers
nearby after the phone rings and spoils their quiet evening around
the campfire.

   TWO COMPANIES AGREE TO SEND SPEEDY REBATES TO CUSTOMERS
</P>
<P>
   After fielding numerous consumer complaints about rebates that
are slow to arrive, the Federal Trade Commission has reached
agreements with two computer product companies under which they
will provide more timely rebates to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements state that the companies, Memtek Products, which
sells the Memorex brand of computer disks, and Umax Technologies, a
distributor of PCs, scanners and digital cameras, must provide
checks to their customers within the times they specify in writing.
If no time is specified, the rebates must be provided within 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements stems from FTC charges that the companies
promised consumers they would receive cash rebates within 12 weeks
after purchasing specific products, but that they had failed to
deliver them until several months later.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Umax, for example, the FTC says that in several
instances, the company failed to send $50 rebates on its Astra
1220S scanner for five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to take on cases that have egregious violations of law
and touch on fundamental protections for consumers,'' said Alice
Hrdy, an FTC lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The companies agreed to the ruling out of court and with no
admissions of any legal wrongdoing, said Jodie Bernstein, director
of consumer protection at the commission. ``We want to send a
message to computer companies that these are rules they have to pay
attention to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Johnson, vice president of marketing at Memtek,
acknowledged that the company had run into trouble handling the
volume of rebate requests it had received. It has significantly
reduced the number of rebate offers as a result, he said. ``It was
a bad situation for everyone involved, but it's behind us, and
we're happy with the agreement,'' he said.

   UPLOADING IMAGES FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN
</P>
<P>
   Students whose interest in the ocean ended when Leonardo
diCaprio's character died at the end of ``Titanic'' may want to
tune their Web browsers to www.ocean.udel.edu/deepsea Thursday for
the first of eight live Internet classes being held from the bottom
of the sea. A University of Delaware scientist, Dr. Craig Cary,
will board the submersible Alvin and dive into the Gulf of
California, where he will talk to selected middle-school classes
and upload images to the Internet through a satellite connection.
Cary will be studying thermal vents and some creatures that dwell
there, like the Pompeii worm, an eyeless, mouthless creature that
can withstand temperatures of more than 235 degrees Fahrenheit.
Hey, nobody thought Leonardo diCaprio was going to be a big star,
either.

AN UPHILL CLIMB FOR `HIGHER GROUND'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
 
 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Higher Ground,'' the Fox Family Channel's first venture into
dramatic series television, has a title with vague religious
overtones and is all about redemption yet strives for a
tough-minded edge. The cast is cluttered with pretty yet moody,
telegenic faces just waiting to break out on the next cover of Teen
People.
</P>
<P>
   The show itself reflects such schizophrenic ambitions. It's a
more dour ``Welcome Back, Kotter'' for the extreme-sports
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lando, late of ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' stars as Peter
Scarbrow, the head of Mount Horizon, a wilderness camp nestled in a
gorgeous pocket of the Pacific Northwest that caters to troubled
kids (good kids should rate a camp so nice). He has a past himself,
as they say, so is able to relate to his passel of rebellious kids.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot episode introduces us to the camp's latest troubled
kid _ Scott Barringer (Hayden Christensen), a former high-school
football hero who descended into drug use, emotionally wrecked by
his lithesome stepmother's furtive enforced dalliances. While being
transported to the camp, he's accompanied by a security guard who
apparently has never been hipped to the ``climb out the bathroom
window at the gas station'' trick, which kills some time before we
get to the clump of exposition introducing those at the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Horizon boasts a demographically diverse group of kids _
it's interesting how shows aimed at teens and kids, like this and
the bulk of programming on Nickelodeon, can manage to have racially
diverse casts when adult network fare can't manage the same thing.
Shelby (A.J. Cook) is the promiscuous tease. Juliette (Meghan Ory)
is bulimic. Ezra (Kyle Downes) is a shy guy who almost overdosed
when his parent went through a nasty divorce. Katherine (Kandyse
McClure) is conflicted by her racial identity. Auggie (Jorge
Vargas) is a dyslexic tagger. Naturally, they're all a lot more
sensitive than the tough exteriors they try to show the world.
</P>
<P>
   At Mount Horizon, the kids enjoy lots of adventurous outings _
one falls into the rapids and has to be fished out by the others in
an action sequence accompanied by the requisite pulsating music _
yet Scott is resistant to the place. Why? Why, given any
teen-ager's alternative _ regular high school and hanging out with
their parents _ would any kid have a problem with this scenic camp?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's Mount Horizon's ground rules _ no drugs, sex or
violence. And this is a TV series?
</P>
<P>
   Really, there's only so far this series can take us, unless it
gets truly daring and tackles headlong abuse and other issues,
which lead kids like these to their assorted problems, without
whitewashing them. Certainly, younger viewers aren't going to care
much about Peter's romantic complications. Unfortunately, the pilot
seems to suggest that the show will be content merely to depict
Peter as a cool older guy who's into rock climbing and
communicating with TV-pretty kids about vague disaffection and
shooting the rapids. Which seems more high-concept than ``Higher
Ground.'' &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: AN UGLY LEGACY LIVES ON, ITS GLARE UNSOFTENED BY
AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mo.)  (js) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The photographs that go on view Friday at Roth
Horowitz, a gallery on the Upper East Side, may never fit
comfortably into the history of art, or for that matter, of
photography. This is because they are so deeply embedded in the
history of hatred, specifically the American history of hatred,
which is often a matter of race. They manifest this hatred
shockingly, remorselessly, tragically.
</P>
<P>
   The 60 photographs are of American lynchings that took place
between 1883 and 1960, mostly but not always in the South. Most of
them were taken by professional photographers immediately or a
short while after the lynching, sometimes during. All but a few of
the victims were African-American men and women.
</P>
<P>
   These images have been collected over the past decade by James
Allen, an antiques dealer from Atlanta, along with related material
like anti-lynching pamphlets and newspaper reports, which are also
on display. Everything in the show is from the Allen-Littlefield
Collection, on deposit in the special collections department of the
Robert W. Woodruff Library at Emory University. The show was
initiated by Andrew Roth when he learned that Twin Palms Publishers
was planning a book about the Allen-Littlefield collection. A book
published this month, ``Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in
America'' reproduces 98 images from the collection, with essays by
the Georgia congressman John Lewis, the historian Leon F. Litwack,
the writer Hilton Als and Allen, who has annotated each image.
Although this material has been available to scholars for two
years, this is the first time any of it has been exhibited. The
show at Roth Horowitz, at 160A E. 70th St., continues through Feb.
12.
</P>
<P>
   These images, most of which are postcard-size, are incendiary;
they will burn a hole in your heart. They depict the lifeless forms
of black men and women hanging from trees, bridges, from telegraph
poles, often tortured or mutilated. They depict charred corpses
held aloft like banners and relatively intact ones arranged like
hunting trophies.
</P>
<P>
   They are postcard-size because that is what they were: most of
them original photographic postcards and a few printed halftones
(some hand-tinted) that were produced in the hundreds and
occasionally the thousands and sent through the mail, sometimes as
warnings (until around 1908, when the postmaster general of the
United States forbade the sending of such material). Some bear
personal inscriptions: ``This is the barbecue we had last night. My
picture is to the left with a cross over it, your sone (sic) Joe,''
reads one message. One of the most complex postcards includes a
portrait of the victim, Will James, at its center, surrounded by
four images related to his lynching and ending with the burial of
his ashes.
</P>
<P>
   But as Allen observes in his eloquent afterword, it is not so
much the victims that stun, although of course they do. What takes
the breath away is the sight of all the white people, maskless,
milling about, looking straight at the camera as if they had
nothing to be ashamed of, often smiling. Sometimes they line up in
an orderly fashion, as if they were at a class reunion or church
picnic. Sometimes they cluster around the victim, hoisting children
on their shoulders so that they can see, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the camera has pulled back for a long view, so that
one sees only immense seas of white people filling the image edge
to edge. One such image has a wide black smudge, flaring like a
funnel from center to upper edge, that on first sight appears to be
a stain on either the print or the negative. Then you realize that
the smudge is billowing, and that its source, which holds the crowd
rapt, is someone being burned alive.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may argue that these images don't tell us much that
isn't already known about the terror inflicted on African-Americans
in the 70 or 80 years after the Emancipation Proclamation.
Beginning with books published as early as 1905, the history of
lynching has been written, along with that of the anti-lynching
movement that helped call it to the world's attention. Starting in
the early 1880s, several organizations, including the Tuskegee
Institute in Alabama and The Chicago Tribune, kept annual records.
``Between 1882 and 1968, an estimated 4,742 blacks met their deaths
at the hands of lynch mobs,'' writes Litwack.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-lynching advocates like the African-American journalist Ida
B. Wells often sent detectives to investigate individual lynchings
and published their reports. More than one historian has noted that
the detail available from newspaper and witness accounts was always
in stark contrast to the brevity of the coroner's reports, which
invariably read ``death at the hands of persons unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Few white people ever came to trial, writes Litwack, adding that
in any case, ``juries would have refused to convict, whatever the
evidence.'' Historians have dissected the charade of protecting the
flower of white Southern womanhood that often triggered lynchings
and reported that many victims had done nothing more than not
stepping aside on a sidewalk, or accidentally brushing against a
young girl, or disagreeing with a white businessman or store owner.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have also detailed the carnival atmosphere and the
social ritual of a lynching, which was often announced in advance
and drew thousands of people from the surrounding area. And they
have reported that people in the crowds often took part in the
torture and then scrambled afterwards to get bits of cloth or bone
as souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   But the images at Roth Horowitz instigate a deeper, more
visceral experience of knowing history. It is one thing to read
that some lynchings were publicized beforehand, another to see
firsthand evidence. One of the most chilling nonphotographic
exhibits at Roth Horowitz is a pamphlet published by the NAACP with
a facsimile of the front page of The Memphis Press, Jan. 26, 1921:
``May Lynch 3 to 6 Negroes This Evening.'' Similarly, the often
intense fetishization of the victim, the desire for what are in
effect relics, is concretized by an image of a lynching displayed
as Allen purchased it, framed under glass with several strands of
the victim's hair.
</P>
<P>
   These images make the past present. They refute the notion that
photographs of charged historical subjects lose their power,
softening and becoming increasingly aesthetic with time. These
images are not going softly into any artistic realm. Instead they
send shock waves through the brain, implicating ever larger chunks
of American society and in many ways reaching up to the present.
They give one a deeper and far sadder understanding of what it has
meant to be white and to be black in America. And what it still
means.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The collection records the effects of fear and ignorance
translated into mindless hate and taken to heinous conclusions. It
also reminds us that such unexamined fear projected outward as
hatred is still very present in American society in phenomena that
range from the dragging death of James Byrd Jr. near Jasper, Texas,
in 1998, to the difficulty black men face trying to hail cabs in
New York City. Als makes this clear in his essay when he writes,
``In my life as a city dweller, I have crossed dark nighttime
streets so as not to make the white woman walking in front of me
feel fear. . . . What I mean is that so much care, so much care is
taken not to scare white people simply with my existence, and it's
as if they don't want to deal with the care, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Horrific as they are, these photographs are a kind of gift, the
gift of knowledge, the chance for greater consciousness and caring.
That they were made so openly reflects the unquestioning
presumption of white supremacy but also preserves that presumption
in all its brutality for us to know anew.
</P>
<P>
   One exhibit at Roth Horowitz provides a glimmer of what these
photographs might mean for the future. It is a photograph of Frank
Embree standing on the back of a buggy, naked and chained, shortly
before his death in Fayette, Mo., on July 22, 1899. He has been
severely whipped and the camera records the deep lacerations up and
down his body. But it also records his insuperable dignity and his
eyes, which look down at the camera and directly into the lens,
oblivious of the leering white men who crowd into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Als writes that Embree's eyes are dead, but it seems equally
arguable that they know death is coming. Their narrow, exclusive
focus gives them a flicker of life. Embree looks into the camera as
if into the future, as if he knows that the camera will ultimately
betray the men around him and let the world know his fate.

BOOK TALK: LITERARY ADVOCATES FOR BLACK VOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the wild inconsistencies of book publishing, it should
come as no surprise that in an industry populated mostly by liberal
thinkers and based, finally, on an openness of thought and
expression, there are only a handful of black literary agents.
There is a huge growth opportunity for blacks who want to be
agents, though, because agents are mostly self-employed and do not
have to be hired by anyone but writers.
</P>
<P>
   The few African-American agents are doing well, but publishing
needs more entrepreneurial blacks and Hispanics who are interested
in books and want to represent authors. More writing by and about
African-Americans is in bookstores than ever before, and agents say
that there are many more blacks trying to get published.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises these questions: Do black literary agents face
special challenges in an industry that is ruefully almost entirely
white? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Do black agents feel a particular obligation to give priority to
black clients? The answer, if for some a subliminal yes, also has a
major caveat. The established black agents all have white clients,
and they are business people who would smash just about anyone,
regardless or race, on behalf of their writers. Black agents do not
practice apartheid agenting.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that they aren't mindful of special problems
and contradictions. Black agents say they are often overwhelmed
with unsolicited manuscripts from African-Americans who believe a
black agent would be more receptive than a white one. Black agents
welcome more black colleagues to share the load. On the other hand,
it is not uncommon for a black agent to successfully establish a
writer's career only to have the author switch to a white agent in
the hopes of getting a better deal in a white industry.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Stinson, a highly respected black agent whose office is
in Detroit, said, ``White agents have told me that the reason they
get black clients is the writer feels more validated with a white
agent, or they feel it would be stupid to leave a white agent in a
white industry for a black agent.'' But the reverse has also been
true also, she said. Ms. Stinson has gotten black clients who left
white agents, and has negotiated their biggest advances.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stinson, who is also starting a small publishing house for
Christian fiction, sells more than 30 books a year, three-quarters
of them by blacks, and has had her best sellers, including Pearl
Cleage's novel ``What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day'' (Avon,
1998). She would like to see more black editors, but she must sell
mostly to whites, ``who have been very receptive to
African-American material and really fought for things for me.''
(The shortage of black editors is acute, and it is not a result of
discrimination, but economics: Entry-level jobs in publishing have
such low salaries that few beginners without financial help can
afford them.)
</P>
<P>
   But black writers, and therefore their agents, have problems
beyond the shortage of black editors. Ms. Stinson said:
``Publishers are looking for material that can have a 100,000-copy
first printing. Few African-American commercial writers can get
that. Most are in the 30,000-to-50,000 first-copy range, a good
range to build a career on, but it looks as if many of these
authors are settling in there.''
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough for black writers was the success in 1992 of
Terry McMillan's ``Waiting to Exhale'' (Viking), a novel about the
friendship among four black women. Previously, crossover fiction by
blacks tended to be literary: Toni Morrison, Ralph Ellison, Richard
Wright, James Baldwin. Since ``Exhale,'' publishers are more
willing to take a gamble on black popular fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Tanya McKinnon, a young black agent, has sold 13 books, ``seven
figures worth,'' in about a year and a half working in an agency
owned by Mary Evans, who is white. The recent successes of
African-American books, she said, ``shows that people of color read
and buy books, and the black market is a lucrative one; there's a
new kind of person, the multicultural person.'' She has a
parti-colored list of clients, but said, ``I'm certainly delighted
when I find a talented black writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the emergence of black agents has been singularly
important for black writers. Adrienne Ingrum, a former book editor
and publisher who is the associate publisher of The Black Issues
Book Review, said that in ``no way would there be the boom in black
books without a black literary agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Even though a lot of blacks are handled by white
agents, it was black agents who cultivated new black talent. Often
white editors and publishers don't understand the talent in the
black community, and if it isn't for black agents communicating
that culture to a very white culture, there would be a lot fewer
black books.''
</P>
<P>
   What used to be unutterable is now acknowledged: Many blacks who
were becoming agents, like many of the whites, simply were not very
good at it. The handful of prominent ones who have survived the
publishing wars _ Marie Brown, Faith Childs, Lawrence Jordan, Ms.
McKinnon and Ms. Stinson, for instance _ are respected
professionals who have earned the most necessary tool of all:
access _ the ability to pick up the phone and get an important
editor on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, a former Doubleday editor, has a client list that is
mostly black. She says that although there are many black writers
who feel more significant with white agents, ``there are just as
many who really feel they are in better hands with black agents
because of their subject matter, and our commitment to selling
publishers more diverse writing.'' But black agents are overwhelmed
with submissions from blacks who want to write, and there is a need
for more African-American agents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Manie Barron, a black editor at Random House, said that
curiously enough, as book publishing has become more politically
correct, discernment about the black story has lessened. ``In the
late '60s and early '70s, there were the black exploitation films,
exploiting the ghetto with stories of criminals,'' he said. ``Now
publishers want to obliterate this. Well, I came from Harlem, and
that was the reality I grew up with and most people grew up with in
the inner city. The professional people grew up with the bad ones.
A black editor or agent knows that unless you can show the dirt,
you don't get the message across.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, an agent with black and white clients, agreed.
``Publishing needs more blacks, editors and sales reps as well as
agents to come along and push the envelope to publishing places we
cannot now imagine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he sold a book about a black woman's relationship with
her late mother. It took him 18 months to find a publisher who
thought that this black story was worth telling. White and black
editors turned it down. Finally it was bought by Jeremy P.
Tarcher/Putnam by a white editor and will be published as ``Life
Lessons My Mother Taught Me'' at the end of the month. The writer
is Andrea Young. The mother was Jean Young. The father and husband
is Andrew Young.

`TOUCHING EVIL': A DETECTIVE FEELS GUILTY IN HIS VERY HUMAN WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and channel
are for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(DW) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Creegan isn't an inspired detective. He makes mistakes. Big
ones. And then he gets so tied up in knots over them that he's
liable to make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Creegan is an inspired character, though, a nonhero who somehow
manages a heroic moment or two. He is at the center of the British
series ``Touching Evil,'' which returns Thursday night to the PBS
anthology ``Mystery.'' Creegan and the other all-too-human members
of the Organized and Serial Crime Unit will be tested by three
cases, each presented in two hourlong episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night Creegan, played with angst-soaked intensity by
Robson Green, is on the trail of a killer who has been preying on
young women in London while a tabloid reporter named David Laney
(James Nesbitt) pumps up the public's hysteria. Creegan and his
colleagues Susan Taylor (Nicola Walker) and Mark Rivers (Shaun
Dingwall) quickly figure out who the killer is, but even though
Creegan and Rivers corner the man with his latest victim, a college
student, they fail to thwart her death. The anguished detectives
stand, guns in their hands, as her throat is slit.
</P>
<P>
   When the guilt-ridden Creegan is confronted by the student's
father, Michael Hawkins (John Duttine), the scene offers a window
into this policeman's unsettled soul. It also demonstrates why
``Touching Evil'' transcends the usual cop drama.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by his inability to learn from the authorities the
details of his daughter's death, Hawkins asks Creegan if he saw her
die. Creegan nods affirmatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was she awake when it happened?'' Hawkins demands. ``Did she _
did she suffer?''
</P>
<P>
   Creegan cannot answer. He stares wordlessly at Hawkins, eyes
bulging as if to contain the tears. Hawkins gasps, then says: ``I
see. You know, that's the first time anyone's been honest with
me.'' In this dark world, honesty can be heard only in silence.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dark world: night and day, indoors and out; a world ever
shrouded in shadows of midnight blue, where what light there is
comes from unexpected directions. The story (script by Mike Cullen;
series created by Paul Abbott), the acting and the visual elements
(directed by Sheree Folkson; photographed by David Odd; production
design by Claire Kenny) are blended with unusual skill into a
somber concoction that holds your attention. You'll want to see how
this tale winds down.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there are pedestrian elements here. The serial killer, a nut
case named Emerson (Tony Curran), is no more than a standard-issue
New Age villain who declares: ``Nobody knows me. Nobody stops me.''
Take heed, please, that this show is not for children; it contains
nudity, coarse language and disturbing depictions of killings.
</P>
<P>
   But many grown-ups will be satisfied to note that there are
adult ideas in play. When the reporter Laney tries to seduce the
lonely Taylor, he reminds her how tightly they are both bound to
the killer, whose identity the police have not yet learned. In the
last year, ``he's taken over my life,'' Laney says of the focus of
their attention. ``You go catchin' 'im, I'm out of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of next Thursday's installment the case will be
closed, although not to the total satisfaction of anyone on the
screen. The viewer, however, can be forgiven for thinking that
things turned out rather well.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I don't ask much for my new property, just a shrub that keeps
its blooms from spring to early winter in an upstate New York
climate. Someone suggested Fairy roses. I don't want an English
manicured look for my rustic Catskills cottage, but I was told
Fairy roses don't look like real roses. True?
</P>
<P>
   A. False from start to finish (although I assume you are being
humorous about the modesty of your request). Roses and cottages go
together like bagels and cream cheese. The English look _ at least
as imitated in this country _ is usually crowded, informal,
anything but manicured. And if we define ``real'' as original, or
wild, individual Fairy roses look more like real roses than the
uptight hybrid teas at the florist.
</P>
<P>
   But individual roses are not the point. This plant, which is
technically a polyantha named the Fairy, is famous for covering
itself with long, loose clusters of pale pink flowers from late
spring until hard frost. The many-petaled blossoms are small, round
in bud and flattish after they open. The foliage is dense. The
leaves are shiny and dark green. The Fairy is, comparatively,
cold-hardy and disease-resistant and has been a big seller since it
was introduced in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   But before you fall in love, bear in mind that shrub refers more
to shape than size. The Fairy usually grows no taller than 2 1/2
feet. And don't expect any fragrance. You'll get more perfume from
Carefree Beauty, a tough, generous bloomer, with bigger, darker
pink flowers on a bigger bush. And if, after all, you go for the
classic rose-covered bower beside the cottage door, try doing the
covering with Autumn Sunset, a hardy, repeat-blooming climber,
whose fragrant flowers glow apricot gold.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairy and Carefree Beauty are available at well-stocked
garden centers. Autumn Sunset can be ordered from Lowe's Roses, 6
Sheffield Rd., Nashua, N.H. 03062; (603) 888-2214; catalog, $3; and
Royall River Roses, P.O. Box 370, Yarmouth, Maine 04096; (800)

<P>
   Inside Private Gardens
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be in New Orleans at the end of March and am
interested in visiting home gardens. Could you supply me with the
names of garden clubs or horticulture societies that I could get in
touch with? Is there a directory of such organizations to which I
could refer when I am traveling?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you're not on the Internet already, garden touring may be
reason enough to get wired _ or at least to visit a cybercafe. A
quick Web search for ``garden club tours'' yielded 25,900 entries,
and while most of them were undoubtedly dead ends, many of the
first couple of hundred looked promising. You can also go directly
to www.gardentourist.com.
</P>

   This site is a regularly updated electronic version of the
Garden Tourist, a paperback calendar-guide organized by state. It
is available in bookstores or directly from the Garden Tourist
Press, 330 W. 72nd St., Suite 12B, New York, N.Y. 10023, for
$21.95, plus $3 shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an easy shortcut to inside looks at some of the
loveliest (and most private) private gardens in the United States,
the Garden Conservancy's Open Days Directory.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit conservancy is dedicated to preserving fine
gardens all over America, and on open days visitors are welcomed
into hundreds of them. Directories are $14.95, plus $3.50 for

REFORMERS BRADLEY, McCAIN REMAIN UNDER SCRUTINY ON CAMPAIGN-FINANCEBy BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houston oilman Oscar Wyatt co-wrote a letter to John McCain,
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, in May 1997, complaining
about the lack of federal help in prodding the British government
to open up slots at London's Gatwick Airport for his airline
venture.
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded within days to the complaint by Wyatt and
partner Sir Freddie Laker, the owners of Laker Airways. The
powerful senator fired off a letter to the head of the U.S.
Department of Transportation asking that he send a ``prompt
response addressing the issue directly to Mr. Wyatt and Sir Freddie
Laker.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt was prompt in returning the favor, sending $5,000 in
campaign contributions from himself and the political action
committee of Coastal Corp., his Houston oil firm, according to
Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions were perfectly legal and the sequence of
events just part of life in Washington, state capitals and city
halls.
</P>
<P>
   But now McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley, an 18-year veteran of
the U.S. Senate, are running for president on a crusade to cleanse
Washington of special-interest money. Because they've set such high
standards for the rest of the country, the reformers find
themselves under much more scrutiny than their rivals on the
campaign-finance issue.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have made inroads against their party's front-runners,
Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush, by portraying
themselves as mavericks who will challenge the political
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of reports recently have revealed that both men
have also played the insider's game in Congress, willing to give a
hand to contributors who want pressure applied within the
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe this week reported that Bradley had received
$500 contributions from officers of Sigma Corp., a New Jersey
company that sought his help with the Commerce Department to
resolve a trade dispute. The account was published after Bradley
challenged reporters ``to go take a look'' at whether he had ever
written letters to federal agencies on behalf of contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was recently criticized in a new report by the Center
for Public Integrity for his close ties to Wall Street and the
large amounts of money he has taken from big financial firms and
pharmaceutical companies. The report alleges that as a senator from
New Jersey, Bradley regularly pushed legislation that helped these
donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a practice,'' Bradley said Wednesday while
campaigning in Indianola, Iowa. ``I also said ... maybe there was
one (incident) out there. That was a letter on behalf of a
constituent. It said, please make a decision. It's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he would help this company, which had donated to
his campaign, rather than other companies that might have needed
similar help, Bradley responded, ``There might be others there that
I've written on behalf of constituents. No, I don't think it's
wrong at all.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was questioned recently about a letter to the Federal
Communications Commission on behalf of a large Florida-based
contributor, Paxson Communications, which was seeking a television
license.
</P>
<P>
   McCain abruptly canceled a fund-raiser that was to be hosted by
the company's president after the letters were made public.
Nevertheless he still received $20,000 in contributions from the
company's executives for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To contain any damage, McCain made public more than 500 letters
he has written to the federal agencies, a majority of which, his
staff claimed, were written on behalf of individuals or companies
who were not major contributors to his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The letter written for Wyatt was included in a pile of what the
senator's staff said were communications on behalf of
noncontributors. While Wyatt gave money for McCain's last Senate
campaign, he has not contributed to his presidential effort.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal Corp.'s PAC gave $5,000 to McCain's chief rival, George
W. Bush. And Wyatt's wife, Lynn, gave $1,000 to former GOP
contender Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   A Coastal spokeswoman said Wednesday only that the contributions
are ``a matter of public record, and we will let the record speak
for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Political experts differ on the fairness of the recent criticism
of McCain and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the oldest principles of human nature is people in
glass houses shouldn't be throwing boulders,'' said Larry Sabato,
professor of political science at the University of Virginia, ``Mr.
Clean and Mr. Integrity can't live up to their Mother Teresa
image.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said the candidates invited criticism of their record by
not living up to their campaign rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are sanctimonious and play holier than thou you bring
this thing on yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others say it is unreasonable to expect McCain and Bradley,
who left the Senate in 1996, not to carry out what are considered
normal duties, such as writing letters for constituents, including
those that donate to their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an elected official you're expected to be a player,'' said
Thomas Mann, a political expert at the Brookings Institution. ``It
is not a matter of selling votes or acting inappropriately. It
partly comes with the territory, the expectation of what members of
Congress will do on behalf of constituents and private citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann and others still give McCain and Bradley credit for trying
to change the entrenched system.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who appears to have weathered the initial controversy,
has acknowledged that he is tainted by the current campaign-finance
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you do is under suspicion,'' he told voters
Wednesday at a town hall meeting in Milford, N.H. He had been asked
to clarify whether his intercession on behalf of Paxson was
legitimate advocacy or ``pandering to special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Arizona senator also said he was prodding a slow-moving
federal bureaucracy into action. McCain has said the two letters he
wrote on behalf of the company to the FCC did not recommend a
specific action, only ask that it move quickly on a case it had
been sitting on for two years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain then pledged to destroy what he called the ``the iron
triangle of big money, lobbyists and the legislative process.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his staff believe he has weathered the controversy
although the senator responded testily when asked about
contributions from Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I raised several million dollars in that campaign,''
he said. ``I have no recollection of that. Nor do I care. I'm
getting a little weary of this business.''
</P>
<P>
   And voters who have flocked to hear McCain in New Hampshire also
appear ready to move on. Many say they accept his explanation that
he was doing his job regarding his letters to the FCC on behalf of
Paxson Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have to like it. But I understand it,'' said
Paul Amato, a 47-year-old owner of a candle factory and McCain
supporter who showed up at the senator's town hall meeting in
Milford.

WHEN ART AND POWER WERE A GOOD MATCH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ The 20th century's experience with the dubious
aesthetics of Fascism, Nazism and communism left several clear
lessons: works of art commissioned by governments are generally
mediocre; creativity does not flourish inside ideological
boundaries; artistic expression is by definition a kind of
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, judging by some reactions to the Brooklyn Museum of
Art's recent show ``Sensation: Young British Artists From the
Saatchi Collection,'' even the motives of private arts patrons are
not above suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   But step back a few centuries and the focus changes. Without the
``interference'' of the Vatican, the Italian principalities and the
royal courts of Vienna, Paris, Madrid, London and Brussels, among
others, Europe's artistic heritage would be a great deal poorer.
</P>
<P>
   From the 15th century to the 18th century, many fine painters
were wooed with money, security and status and in exchange spent
their time glorifying the ``ideology'' of the Roman Catholic Church
and exalting assorted popes, monarchs and military heroes. They
also produced prodigious art.
</P>
<P>
   This was certainly the case with three masters of the
post-Renaissance whose relationship with power is the subject of
``Velazquez, Rubens, Van Dyck: Court Painters of the 17th
Century,'' a new exhibition at the Prado Museum in Madrid that runs
through March 5. Each artist had his own style of painting, but
they nonetheless had much in common: their careers coincided during
two decades; they supported the Catholic Counter-Reformation;
Velazquez and Van Dyck looked up to Rubens, 22 years their senior;
and all revered Titian, who died in 1576, the year before Rubens'
birth. But what most united them was that they were first and
foremost court painters.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, Peter Paul Rubens was the most adept at juggling
patrons. After leaving Antwerp for Venice in 1600, he was promptly
hired by the Duke of Mantua. Returning home in 1608, he again
became court painter, this time to the regents of the Spanish
Netherlands in Brussels. In 1622, he accepted commissions from
Louis XIII of France and the queen mother, Marie de Medicis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1625, he was painting the Duke of Buckingham in London. Four
years later, he was in Madrid, working in the royal palace. A good
linguist as well as a skilled diplomat, he was even knighted by
both Charles I and Philip IV for his role in negotiating peace
between England and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Van Dyck, who studied with Rubens around 1618, evidently
learned more than art from his sophisticated and peripatetic
mentor. After making his name in Antwerp as a precocious young
artist with an eye to the good life, he traveled first to London,
where he painted a portrait of the Earl of Arundel, and then to
Italy, where he painted numerous oils of aristocrats and their
children as well as religious works.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a fresh stretch in Antwerp, he returned to London
in 1632 and was appointed ``principalle Paynter'' to Charles I, a
post that he held with distinction and aplomb until his death in
1641.
</P>
<P>
   Diego Velazquez, in contrast, had the least eventful career of
the three: he was just 24 when he was named royal painter by Philip
IV of Spain, and he held the post until his death in 1660. Although
he twice traveled to Italy (where he painted his remarkable
portrait of Pope Innocent X), most of his nonroyal work was done
while still a young man in Seville.
</P>
<P>
   In the palace, he was absorbed by official painting and,
increasingly, by nonartistic duties. Successively he was named
gentleman usher to the king, gentleman of the bedchamber and
finally chamberlain of the palace. No wonder that, compared with
Rubens and Van Dyck, his output was small, with fewer than 100 of
his paintings surviving today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is Velazquez, or rather the 400th anniversary of his
birth in Seville in June 1599, that inspired this show. In theory,
the centennial might have justified a Velazquez blockbuster, but
one was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1989
and an even larger one at the Prado in 1990. And it could not be
repeated so soon (or, who knows, ever).
</P>
<P>
   So, to follow other anniversary exhibitions, notably ``Velazquez
and Seville'' in Seville last fall and ``Velazquez in New York
Museums'' currently at the Frick Collection, the Prado invited the
art historian Jonathan Brown to organize a more modest, more
didactic show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worth emphasizing the exploratory nature of this
effort,'' Brown writes in a catalog essay, noting that the
exhibition is designed to raise questions and provoke debates as
much as to produce conclusions. ``It is, in reality, an exercise in
comparative history, a kind of history that because of its
intrinsic difficulties is rarely attempted and even less so in the
history of art.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth centenary of Van Dyck's birth, which also fell last
year, provides additional topicality, although the Flemish painter
was amply celebrated in a major retrospective seen first at the
Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp last summer and again at the
Royal Academy in London in the fall. In fact, there was just time
for some of the Van Dycks, including his magisterial
``Self-Portrait With Sunflower'' and ``Charles I in the Order of
the Garter,'' to travel from London for the opening here on Dec.
17.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of the 44 works on display (17 by Velazquez, 14 by Van Dyck, 12
by Rubens and one copy of a Rubens), however, 14 come from the
Prado's own collection.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition itself is divided into five thematic sections _
self-portrait; monarchy; court portraits; mythology and fable; and
religion and faith _ that serve to underline what the three
painters had in common. Yet from the first room, their different
personalities become apparent. Velazquez's 1640 self-portrait _ one
of just two that survive (excluding his appearance in ``Las
Meninas,'' which is on permanent display elsewhere in the Prado) _
shows a stern man in simple clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyck's 1633 self-portrait with a sunflower captures the
dandy in him. Rubens' 1638-1640 self-portrait, with glove, sword
and elegant hat, glows with his pride at achieving social
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The section on the monarchy dwells on military prowess, as in
Velazquez's legendary ``Surrender at Breda'' and Rubens' ``Triumph
of Henri IV.'' More space is given to court portraiture, with two
equestrian paintings, Velazquez's ``Philip IV on Horseback'' and
Rubens' ``Cardinal-Prince Fernando of Austria in the Battle of
Nordlingen,'' contrasting Velazquez's directness with Rubens'
affection for allegorical reference.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Van Dyck's portraits, whether of Charles I or
assorted child princes, there is a lushness absent in Velazquez's
undramatic portraits of, say, Philip IV and Queen Mariana of
Austria. Here again, personality played a role: Van Dyck was eager
to flatter his subjects, while Velazquez painted what he saw (so
much so that Philip IV refused to be painted in later life).
</P>
<P>
   In the gallery dedicated to mythology and fable, the show
illustrates how Velazquez handled subjects also tackled by Van Dyck
and Rubens. Beside Velazquez's remarkably realistic ``Forge of
Vulcan'' hangs Van Dyck's almost Romantic ``Tetis in the Forge of
Vulcan.'' Versions of ``Mercury and Argus'' by Velazquez and Rubens
again contrast the Spaniard's eye for the unexpected with the
Fleming's more classical approach. And when both men paid tribute
to Titian's ``Rape of Europa,'' Rubens copied the original, while
Velazquez tucked his version into the background of ``The
Spinners.''
</P>
<P>
   Still more distinct is Velazquez's majestically simple religious
painting. Surprisingly, given Philip IV's position as a prominent
Catholic monarch, his court painter did little religious work. This
show nonetheless presents crucifixions by all three artists:
Rubens' ``Martyrdom of St. Andrew'' is full of color and movement,
with angels on high; Van Dyck's ``Christ on the Cross'' shows a
single cross standing against an almost pastoral scene, with all
the drama focused on Christ's tortured face; Velazquez's ``Christ
on the Cross,'' set against a black background, is moving in its
austerity.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if a conclusion to this show may be risked, it is that
Velazquez, seemingly the most tied-down of the three painters, in
fact exercised the greatest freedom in his approach to the themes
of his day. While Rubens and Van Dyck were engaged in meeting the
expectations of a variety of patrons, the Sevillano had only one
master to please. And, by good fortune, Philip IV was a patron who
understood the notion of artistic license.
</P>
<P>
   The entire show is of course a tribute to royal patronage.
Indeed, because of the Prado's infamous space limitations, the
exhibition is embedded in the museum's main collection, a
collection that rests heavily on the treasures accumulated by
successive Hapsburg and Bourbon monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, visitors emerging from the show on the Villanueva Palace's
main floor immediately find themselves in galleries filled with
still more works executed by Velazquez, Rubens and Van Dyck as
court painters. And if they want to organize their own virtual
show, they can even look at the Prado's wonderful Titian collection
to see how much the Venetian inspired his 17th-century heirs.

POPLIFE: FAVORITE CD'S YOU NEARLY MISSED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   At least 27,000 recordings were released last year around the
world. Somewhere within them was one CD that was just right for
you: it was filled with the kind of music that speaks to you most,
that sets your heart on fire with the selfless, nameless excitement
that only art and love can inspire. It was a recording you would
play day and night, and for every friend and relative within
earshot. But sadly you never heard it. How could you? The odds were
against you: 27,000 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Every year the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times try to
lower those odds with the alternative Top 10, a list of
high-quality recordings that almost got away in the preceding year.
These are not by the bands you were assaulted with all year long on
the radio but CD's that lay tucked away in an obscure corner of the
globe, in a tiny one-room record store selling independent
recordings or lost in the racks underneath life-size Backstreet
Boys cutouts at chain stores.
</P>
<P>
   No two critics envision this list the same way: Among other
things, it is an opportunity to spot up-and-coming talent, to cite
favorites that just missed the cut in the traditional year-end Top
10 list or to come to the rescue of a critically or commercially
maligned mainstream recording.
</P>
<P>
   If employees at your local record store call security to eject
you from the premises when you return week after week trying to
find some of these records, try searching online. Mainstream record
retailers include CD Now _(www.cdnow.com) as well as Gemm
(www.gemm.com).
</P>
<P>
   Descarga (www.descarga.com) specializes in Latin music. For
independent recordings there is Other Music (www.othermusic.com)
and Forced Exposure (www.forcedexposure.com).
</P>
<P>
   Jon Pareles
</P>
<P>
   1. Mestre Ambrosio: ``Fuana Casa de Cabral'' (Chaos/Sony
Brasil). Driven by drum beats and raw fiddle phrases from
northeastern Brazil's traditional music, with guitars that ripple
and shove, Mestre Ambrosio's rock songs consider roots, history and
possibilities. But the songs jump with all the vitality of the
present.
</P>
<P>
   2. Dirty Dozen Brass Band: ``Buck Jump'' (Mammoth). More than a
century of New Orleans music _ parades, funk, R-and-B, jazz, even a
little calypso _ courses through the Dirty Dozen's songs, which can
turn themselves inside out with improvisation while the dancing
never stops.
</P>
<P>
   3. Asie Payton: ``Worried'' (Fat Possum/Epitaph). Asie Payton, a
Mississippi farmer who died in 1997, left these demo tapes of
primal blues: mostly just distorted electric guitar, rudimentary
drums and a voice quivering with fury and disbelief at all the ways
he'd been done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   4. Los Zafiros: ``Bossa Cubana'' (World Circuit/Nonesuch). One
of Havana's top 1960s rock bands, Los Zafiros pulled together
doo-wop harmonies, sultry Afro-Cuban rhythms and stinging
quasi-surf guitar. Now their songs from 1963-67 sound like suave
excursions into surrealism.
</P>
<P>
   5. Shivaree: ``I Oughta Give You a Shot in the Head for Making
Me Live in This Dump'' (Odeon/Capitol). In a breathy, knowing
voice, Ambrosia Parsley sings about back-stabbing and love gone
awry. Meanwhile her band slouches along the alleyways that lead to
blues, country and torch songs.
</P>
<P>
   6. Eliades Ochoa: ``Sublime Illusion'' (Higher Octave). The
guitarist who sang the Buena Vista Social Club's ``Chan Chan''
leads a group that's older than he is, the Cuarteto Patria. With
taut lattices of acoustic-guitar lines, they add virtuosity to
rural Cuban music.
</P>
<P>
   7. Stacey Earle: ``Simple Gearle'' (Gearle/E-Squared). On an
album completed in four days, Stacey Earle's songs came out
homespun and pristine. She examines marriage, divorce and starting
over in quiet, folky vignettes full of tears and determination.
</P>
<P>
   8. Various Artists: ``Music of Indonesia 20: Indonesian
Guitars'' (Smithsonian Folkways). This final volume of an
extraordinary series surveys Indonesia from behind the fretboard.
Stark, largely meditative solos and duets reveal Islamic, Indian,
Hawaiian and pop influences; they're full of spiky little phrases
and serenely heartfelt voices.
</P>
<P>
   9. Johnny Dowd: ``Pictures From Life's Other Side'' (Koch). If
Willie Nelson turned into Hyde, he'd be Johnny Dowd. Backwoods
Gothic tales of love, death and a perverse God arrive with a twang
and a junkyard clatter, reaching for laughs that grow uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   10. Angus MacLise: ``The Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda''
(Siltbreeze). Angus MacLise, a founding member of the Velvet
Underground who died in Katmandu in 1979, left proof that the 1960s
were even wilder than they're remembered: improvised
East-meets-West melees of hand drums, minimalistic repetition,
heavy breathing, tinkling bells and psychedelic echoes, all on a
quest for ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Strauss
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Celebrities at Their Worst, Vol. II'' (Mad Deadly
Worldwide). Elvis Presley singing lewd rhymes in the studio, Hank
Williams Jr. raving drunk onstage, Linda McCartney caterwauling
``Hey Jude,'' Barbra Streisand throwing a fit, and a concert by the
heavy-metal band Venom reduced to only the inane patter between
songs. It's all here on Nick Bougas' second two-CD compilation of
classic gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Chicks on Speed with Christopher Just, ``Glamour Girl'' (Go).
The members of the post-riot grrrl Munich trio Chicks on Speed are
visual artists, label executives, clothing designers, television
producers, comic-book writers and so much more. On this disco
record they make punk rock that knows no stylistic boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   3. Comas, ``Wave to Make Friends'' (Plastique) and ``Two Dollar
Pistols With Tift Merritt'' (Yep Roc). Proof that the underground
continues to thrive in Chapel Hill, N.C., are these two beautiful
albums: The Comas write slow, haunting pop reminiscent of Yo La
Tengo, and the Two Dollar Pistols pay tribute to the country duet
with the ache and twang of the Carbines singer Ms. Merritt.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cubismo Graphico, ``Tout!'' (Sound for Escape). At its best
the Japanese one-man band Cubismo Graphico provides a high-density
easy-listening pastiche with samples and vocals mostly in French
and fast, quirky rhythms that sound like a television being flipped
from a soccer match, to a Spanish soap opera, to a French newscast,
to a '50s game show.
</P>
<P>
   5. Dauerfisch, ``Crime of the Century'' (Bungalow). A
sample-savvy German duo, Dauerfisch hops from new wave to spaghetti
western to sculpture seemingly random sounds into pop so beautiful
that even the last track on this CD, a computer voice reading the
recording credits, is catchy.
</P>
<P>
   6. D.J. Assault, ``Mr. Mutha ...'' (Electrofunk). Though not as
satisfying as D.J. Assault's fast-paced mix records, this
compilation contains their highlights, namely the greatest fast,
jiggling ghetto-tech anthems of this D.J., who has fused salacious
Miami bass, minimalist techno and frenetic drum-and-bass into a new
extreme.
</P>
<P>
   7. Icebreaker, ``Distant Early Warning'' (Aesthetics). Though
the concept seems unwieldy _ a set of droning rock instrumentals
inspired by a NATO nuclear-strike warning system in the Arctic _
the execution is entrancing. With a strong sense of composition and
forward motion, this duo creates an electro-acoustic polar
soundscape that is anything but frigid.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   8. Interadio (at www.shoutcast.com). Last year I put the
Internet radio site Shoutcast on this list for its variety of
programming. This year I've zeroed in on favorite broadcasters, one
of which is Interadio, a rock en espanol station that plays Cafi
Tacuba, Actitud Maria Marta and Titan, a Mexico City act whose
playful, genre-bending ``Elevator'' (Tombola!) was another 1999
highlight.
</P>
<P>
   9. Sidestepper, ``Logoza'' (Apartment 22). Music evolves through
combination, and some of the most exciting hybrids lately have come
from merging electronic dance music with regional styles, as in
this minialbum via Bogota, Colombia, on which drum-and-bass, cumbia
and dub reggae effortlessly and sensuously fuse.
</P>
<P>
   10. Swollen Members, ``Balance'' (Battle Axe). With powerful
rapping and innovative beats, this is one of the funkiest,
hardest-hitting recent alternative rap releases. The band's core
members are a duo from Vancouver, British Columbia, a city that
just might give rap (with hotbeds on the East, West and South
coasts) a Northern capital.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ratliff
</P>
<P>
   1. Ethan Iverson Trio, ``The Minor Passions'' (Fresh Sound).
Iverson, mature beyond his years, puts a serenity into this album
with the bassist Reid Anderson and the drummer Billy Hart. Not
sentimentality: its semi-sour harmonies come from Monk and Herbie
Nichols. Rather, he's created a quiet music that's full of careful
tension.
</P>
<P>
   2. Guillermo Klein, ``Los Guachos II'' (Sunnyside). Klein, an
Argentine living in New York, has a talent for large-group jazz
composition, combining a mass of choirlike horns, minimalism,
swing, voice and a bit of fusion's best intentions.
</P>
<P>
   3. Tony Allen, ``Black Voices'' (Comet). The drummer for Fela's
band _ who drove its sound every bit as much as the band leader did
_ has made a very contemporary version of Afrobeat, with ideas
borrowed from dub reggae. Amid tenebrous murmurs that serve as
singing, the sound pans back and forth across the speakers, and the
continuous, syncopated trap-set rhythms drop out for stretches as
if disappearing into tunnels along the highway.
</P>
<P>
   4. Rod McGaha, ``Preacherman'' (Compass). McGaha, a
Nashville-based trumpeter who's a member of Max Roach's band,
delivers streamlined renditions of bop standards as well as
originals based in rhythm-and-blues and gospel; by track 7 you
discover he's a singer. Bonus points for beautiful sound on an
independent label.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thirteen Ways, ``Focus'' (Palmetto). In a cooperative jazz
trio full of collective improvising, the pianist Fred Hersch, the
saxophonist Michael Moore and the drummer Gerry Hemingway create
something approximating a modern response to Jimmy Giuffre's
beautiful, pliant trio records of the early 60's.
</P>
<P>
   6. Bill McHenry Quartet, ``Graphic'' (Fresh Sound). A young
saxophonist sets down the new sound coming from music schools and
New York's farm-team jazz bars: a hybrid of structure and free
improvisation influenced by Ornette Coleman, Paul Bley, and
possibly even McHenry's influential contemporary, Mark Turner.
</P>
<P>
   7. Estrellas de Areito: Los Heroes (Nonesuch). The Cuban answer
during the late '70s to New York's salsa supergroup the Fania
All-Stars, this band combined styles _ charanga, conjunto and jazz
_ to create some of the most vibrant jam-session records ever made.
</P>
<P>
   8. Onda Sonora, ``Red Hot and Lisbon' (Bar None). A shrewdly
interpretive and often beautiful attempt to combine popular music
from the Portuguese-speaking diaspora, it features musicians from
Caetano Veloso to the Spanish Gypsy group Ketama.
</P>
<P>
   9. Orrin Evans Trio, ``Grown Folk Bizness'' (Criss Cross). In
solos Evans' piano sound can approximate tuned drums. An aggressive
and exciting new pianist, Evans has still not been recorded to his
full potential, but his third disc gets closer.
</P>
<P>
   10. Chicago Underground Trio, ``Possible Cube'' (Delmark). From
time to time the basic sound of this hot and earnest young bohemian
jazz group has all the newness of the Art Ensemble of Chicago 30
years ago. But there's a resourcefulness here: they use cheap
electronics well, they mine a lot of feeling from single vamps, and
the disciplined, versatile cornetist Rob Mazurek may yet become the
Dave Douglas of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Powers
</P>
<P>
   1. Carl Hancock Rux, ``Rux Revue'' (Sony 550 Music). This
literary young lion found the balance between hip-hop cool and the
poetry slam's pretensions on his debut collection of funk-powered,
soul-searching rants forming a panorama reaching from the
neighborhood to the universe.
</P>
<P>
   2. Drive By Truckers, ``Pizza Deliverance'' (Soul Dump/Ghostmeat
Records). The son of a Muscle Shoals session man, Patterson Hood
was born to mess with the cultural legacy of the redneck rock 'n'
roll South. His band plays effortlessly authentic roots punk that's
tasty as a pulled-pork sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   3. Toshi Reagon, ``The Righteous Ones'' (Razor &AMP; Tie). There is
no warmer spirit on the New York music scene than Toshi Reagon, and
no fresher album than this came out this year. Unflinchingly
political but never preachy, eclectic without stumbling into
dilettantism, this is a soul sister's house party.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sally Timms, ``Cowboy Sally's Twilight Laments for Lost
Buckaroos'' (Bloodshot). Ms. Timms expertly walks a tightrope
between her native English reserve and country music's bald
emotion. The songwriters of bohemian Chicago helped her do it, but
this album is all hers: the memoir of a hipster girl grown wise.
</P>
<P>
   5. Rainer Maria, ``Look Now Look Again'' (Polyvinyl Records).
When Caithlin De Marrais sings, she goes so wide open that the kid
in her soul bursts out. Her mates, the drummer William Keuhn and
the guitarist and singer Kyle Fischer, shed all rock 'n' roll
affectations to meet her on her post-punk cloud.
</P>
<P>
   6. Odetta, ``Blues Everywhere I Go'' (M.C. Records). The mother
goddess of folk blues still has plenty of spice in her, as this
long-overdue return proves. Odetta honors Victoria Spivey, Bill
Broonzy and Sippie Wallace here, but the real tribute belongs to
the 70-year-old singer herself, sharing her extensive knowledge of
hardship, good loving and the best way to bend the blues.
</P>
<P>
   7. The Tiger Lilies, ``Shockheaded Peter'' (NVC Arts/Warner
Brothers). On a par with ``South Park,'' this cast recording from
the hit English ``junk opera'' places 10 gorily hilarious Victorian
``morality tales'' in the hands of the Tiger Lilies. The fates of
Fidgety Phil and Cruel Frederick will have children and their
parents screaming in delight.
</P>
<P>
   8. John Linnell, ``State Songs'' (Zoe/Rounder). This solo trip
by one half of They Might Be Giants explores the strange ways
places, and the memories we make in them, invade our psyches.
Linnell searches from Illinois to Nevada and finds bad puns, deep
secrets, random associations and the other thrift-store treasures
that fill American brains.
</P>
<P>
   9. Angie Stone, ``Black Diamond'' (Arista). More grooves than
hooks doomed this album by D'Angelo's onetime collaborator, a
writer and arranger with a voice like a slow burn, to a shadowy
place in the year's renaissance of female rhythm-and-blues. But for
deep funk and heady relaxation, you couldn't spin a more sensual,
smarter disc.
</P>
<P>
   10. Mark Lanegan, ``I'll Take Care of You'' (Sub/Pop). The
country's three or four remaining grunge loyalists long anticipated
this album of favorite cover songs by the voice of the Screaming
Trees. Deep blues meets tuxedo soul and mournful punk on this great
disc for a cloudy day.

HOME CLINIC: CHOOSING THE CORRECT WOOD FINISH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to applying a finish to wood, most
do-it-yourselfers automatically reach for a can of polyurethane
varnish. Polyurethane is an ideal choice for many projects, because
it produces a hard protective film that is more durable than any
other finish. This makes it a good choice for tabletops, floors and
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   But polyurethane does have a down side. It creates a cold, hard
glossy finish that makes wood look like it is encased in plastic.
Another problem is that it cannot readily be applied to surfaces
that are already finished. Polyurethane simply will not stick to
other finishes, not even to itself, if the film has cured. In order
to apply a coat of polyurethane, the old finish must either be
removed or roughened up with sandpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with polyurethane is that it tends to peel when
exposed to sunlight for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   Varnishes differ depending on the type of resin used in their
composition. Traditional varnishes use natural gum resins, like
damar, which is obtained from conifer trees. Modern varnishes are
made from synthetic resins like polyurethane or alkyd.
</P>
<P>
   Alkyd varnish has almost the same properties as polyurethane
varnish. It is easy to apply and just as durable. Moreover, the
final finish has more warmth and clarity, so it is a better choice
for furniture.
</P>
<P>
   All varnishes have a long curing time (also called the open
time). This makes them easy to apply with a brush or rag. But this
also means that the varnish film can attract a lot of airborne dust
as it dries, making it necessary to hand rub the finish with steel
wool or pumice after it cures.
</P>
<P>
   Most manufacturers choose lacquer to finish their furniture,
because it is easy to spray on and it has a very short open time.
Do-it-yourselfers will find it difficult to spray lacquer unless
they purchase professional equipment. However, there is a brush-on
lacquer suitable for home use.
</P>
<P>
   The lacquer film is not as durable or scratch-resistant as
varnish, but it has a clarity that brings out the warmth in wood.
Lacquer has a very short open time, so you must work quickly and
methodically to create a smooth, even finish. A lacquer finish is
easy to repair because the solvent in lacquer will melt existing
layers, making it easy to blend successive coats into one another.
The potent solvent in lacquer is more toxic and flammable than the
solvents in other finishes, so you must wear proper safety gear and
work in a well-ventilated area.
</P>
<P>
   Shellac is a traditional finish that is rarely used today. It is
not as durable as varnish or lacquer and it is not resistant to
water. Liquid shellac has a short shelf life. Old shellac turns
gummy as it ages and won't harden properly on any surface. However,
it is available in flakes, which can be dissolved in denatured
alcohol (alcohol is less toxic than the solvents in many other
finishes) to make a fresh solution when you need it.
</P>
<P>
   A shellac finish, however, is warm _ ranging from almost
transparent to dark amber _ and it enhances the natural beauty of
wood. It can be brushed on, or applied with a polishing pad in a
technique known as French polishing (featured in the Home Clinic,
July 5, 1998). Shellac is a good finish for furniture and interior
trim.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of finish that has recently become available is a
water-based finish. These products are often labeled as varnishes
with polyurethane or acrylic resins, but they have different
properties than solvent-based polyurethane or alkyd varnish. They
are not as durable as solvent-based varnishes, and many woodworkers
find that the finish is often flat and dull.
</P>
<P>
   Water-based finishes are sensitive to fluctuations in air
temperature and humidity. They can be slow to cure on a humid day.
In contrast, when the air is warm and dry, they can dry too quickly
and trap air bubbles in the film. Water-based finishes can also
raise the grain in some woods and may require sanding afterward.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, these finishes clean up easily with soap and
water and the solvent is not flammable and less toxic than others,
so they are easier to work with indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are the oil finishes, like linseed oil and tung
oil. Oils must be heated so they penetrate into the wood. The heat
for a tung oil finish is best generated by applying it with a
coarse rag and rubbing hard. Linseed oil must be heated in a double
boiler (never in a pan over a direct flame). Tung oil provides a
warmer glow to wood than linseed oil does, but neither offers much
protection against wear or water.

FOOD RETAILER MEETING FOCUSES ON WEB

   HAINES CITY, Fla. _ Retailers are no longer just in the business
of brick and mortar. They're now also in the business of click and
mortar or what is known as e-commerce, said Bruce Peterson, vice
president and general merchandise manager of perishables for
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet offers unlimited information and unlimited
choices to the consumer,'' Peterson told a group of retailers at a
food and citrus conference sponsored in part by the Florida
Department of Citrus. The two-day ``Selling Food in the New
Millennium'' conference focused on global expansion and the
opportunities of selling food products over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which ended Tuesday, featured speakers from
several online companies and food retailers such as Homegrocer.com,
Priceline.com, McDonald's Corp., 7-Eleven Inc. and a Japanese
consulting firm, Fujii Office, which specializes in foodservice.
The conference was funded in part by the Florida Department of
Citrus.
</P>
<P>
   John Laing, chief operating officer of Food.com, based in San
Francisco, said America Online's plan to purchase Time Warner is an
example of the Internet's importance. Laing said the Internet
provides unlimited opportunities, citing estimates that every 1.67
seconds someone new logs onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is experiencing explosive growth,'' said Laing,
whose company is the largest takeout and delivery service on the
Internet. ``It's a phenomenal way to reach people.''
</P>
<P>
   Food.com has 14,000 restaurants that participate in delivery
service through the Web site and more than 800,000 Internet members
who order food online. The site also offers listings of more than
300,000 restaurants. As far as the Internet as a whole, advertising
sales are expected to reach $15 billion in 2003, up from $2.7
billion in 1999, Laing said. Spending on the Internet is expected
to go as high as $425.7 billion in 2003, up from $67.1 billion in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce is here to stay,'' Laing said. ``The time to get
online is now. Three years ago, the Amazon was a very big river in
Latin America. Today, it is the No. 1 retailer on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Stockberger, president of SBN Network, said the ultimate
marketing tool today is the Internet. SBN.com is a database of 50
million business listings, including 20 million in the United
States. The site includes the yellow pages, white pages, toll-free
numbers and Web sites. He said statistics show 4 trillion e-mails
were mailed last year compared with 1.4 billion first-class letters
mailed. More than half of all businesses in America are online and
almost 30 percent of Americans use the Internet on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more Internet users than readers of Time, Newsweek,
Consumer Reports, Cosmopolitan and Playboy magazines,'' Stockberger
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sit back and expect people to beat a path to your door,
it won't work,'' Stockberger said. ``The Web is absolutely going to
continue to grow. If you're not on it, you'll have a problem.''

   HOLLYWOOD _ All Charlie Lustman wanted was a falafel sandwich.
He was driving down Fairfax Avenue, searching the passing
storefronts for a Middle Eastern restaurant he had eaten at before,
when he caught sight of a dilapidated movie theater with a for-sale
sign on the front in a faceless row of nursing homes and parking
lots across from Fairfax High School. ``My infamous falafel
sandwich,'' Lustman said, ``that ended up costing me a million
bucks.''

   Lustman, 34, a former songwriter who lives in Santa Monica,
Calif., is today the owner, proprietor and programmer of the
nation's only movie theater dedicated to showing silent films. The
Silent Movie Theater, which has a history as melodramatic as any of
its features, opened in November with a new screen from England, an
upstairs coffeehouse, a backyard patio, an antique projector and a
new neon sign that bathes the sidewalk in a lavender glow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be a day job, but it has consumed my life
completely,'' Lustman said. ``I did this whole thing on credit
cards. I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm just doing it. But
Hollywood was built on the backs of these silent-movie pioneers,
and it's something that I think needs to be appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Silent Movie Theater shows silent films six nights a week.
(Talkies are relegated to Tuesdays, and only those made before 1949
are allowed even then.) That, Lustman said, makes it the only
theater in the United State dedicated year-round to showing silent
movies. Some theaters, like New York's Film Forum, have regular
silent-movie series, but he said no other theater had a regular,
weekly program of silent classics. He had thought his was the only
such movie theater in the world but then discovered another one in
Queensland, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   For those who love silent movies, the new theater is part of a
slow reawakening. ``It used to be absolutely impossible to see
silent films in a theater, but lately it's gotten a little
better,'' said David. B. Pearson, whose www.silent-movies.com is
one of the most popular silent-film sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The people who kept the medium alive through the years were the
collectors, Pearson said _ not only of old films but of memorabilia
and antique technical equipment as well. Only recently, with the
advent of videotapes and now DVD, has the quality of available
films improved markedly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lustman's small theater in Hollywood _ just 224 seats _ was
built in 1942 by John and Dorothy Hampton, a couple from Oklahoma
City who moved to Los Angeles for the climate and dedicated
themselves to finding, restoring and exhibiting silent films.
Hampton, who died in 1990, hand-lettered his own posters and often
blended pools of toxic chemicals in the bathtub of his apartment on
the theater's second floor, using the mixtures to try to save
deteriorating films. In 1978, without warning, the theater closed.
</P>
<P>
   People thought the Hamptons had moved back to Oklahoma, but they
were still living above the theater, almost as recluses. In a
hidden storage room beneath the projection booth, Hampton had cans
filled with hundreds of moldering silent films.
</P>
<P>
   After he died, his wife moved into a nearby nursing home where
she befriended Laurence Austin, who had attended the high school
across the street. He persuaded Mrs. Hampton to reopen the theater,
which the two of them did in 1991. Often Mrs. Hampton, in a
wheelchair, would sell popcorn in the cramped lobby.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Mrs. Hampton signed over control of the theater
to Austin, purportedly on a cocktail napkin. Later Austin
supposedly signed a similar napkin that made his roommate and the
theater's projectionist, James Van Sickle, his partner and heir. In
1997 a young man watching a comedy short from the back row of the
theater, a crowd-warmer for the feature presentation (F.W. Murnau's
1927 ``Sunrise''), stood up, walked into the lobby and shot Austin
dead. When a 19-year-old man was charged in the shooting, the
police also charged Van Sickle with hiring him to do the job. The
pair were convicted and sentenced to life in prison. The theater
closed and fell into disrepair again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not plan to sign any napkins,'' Lustman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lustman had been living in Copenhagen for several years, he
said, writing songs for Danish artists who wanted to record in
English, but in early 1999 he tired of that and moved back to Santa
Monica. ``I was turned off by the music industry scene, but I
didn't know what to do,'' he said. ``I was searching around for
something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So he called the number on the for-sale sign at the theater,
made an appointment and was shown into the dark, dusty space last
April. ``I immediately felt the magic of the place,'' he said. Some
of Hampton's hand-lettered signs were still on the walls, along
with caricatures of silent-film stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called some investors, rich people, friends of friends,'' he
said, and by May he was able to close on the theater, contents and
all, for $650,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Silent Movie Theater reopened in November with Chaplin's
``Modern Times.'' Business since then has been good, Lustman said,
``although I don't expect to get rich from this.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater and its coffeehouse open at 6 p.m. The show begins
at 8 p.m., always with musical accompaniment. Often experts are
brought in to introduce the films or show props or memorabilia.
Tickets are $8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just, `Come to see a movie,''' Lustman said. ``It's,
`Come and have an experience of Old Hollywood as they saw it years
ago.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesdays and Thursdays are dedicated to silent dramas. One
comic film or a collection of shorts, usually Chaplin, Buster
Keaton, Harold Lloyd or Laurel and Hardy, plays on weekends. The
offerings on ``Talking Tuesdays'' include films like ``King Kong''
(1933) and ``Captain Blood'' (1935).
</P>
<P>
   Lustman says he has received enormous support from many people
who collect or admire silent films, particularly David Shepard,
whose Film Preservation Associates has been instrumental in saving
many aging films and who has allowed the theater to show his prints
free. Yet he has also drawn grumbling from many fans and experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's collectors, some people in the silent-film
business,'' he said. ``As long as they pay their eight bucks to get
in, they can say what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson, though, said the grumblers are in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in general everybody is very happy about the theater
reopening,'' Pearson said. ``Oh, there is a perfectionist group who
wish it was exactly the way it was in 1926. They object to the
theater showing Chaplin's `City Lights' because it was made during
the sound era.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest controversy involves Lustman's plan to stage a
``tribute'' to Austin, the theater's former owner. Next Wednesday
and Thursday the theater will screen Murnau's ``Sunrise,'' the film
that was never shown the night Austin was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten calls, threats, it hasn't been pretty,'' Lustman
said. ``Some people think it's kind of morbid. I don't know; I'm
just some guy who doesn't know squat about silent movies who drove
by and bought it on a whim. But the bottom line is, the place is
still alive.''

   Shannon Rose can see the recipes in the cookbook she uses, but
her right eye isn't seeing the full page. One day while updating a
prescription for contact lenses, her optician detected vision
trouble, prompting further examination. An ophthalmologist found a
small cancerous tumor on her retina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just really odd and scary to think that there's
something like that in your eye that's just sitting there, and you
have no idea,'' says Rose. ``When that kind of news is delivered, I
think you do go into shock. I don't know if it still has sunk in.''
</P>
<P>
   The tumor in Rose's eye creates a hole in her vision. Dr.
William Freeman, professor of ophthalmology at Shiley Eye Center at
the University of California, San Diego, says Rose can't see the
hole because her brain compensates for the loss, ``telling'' her
other eye to fill in the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your brain kind of wants there to be a full picture, and it
fills it in,'' Freeman says.
</P>
<P>
   Based on this phenomenon, Freeman and his research colleagues,
in conjunction with Microvision Inc. of Bothell, Wash., developed a
machine that informs doctors precisely where vision is blocked,
allowing a more accurate diagnosis and treatment of the problem.
Called entoptic perimetry, it borrows electronic display imaging
technology first developed for military applications.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mix of patients in trials, entoptic perimetry has been
used to diagnose peripheral scotomas caused by cytomegalovirus
retinitis, an opportunistic infection experienced by people in
advanced stages of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have found in AIDS patients is that patients who are
completely unaware that they have an infection in the retina can
immediately see that there's something wrong,'' Freeman says.
</P>
<P>
   The test could also be used to diagnose vision problems among
brain tumor patients and others. ``When the doctor or your
pediatrician looks in the eye with a little hand-held
ophthalmoscope, that only shows him really the very center, he
would miss a retinal detachment, peripheral diabetes, tumors of the
retina, and things like that,'' says Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   RETINAL IMAGE PROJECTION
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Plummer, Ph.D., visual psychophysicist at Shiley Eye
Center, says that when Rose looks into the lens of the testing
instrument with her bad eye, she sees an image projected directly
into her eye, an image similar to the ``snowstorm'' on a TV screen
that is not tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also cool that people are looking inside this machine
which doesn't have a screen inside of it, and yet they're seeing
the computer monitor inside their eye,'' says Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   The exam also increases patient awareness and responsibility in
treating their disease, serving to motivate patients to stick to
their drug regimen in cases when the eye can be healed. ``If you
break your leg, you know that your leg is broken. Something hurts.
You have pain. They're able to suddenly somehow understand what's
going on in the retina and why they need treatment,'' says Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   In the test, dots projected onto the eye move so fast that the
brain doesn't have time to fill in the missing parts of vision. In
a darkened exam room, staring into the examination lens, the only
one in the world, Rose is asked about the relative location of the
hole that she perceives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They draw on the computer monitor where they see the defect,''
says Freeman, considered a retinal specialist. ``That corresponds
very closely to exactly where the tumor or infection, or whatever
it is, on the retina.''
</P>
<P>
   With the test, Rose reports a black hole toward the side of her
vision. ``That whole area was blocked out,'' she says. ``It's just
a dark triangle. It's just black. So you would think that I
wouldn't be able to see out of that corner of my eye or that I
would notice the blockage.'' Doctors estimate she had been
suffering the condition for a year.
</P>
<P>
   The test takes under a minute, and early studies show it's
highly accurate, with a detection sensitivity figures of 95 percent
and specificity of greater than 95 percent. While the test is
presently only available in the San Diego area, the researchers
hope it will become a standard test used by optometrists and other
eye care practitioners when it becomes widely available, most
likely in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies have yet to announce whether they'll cover
the cost.

</P>
<P>
   Delacorte, $26.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What can you say about a book that describes sex between two
characters as ``four-star,'' and has a character expressing his
love for the heroine by personally reserving the ideal hotel room
for her during a Hawaiian business retreat _ in sandy and white
tones that ``looked like a spread from a magazine''? Either author
Danielle Steel spends too much time lounging in fancy hotels and
restaurants, or her jet-setting, stunning characters in
``Irresistible Forces,'' while glamorous, also seem too slick and
superficial, stuck in the '80s and about as warmblooded as Barbie
and Ken dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her plastic characters, Steel shows off her trademarked
ability to keep the pages turning, although the pacing gets a slow
start _ the only real problem or obstacle the heroine faces in the
first 150 pages is an executive's bitter opposition to her taking a
client's company public. Until then, protagonist Meredith Whitman
sees her life as ``perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Blond, slender and (of course) beautiful, our heroine enjoys a
blazingly successful career as a Wall Street investment banking
firm partner. She even holds the respect of senior partners who
make up ``a secret fraternity that still had trouble acknowledging
women.''
</P>
<P>
   She is married to a dark, handsome (but not vain) ER surgeon,
Steve, who works superhuman hours saving lives, yet finds time to
cook for her. Their love burns like an ``eternal flame.''
</P>
<P>
   She is in full control and things are running, as the cliche
goes, as smoothly as silk _ as in her ``silky'' blond hair and
``silky'' skin. She is probably the kind of woman Steel visualizes
her readers wanting to be _ and the author lets the readers loll in
the silken sheets of this supposedly glamorous, luxurious life for
chapter after chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Steve aches for a child, but Meredith sees no place in their
busy lives for distractions. She is committed to her job, to the
excitement of proving herself, the glamour of wearing lovely
clothes and impressing people.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Callan Dow, a dashing ``financial wizard'' client with a
vaguely described Palo Alto computer-related company. You can see
this train coming from miles away, but Meredith won't get off the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons with Steve begin: Blond, Ferrari-driving,
Hermes-tie-wearing Cal looks like a GQ ad, even after all-day work
marathons, while intense, practical Steve looks as if he dressed in
a thrift shop. Cal loves fine dining; Steve settles for hamburgers
and pizza. Steve doesn't even care about (sheesh) money. Steve
represents comfortable history. Cal is a project for the future: He
has a storybook home and three children, but a heart broken by an
icy ex-wife who ditched the family.
</P>
<P>
   But don't most Ferrari-driving Ken dolls turn out to be jerks in
real life, Meredith?
</P>
<P>
   After Meredith helps engineer a successful IPO for Cal's
company, jetting around the country and Europe with him on a
promotional tour, she accepts a California job from him, turning
her marriage into a long-distance relationship _ with her husband's
improbable blessing. (He'll move to the West Coast later, once he
finds a job there.) Then even the weather and illness, along with
business conflicts, conspire to keep the couple on separate coasts.
Meredith's attraction to Cal grows.
</P>
<P>
   Will she resist this forbidden fruit? Will Steve, meanwhile,
overcome his attraction to New York co-worker Anna, a ripe-looking
Puerto Rican single mom with soft ``chocolate-colored'' eyes? This
soap opera plays out with tears, tense scenes, volcanic (sometimes
stormlike) passions and a gunshot wound.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after the dramatic tension is finally turned up, characters'
motivations still come off as too pat. Poor-but-proud Anna has the
noble goal of doing medical work in Third World countries. Cal and
Meredith bask in praise after pulling off a high-flying stock
launch for his computer-related company, but would that really take
genius in today's economy? And Anna and Cal are cast as victims,
still wounded by cold-hearted (but long-gone) ex-spouses and in
need of healing. Isn't this a bit too button-pushingly
manipulative?
</P>
<P>
   The reader ends up suspecting that Steel has written this book _
or parts of it _ before and is too lazy to create believable,
realistic people. .MDBR/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online

NEW YORK ARTISTS WIN MAJORITY OF A FOUNDATION'S FIRST GRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the first round of grants by the Creative Capital
Foundation is any guide, this city is, hands down, the nation's
creative capital. And much of the innovative work being done by
artists in the performing, visual, media and computer-based arts is
_ in contrast to a lot of the art that wins news media attention _
hardly controversial at all.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing applications from more than 1,800 artists from
46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, Creative
Capital is awarding a total of $563,700 to 75 artists, 40 of whom
live in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx or Staten Island. Two others
live elsewhere in New York state, 12 in California and 3 in
Minnesota. Thirteen other states and the District had one or two
award recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Capital was founded last May to provide financial aid
to artists whose work may challenge convention. The money is
intended to help make up for the halt in federal grants to
individuals that took effect in 1994 after years of controversy in
Congress over the financing of works dealing with nudity, sexuality
and other provocative subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from descriptions of the projects provided by Creative
Capital, several deal with homosexuality or race, but only a few
seem to have much potential to stir controversy. For example, a
$5,000 grant went to Ray Thomas, the pseudonym of an artist in
Loudonville, N.Y., for RTMark.com, a Web site and promotion and
financing system that gives aid to ``creative subversion and
blacklisted cultural production.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave the review panels total leeway to pick the strongest
projects,'' said Ruby Lerner, Creative Capital's executive
director. ``We never said we would fund only controversial
projects; we said we wouldn't shy away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   She described several of the winning proposals as ``really
lyrical,'' but added, ``A lot of these projects are in their early
stages, and you never know how something will be received.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the grants were reported earlier this month, based on
descriptions provided in mailings to the artists.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lerner said she was ``a little disappointed'' that the list
of winners was not more diverse geographically. Before the
application deadline next September for the second round of grants,
she said, Creative Capital will try to reach out to more artists,
particularly in the Southeast, Hawaii, Minnesota and California,
where some of Creative Capital's financial backers are based.
</P>
<P>
   In other respects, the grants, which range from $3,200 to
$20,000, are more evenly distributed. They went to 40 men and 35
women, most in the early or middle stage of their careers. Only a
few recipients are well established, like Meredith Monk, the
composer, Ralph Lemon and Elizabeth Streb, performance artists, and
Mary Ellen Strom, an installation artist and choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   The grants are also spread fairly evenly among Creative
Capital's four award categories. The winners include 23 performing
artists, 20 visual artists, 20 film or video artists and 12 who
want to create Web sites, computer games, CD-ROMs or other
technology-based projects.
</P>
<P>
   The largest award, $20,000, went to Wendy Jacob, creator of the
sculpture ``Squeeze Chair,'' a large, overstuffed chair with arms
that inflate and hug the sitter in an embrace. When it was
exhibited, some saw its potential for calming autistic children who
are frightened or overstimulated by human touch. Ms. Jacob will use
the money to design a prototype that can be manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   The grant recipients were selected from a pool of 220 finalists,
whose detailed proposals were evaluated by panels of curators, arts
administrators and artists in November. The recipients are also
eligible for supplemental grants, and Creative Capital has set
aside $356,000 more for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Capital's founders have said since the start that grant
winners would be required to work with marketing experts to build
audiences for their works and then to share profits from the
projects in amounts to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   In this first round, artists will agree to a budget figure
(which includes wages, or fees for their time, and depreciation for
their personal equipment). Artists can keep any revenue received up
to that figure. Beyond that, Creative Capital is to receive a
percentage of profits equal to the percentage of the budget it
financed. When Creative Capital recoups its investment, its
percentage of the profits will be halved.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Capital, which is based in Greenwich Village, started
out with 22 patrons and now has 28 contributors, including the Ford
Foundation, which recently agreed to donate $250,000 over four
years. It has received more than $5 million and hopes eventually to
raise at least $40 million. The group will use some of the money to
hold a retreat for its grant recipients in August at the Skowhegan
School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine.

KEY VOICE COMBINES VOICE AND DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Va.) (nk) 
 By MATTHEW SAUER   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Key Voice Technologies is winning recognition
for a new product it developed that unifies voice mail, faxes and
e-mail into a single, universal ``inbox.''
</P>
<P>
   The product, called iNTerchange, debuted in August and this week
it received the 1999 Product of the Year award from Communication
Solutions magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The product provides users with an inbox on their computer that
lists e-mail and voice mail messages and faxes. It allows someone
to listen to e-mail messages and it converts punctuation,
abbreviations, shorthand and other written forms into natural
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Other applications include allowing users to listen to voice
mail through their computer speakers or allowing them to reroute
faxes to be sent along with forwarded e-mail or voice mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   The product can be integrated with more than 100 different
telephone systems.
</P>
<P>
   The iNTerchange product is sold through Key Voice's 500 dealers.
The Sarasota company also has access to other sales channels
through its parent company, publicly traded Comdial Corp. of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Communications Solutions noted that the convergence of voice and
data in products such as iNTerchange is becoming almost too complex
to track.
</P>
<P>
   ``As voice and data converge, commingling ever more intimately,
they give rise to a teeming array of hybrids,'' the magazine said.
``These hybrids have grown so numerous, that they pose a challenge
to anyone who would divine their relationships to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Key Voice also develops and manufactures a line of voice mail,
automated attendant and fax processing products. The company was
founded in 1993 by Nick Branica, who remains its president under
Comdial.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia company bought Key Voice four years ago for $18.3
million in cash, notes, and Comdial common stock.
</P>
<P>
   Comdial, based in Charlottesville, Va., also makes
computer-telephone integration software, digital voice services and
voice processing products, wireless phones and paging systems. The
company posted fiscal 1998 net income of $17.2 million on sales of
$129 million. Its shares trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker
``CMDL.''

   ``Burr, Hamilton and Jefferson: A Study in Character'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Roger C. Kennedy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American History &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University Press, $30 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his excellent single-volume biography of George Washington,
James Thomas Flexner includes but a single line about Aaron Burr.
When Burr's name comes up for a possible political appointment,
Washington first pauses, then rejects Burr as of unsuitable
character.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the reaction of the first president, whose ability to
judge and manage men was perhaps his most valuable asset. At the
same time, Washington confidently named Alexander Hamilton his
chief of staff. Nearly two centuries after their 1804 shootout,
Burr and Hamilton continue to be contrasted in history books.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Fleming, author of more than a dozen volumes of history
and historical fiction, zeros in on the final, fatal encounter
between Burr and Hamilton. He skillfully describes the young
nation, its factions and its partisans that set the stage for the
dispute that claimed Hamilton's life.
</P>
<P>
   Both men craved recognition. Both borrowed heavily to build
country estates and lived beyond their means. Both engaged in
numerous sexual dalliances. President John Adams reviled Hamilton
for ``his audacious and unblushing attempts upon ladies of the
highest rank and purest virtue.'' Adams concluded: ``Hamilton
couldn't cool his iron in his own trough!'' Burr's conquests, too,
were legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could claim the moral high ground in matters political,
either. In 1799, when Burr was a New York assemblyman, he agreed to
help European speculators acquire land in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a mere $5,000, which he distributed to members of the New
York legislature, Burr obtain a law waiving the ban on foreigners
owning land,'' Fleming writes. For his effort, he accepted $5,500,
which was disguised as a loan that was never repaid, along with an
opportunity to buy 100,000 acres of the speculators' land. But the
speculators approached Burr only after first going to Hamilton, who
agreed to help them on the condition that they loan his
father-in-law $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The two men nevertheless found themselves at opposite ends of
the political spectrum. At a time when ``party politics was
unquestionably becoming an integral part of the American system,
Hamilton and his fellow federalists ... saw themselves as the party
of the wise and good, men of virtues, talents, and property best
suited by birth and/or achievement to run the country.'' The
Republicans, led by Jefferson, ``called themselves the spokesmen of
the average man,'' the true standard-bearers of the Revolution's
ideals of liberty and equality.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? The barbs and criticisms of the day also
resonate in our contemporary insult barrages. For example, in 1790,
Hamilton had persuaded Washington to fund the $80 million
Revolutionary War debt by issuing debt certificates to veterans and
other supporters of the conflict, rather than cash. Within a few
years, most of that script, whose repayment was uncertain, was in
the hands of speculators who acquired it for cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamilton defended this deliberate concentration of wealth in
the hands of a few by arguing that without capital, America would
never build a powerful economy,'' Fleming writes. The Republicans
demonized Hamilton, accusing him of ``trying to turn America into a
mirror image of England, a country where financial speculation,
political corruption and mobs of disenfranchised factory workers
required a standing army to keep the aristocrats in power.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Burr, by the time he came to serve in 1800 as vice
president under Jefferson, he had given his peers ample opportunity
to form their opinions of him. While not trusted, his style was
renowned.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling example, when Burr was accused of fraud in the
European land deal, he quickly challenged his accuser to a duel.
Neither man was hurt. But observers recalled that Burr was
remarkably calm _ even when it was clear that his gun would not
fire properly and his opponent's bullet passed through Burr's coat.
Burr was reloading when his antagonist apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly intriguing is Fleming's detailed treatment of
Hamilton's ``insult'' and Burr's response. At a private dinner
party, Hamilton called Burr ``despicable,'' among other things, and
his words subsequently were published without his knowledge in a
partisan newspaper. The adjective barely met the day's standard for
besmirching a gentleman's honor. Indeed, Burr pressed Hamilton for
examples that would justify the term, while Hamilton, clearly eager
to avoid a duel, attempted to soften the insult even as he refused
to retract it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although dueling was already in some disfavor in New England
and New York, it was still the quintessential test of a man in the
South and West,'' Fleming writes. Given that both men were
recognized military heroes, whoever backed down would sacrifice all
influence and power.
</P>
<P>
   Roger C. Kennedy takes a broader approach in his take on the
subject matter, reflecting the events of the early 1800s in America
through the multifaceted prisms of Burr, Hamilton and Jefferson.
Assessing character and motives nearly two centuries distant is
hazardous at best, and Kennedy admits that though ample personal
writings exist to judge Jefferson and Hamilton, Burr left little
behind. The author proceeds to fill the vacuum with his own
speculations.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the messy duel was behind him, Burr traveled to
Florida and then westward, where he hit upon the idea of
establishing a plantation settlement in what is now northeast
Louisiana. He acquired hundreds of thousands of acres, called the
Bastrop Tract, in 1806. By spring 1807, then-President Jefferson
accused him of treason on grounds of promoting a new nation in
those western lands. Burr was cleared, but his reputation never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   There might be a convincing argument for Burr in Kennedy's
volume. If so, it is hidden in a factual thicket that could stand a
good pruning. Eager to take Jefferson down a notch or two, the
author elevates Burr correspondingly. Where virtually all of Burr's
contemporaries concluded he was not trustworthy, Kennedy tells us
Jefferson was the true self-aggrandizer and Burr more an
adventurer.
</P>
<P>
   If Kennedy wishes to change minds about Burr's character, he
might take a cue from Fleming and focus on a defining event _
Burr's western vision, perhaps _ to build a case. Both books offer
a glimpse of political intrigue in the nation's early years.
Fleming's seems the more likely to earn a place on the bookshelf.

<P>
   ``The Finished Work of Christ'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Francis A. Schaeffer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crossway, $19.99 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He being dead yet speaketh.'' That biblical phrase was not
written about noted evangelical Francis Schaeffer, who died in
1984, but ``The Finished Work of Christ'' calls it to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer's 1998 posthumously published commentary on the first
eight chapters of Romans was distilled from taped discussions of
Paul's epistle. The Swiss theologian emphasizes the reality of God,
the historicity of the Bible's events, the rational nature of
humanity, and individuals' utter inability to save themselves. The
only hope for man, Schaeffer writes, lies in the title phrase of
his book.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century says that ``faith has value as a thing in and
of itself ...,'' he writes. ``To this modern notion of faith, the
Bible absolutely says no! ... the important thing is not the faith
itself but the object of the faith: the God who is there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Finished Work of Christ'' uses the King James Version for
its text, but the archaic language of that translation is
counterbalanced by the casual, conversational style of Schaeffer's
comments. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Over the course of five CDs, New York's Hezekiah Walker &AMP; the
Love Fellowship Crusade Choir have established themselves as one of
the leading lights of contemporary gospel. After less than six
weeks in the stores, this sixth CD has risen to No. 2 on the
national gospel charts and is probably settling in for a long stay
in the Top 5.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good _ except that this is as schizophrenic a
gospel CD as I've ever heard. At times, it's simply boring: Songs
such as the opening ``Power Belongs to God'' and ``Wonderful Is
Your Name'' just go on and on, with the choir wailing away, singing
the chorus over and over and OVER, with no lead singer to give the
tune focus.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there are moments when the CD lifts off and shows
Walker's and the choir's strength and versatility. Several songs,
including ``Let's Dance'' and ``Give 'em Your Life,'' get strong
contributions from rappers J. Moss and Mel Moss; rarely have rap
and gospel been integrated so smoothly. Both these songs boast a
winning funk underpinning and memorable choruses _ and both (hint,
hint) are among the shortest songs on the CD. Either could, and
should, be a major crossover hit single.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are songs in which a lead singer steps forward to
lead the choir and ups the intensity of the CD as a whole; a good
example is ``Never Leave Me Alone,'' which features Kirvy Brown on
lead vocals.
</P>
<P>
   And, literally last but definitely not least is ``Finally,'' a
stirring summit meeting of Hez and his bunch with R&AMP;B superstars
Blackstreet; here, the balance of voices is perfect. &QL;

THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING A 100-YEAR-OLD BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday Jan. 14)  
(DW) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I must confess that the Y2K fizzle has been a big disappointment
to me, and not just because I squandered my entire New Year's Eve
crouched in front of an automatic teller machine with an open
grocery bag in my hands.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming instantly rich is not always a blessing, plus there
might have been some legal ramifications attached to a windfall of
that kind that would ultimately have taken some of the joy out of
the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   My disappointment mostly has to do with a perverse curiosity as
to what the world would be like without computers or, more
accurately, what the world would be like with computers that act
like they've swallowed large quantities of LSD.
</P>
<P>
   It's an irresponsible fantasy, I admit, if for no other reason
than the fact that the company I work for would go belly-up faster
than you can say ``final edition'' and I would be forced to find a
well-paying job that takes advantage of my other job skill, which
basically consists of taking long naps between snacks.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a concern now because the Y2K bug has turned out to
be as ineffectual as the Nevada Boxing Commission. The most
shocking news story to emerge from the whole sorry, over-hyped
``crisis,'' other than a few strands of Christmas lights dimming
momentarily at an Arkansas nuclear power plant, was a tabloid
report of a 100-year-old Danish baby.
</P>
<P>
   The Reuters news service, quoting the tabloid, said a computer
in a Copenhagen hospital initially registered the year's first
newborn as being 100 years old and born in the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Although I don't know the name of the tabloid, the name of the
hospital or even if the Y2K bug was the cause of the glitch, I
think we can safely assume that this story is authentic in every
regard and that there is a child out there _ in Denmark,
specifically _ who is doomed to go through life 100 years older
than he or she actually is.
</P>
<P>
   The first question we need to ask ourselves is: Is this a good
thing or a bad thing? Is there an advantage to being 100 years
older than all the other babies in the nursery or would you be
looked upon as some sort of freak? Or would anyone be able to tell
the difference?
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it would be an advantage to be the only kid in
your preschool who gets monthly Social Security checks.
Buying-power, no matter how modest, is sure to impress little
people who look upon Big Bird with the same sense of awe and
admiration that adults have for Albert Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you wouldn't be tall enough to reach the
mailbox, which could hinder your financial independence.
</P>
<P>
   If the 100-year-old baby moved to Florida, he could renew his
driver's license, by mail, for another six years, which would
elevate him tremendously in the esteem of the pre-potty-trained
set. Daily viewings of the Pokemon movie might not appeal to most
parents, but to a 100-year-old baby, it may pack all the dramatic
wallop of ``War and Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to predict what the job market or dating scene would
be like for someone who, according to the computer, is the oldest
person on Earth before he or she gets out of high school. My guess
is it would be just as frustrating and depressing as it is for
people of normal age.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that if the Y2K bug had bitten us as hard
as many had predicted, our lives might not necessarily have taken a
turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if we all walked away with a shopping bag full of
free loot.

VLADIMIR PUTIN, CONSUMMATE POLITICIAN, EMERGES 
</HEADLINE>

 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With presidential elections looming and the war in
Chechnya that brought him to power sputtering, acting Kremlin
leader Vladimir V. Putin appears to have discovered the world's
oldest political weapons: pork and populism.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a steely former KGB spy who became Russia's acting
president when Boris Yeltsin abruptly resigned on New Year's Eve,
has spent most of his political career in the shadows. But in just
over two months, he will face Russia's surly voters in snap
presidential elections that he is heavily favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   And if the past week is any indication, Putin isn't planning on
leaving anything to chance. He appears to have made the transition
from stealth backroom operator to public politician with ease. With
a series of populist moves aimed at various constituencies, Putin
has appeared as adept in winning voters hearts as he was at winning
the bureaucratic battles that landed him in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Putin promised to raise the salaries of teachers and
doctors, who are among Russia's most underpaid state employees,
earning about $40 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also called on Russian industry to spearhead an economic
revival by exporting high-profit manufactured goods. Since the
Soviet collapse, Russia's main exports have been oil, gas and other
natural resources, as the country's manufactured goods have been
unable to compete on world markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must develop our own industry,'' Putin said. ``We should
not only export raw materials. We need to find an approach oriented
to the future, not only the present with the aim of making quick
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's comments came during a visit to the city of Petrozavodsk
in northwest Russia, which had all the trappings of a campaign
swing. During a visit to a local hospital, Russian television
stations showed flattering footage of Putin, wearing a blue
doctor's cap, surrounded by children.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, meanwhile, a group of Russia's leading political,
business and artistic figures _ including some who had previously
backed opposition candidates _ formally nominated Putin for
president.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were just the latest in a series of gestures by Putin
that appeared tailored to appeal to Russia's weary voters, who will
go to the polls to choose a new president on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Putin ordered his government to raise pensions every
three months, starting with a 20 percent increase in February, a
move that is sure to be popular with Russia's impoverished elderly
voters. Also on Tuesday, the acting Kremlin leader said there were
too few women in Russia's leadership. Putin added that he hoped the
newly elected parliament would elect a woman as its speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin has clearly started his presidential campaign,'' said
Nikolai Petrov, a political analyst with the Moscow Carnegie
Center. ``He is using these populist gestures to try to show voters
that he will be decisive and effective with the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   He may also be trying to distract the public's attention from
recent military problems in Chechnya, where a series of attacks by
separatist guerillas have stalled Russia's attempt to regain
control over the rebel province. Putin's popularity has soared due
to his tough stance with the Chechen separatists, but some analysts
here have said his standing could suffer if the military continues
to suffer setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some media here, previously slavishly supportive of the military
campaign, have recently become more critical. Some newspapers have
begun comparing the campaign to Russia's ill-fated 1994-96 war in
Chechnya, which killed 80,000 and resulted in a humiliating
withdrawal for Moscow. And while state controlled television is
still solidly behind the war, NTV, a popular private television
station, has recently been reporting heavy losses among Russia's
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Russia's shaky currency, the ruble, fell Wednesday
for the third day in a row and has lost about 10 percent of its
value since the New Year. Should the ruble continue to fall, it
could also dent Putin's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Putin's political juggernaut got a big boost
Wednesday when he was officially nominated for president by a group
of 197 leaders of Russia's political, business and artistic elite.
The group included the heads of Russia's powerful electricity and
natural gas monopolies, as well as actors, artists and 20
provincial governors.
</P>
<P>
   Among these was Mintimer Shaimiyev, leader of the oil-rich
republic of Tatarstan, who had previously supported Putin's rival,
former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov, for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Vladimir Putin, Russian society is being consolidated,''
Shaimiyev said.
</P>
<P>
   Regional leaders like Shaimiyev are vital to any election
campaign, as they have enormous influence over how their provinces
vote. Late last year, Shaimiyev joined Primakov and Moscow Mayor
Yury Luzhkov to form the opposition party Fatherland-All Russia,
which had hoped to dominate last month's parliamentary elections
and propel Primakov into the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   But after the party finished a disappointing third in the
parliamentary vote, Primakov's allies said he would not challenge
Putin for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Putin to be virtually unbeatable, with
some 55 percent of Russian adults saying they would vote for him.
His closest rival among declared candidates is Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov with 13 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, should he choose to run, has about six percent
support. Nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and liberal economist
Grigory Yavlinsky are polling four percent each.

JUSTICES UPHOLD DRIVER'S PRIVACY LAW AS WAY TO PROTECT CITIZENS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law
Wednesday that bans states from disclosing information from
driver's licence applications, calling the statute a valid
congressional effort to protect citizens' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the law, the 1994 Driver's Privacy Protection
Act, in an effort to thwart violent stalkers who often rely on
public records to locate their victims.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawmakers passed the statute after it was revealed that
Rebecca Schaeffer's killer, Robert John Bardo, tracked down the
California home address of the television actress through state
motor-vehicle records in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Texas had sold license-application information largely without
restriction until 1997, when state law came into compliance with
the federal statute. In the fiscal year before the 1997 law's
enactment, Texas garnered $207,735 in revenue from sale of the
information, the state Department of Public Safety reported.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The justices' surprising 9-0 decision to uphold the law was in
contrast to recent rulings in which the court has invalidated
similar federal statutes for encroaching on the traditional
authority of states to regulate activities within their borders. In
one 1997 decision, the court had struck down a provision of the
Brady gun-control law because it required local police officers to
conduct federal criminal background checks on would-be firearm
purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, citing that decision, had challenged the privacy
law as an unconstitutional power grab by Congress at the authority
of states to decide unilaterally what they do with information they
collect from their residents. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
agreed with South Carolina, ruling that the national government
could not require motor-vehicle workers, employed by the state, to
participate in a federal privacy program.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court overturned the 4th Circuit decision,
saying that the privacy law neither imposes a great burden on the
state or its employees nor requires state workers to perform a
federal function. Rather the law simply calls on the state to
refrain from disclosing application information.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy law ``does not require the South Carolina
Legislature to enact laws or regulations, and it does not require
state officials to assist in the enforcement of federal statutes
regulating private individuals,'' Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also said Congress could enact the statute under
the constitutional provision giving federal lawmakers say over the
regulation of interstate commerce. Information provided by drivers
is used nationwide by automobile manufacturers and car-parts
dealers in their sales pitches, the court noted.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union hailed the justices'
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We applaud the court's affirmation that Congress has a right
to enact legislation that protects our privacy and safety,'' said
Steven Shapiro, the ACLU's national legal director. ``Today's
decision is especially welcome given a series of recent decisions
by this court favoring states' rights over the federal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon, who brought the
case on behalf of the state, grudgingly accepted the court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``States' rights and federalism are principles well worth
fighting for,'' Condon said. ``A one-size-fits-none attempt to
protect privacy will not work. The state of South Carolina, not
Washington, D.C., can best determine how to protect the privacy
rights of South Carolinians.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale of driver's license information has proven quite
lucrative for states, as New York in one recent year earned $17
million from individuals and businesses who sought access to the
information, the federal government reported.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law prohibits states from disclosing,without the
person's consent, a driver's personal information, including name,
address, telephone number and photograph.
</P>
<P>
   The law does not prohibit states from disclosing information on
car accidents and driving violations.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Texas law, in legal limbo due to a court challenge, would
require people seeking car-accident information to provide the name
of a person involved in the collision as well as the date or
location of the mishap. The law is designed to safeguard the
privacy of accident victims and protect them from being inundated
with business solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Daily Newspaper Association and the Texas Press
Association have challenged the law as violating the First
Amendment right of free press.
</P>
<P>
   Travis County District Judge Paul Davis Jr. has enjoined the
state from enforcing the law until he issues a ruling on its
constitutionality, which is expected within the next several
months.

GROUP AGREES TO SET FIBER-OPTIC TECHNICAL STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The fledgling fiber-optic telecommunications community got a
major boost Wednesday when 50 mostly young optical equipment makers
and service providers, led by Sycamore Networks Inc., agreed to
create technical standards that would enable communications
carriers to provide complete end-to-end connections and software
services.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably absent from the nationwide industry initiative are
such established telecommunications suppliers as Cisco Systems,
Lucent Technologies Inc., and Nortel Networks Inc., which are
developing their own optical networking equipment that will tie
into existing electrical networking gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at all the players, the big, broad-based
companies like Cisco and Lucent don't necessarily want an open set
of standards that would enable other companies to enter their arena
and share the wealth,'' said Tom Nolle, president of CIMI Corp., a
telecommunications consulting firm in Voorhees, N.J. ``So this
group of smaller players led by Sycamore will go it alone, and, if
they are successful, they could be a force that the big players
cannot ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry group, which will hold its inaugural meeting next
Tuesday in Boston, wants to create ``open interfaces and signaling
protocols.'' These will enable equipment and service providers to
connect seamlessly optical and electrical devices to provide
high-speed delivery of Internet-based communications and ancillary
services for corporations and, eventually, consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Optical Domain Service Interconnect, the long-term
goal is to provide a fast and easy way for corporations and
consumers to better use the Internet both in sending and receiving
voice, data, video, and graphics, along with new services such as
video conferencing and new private networks, between a
corporation's suppliers and trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium, whose members are predominantly startups and
small companies formed in the mid- to late 1990s, plans to submit a
proposal in about a year for approval by technical organizations
that govern such guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the future is attracting and retaining corporate
customers through innovation, so this is not about east versus west
or big against small, but rather the new guys like us versus the
old guys,'' said Sean Welch, vice president of marketing and sales
at Tenor Networks Inc., referring to Lucent and Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ODSI initiative puts service providers a giant step closer
to the `Holy Grail' of new service provisioning,'' said Mick
Scully, chief executive of Appian Communications Inc. of
Boxborough, Mass., one of the group's 50 members.
</P>
<P>
   Led by fast-growing Sycamore Networks of Chelmsford, Mass.,
which began putting the nationwide group together two months ago,
nearly 20 of the 50 members are in New England _ the single largest
geographic contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists and industry analysts including Andrew Cray
of Aberdeen Group in Boston maintain the region, particularly
Massachusetts, is now the center for fiber-optic communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer networking was the hot button of the 1990s that came
out of California with Cisco, 3Com Corp., and parts of Bay Networks
providing the core switches used in the Internet,'' said Cray.
``But with fiber-optic technology, plus long-distance carriers
looking to provide corporations with high-speed connections and
enhanced services, the focus is back east, particularly in the
Greater Boston area.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Nathaniel Appleton silver-mounted secretary
sold a year ago for $8.3 million _ after an estimate by Sotheby's
of $500,000 to $800,000 _ newcomers to the auction game may have
been shellshocked, but the pros were not. When most of the other
major items of Americana went for prices well above their presale
estimates, these newcomers sighed, picked up their inked-up
catalogs and headed for home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen them bewildered, with their mouths open and their
hands empty,'' said Carol Prisant, a decorative-arts writer and
former antiques appraiser. ``Right now, there are a whole lot of
inexperienced people who are going away disillusioned with the
auction process. The tyro gets no explanation. Only the old hands
really know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   What's going on is that the city's largest auction houses are
setting their estimates artificially low deliberately, as a matter
of strategy, to lure bidders and to make themselves look good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the Big Tease,'' said John Hays, the head of
American decorative arts at Christie's, which, like Sotheby's, is
holding a big Americana auction next week to coincide with the
Winter Antiques Show at the Seventh Regiment Armory. ``Like
anything else in life,'' he said, ``people have to feel that they
have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Auctioneers, who freely admit the practice, and prominent
Americana dealers like Leigh Keno say lower-than-realistic
estimates can incite bidding from the floor, thereby generating
excitement that ratchets up prices, often to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   While in the recession of the early 1990s auctioneers used high
estimates to demonstrate worth _ and to get the bids moving _ that
approach is now regarded as a flop. ``They found out they weren't
going to pull in the bidders that way,'' said Keno, who once worked
at both Christie's and Doyle's. As times got better, auction houses
found that ``low estimates do entice buyers,'' he said, adding,
``So for the last five or six years, there's been more of a
conscious effort to be conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Auction officials are quick to concede that if they put down
what they really thought the best items would go for, nobody would
show up _ or customers might be reluctant to bid. ``Nobody would
want to be the first to put their hand up in the air,'' said Nancy
Druckman, the director of American folk art at Sotheby's. ``It's
scary _ I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but if the auction house printed estimates based
on real expectations, it also might not be able to boast about
selling a piece at double the estimate (or more). After its last
Americana auction, Christie's trumpeted that sales ``totaled $6.6
million, well above the presale estimate of $4 million.'' In a
packed room, the release continued, ``many pieces sold for two,
three and four times their presale estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   For one would-be buyer, these triple and quadruple selling
prices are unnerving, to say the least. ``Something I really wanted
a lot went way over the top,'' said Jane Schulak, a designer from
Birmingham, Mich., who often travels to auctions, even as far as
Paris. Even there, a chair she wanted with an estimate of $12,000
ended up selling for $50,000. ``Once I hit $25,000, I said, `You're
sick,''' she said. ``I stopped.'' She paused. ``I was surprised,
but that might have been my lack of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Sotheby's and Christie's are hoping for record attendance
at next week's Americana sales in Manhattan, and dealers say that
with all the new Wall Street money, the auction floor will be full
of what Richard H. Jenrette, the longtime collector, calls the
Nasdaq nouveaux riches. While officials concede that some of these
bonus babies may not know the auction ropes, they insist that many
more of them are savvy enough to figure them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I always take the estimates with a grain of
salt,'' said Jenrette, the former chairman of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette and a preservationist who has restored and decorated six
historic houses, largely with furnishings bought at auction. ``I
wouldn't worry too much about the Nasdaq crowd,'' he added.
``They're used to seeing things soar.''
</P>
<P>
   Then which bidders are hurt by the practice?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody,'' Keno said, ``except maybe the elderly couple from
Rumson, N.J. _ or anywhere _ who spend all week with the auction
catalog, find a chest estimated between $5,000 and $10,000, maybe
talk to their banker about a loan and arrive at the auction only to
see it start at $16,000.''
</P>
<P>
   But those buyers, the auctioneers say, are on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   Although auction officials also tend to play down the role of
the younger, more inexperienced auctiongoers _ Hays predicted the
new, younger blood at this year's sale will be only between 15 and
20 percent of the crowd _ Margaret B. Caldwell, an Americana dealer
and appraiser, disagrees with the auctioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bonus babies are who's buying,'' she said. ``The Old Guard
is shocked and horrified by the prices.'' By Old Guard, she added,
she means customers over 60.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is someone who may be hurt by low estimates: the
seller. Under New York City consumer laws, the minimum price he or
she must accept for the item is the lowest estimate, the
auctioneers say. Thus, if a chest of drawers is estimated to sell
for between $5,000 and $7,000, the auction house must sell it if
someone bids $5,000 or more. If it's a bad day for sellers, Uncle
George may end up selling his chest _ which he thought was worth at
least $10,000 _ for half that. (Of course, the sellers would also
be delighted if the estimate is tripled.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there is another problem, said Ms. Caldwell, who this year
helped authenticate the Winter Show's offerings and headed
Sotheby's 19th-century furniture department in New York for six
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your piece is damaged while it's at the auction house, the
insurance is based on the low estimate, so the auction house won't
reimburse you more than that,'' she said.

PEREZ, FISK A RESPECTABLE PAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Up on a stage, in front of cameras and microphones,
Carlton Fisk and Tony Perez sat side-by-side. One born in Cuba, the
other in Bellows Falls, Vt., they will walk shoulder-to-shoulder
through the gates of Cooperstown in July.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk and Perez first crossed paths in the 1975 World Series,
each hitting a dramatic homer in the final two games, then they
served the Boston Red Sox as teammates in 1980. On the day after
they were voted into the Hall of Fame, both talked about respect
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony and I shared a passion for the game that might not be
present in other people's attitudes toward the game,'' said Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to this correspondent's favorite Fisk moment.
Reviewing the catcher's 24-year career, most New Englanders would
first cite Fisk's Game 6 Foul Pole Shot of ``Good Will Hunting''
fame (just as some young people think Bobby Orr's only goal was the
1970 Cup-clincher, there will be folks who think Fisk only hit one
homer in his career). Some Sox fans with long memories might prefer
to replay one of Catcher Carlton's fistfights with (pick a Yankee)
Thurman Munson, Gene Michael or Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   But the career moment that says the most about Fisk and his work
ethic, is the Deion Sanders incident in Yankee Stadium when Fisk
was a catcher for the White Sox more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk gladly recounted the story Wednesday after his Manhattan
press conference:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be overly disrespectful, but I'll just tell
you what happened. Deion Sanders obviously had his own personality.
He would come up to the plate every at-bat and he'd draw a dollar
sign in the dirt. I was offended because I felt as though he was
pimping me when he came up there. I don't know whether I was right
in that feeling or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit a popup to the infield and didn't run. He didn't make a
move to run, whether he thought that he didn't have to. And I
thought that was so disrespectful to the game and to the uniform he
was wearing. And here he was, wearing a New York Yankees uniform.
So I yelled at him to run the ball out, using so many expletives.
And he looked at me quizzically and just broke off and went into
the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was burning. I was fuming for some reason. And this was a
guy playing for the other team. So he comes up the next time and
draws his dollar sign in the dirt and says, `Hey man, the days of
slavery are over.' And I looked at him and said, `What the
(expletive) are you talking about?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I jumped up and got in his face badly and said to him,
`You know something, there's a right way and a wrong way to play
this game and you are playing it wrong and you know something, it
offends guys like me so if you don't play it right, I'm going to
kick your butt right here in Yankee Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   There. The ultimate Carlton Fisk moment. It encapsulates his
stubbornness, fearlessness, and competitive fire. It explains how a
boy from a town of 800 people (Charlestown, N.H.) made himself into
one of the top 100 baseball players of all-time, and only the
fourth catcher (joining Yogi Berra, Roy Campanella, and Johnny
Bench) elected to the Hall of Fame in the last 43 years. Fisk
caught more games and hit more home runs than any catcher in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to do it so long because I was really stubborn,''
he said. ``Maybe my New England roots had something to do with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk will be back in the Hub Thursday for the annual Boston
Baseball Writers' bash at the Sheraton. Perhaps then he'll admit
the obvious _ he plans to be immortalized with a Red Sox ``B'' on
his bronze plaque in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he'll be enshired as a Cincinnati Red. What else? He
was part of the Big Red Machine, which won consecutive World Series
in 1975-76. If Pete Rose hadn't bet on baseball, the '75 Reds would
be able to claim four Hall of Famers in their infield (catcher
Bench, first baseman Perez, second baseman Joe Morgan, and third
baseman Rose). Sixty-seven voters this year thought Dave
Concepcion, the '75 Reds' shortstop, was also Hall worthy.
Cincinnati manager Sparky Anderson is expected to join Perez and
Fisk when the Hall's Veterans Committee convenes in March. And
let's not forget that the '75 Reds outfield had 50-homer guy George
Foster and Ken Griffey Sr., father of one of the greatest players
in history.
</P>
<P>
   History. Respect. That's what this is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game itself,'' said a reverant Fisk. ``Being able to carry
the torch for the game is what I will cherish the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge homeboy Matt Damon, who won an Oscar for the script
that gave proper homage to Fisk's Game 6 shot, met Fisk during the
All-Star festivities last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' gushed Damon. ``He was standing there
telling me what an honor it was to be named one of the greatest
players of the century and he showed me his forearm. The hair was
standing up on his forearm! That's how much it meant to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk and Perez honored the uniform for more than 40 years. Their
joint induction, on the 25th anniversary of what might have been
the greatest World Series ever, should serve to remind us about
everything that is great about the game and why it still matters.
Even here in the 21st century.

 NEW YORK: she said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consignors, or sellers, are therefore often reluctant to list
their property at a price lower than they had hoped for. Auction
officials said they spent numerous lunches and dinners persuading
consignors to accept the lower estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low estimates equal high prices,'' said William W. Stahl Jr.,
the head of Sotheby's decorative arts division. (He clarified that
to say that he didn't mean ``ridiculously low estimates
would make a bidder think there was something wrong with the
piece.'')
</P>
<P>
   If the consignor won't go along with a price he or she believes
to be too low, ``then we tell them their property might be better
off not being sold at auction,'' Stahl said.
</P>
<P>
   So those numbers in the catalog are the result of a negotiation:
not too low, or the seller will balk, and not too high, or
potential bidders will lose interest.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times asked four independent dealers of note to
appraise catalog estimates for next week's two major Americana
auctions. All agreed that many of the estimates were low, part of
what they termed the general policy of the auction houses. Ms.
Caldwell was the only dealer who would allow her name to be used
when talking about specific items in the sales, with the
understanding that she would not offer comments on pieces she
planned to bid on _ either for herself or for clients who have
hired her.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed in particular to Christie's Item 159, the Hewlett
Family federal sideboard, estimated at between $70,000 and
$100,000. If the feet are ``right,'' she said, using the trade's
term for ``original,'' she said the sideboard might approach
$200,000. Both she and Peter M. Brant, a well-known collector and
the owner of Antiques Magazine, also pointed to a serving table
attributed to Thomas Seymour of Boston (circa 1810). The table is
estimated at $20,000 to $40,000. Even with its shortened legs,
Brant predicted a gavel price of more than $100,000, and Ms.
Caldwell said she would be conservative, guessing $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   She also pointed to two of the auction week's most exciting
offerings, both in the Christie's sale _ items that don't have
published estimates: the 1679 Joseph and Bathsheba Pope valuables
cabinet (which dealers have now nicknamed ``the box'') and the
Cornelius Stevenson Chippendale carved mahogany card table
(nicknamed ``the card table'').
</P>
<P>
   If you ask the auction house, the box is estimated at between
$600,000 and $900,000, and the card table between $1 million and $2
million _ but interested parties have to call to find that out.
``We want people to call us,'' said Hays, the decorative arts head.
Because the pieces are so rare and valuable, the auction house did
not feel confident estimating their worth when the catalogs were
sent off to the printer's months ago, Hays said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the dealers wanted to hazard a guess, either, on the
box, but Ms. Caldwell said she would not be surprised if the Card
Table sold for between $2 and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' she said, ``where are you going to get another
one?''
</P>
<P>
   Other dealers were buzzing about the pair of carved Chippendale
card tables at Sotheby's. They were originally owned by James W.
Beekman, and were made in New York around 1760. Other card tablesowned by the Beekmans are on display at Winterthur and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. The pair is estimated at $400,000 to
$600,000, but dealers say they are already lining up clients who
may be willing to top the estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, at Sotheby's, predicted that the tables ``will probably
bring more.'' (Leslie Keno, the director of American furniture
under Stahl _ and Leigh Keno's twin brother _ was more direct: He
said he would ``not be surprised if the tables brought over a
million dollars.'')
</P>
<P>
   Stahl was less cautious about Lot 706, the Queen Anne secretary
attributed to Samuel Harding of Philadelphia, with some exceptional
carvings of sunflowers and shells on its pediment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his own published estimate of $200,000 to $300,000, he
predicted the auction price ``will go through the roof.''

FASHION ON FOUR WHEELS AT THE L.A. AUTO SHOW
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swirls of silver, lots of red and numerous designs punched with
orange.
</P>
<P>
   And the silhouettes. Sexy, curvy and body-hugging.
</P>
<P>
   Add sleek leather, some animal prints, monochromatic fashion
statements and you've got the best of European design and American
style.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, these are cars, not clothes. But in a city where your image
is defined by style, an automobile should not be judged by its
mechanical prowess alone.
</P>
<P>
   So, no hoods were opened or tires kicked for this report of the
trendsetters of the Greater L.A. Auto Show 2000, which continues
through Sunday at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Here are a few
car suggestions based on your style: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VALLEY GIRL
</P>
<P>
   Sporty, speedy and stylin' are the trademarks of the ultimate
(San Fernando) Valley Girl driving machine, and the standout is the
Audi TT Roadster, a shiny, little silver two-seater convertible
that's as cute and curvaceous as the '90s Volkswagen Bug. Only it's
more glamorous, with a retro dash (individual gauges instead of a
panel) and a gas cap design that looks like the nut-and-bolt design
on the Cartier love bracelet. The stick-shift Audi TT is available
in matte or metallic silver, priced at $33,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Other cars for driving in fashion's fast lane include the Ford
Mustang, which has fewer muscle-bound features and more girlie
stuff, like a neon-orange paint job and a cute pony logo
embroidered on the fronts of the tan leather seats. Details include
aluminum wheels and a groovy trio of tail lights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RETRO BABE
</P>
<P>
   She loves old movies, flea markets and clothes with bohemian
flair. She'd love to drive a vintage car, but finds those restored
models too pricey, and besides, they're gas guzzlers.
</P>
<P>
   For her, the cherry red Chrysler PT Cruiser modeled after the
1930s Air Flow, and the Ford Thunderbird, modeled after the 1957
T-Bird.
</P>
<P>
   The PT Cruiser is low-swung and curvy with art deco lines,
upholstered in a gray fabric that looks like the old horsehair
fabrics and also has the new-again dashboard with separate gauges.
Not only does it turn heads, but its small (four-cylinder) engine
ensures good mileage.
</P>
<P>
   The T-Bird roadster, which we probably won't see until the end
of the year, is modeled after the popular '57 T-Bird right down to
the little porthole windows on the sides and the bullet-shaped tail
lights. Even the top has to be lifted off to make it a convertible.
At the preview, it was shown in red, but perhaps Ford will rethink
the colors and include a vintage shade of turquoise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GLAMOUR QUEEN
</P>
<P>
   She's the designer-label driver who dresses to impress, right
down to her luxury automobile.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, it's been the Lexus, known for its subtle
glamour and pearlized finish, and the company's new GS400 model
certainly qualifies with its sun roof, pale gray leather interior
and varnished wood on the center console and doors.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, it's got some major contenders. For instance, the
drop- dead gorgeous Jaguar S-Type, with a curvy silhouette, sun
roof, oh-so-fashionable bird's-eye maple wood trim and a hefty
chrome Jaguar hood ornament, is priced at $42,500 and up.
</P>
<P>
   More sporty, but equally impressive is the two-seater Mercedes
Kompressor, available in a coppery metallic exterior with orange
accents in the black leather upholstery and the center panel. The
little roadster also sports oval exhaust pipes instead of the usual
round design.
</P>
<P>
   Also to be considered is the Volvo C70 convertible, presented
with a metallic cinnamon exterior and champagne leather interior
with red walnut trim and elegantly appointed vanity mirrors. Note:
Illuminated vanity mirrors are still not considered standard
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   DISCOUNT DIVA
</P>
<P>
   Style really matters, but frankly she can't afford those luxe
labels. She buys her clothes at off-price stores, and when it comes
to cars, she's equally savvy.
</P>
<P>
   For her, Chevrolet's Monte Carlo LS Coupe is at its best in
black with ebony animal-print cloth interior, priced at $21,296.
It's got nice vanity mirrors and lots of conveniences, but the
curvy silhouette and futuristic taillights encased in clear plastic
make the style statement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CITIFIED COWGIRL
</P>
<P>
   Hauling hay, antique furniture, golden retrievers and more.
Something that kicks up the dust on the back roads and makes her
feel like she's heading to a ranch in Texas instead of the studio
lot in Burbank. We're talking trucks, and the GMC 4X4 Sierra is the
hottest ticket.
</P>
<P>
   This classic pickup truck comes in creamy fire-engine red with a
passenger cab (three doors), sports gray leather upholstery, a
snack table, really deep wells in the drink holders, and oh yeah,
it's got an overhead console to hold sunglasses, garage door
openers and maps. The final touch is some vintage-inspired chrome
trim on the sides of the cab and the bumpers, and a lowered step
that makes the cab easy to hop into. The bottom line? $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   For $10,000 less, the Ford four-door pickup (also in creamy
red), is loaded with style, right down to its chrome-trimmed wheels
and fenders and the ``step-up'' for women drivers. Waxing
nostalgic, Ford installed a bench seat instead of buckets and used
gray vinyl and fabric upholstery, which is great for lovers
watching the sun come up. &QL;

CBS PRESIDENT EMPHASIZES CHANGING FACE OF TV
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS may be riding high in the ratings in prime time, but that
didn't prevent Les Moonves, president and CEO of CBS Television,
from his usual pugnacity and feistiness in his press conference
during the semiannual TV Press Tour in Pasadena. In contrast to the
diplomacy that other network executive press conferences follow,
Moonves took potshots at the other networks and offered up other
colorful observations about the state of television in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves began by introducing three other top CBS executives _
Andrew Heyward of CBS News, Nancy Tellem of the network's
entertainment arm and Sean McManus of the sports division _ by
explaining he didn't want reporters to get ``tired of seeing the
same two people'' in the programming department. He then added,
referring to the other networks' recent turnover in top management
positions, ``Actually, at the other networks, you never see the
same two people.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves suggested the recent departure of Lindy DeKoven, who
left NBC Saturday night after running the network's TV movie
division, is because NBC's upcoming 10-hour miniseries ``The 10th
Kingdom'' is ``a dog.'' He added, ``If I had 10 hours of TV that
wasn't very good, I'd get rid of the executive responsible early so
I had someone to blame.'' He saidthat ``CBS has never been
dominated by one producer who provided bad special effects,''
referring to ``Kingdom'' producer Robert Halmi, who has also
produced other expensive but low-rated miniseries for NBC such as
``Leprechauns.''
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, Moonves spoke of his hopes for CBS' upcoming
midseason series ``City of Angels,'' a multiethnic drama set in a
Los Angeles hospital. Last year, the NAACP decried the lack of
racial diversity in network television casts, and this series, from
``NYPD Blue'' collaborators Steven Bochco and Paris Barclay, will
be an important test to see if mainstream audiences will warm to a
show with a predominantly minority cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more than just a television show,'' Moonves said. Though
development of minority-themed series has increased since the NAACP
complained about the dearth of African-American roles on TV, should
``City of Angels'' not click with viewers, he conceded, ``I don't
know if it will kill the genre, but it will set it back.
Unfortunately, that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is becoming more symbolic than it should,'' Moonves
said, adding that the series is more correctly characterized as
multicultural than strictly African-American in its concerns. ``We
do have to get beyond that this is a black hospital show.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said that given the show's time slot _ 8 p.m.
Wednesdays, a traditionally weak point on CBS' schedule _ ``It
doesn't have to be an instant hit.'' The network plans to give
viewers time to find the series.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves added that he had met with several minority groups on
Tuesday and an announcement was forthcoming on CBS' official policy
for bringing more actors of color to the TV screen. NBC and ABC
have already detailed plans for integrating the TV landscape, but
Moonves said, ``We were out in front of this issue. ... CBS by far
in terms of having people before the camera is ahead of everyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Close scrutiny of CBS' news division put Heyward on the
defensive. Both the network's evening news and recently retooled
morning news package, ``The Early Show,'' have suffered from fallow
ratings, but Heyward declared that no personnel changes were in the
offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both operations are fundamentally very sound,'' Heyward said.
``The evening news program is solid as a rock editorially.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``The Early Show'' has ``done a terrific job of
mounting a credible, competent and competitive program. The cycle
has not favored our program, but I give them credit for getting us
on the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward also defended Jane Clayson, co-anchor of ``The Early
Show'' with Bryant Gumbel, who was roundly criticized in reviews of
the show of not holding her own with her colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jane's doing great _ she took on a daunting
challenge,'' Heyward said. ``She started strong and is getting
stronger, and her rapport with Bryant will continue to evolve and
grow. You can't artificially cast the show _ `Send me someone perky
and feisty.' You have to let the relationship evolve. But as far as
Bryant dominating her _ I don't think that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS also took a critical hit for digitally altering images in
its broadcasts of ``The Early Show'' and its news coverage of New
Year's Eve in Times Square _ a CBS logo was digitally superimposed
over an NBC logo. Critics charged that this alters viewers'
perceptions of reality, something TV news organizations should not
be in the business of doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a close call, and we did debate it,'' Heyward said.
``Reasonable people can agree to disagree on this issue as to
whether it was appropriate. ... I don't think signage in Times
Square affected a news story.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves interjected that he could imagine the NBC logo being
part of a CBS news story: ``If someone used the NBC logo to commit
a murder, we wouldn't cut it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves also repeated his earlier criticism of the prime-time
game show phenomenon, even though his network has followed ABC's
wild success with ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' by developing
its own quiz shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's good for television,'' he said. ``But am I
jealous (of ABC's success)? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   McManus of CBS Sports noted that football ratings for the
network were up 3 percent, even though the network had based much
of its coverage on the assumption _ disastrously wrong, as it
turned out _ that the Denver Broncos and New York Jets would be
powerhouse teams this season. ``That proves that of all sports,
nothing is as dominant as NFL Football,'' McManus said. ``It bodes
extremely well for us in the future.'' &QL;

SATELLITE FINDINGS HELP EXPLAIN A HOT GAS HALO OF THE MILKY WAY 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ga., Md., N.J., Wis., Colo., Calif., Canada)  (jw) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From the first observations by a new spacecraft,
astronomers have found evidence that they say not only confirms the
existence of a halo of hot gas surrounding the Milky Way galaxy but
also seems to reveal how the gas got there, stays hot and
contributes recycled material for the formation of new stars.
</P>
<P>
   The findings from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorers,
called FUSE, were reported here Wednesday at a meeting of the
American Astronomical Society. The small 300-pound satellite was
launched into Earth orbit in June to conduct a planned three-year
investigation of the evolution of galaxies and formation of stars
and planets.
</P>
<P>
   The new results show that ``FUSE is open for business and is
already producing groundbreaking science,'' said George Sonneborn,
the project's chief scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center
in Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling discovery so far, scientists said, was the
detection a vast abundance of a certain type of oxygen atom, known
as oxygen VI, that appears in almost all directions and extends as
much as 5,000 to 10,000 light-years away from the plane of the
Milky Way, the region in Earth's home galaxy where most stars
reside. Oxygen VI is an oxygen atom that has five of its eight
electrons stripped away.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the presence of these atoms indicates the existence
of gas with temperatures approaching half a million degrees
Fahrenheit, Blair D. Savage of the University of Wisconsin at
Madison said this was strong evidence linking the dynamics of the
galactic halo to stars that exploded long ago. Some scientists had
thought the halo gases were much cooler. Others had suggested that
the gas was heated by ultraviolet radiation from hot stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the only way to make the observed amount of oxygen VI is
through collision with the blast waves'' from exploding stars, or
supernovas, Savage said.
</P>
<P>
   This idea of a galactic halo of hot gas was postulated in 1956
by Lyman Spitzer, who was an astrophysicist at Princeton
University. And 40 years ago, Dutch astronomers discovered clouds
of gas falling into the plane of the Milky Way at extremely high
velocities.
</P>
<P>
   The FUSE spacecraft has also gathered detailed data on the
composition of these infalling clouds. Metals in the clouds could
link them to supernovas, revealing how many times the cloud's
contents have been processed by the nuclear furnaces inside stars.
This is how stars transmute light elements from the beginning of
the universe into heavier elements, the stuff of planets, minerals
and people.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the early results, Edward Murphy, a research scientist
at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said most of the clouds
appeared to have metals that had been processed by stars at least
once. It was too early to tell if that applied to all the clouds,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the findings offered a plausible view of one
important aspect of galactic dynamics. When dying stars explode,
they heat the gas around them, creating pressures that push the gas
up and away like a colossal bubble. They rise to the halo region,
which is continuously heated and replenished by more rising gases.
As some of the gases cool, though, they fall back into the galaxy
in clouds, bringing with them the gas out of which new stars form
and the supernova debris that winds up in planetary systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a bit like the water cycle on Earth,'' Murphy said.
And just as the movement of water into the atmosphere and back to
Earth again explains climate and weather, discoveries by FUSE could
yield insights into the nature of the galactic halo.
</P>
<P>
   The FUSE spacecraft was designed to sample ultraviolet light in
a nearly unexplored region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Its
spectrograph, which breaks down light like a prism, is at least 100
times as powerful as such instruments on previous spacecraft. The
ultraviolet light is invisible to the human eye, and the kind of
most interest to astronomers is screened out by Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In examining the halo, astronomers looked at the ultraviolet
light coming from a dozen bright objects in the distant universe.
As the light passed through the halo gas, some of it was absorbed
at certain known wavelengths. These absorptions were like
signatures of the elements within the halo, like the oxygen VI.
</P>
<P>
   Other early findings by FUSE included detailed observations of
the molecular hydrogen clouds out of which stars form in the Milky
Way and neighboring galaxies. The spacecraft also tracked hot gas
``winds'' from huge bright stars that blow away their mass in 10
million years, brief lifetimes in stellar terms.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft was built and is operated by Johns Hopkins for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in collaboration
with Canada, France, the University of Colorado and the University
of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continuing to tune the instrument,'' said Warren Moos,
the FUSE principal investigator at Johns Hopkins. In the spring, it
should be ready to begin a comprehensive study of the cosmic
abundance of deuterium, a fossil atom left over from the Big Bang.

   RING-ROBBERY (Los Angeles) -- When a robber demanded Carl Phan's
money, he gave it up, but he refused to give up his wedding ring
cost him his life. Phan struggled with his assailant and was shot
and wounded. The robber fled, but Phan kept the ring and returned
to his wife of 12 years. ``The wedding ring that is the only
valuable thing I have,'' he said. ``It represents true love and
comittment to each other and that we are never going to separate
from each other until death.'' By Lisa Van Proyen. (Will move on

   XRATED-LAX (Los Angeles) -- New security systems at Los Angeles
International Airport and others are so powerful they actually can
reveal the naked curves of travelers, prompting complaints from
civil liberarians and passengers alike. The new $125,000 BodySearch
system uses very low doses of x-ray energy to scan and display an

FASHION ON FOUR WHEELS AT THE L.A. AUTO SHOW

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swirls of silver, lots of red and numerous designs punched with
orange.
</P>
<P>
   And the silhouettes. Sexy, curvy and body-hugging.
</P>
<P>
   Add sleek leather, some animal prints, monochromatic fashion
statements and you've got the best of European design and American
style.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, these are cars, not clothes. But in a city where your image
is defined by style, an automobile should not be judged by its
mechanical prowess alone.
</P>
<P>
   So, no hoods were opened or tires kicked for this report of the
trendsetters of the Greater L.A. Auto Show 2000, which continues
through Sunday at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Here are a few
car suggestions based on your style: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VALLEY GIRL
</P>
<P>
   Sporty, speedy and stylin' are the trademarks of the ultimate
(San Fernando) Valley Girl driving machine, and the standout is the
Audi TT Roadster, a shiny, little silver two-seater convertible
that's as cute and curvaceous as the '90s Volkswagen Bug. Only it's
more glamorous, with a retro dash (individual gauges instead of a
panel) and a gas cap design that looks like the nut-and-bolt design
on the Cartier love bracelet. The stick-shift Audi TT is available
in matte or metallic silver, priced at $33,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Other cars for driving in fashion's fast lane include the Ford
Mustang, which has fewer muscle-bound features and more girlie
stuff, like a neon-orange paint job and a cute pony logo
embroidered on the fronts of the tan leather seats. Details include
aluminum wheels and a groovy trio of tail lights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RETRO BABE
</P>
<P>
   She loves old movies, flea markets and clothes with bohemian
flair. She'd love to drive a vintage car, but finds those restored
models too pricey, and besides, they're gas guzzlers.
</P>
<P>
   For her, the cherry red Chrysler PT Cruiser modeled after the
1930s Air Flow, and the Ford Thunderbird, modeled after the 1957
T-Bird.
</P>
<P>
   The PT Cruiser is low-swung and curvy with art deco lines,
upholstered in a gray fabric that looks like the old horsehair
fabrics and also has the new-again dashboard with separate gauges.
Not only does it turn heads, but its small (four-cylinder) engine
ensures good mileage.
</P>
<P>
   The T-Bird roadster, which we probably won't see until the end
of the year, is modeled after the popular '57 T-Bird right down to
the little porthole windows on the sides and the bullet-shaped tail
lights. Even the top has to be lifted off to make it a convertible.
At the preview, it was shown in red, but perhaps Ford will rethink
the colors and include a vintage shade of turquoise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GLAMOUR QUEEN
</P>
<P>
   She's the designer-label driver who dresses to impress, right
down to her luxury automobile.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, it's been the Lexus, known for its subtle
glamour and pearlized finish, and the company's new GS400 model
certainly qualifies with its sun roof, pale gray leather interior
and varnished wood on the center console and doors.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, it's got some major contenders. For instance, the
drop- dead gorgeous Jaguar S-Type, with a curvy silhouette, sun
roof, oh-so-fashionable bird's-eye maple wood trim and a hefty
chrome Jaguar hood ornament, is priced at $42,500 and up.
</P>
<P>
   More sporty, but equally impressive is the two-seater Mercedes
Kompressor, available in a coppery metallic exterior with orange
accents in the black leather upholstery and the center panel. The
little roadster also sports oval exhaust pipes instead of the usual
round design.
</P>
<P>
   Also to be considered is the Volvo C70 convertible, presented
with a metallic cinnamon exterior and champagne leather interior
with red walnut trim and elegantly appointed vanity mirrors. Note:
Illuminated vanity mirrors are still not considered standard
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   DISCOUNT DIVA
</P>
<P>
   Style really matters, but frankly she can't afford those luxe
labels. She buys her clothes at off-price stores, and when it comes
to cars, she's equally savvy.
</P>
<P>
   For her, Chevrolet's Monte Carlo LS Coupe is at its best in
black with ebony animal-print cloth interior, priced at $21,296.
It's got nice vanity mirrors and lots of conveniences, but the
curvy silhouette and futuristic taillights encased in clear plastic
make the style statement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CITIFIED COWGIRL
</P>
<P>
   Hauling hay, antique furniture, golden retrievers and more.
Something that kicks up the dust on the back roads and makes her
feel like she's heading to a ranch in Texas instead of the studio
lot in Burbank. We're talking trucks, and the GMC 4X4 Sierra is the
hottest ticket.
</P>
<P>
   This classic pickup truck comes in creamy fire-engine red with a
passenger cab (three doors), sports gray leather upholstery, a
snack table, really deep wells in the drink holders, and oh yeah,
it's got an overhead console to hold sunglasses, garage door
openers and maps. The final touch is some vintage-inspired chrome
trim on the sides of the cab and the bumpers, and a lowered step
that makes the cab easy to hop into. The bottom line? $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   For $10,000 less, the Ford four-door pickup (also in creamy
red), is loaded with style, right down to its chrome-trimmed wheels
and fenders and the ``step-up'' for women drivers. Waxing
nostalgic, Ford installed a bench seat instead of buckets and used
gray vinyl and fabric upholstery, which is great for lovers
watching the sun come up. &QL;

GORE VOWS `FRESH START' IN DEFENDING CHANCES OF WINNING PRESIDENCY

<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore defended his
electability Wednesday, both because and despite his relationship
with President Clinton, and was prompted by an undecided Iowa
Democrat to declare: ``I wouldn't have done that'' with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, national front-runner for the Democratic presidential
nomination, called Clinton's sexual liaisons near the Oval Office
with White House intern Lewinsky ``reprehensible'' but insisted
that the criticism did not begin to describe his many-layered
feelings about the man he has served closely for seven years and is
seeking to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president sought to convince a group of supporters and
undecided voters at Coe College of his political independence: ``I
am running for president on my own, as who I am, on my own vision,
on my agenda.'' His comments came as he pressed for support ahead
of the Iowa precinct caucuses Jan. 24 that will formally begin the
presidential nominating contest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore recalled that some Democrats in 1960 had said John F.
Kennedy could not win and that Republicans had said the same of
Ronald Reagan in 1980. Although claiming not to like polls ``at
all,'' Gore went on to contend that some national surveys had
turned around recently, and now showed he would have a better
chance than former Sen. Bill Bradley to defeat the Republican
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement in polls cited by Gore is marginal, and he
continues to trail Bush. A Newsweek poll showed Bush leading Gore
by 7 percentage points (50 percent to 43 percent) and Bush leading
Bradley by 12 points (54 percent to 38 percent). A Time-CNN poll
put Bush 17 percentage points (56 percent to 39 percent) over Gore
and 16 percentage points over Bradley (55 percent to 39 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that if he is the Democratic nominee he would
challenge the Republican standard-bearer to abandon television
commercials in favor of frequent debates.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Iowa on Tuesday night, Gore roused an
audience of his partisans with the pledge to ``hound that other
party from coast to coast and border to border with a challenge to
debate twice a week, accepting every format, accepting every
invitation within reason.'' Gore said he would apply the rule to
his campaign and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has issued the same challenge to Bradley, who has refused,
and a similar rejection is almost certain from any Republican
nominee, which the vice president and his strategists almost
certainly know.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making Gore try to look high-minded, the
debates-only challenge would cut into any Republican attempt to use
television advertising to link Gore to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps concern about such commercials influenced a Gore remark
Wednesday night: ``We do not have to have this insipid approach to
having these little meaningless, poll-tested, fuzzy, clever,
ultimately destructive messages that demean our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A debates-only campaign would remove the possibility that
Republican groups could hammer Gore with clips, including the vice
president's assertion, on the day of the impeachment vote in
December 1998, that Clinton was ``one of the greatest presidents''
in the nation's history. Independent groups, however, would not
necessarily be bound by such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Gore's long, nuanced answer about his relationship
with Clinton, which could be a major subtheme in the fall campaign,
would not fit neatly into a 30- or 60-second ad.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his relationship with Clinton had ``basically four
aspects.'' Those included becoming ``a genuinely good friend''
because of their working closely together, being shocked by
Clinton's ``personal mistake'' in the Lewinsky scandal, fighting
``an awful lot of battles'' over the seven years of their
administration, and running the current campaign ``on my own.'' The
successes, he said, included the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing only one of those aspects, ``you won't get the whole
picture,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps unwittingly, later in a United Auto Workers union
hall in Waterloo, Gore voiced what almost certainly will be a major
Republican campaign theme and raised some doubt about how closely
he wants to be aligned with Clinton in voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is about fresh starts,'' Gore said. ``And we need a
fresh start. We need a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, it had taken Gore several minutes to lay out his answer
Wednesday after Craig Wood, a Cedar Rapids mental health worker,
challenged Gore's chances of winning the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that your ability to win the election is reduced
by your association with the Clinton scandal, and I think you've
got to come up with some way to make a statement that you're
separated from that somehow,'' Wood said. ``I would have a
suggestion for that statement which something along the lines of,
'I wouldn't have done that.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Wood continued to speak, Gore broke in to say: ``I wouldn't
have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore expressed confidence that during the next nine months he
could be accepted on his own by the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that presidential campaigns represent an
opportunity for the American people to get to know the candidates
personally and make a judgment about them personally,'' Gore said.
``Properly pursued a presidential campaign is a learning
experience, even a transformative experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said after the hour-plus forum that he was leaning toward
support for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he convinced me,'' Wood said. ``I understand that you
can be a friend and not approve of their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said Gore trails Bush in national polls because of the
Clinton scandal, but if Gore ``can get his message out,'' he could
overcome voters' doubts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a favorite topic of reporters, Gore rarely gets
questions from voters about electability. He also faced inquiries
at Coe about other seldom raised issues, including one about
``transgender'' discrimination from a person who had a sex-change
operation and another from a farmer who pressed the vice president
for his position on ``ram shields,'' devices apparently banned in
Iowa that keep rambunctious male sheep from butting their minders.

JUDGE IN TRIAL OF PAKISTAN'S OUSTED PREMIER QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The judge in the treason and hijacking case
against the ousted prime minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif,
abruptly quit the proceedings Wednesday, complaining that
government intelligence agents were menacing his courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot provide a fair trial in these circumstances,'' said
the judge, Shabbir Ahmed, just before he stalked out, leaving
behind a stunned courtroom. ``Is it an open, free, fair and
impartial trial when intelligence people sit in my room in
plainclothes?''
</P>
<P>
   The judge then sent the troublesome case back to the same lower
court judge who only a month ago sent it his way.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another bizarre episode in an increasingly bizarre
situation _ and no way for Pakistan's military ruler to celebrate
the three-month mark of his coup.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the nation's self-proclaimed leader, had
explained his seizure of power on Oct. 12 as a reaction to a
murderous plot by Sharif. But the court case, which promised high
drama, has produced only farce.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Wednesday in Karachi began routinely enough,
observers said. But then, one of Sharif's five co-defendants,
Shahid Khakan Abbasi, former head of the state airline, stood up to
complain about the conditions in the jail cells where he and the
others have been held. Abbasi added that a government intelligence
agent had taken a seat near the defendants and was listening to
their conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of someone from an intelligence service is not
particularly unusual at a high-profile political trial. But the
judge seemed to grow angry and began firing questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge just lost his temper,'' a defense lawyer, Khawaja
Naveed Ahmed, said. ``He said he wanted the intelligence officers
to be arrested, though that didn't happen. He said he wanted the
case transferred, and then he walked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif began speaking to reporters. ``It is very obvious that
the government wants to overpower the court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif has proclaimed his innocence of all charges, including
hijacking, kidnapping, attempted murder and plotting to wage war
against the state.
</P>
<P>
   The charges, which could incur the death penalty, stem from the
events of Oct. 12, when Sharif reportedly gave orders to prevent a
jet with 198 passengers from landing at the Karachi airport as it
was running out of fuel. Aboard the flight was Musharraf, who,
though he did not know it at the time, had been sacked as army
chief by Sharif. The general has insisted that an air calamity was
averted only because the military seized the airport in a hastily
orchestrated coup.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The case against Sharif was prepared in antiterrorism courts,
where rules have been written to produce quick verdicts. Near the
time for the official filing of charges, the government suddenly
rewrote the antiterrorism laws so that only a High Court judge
could preside.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ahmed was appointed, and although some defense lawyers
contend that the government had picked someone whom it could bully,
events seemed to prove otherwise. He repeatedly scolded prosecutors
for refusing to share evidence with the defense. One delay followed
another. The court has yet to ``frame'' the charges, the legal step
where the case is accepted for an actual trial. Meanwhile, the core
of the prosecution's case has been made public, with the filing of
summaries of witnesses' statements.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than neatly supporting Musharraf's account, the
statements are full of contradictions and could be read as a prime
minister's understandable efforts to head off a coup after having
exercised his constitutional right to replace his army chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weak case, and I don't think any judge would want to
try it under these circumstances,'' Ahmed, the defense lawyer,
said. ``I'm suspicious. What happened today seems preplanned. If
you were the judge, wouldn't you use a little drama to get out of
this case?''

EVEN FOR AOL - TIME WARNER, ASIA LOOMS AS A CHALLENGE  (jw) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ It was hardly Paris, but Shanghai played a part in
the brief, intense courtship between America Online and Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, the chairman of America Online, attended a Fortune
magazine conference there in October, during which he met and
mingled with Time Warner's top executives, including Gerald Levin
and Ted Turner. Later, the executives traveled to Beijing for the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
A Time Warner executive who was there recalls a teasing exchange
between Case and Turner, when the two found themselves stranded in
the rain outside the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted, your big, merged company isn't getting you off the
steps,'' Case shouted to Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve,'' he replied, ``your billions ain't getting you
anywhere either.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, even after America Online's extraordinary bid
for Time Warner, that this huge merged company will be able to get
off the steps in China _ or elsewhere in Asia. As in Europe, where
America Online has built a valuable regional franchise through its
partnership with Bertelsmann AG, the Internet in Asia remains a
fractured business with few large competitors and virtually none
that cross national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL and Time Warner have tremendous critical mass in the
United States and, through AOL and Compuserve, in Europe as well,''
said Michael Wolf, the partner in charge of the media practice at
Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton in New York. ``But to a large extent, Asia is
up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online operates an online service in Japan and recently
started one in Hong Kong. But it has yet to enter the Chinese
mainland, where Yahoo, the Internet portal service, is one of the
only major American Internet companies to have established a
foothold. Time Warner distributes movies and music in China, as
well as CNN and Time magazine, when they are not banned by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   But Time Warner, like most other American media companies, has
not been able to make deep inroads into China because of barriers
ranging from piracy and onerous regulations to political pressure.
The proposed merger will not eliminate those hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said America Online would benefit more from a
merger than Time Warner because its credibility would be burnished
in the eyes of the Chinese government. Although Beijing recently
indicated, after months of equivocation, that it would allow
foreign companies to invest in the Internet, the government seems
likely to pick and choose among potential entrants. Analysts said
America Online's odds of receiving favorable treatment would be
higher if it tied up with a media colossus like Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN and Ted Turner will open doors for this company
politically, allowing it to do things that other companies may not
be able to,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Lippey, chief executive of Tokai Asia, a hedge fund in
Hong Kong, said, ``The merger gives AOL international credibility.
Time Warner is a good, old-fashioned multinational.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the merged company's prospects in Asia are uncertain,
news of the huge deal reverberated through the region, prompting
talk of more mergers and strategic alliances involving Asian
companies. Shares of local media companies and Internet access
providers soared on Tuesday, though most fell back Wednesday as the
initial giddiness over the announcement subsided.
</P>
<P>
   That reality check may reflect some basic truths about Asia.
Lehman Brothers noted in a report that the ownership of many Asian
media companies was concentrated in the hands of one or two large
investors. That would make large combinations like AOL-Time Warner
unlikely, at least in the short-term.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cultural, linguistic and regulatory differences among Asian
countries also militate against the creation of pan-Asian
companies. Two decades after CNN was founded in the United States,
Star TV, which is the satellite television service, remains the
only genuinely regional media service based in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts and stock pickers were quick to draw up lists of
Asian companies they contended would benefit from the changes
uncorked by America Online and Time Warner. Leading the list were
obvious candidates like Sony, the Japanese electronics giant, and
less obvious ones like TVB, a Hong Kong television broadcaster that
owns the world's largest library of Chinese-language programming.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that any company aspiring to deliver information
and entertainment to subscribers via high-capacity wires would also
benefit. Among the Asian players in this ``broadband'' business are
Korea Thrunet and Pacific Century Cyberworks of Hong Kong. Hong
Kong's dominant local phone company, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, may also
come into favor because of its recent alliance with Star TV, in
which the two plan to offer television programming to the phone
company's customers.
</P>
<P>
   For all the excitement, Asia's reaction to the AOL-Time Warner
has had an unfocused quality. Experts said that reflected the
Internet's relative lack of the development here, which makes
picking winners and predicting the future even more futile than in
the United States. ``It's a simple question of supply and demand,''
Lippey said. ``There aren't that many quality Internet companies in
Asia.''

   ``The Secret of Shambhala,'' James Redfield's latest guide to

that will be (en)lightened is your wallet.
</P>
<P>
   This is a torturous 235 pages of bunk, hokum, bilge, foolishness

as a first-person yarn, receives a cryptic message from a friend
lost in Tibet while in search of Shambhala, first-cousin city to
Shangri-La.
</P>
<P>
   Shambhala is, we are led to believe, the land of enlightenment.
And so our paranoid hero dutifully trucks off to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   He imagines danger at every turn, presumably from Chinese
soldiers who seek to quash any mention of Shambhala. But the danger
is more perceived than real. It comes off as a device contrived to
inject some dramatic tension into a tale that, even so, has the
intellectual depth of TV's ``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Redfield skulks about Tibet with the help of Yin, a native guide
and spiritual mentor who drones on about maintaining his ``prayer
field'' and ``synchronicity'' as they search for ``The
Extensions.'' On occasion, the two are aided by the Dakini, best
described as Shambhalan sprites.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Celestine Prophecy,'' an earlier unliterary mess,
Redfield went mucking around South America, where he fomented ``The
Ten Insights.'' Think of The Extensions as the Asian version of The
Insights.
</P>
<P>
   The First Extension is achieved by breathing in ``inner divine
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Visualize that this energy is coming into you and feel it as
it flows out into the world. Do this, and you will have completed
the First Extension,'' says Yin.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Extension, we learn, is all about ``setting your
field of energy so that it will enhance your life flow. You do this
by staying alert and expectant.'' It's much like a caffeine rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Third Extension,'' says Yin, `` is setting your
prayer-field to go out and increase the energy and vibrational
levels of others. When your prayer field reaches other people in
this way, they feel a hit of spiritual energy, clarity, intuition
and they will be more likely to give you the right information.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad that none of this has anything to do with clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's much more. Let us just say that Redfield does
find Shambhala, which turns out to be a physical place where the
people have mastered cold fusion and procreate by ``intuition.''
The unborn children also magically go away if the couple changes
(or loses?) its collective mind.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, great literature can entertain, educate and
enlighten. ``The Search for Shambhala'' is neither great nor
literature. Neither is it entertaining, educational or
enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   Easy answers to life's mysteries would be nice, but
enlightenment is neither a place nor a destination. It comes from
experience, self-evaluation and growth. And, most of all, it is a
journey one never completes, or finds in a James Redfield ``book.''
(Apologies to people who really do write books.)
</P>
<P>
   One almost can't blame Redfield for wanting to make a buck. What
is distressing is that so many desperately confused people allow
themselves to be taken in by this waste of good paper.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, World Shambhalaism is attained and maintained
through some kind of collective prayer field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to human progress,'' we are told, ``is to have enough
people who can beam a higher expectation of love into this human
field.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words: ``Trust the Force, Luke!''
</P>
<P>
   This is snake oil. .MDUL/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's

JAKARTA REPLACES HEAD OF BANK RESTRUCTURING AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Indonesia's three-month-old government tightened its
control over the nation's much-disputed economic rebuilding effort
Wednesday, dismissing the chairman of its powerful bank
restructuring agency and replacing him with an official closer to
President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo told reporters that Glenn Yusuf
would step down Thursday as chairman of the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency, a position Yusuf had held for the last 19
months.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, Cacuk Sudarijanto, is a former
telecommunications executive whom Wahid had appointed as the
agency's vice chairman last November and who enjoys support among
the loose grouping of Muslim political parties instrumental in
Wahid's October election.
</P>
<P>
   The move puts control of the economy of Indonesia, the world's
fourth most populous nation, more firmly in the hands of the new
administration. The bank restructuring agency, which was
established in early 1998 as a condition of aid from the
International Monetary Fund, controls roughly $69 billion in assets
as well as the rescue of the nation's insolvent banks. It is in
charge of reviving the banking system by selling off the holdings
of troubled banks and recovering unpaid loans from recalcitrant
debtors.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the largest debtors are companies owned in part by the
friends and children of former President Suharto, who resigned amid
riots and mass protests in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There had long been some speculation that Yusuf would be
replaced, but it remained unclear Wednesday how the move would
affect relations between Jakarta and the IMF, which is overseeing a
$43 billion economic assistance package to Indonesia and has in the
past opposed efforts to politicize the agency. The IMF and
Indonesia are due to sign a new letter on the terms of that package
this month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The proposed appointment of a new chairman for the Indonesian
Bank Restructuring Agency comes at a critical juncture,'' said
Vasuki Shastry, an IMF spokesman in Washington. ``The IMF has been
working closely with IBRA on restructuring Indonesia's financial
system, a prerequisite for achieving broad economic recovery.'' He
said the agency would continue working with Indonesia but ``would
like to reiterate that maintaining IBRA's independence and
professionalism is absolutely essential and remains central to the
IMF program.''
</P>
<P>
   Other signs have emerged recently that Wahid's government is
maneuvering to gain more singular control over how to uproot the
corruption of Suharto's regime. Last week, the government asked the
parliament to remove the central bank governor after a state audit
found fault with the bank's account of billions of dollars in
futile rescue loans doled out to commercial banks in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a part of a wider pattern to assert partisan control
in Indonesia,'' said Andrew MacIntyre, an associate professor of
international relations at the University of California in San
Diego. ``But whether this new partisan leadership will get better
results is very much an open question.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication what Yusuf might do next or what would
happen to his immediate subordinates, although there was
speculation that some of them might be dismissed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yusuf, a banking industry executive, was appointed under the
interim administration of Wahid's predecessor, B.J. Habibie, and
had earned the respect of the foreign bankers and investors whose
funds are crucial to raising the money necessary for Indonesia's
bank bailout.
</P>
<P>
   But Yusuf's close relationships with overseas financiers, as
well as his continued membership on the board of a securities firm
paid to advise the agency, had led to criticism by Indonesian
politicians that he had conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Yusuf and the agency became embroiled in a corruption
scandal after approving payments to Bank Bali that ended up at a
company controlled by the former ruling party. Though Yusuf was
never directly implicated, his reputation never recovered and the
agency's efforts to sell assets and repay interbank loans were
weakened.
</P>
<P>
   World of Yusuf's dismissal had little effect on Indonesia's
financial markets, partly because there had been some expectation
that it would happen at some point. The rupiah, the domestic
currency, weakened marginally to 7,135 to the dollar from 7,035
Tuesday, and Indonesia stocks fell 1 percent amid a broader retreat
in Asia shares.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid had named Cacuk vice chairman of the agency in November,
when he moved it out from under the Ministry of Finance and put it
under his direct control, ostensibly to make it more independent.
</P>
<P>
   Cacuk, formerly president director of the telecommunications
monopoly PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, brings in a reputation as a
capable manager unsullied by links to the Suharto regime.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's Muslim parties are also said to support Cacuk, and
analysts said there was a chance Cacuk might adopt their calls for
the agency to take a more populist role in revamping Indonesia's
economy, perhaps trying to redistribute assets to native
Indonesians rather than sell them to the highest-bidding
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Cacuk is also close to the former minister of cooperatives and
small enterprises, Adi Sasono, who has called for the creation of a
``people's economy.'' Early last year, Cacuk resigned as director
general of small-scale enterprises development to lead Sasono's
People's Sovereignty Party. Cacuk has said he is no longer a member
of the party and has denied any allegiance to Sasono.

KREMLIN RELEASES VIDEO IT CLAIMS LINKS CHECHENS TO TERROR
BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Kremlin on Wednesday offered what it called proof
that militants in Chechnya masterminded terrorist bombings last
fall at several Russian apartment houses: a video tour of a Chechen
bomb factory, replete with thumping music.
</P>
<P>
   The film of the factory, which officials said contained
explosives identical to those used in the bombings, appeared to
offer circumstantial evidence at best that the militants were
behind the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   But the secretary of the Russian government's security council,
Sergei Ivanov, said Russian forces are seeking two individuals in
Grozny and in rebel-held southern Chechnya who they believe are
tied to the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged in the bombings, which destroyed a
Russian barracks in Dagestan and vast apartment blocks in Moscow
and the southwest Russian town of Volgodonsk. More than 300
civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebel leaders have denied any role in the bombings. The
most cynical Russians have suggested that the government itself
staged the blasts to fan nationalistic political support of the
Kremlin, a charge Ivanov on Wednesday called crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said Wednesday's release of the video was meant in part
to put such rumors to rest. ``This film proves the indisputable
link of the explosions to Chechnya,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The video was shot by the Federal Security Service, the
successor agency to the Soviet KGB. It depicts sites in
Urus-Martan, a town about 10 miles southwest of the Chechen
capital, Grozny, in which the Kremlin says bombs were made and
slave laborers and condemned prisoners were kept penned in cells.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scenes on the film are shots of containers said to be
filled with explosives; mixing vats, and bomb components such as
alarm clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said the sites held ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive
ingredient used in the apartment-house bombings, and a small amount
of hexagen, another explosive compound found in traces of the
terrorist bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the vigorous actions of our army, the militants
didn't manage to take everything out of these bases,'' he said.
``They left behind explosives that were identical to the ones used
in the explosions'' in Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same ingredients, he said, were also used in car
bombings in 1998 in Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, in which
13 people died and more than 100 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   He also charged that the rebels had executed 700 civilians who
refused to assist them and 300 hostages who were being held for
ransom. There was no way to corroborate those figures.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both Russian and Chechen propagandists have been
hurling wildly inflated accusations throughout the war, as well as
gross underestimations of their own casualties and battlefield
mistakes, so it is difficult to separate the war's truth from its
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, each side has complained that the other side
massacred civilians and waged chemical warfare. The latter charge
apparently stemmed from the bombing _ accidental or otherwise _ of
some chlorine tanks near Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's video could contain compelling evidence of Chechen
terrorist activity. Or it could simply be an element of the
Kremlin's effort to bolster support for the war at a time when
Russian troops are taking their heaviest losses yet, and when the
once-pliant media are growing restive.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov allowed Wednesday that the Kremlin is locked in an
``information war'' with the Chechen militants, a war that, he
said, was ``at least as fierce as combat in the field.''

&HT;     COURT WEIGHS VISITATION RIGHTS FOR GRANDPARENTS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court struggled Wednesday with
arguments over whether Washington state's Supreme Court made a
mistake last year when it ruled that parents there have a nearly
absolute right to restrict their children's access to anyone,
including grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The state court ruled that parents can bar grandparent
visitation even when a neutral judge has determined that such
contact would be in the ``best interest'' of the children. The
state supreme court's decision invalidated a Washington law that
allowed any person _ relative or non-relative _ to seek visitation
rights claiming they would be in the child's best
interest.Wednesday's highly-charged case has potentially
wide-ranging implications, not only for family life in general but
also for an emerging area of law that seeks to establish that
children have their own rights that may supersede those of their
parents. In hearing the arguments, several of the U.S. Supreme
Court justices appeared to lean toward giving parents the final say
in how their children are raised unless an outside party, such as a
grandparent or a court, could show that the children were being
harmed by the parents' decision.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted past rulings that gave
parents the right to decide how their youngsters would be brought
up and whom they were allowed to see.
</P>
<P>
   He added that reinstating the Washington law might result in
numerous court challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this mean next that a great aunt can come in and say, `I
want take the child to the movies every week because it's in the
best interest of the child to have a relationship with his great
aunt'?'' Rehnquist asked.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the law's reliance on the
phrase ``in the child's best interest'' made the statute
``breathtakingly broad'' and meant that ``anyone can march in and
seek visitation rights to any child.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia also voiced strong concerns about the
so-called ``best-interest'' standard. ``It would be in the best
interest of many children to take them away from their parents and
give them to someone else. But the parents have rights,'' he
said.Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg also
questioned the Washington law. But Breyer, along with Justice David
Souter, also said there is a ``special relationship'' between some
grandparents and grandchildren that should be taken into account in
law.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's case involves an effort by Jenifer and Gary Troxel
from Anacortes, Wash., to see their two granddaughters, Natalie,
10, and Isabelle, 8, on a regular basis. The Troxels' son, Brad,
who fathered the two girls but never married their mother,
committed suicide in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Troxels wanted to have the two girls visit twice a month,
but their mother, Tommie Granville Wynn, wanted to limit the visits
to once a month.Wynn had married a man with several children and
claimed that arranging a visit every two weeks with the
grandparents would be too complicated and time-consuming. Unable to
reach an agreement with Wynn, the Troxels sued in 1995.Later that
year a trial judge ruled in the Troxels' favor, but in a 5-4 vote
the state Supreme Court overturned his decision in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``A parent's constitutionally protected right to rear his or her
children without state interference has been recognized as a
fundamental liberty interest,'' the state court said in its ruling.
``Parents have a right to limit the visitation of their children
with other persons.'' But Mark Olson, a Seattle lawyer for the
Troxels, told the high court that granting the opportunity for
children to see their grandparents isn't a serious intrusion into
parents' constitutional right to family privacy, and that in some
states the right of grandparents to see their grandchildren is
protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court should balance all interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Catherine Smith, a Seattle lawyer for Wynn, argued that
courts should stay out of private family decisions. ``Courts should
not micro-manage families when no one is showing any harm to the
child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is one of the most closely watched of the term and has
prompted friend-of-the-court briefs from many organizations and
more than a dozen states.Among those groups siding with the Troxels
are the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the
National Conference of State Legislatures, National League of
Cities and U.S. Conference of Mayors. Wynn is supported by
organizations that span the ideological spectrum from the American
Civil Liberties Union and gay-rights groups to the Christian Legal
Society.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states have some kind of grandparent-visitation law. In
some states, courts can order visits for grandparents only if
parents are deceased, divorced or unmarried. Some state laws
require proof of a close relationship between children and
grandparents before visits can be ordered. Still others insist that
courts consider the effect of such visits on parent-child
relationships. All states require that judges must determine,
before they permit visits between children and their grandparents,
whether such visits are in the best interest of the child.Some 31
percent of Americans, about 60 million people, are grandparents.
They include Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia, Ginsburg, Justice Anthony
Kennedy and Justice John Paul Stevens. Justice Clarence Thomas was
raised by his grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   An AARP survey released last week found about one in nine
grandparents over the age of 50 helps care for at least one
grandchild. The survey said 8 percent provide day care regularly
and 3 percent function as parents, rearing a grandchild.

   SHELBURNE, Nova Scotia _ Five years ago, this seaside fishing
village of gabled roofs and colonial alleys served as a movie set
for ``The Scarlet Letter.'' But in real life the witch hunt
haunting Shelburne revolves not around ``A'' for adulterer but
``P'' for pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Patrick McDougall, a former employee of Shelburne School
for Boys, a provincial reformatory here, was convicted of sexually
abusing several boys in the 1960s and 1970s. He died in jail last
year.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial received wide publicity, 89 other former
residents of Nova Scotia's three reform schools came forward and
charged that they, too, had been physically or sexually abused
decades ago by him and other staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing an avalanche of lawsuits, the Nova Scotia provincial
government set up a $25 million compensation fund for victims.
Setting aside due process and the concept that the accused were
innocent until proven guilty, the government decided that the
complaints would be accepted largely on face value.
</P>
<P>
   Word spread like wildfire. The government advertised the fund in
newspapers. In some prisons, lawyers posted what inmates nicknamed
``the meat chart,'' an official compensation scale that ranged from
$3,500 for physical abuse up to $85,000 for sexual assault. Within
18 months the number of accusers ballooned to about 1,400, the
number of accusations into the thousands and the number of accused
to 363.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know of any employee who has not been accused,'' Lee
Keating, a former supervisor, said in an interview at a dockside
restaurant here. ``The original intent was to pay off a few
claimants, quick and dirty, and then sweep the whole matter under
the rug.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating says police investigators questioned him about only 20
of the approximately 75 allegations against him that were settled
with cash payments. He says that he is innocent and that the
government refuses to let him see details of the accusations or to
identify the accusers.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron S. McKinnon, a lawyer for Keating and 84 other former
reform school employees, said, ``In many cases our clients were not
even asked their side of the story before payments were made.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon contends that physical evidence has been largely
ignored. Pressed to make payments within 45 days of a complaint,
the fund administrators paid one former resident for an assault
that was alleged to have resulted in broken bones, even though
there were no medical records or contemporary X-rays to back up the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Another former resident, he said, received compensation for an
assault by an employee, even though records showed that the man no
longer worked at the school on the date of the alleged attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like going to buy the lottery ticket when you already
know the numbers,'' McKinnon said of the payment system.
Calculating the total number of claims at 14,500, he said,
``Fourteen thousand five hundred claims that went undetected over
40 years? It doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years two former Shelburne employees have committed
suicide on learning that they had been accused of sexual abuse.
After newspapers reported the suicide of one man who had been
accused, William Belliveau, about 20 other former residents filed
similar claims against him. Later, Royal Canadian Mounted Police
investigators cleared Belliveau of the original charge.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of the program, Anne Derrick, a lawyer for 450 former
residents, complained that a compassionate program has been
``turned on its head'' by critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe there was a significant amount of abusive
activity,'' she said, referring to violence at the reform schools.
``But you are talking, in some cases, about what happened 50 years
ago. There are no records. There are no witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that ``there is undoubtedly a certain amount of
fraud,'' but questioned why the accused were angry, noting that
``the money is not coming out of their pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   To some the controversy revolves around applying late 1990s
standards to 1960s behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the physical abuse was just the kind of smacking
around that the person got at home,'' said Terry Turple, a former
Shelburne resident who is now a house painter in Halifax and who
declined offers to file a suit. ``People getting whacked around was
more or less an every day thing there. We more or less accepted it.
We were bad kids in reform school.''
</P>
<P>
   With the initial compensation fund exhausted, the government has
added $8 million more. Millions more have been spent on an
investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, in what has
become one of the largest investigations in its history. But after
five years, there have been no new indictments for sexual or
physical abuse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reducing the scope of the Mounties' investigation, 403 payment
recipients signed waivers saying they did not want criminal
investigations of their abuse accusations. About 330 of the former
residents who came forward filed abuse claims against McDougall,
the convicted sex abuser who is now dead.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Mounties announced they had just located 7,000
boxes of files from the era _ time cards, employee shift schedules
and expense claim forms. These will have to be digested before any
indictments can be announced, said Sgt. Wayne Noonan, the Mounties'
spokesman for Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be charges,'' he said of the abuse allegations.
Noting that only 63 accusations of fraud over compensation claims
have been forwarded to the commercial crimes section, he said he
concludes that abuse of the compensation program was ``not
widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nova Scotia is now feeling pressure from national scrutiny
to take another look at how it has handled the matter. In
mid-November, Canada's respected public television network, CBC,
called the payout program ``too bad to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Wente, a Globe and Mail newspaper columnist in Toronto,
wrote that ``the real victims of the Shelburne scandal'' are ``the
vast majority of employees who dedicated their lives to helping
troubled kids, and are now seeing their names, reputations and life
work smeared forever by allegations of hideous crimes they never
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the provincial government has commissioned an
independent inquiry. To head the audit, they reached out to Quebec
to hire a retired judge, Fred R. Kaufman. In Halifax, the
compensation program has become such an industry, employing 144
lawyers, that the government was unable to find a member of the
local legal community who was not involved in it.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, most Shelburne employees were cowed into silence by
the combined weight of a hostile press and the government
investigation. Keating had time to mull over the situation when he
worked as a carpenter on the ``Scarlet Letter'' movie set here.
Speaking on a recent evening as chairman of a new group, Past
Employees for Restorative Justice, he said in a clear voice: ``We
want exoneration.''

   MIAMI _ The war of words over 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez escalated Wednesday as his Miami relatives vowed not to
turn him over voluntarily and to file a federal lawsuit after
Attorney General Janet Reno brushed aside a Florida court ruling
that gave them temporary custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to turn over the boy,'' said Juan
Garcia-Pedrosa(cq), one of the family's attorneys. ``They either
have to take him by force, which would be scandalous, or they have
to go to federal court.''
</P>
<P>
   The family plans to file a federal lawsuit next week seeking to
keep Elian in this country, attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, meanwhile, lifted a Friday deadline for returning Elian to
his father in Cuba, saying the matter should be resolved in federal
court. But she firmly rejected a ruling on Monday by a Miami-Dade
County Family Court judge that gave temporary custody of Elian to
his Miami relatives, saying the court's order had ``no force or
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, the question of who may speak for a six-year-old child
in applying for admission or asylum is a matter of federal
immigration law,'' Reno said in a letter to attorneys for Elian's
Miami family.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Miami's volatile exile Cuban community called for the
public to remain calm in the aftermath of the latest developments,
although they warned that they are ready to call for new
demonstrations like the ones last week that tangled traffic and led
to more than 100 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to use civil disobedience as a last resort,'' said
Ramon Saul Sanchez(cq), leader of the anti-Communist Democracy
Movement. ``But we are ready to use it if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The furor over Elian has grown steadily since he was found
clinging to an inner tube off Fort Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day.
His mother and nine other people drowned after their cramped, tiny
boat sank in choppy seas during their attempt to flee Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the tug-of-war over the child has resembled a cross
between a soap opera and political theater, with U.S. presidential
candidates weighing in on the case even as protestors in Miami and
Cuba staged competing demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 5, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner
Doris Meissner(cq) announced that Elian must go back to his father
in Cuba. The agency interviewed Juan Miguel Gonzalez twice in Cuba
and found him to be a loving, reliable father who wants his son
returned home, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision touched off a firestorm of protest in Miami, where
Cuban-American activists have made young Elian a cause celebre.
Chanting, flag-waving protestors took to the streets, vowing to
form a human chain around the Little Havana home of his
great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, they insisted, is not free to speak his true
feelings on the matter because he is controlled by Cuban dictator
Fidel Castro. Sending Elian back to Cuba would subject him to
harassment, scorn and a dismal future, protesters said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Miami-Dade County Family Court Judge Rosa
Rodriguez(cq) agreed that the risk of such treatment was real, and
granted temporary custody to Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez(cq). She also set a March 6 hearing on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts, however, were nearly unanimous in saying the
family court had no jurisdiction over an immigration case, the same
point made by Reno Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, news reports surfaced that Judge Rodriguez had
employed a spokesman for Elian's Miami family in her last political
campaign. The judge insisted she had no obligation to disclose the
matter, although some legal experts said she should have withdrawn
from the case to avoid the appearance of any impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   The matter now seems moot, as Elian's fate seems likely to be
decided in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   But the politics swirling around the case aren't likely to
disappear. Cuban-Americans in Congress have allied with
conservatives in proposing a special act granting Elian U.S.
citizenship, a move that would change his immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., has also issued a subpoena requesting
that Elian testify before a House committee, a ploy that Burton
admitted was aimed at keeping him in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's case has dominated the South Florida media for weeks,
with screaming headlines and breathless ``exclusive'' reports
breaking into normal programming. At one point television
helicopters hovered overhead, filming as the boy was whisked into a
car and taken home from his elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a mini-furor erupted when Miami television station
WPLG aired a tape of Elian playing in his yard. As a huge airplane
roars overhead, the boy jumps up and down and yells something about
going back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The station aired the tape, saying Elian apparently said he
wanted to go back to Cuba. That prompted a flood of angry telephone
calls and blistering criticism on Miami's ubiquitous Spanish talk
radio.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the station followed up by taking the tape onto
the streets of Miami and asking Spanish-speakers to view it. Half
those shown the report said Elian said he wanted to go home to
Cuba, but half thought the boy said just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, meanwhile, Elian's father hasn't been seen in several
days. He spoke with great emotion last week at a huge rally, saying
he will never go to Florida and that his son should be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, told reporters
Wednesday that the boy was kidnapped for the voyage to Florida and
that Elian's mother was tricked by her boyfriend into making the
journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my only daughter and my only grandson,'' she said,
arranging gifts around a Christmas tree she said she has kept ready
for Elian's return.

LABELING SHOULD BE ABOUT SHOW'S QUALITY, NOT RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ No midseason show is getting more buzz than
CBS's ``City of Angels,'' an ensemble hospital drama from Steven
Bochco that features a predominantly black cast. Bochco himself
calls it a ``black drama,'' even though he's never called ``NYPD
Blue'' a ``white drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochco is a master of market manipulation, so it's impossible
not to wonder if he's trying to deflect attention away from the
quality of the show by focusing on its racial makeup and its
significance as a sort of socio-political litmus test. (Early
consensus among critics gathered in Pasadena this week is that
``City of Angels'' isn't bad, but it's not great. At least not
yet.)
</P>
<P>
   Co-creator Paris Barclay, who is black, doesn't mind calling it
a black drama. ``You have to find a way to describe stuff,'' he
said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   So what's wrong with just calling it another drama? I don't
recall ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' _ a beautifully crafted
series _ being described as a ``black'' or ``ethnic'' drama.
Critics who adored the show usually called it a very good drama
with fine acting and spectacular writing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Warren, an alumnus of Bochco's ``Hill Street Blues'' and
one of the stars of ``City of Angels,'' differs with Bochco on
labeling the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately it's all about stories,'' he said. ``I think that
if you put white characters in some of the stories they've created,
you will have a white point of view, but if you create interesting
characters it really doesn't matter who plays them.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, though he sems to be blowing the trumpet the
loudest, Bochco admitted that he hopes ``we don't get buried under
the burden of our historical significance.'' Seems to me that
calling it something other than a ``black drama'' would help.
``City of Angels'' premieres Sunday night, then moves to its
regular slot, Wednesdays, on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   _It's hard to let go of a profitable franchise. Executives at
Fox are still hoping ``The X-Files'' will return for an eighth
season, even though creator Chris Carter has said he's treating
this season as the last and the show's stars, David Duchovny and
Gillian Anderson, have been saying they're ready to move on, even
though Anderson is under contract for one more year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd probably say it's no better than 50/50,'' Fox
Entertainment Group chairman Sandy Grushow said this week, ``but I
can tell you our agenda is to try to get this show to come back for
an eighth season.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether it might resurface without Duchovny, Grushow said,
``We're really not there yet. ... If, in fact, we get to a point
that it's clear that David Duchovny absolutely, categorically
refuses to do another season of this show, I think that decision is
really going to rest with Chris Carter. If Chris Carter believes he
can make an eighth season of `The X-Files' without David Duchovny _
we bet on Chris thus far, we'd keep betting on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Grushow said that, logistically speaking, push will come to
shove on the ``X-Files'' question in about a month. He said he
believes Carter ``in his heart wants to come back.'' As for
Duchovny, he said, ``Everything is a negotiation in our business,
so there's all kinds of posturing going on. One of two things is
probably true: Either David definitely doesn't want to come back
... or his representatives are saying he doesn't want to come back
so as to drive up his price for coming back. Welcome to our
world.''

VACATION? WITH KIDS? FORGET IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Didn't you people learn ANYTHING from Chevy Chase? How to cover
a bald spot, how to execute a pratfall, how to fail in increasingly
interesting ways? Most important, haven't you learned from him _
well, not from him, technically, but from his portrayal of Clark
Griswold _ not to take your kids on vacation?
</P>
<P>
   You've seen his ``Vacation'' movies, right? They are, after all,
the ultimate collection of similarly themed films within the Chase
oeuvre _ and wacky to boot. The Griswold family loads up the kids
and heads to a favorite vacation spot (or, in the case of
``Christmas Vacation,'' other relatives head to the Griswold
household), only to be beset by mishaps so wackily amusing as to be
considered highly wacky. Most people blame Chase/Griswold for the
unending mischance and misfortune endured by his family, but I know
otherwise: It's the kids' fault.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappiness follows when you bring the little missy/nipper on
vacation, no matter your good intentions. This is not a new
concept, so why don't you get it, people? How do I know? I have
just returned from a week in our nation's fine capital, wherein the
lovely Mrs. Hey Dad and I spent our evenings frolicking in a
no-child-attached euphoria. We ate at fine restaurants, drank
splendid adult beverages, even kissed under the fireworks at the
Washington Monument on New Year's Eve. Most gloriously, we slept
till noon.
</P>
<P>
   It was relaxing, invigorating, good for the ol' _ and I do mean
ol' _ marital state. But those poor, silly tourists I saw dragging
their tired, whining children about had only themselves to blame.
Walking near the Lincoln Memorial, I saw one father literally
carrying two boys by their respective arms as one scream-cried, the
other pleaded for salvation. ``BUT I DON'T WANNA SEE ANOTHER
STATUE, DAAADYYY!''
</P>
<P>
   Of COURSE the toddlers and teens were leading vacations of
not-so-quiet desperation. They were bored. You can't watch ``Dragon
Ball Z'' at the Lincoln Memorial. You will not catch 'em all at the
National Archives, no matter if you gotta. And just try to play
Quidditch at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. These are the things
little kids enjoy: fantasy, new worlds, television. Those, and
Disney World, because there you can ride rides, get ice cream, talk
to giant mice. Kids are excited about vacations only when they
think it's an ``adventure.'' My daughter had a blast spending a
week in the woods with her grandmother, playing in the creek and
chasing birds. Simple fun is all a kid wants on a getaway. A friend
tells a story about the couple who took their kids on vacation, and
the munchkins were thrilled until they found they were supposed to
leave the hotel, since all they wanted to do was swim and call room
service.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers, or ``apathetic brats'' as they're sometimes called,
aren't any better. Sure, they understand more; maybe they've even
heard of Abraham Lincoln from watching that weird ``Star Trek''
episode where he's floating in front of the ``Enterprise,'' but
they don't care. Create a vacation spot with a Limp Bizkit
Monument, and they'd be stoked.
</P>
<P>
   There is a preteen age that children reach when they have enough
knowledge to appreciate history or architecture or pretty lights or
whatever it is that your vacation spot offers, and they are old
enough not to complain if they have to leave the Holiday Inn pool
to go sightseeing. These are called ``9-year-olds.'' But even they
probably aren't getting out of the trip what you, in some deluded
state of parental hopefulness (''Honey, it will be GOOD for
them''), had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   I ran into a mother with her 9ish-year-old at the American
History Museum, as I was touring the exhibit on the first ladies.
(Yes, I'm a dork.) They came upon a picture of Eleanor Roosevelt.
The young lass studied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, she isn't like, TOTALLY ugly, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, honey. Somewhere between ugly and cute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right. Mom, I'm hungry. Is there a Burger King here?''

CONFEDERATE TRADITIONS HAUNT PRESIDENTIAL RACE IN SOUTH CAROLINA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, S.C. _ The Civil War is history, but ghosts of the
Old South can still haunt political campaigns, including the race
between George W. Bush and John McCain for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With the Feb. 19 South Carolina primary looming as a potentially
pivotal showdown between the Texas governor and the Arizona
senator, regional issues and traditions in this state _ including
the Confederate flag and historic plantations _ can take on a life
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolinians have been arguing for months, for example,
over whether the Confederate flag should continue to fly over the
state Capitol in Columbia alongside the state flag.
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning in New Hampshire, McCain sought to clarify his
position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he has made a number of conflicting statements about
the flag, which is embraced by conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he viewed the flag as a ``symbol of heritage'' but
recognized that South Carolinians would have to resolve the
emotional issues.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move for a politician who generally likes to speak
without using notes or props, McCain pulled out a paper and read
his formal position.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to how I view the flag I understand both sides,'' he said.
``Some view it as a symbol of slavery. Others view it as a symbol
of heritage. Personally I see the flag as a symbol of heritage. I
have ancestors who fought for the Confederacy, none of whom owned
slaves. I believe they fought admirably.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he had resorted to reading his position to avoid any
ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's gotten very Talmudic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refuses to take sides, even though he is greeted with the
flag question every time he comes to South Carolina. It happened
again Wednesday, and his answer remained the same:
</P>
<P>
   ``I view it (the flag question) as a local issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been preaching outreach to minority voters but has
been attracting mostly whites to recent campaign appearances, also
found himself defending his campaign's decision to hold a Tuesday
night rally at a South Carolina plantation, which once used slave
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Boone Hall, a sprawling plantation and popular tourist
attraction, is only a few miles from Charleston Harbor, where the
first shots in the Civil War were fired on Fort Sumter.
</P>
<P>
   An oyster roast hosted by Bush's South Carolina supporters
attracted several hundred people. It was held under a large white
tent erected near the main plantation house and only a few hundred
yards from a row of old slave quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boone Hall is a place where people hold public functions all
the time,'' Bush replied, when questioned about the plantation at a
news conference. He said he had been told that South Carolina's
Democratic governor had attended a function there on the previous
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shouldn't read into venue locations someone's heart,''
Bush added. ``I've got a lot of work to do in the minority
communities, and I recognize that, and I'm going to reach out to
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush received at least 40 percent of the Hispanic vote and a
significant share of the black vote during his 1998 re-election
race in Texas. He said he believed he would win votes in his
presidential campaign ``based upon public policy, and talking about
education and opportunity and economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was shouldered with a report that state Sen. Arthur
Ravenel of Charleston, a minor Bush supporter, had recently called
the NAACP ``the National Association of Retarded Persons.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights organization has threatened a tourist boycott
of South Carolina unless the rebel colors come down.
</P>
<P>
   Ravenel, who contributed $25 to Bush's re-election effort but
has no role in the governor's presidential campaign, said the
remark was a ``slip of the tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Ravenel's comments were ``unfortunate name-calling''
but said it would be up to the senator whether to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday in Wilmington, Del., Bush showcased his
``compassionate conservative'' credentials by touring the Ministry
of Caring, a non-profit, tax-exempt organization offering services
to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know oftentimes people with the word, Republican, by their
name are labeled, and I would like to break the label,'' he said in
a meeting with several caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters later that the label he was trying to break
was an assumption by many people that ``Republicans can't connect
or don't care about African-Americans or the downtrodden.''

BUSH RELUCTANT TO DIP TOE IN OVERHEATED WATERS OF LOCAL ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Governor George W. Bush has long
campaigned on ``welcoming new faces'' to the Republican party. But
after hosting a party at a renowned slavery-era plantation here
Tuesday night, Bush Wednesday found himself deluged with questions
about whether his sensitivity to racial issues has been
subordinated to his political needs.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign swing here, Bush again, as he has on previous
occasions, refused to take a stand on a blazing local topic:
whether the South Carolina Capitol should fly the Confederate flag.
His reticence on that score is largely shared by his leading rival,
Sen. John S. McCain. Neither wants to risk much political capital
in the name of a local controversy.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush found himself more deeply ensnared in South Carolina
racial politics Wednesday, as furor mounted over whether a state
senator and minor Bush contributor should apologize for insulting
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. On
Saturday, Senator Arthur Ravenel, a Charleston Republican, called
it the association of ``retarded people'' in remarks to a
``save-the-flag'' rally and then compounded the insult by
apologizing to the ``the retarded folks of the world for equating
them to the national NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark has prompted tremendous outcry among blacks in South
Carolina, but Bush simply called it ``unfortunate name-calling''
and refused further comment.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed no second thoughts at all about his campaign's
decision to hold an oyster roast at Boone Hall, a sprawling estate
eight miles north of Charleston. Asked whether choosing a former
slave plantation might offend some of the black voters he seeks to
recruit, Bush denied that the plantation venue had any symbolic
significance, calling it a ``place where people hold public
functions all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken individually, the incidents seemed unlikely to put much of
a dent in the Bush campaign, particularly as other GOP candidates
are alike wary of the issue, and because the states with early
contests _ including Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and
Michigan _ do not have large numbers of black Republican voters.
The plain-spoken McCain has, in particular, grown cautious in
speaking to the Confederate flag controversy. ``As to how I view
the flag, I understand both sides,'' the Arizona senator said
during a Dublin, N.H., appearance Wednesday. ``Some view it as a
symbol of slavery. Others view it as a symbol of heritage,'' which
is a phrase used by some white Republicans who want the flag to
continue flying over the South Carolina Statehouse. ``Personally, I
see the battle flag as a symbol of heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, was clearly agitated by the questions, with
their potential to smudge something he holds dear: his reputation
as a Texas governor of unusual sensitivity to minority concerns.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning news conference in West Columbia, Bush refused, as
he did in a debate in South Carolina last week, to weigh in on the
Confederate flag issue, saying simply: ``It is a local issue.''
When asked whether the state senator should apologize for his NAACP
remarks, Bush said: ``It'd be up to the senator to do that.'' Then
he cut off questioning, thanked reporters and left the podium.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Democratic National Committee urged Bush
to reject the endorsement of Representative Jay Dickey, Republican
of Arkansas, after he made racially controversial remarks about
black farmers. The DNC also said Bush should give back $25 Ravenel
donated to Bush's 1998 gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush says he wants to run a different kind of Republican
campaign, and reach out to voters who haven't traditionally
supported his party,'' the release said. ``He can prove his
sincerity by rejecting Dickey's endorsement and returning Ravenel's
campaign money.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, said Bush's views and actions should occasion
no dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is inappropriate at all for him to hold an
event at a slave plantation,'' Phyllis Berry Myers, executive
director of the Center for New Black Leadership, a black
conservative policy center in Washington. ``Slavery was a fact of
American life...and as we move into the 21st century there are
things I hope we would leave in the 20th century such as judging
people by their color and defining everything that happens in black
America according to race.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush sought to move past the questions by referring to his
record on economic issues and education. Those topics, he said, and
not his stance on debates over symbols like the Confederate flag,
will be the deciding factor in how minorities vote.
</P>
<P>
   He also went out of his way, during a campaign visit with the
heads of several charities in Wilmington, Delaware, to describe his
enthusiasm for bringing new voters into the Republican fold. The
party, he said, must ``welcome new faces and new voices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The party must reach out to people,'' he said. In his general
election in the governor's race in 1998, Bush won 49 percent of the
Hispanic vote and 27 percent of the black vote. He also said: ``I
believe my message, if people hear it, will encourage
African-Americans to vote in Republican primaries and for this
Republican candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on the decision to stage a campaign event at Boone
Plantation, Bush said the 319-year-old plantation, in Mount
Pleasant, is a popular tourist destination large enough to
accommodate his throngs of supporters. He also said that ``the
Democratic governor of South Carolina was at an event there the
night before.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Brook, an aide to South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges, said
the governor had never visited the plantation during the course of
his campaign or tenure in office.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden barrage of questions about race came as the Bush camp
was being buffeted by a controversy of another kind: the complaint
of a 23-year-old New Hampshire woman that the Bush campaign had
tried to recruit her to appear in a negative advertisement about
his opponent, Senator John S. McCain.
</P>
<P>
   According to Heidi Quigley, a senior at American International
College in Springfield, Mass., a Bush aide asked her to appear in
an ad comparing the two candidates' tax plans over the weekend. She
said she didn't have enough information to comment. The aide then
coached her, she alleged, encouraging her to say that McCain's plan
would keep taxpayer money on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at it, (Bush) is saying Forbes is doing a negative
commercial, but so is he by feeding me negative things about
McCain,'' Quigley told the Associate Press. ``I didn't feel
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McKinnon, head of Maverick Media in Austin, said Quigley
was one of 20 to 25 people interviewed recently in New Hampshire in
the Bush campaign's ongoing efforts to create fresh advertising
spots that address the evolving issues of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The interviewees ``all volunteered to do this _ to talk about
the Governor's tax plan, about McCain's tax plan, and about Forbes'
negative attacks,'' McKinnon said. ``We were simply doing due
diligence, preparing to respond to attacks Senator McCain has
already launched on his website'' and a Forbes TV ad launched last
week that accuses Bush of breaking a no-new-taxes pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the ad will not run, and repeated his vow not to run
negative ads. ``I am going to treat my friend and opponent with
respect, and he deserves to be treated with respect. He's a
buddy,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, communications director for McCain, said that
``taping a negative ad but promising not to run it is the high-tech
equivalent of smoking marijuana without inhaling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush was endorsed by two Republican US
senators, John Ashcroft of Missouri and Connie Mack of Florida.
That brings his number of senate endorsements to 33. Ashcroft, who
abandoned his own thoughts of a presidential bid last year,
introduced Bush with a rousing proclamation: ``We're far too young
to die. It's time again to fly and let this mighty eagle soar
again.''

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court struggled Wednesday with
arguments over whether Washington state's highest court made a
mistake last year when it ruled that parents there have a nearly
absolute right to restrict their children's access to anyone,
including grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Supreme Court ruled that parents can bar
grandparent visitation even when a neutral judge has determined
that such contact would be in the ``best interest'' of the
children.
</P>
<P>
   The state court's decision invalidated a Washington law that
allowed any person _ relative or non-relative _ to seek visitation
rights claiming they would be in the child's best
interest.Wednesday's highly-charged case has potentially
wide-ranging implications, not only for family life in general but
also for an emerging area of law that seeks to establish that
children have their own rights that may supersede those of their
parents. In hearing the arguments, several of the U.S. Supreme
Court justices appeared to lean toward giving parents the final say
in how their children are raised unless an outside party, such as a
grandparent or a court, could show that the children were being
harmed by the parents' decision.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted past rulings that gave
parents the right to decide how their youngsters would be brought
up and whom they were allowed to see.
</P>
<P>
   He added that reinstating the Washington law might result in
numerous court challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this mean next that a great aunt can come in and say, `I
want take the child to the movies every week because it's in the
best interest of the child to have a relationship with his great
aunt'?'' Rehnquist asked.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the law's reliance on the
phrase ``in the child's best interest'' made the statute
``breathtakingly broad'' and meant that ``anyone can march in and
seek visitation rights to any child.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia also voiced strong concerns about the
so-called ``best-interest'' standard. ``It would be in the best
interest of many children to take them away from their parents and
give them to someone else. But the parents have rights,'' he
said.Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg also
questioned the Washington law. But Breyer, along with Justice David
Souter, also said there is a ``special relationship'' between some
grandparents and grandchildren that should be taken into account in
law.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's case involves an effort by Jenifer and Gary Troxel
from Anacortes, Wash., to see their two granddaughters, Natalie,
10, and Isabelle, 8, on a regular basis. The Troxels' son, Brad,
who fathered the two girls but never married their mother,
committed suicide in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Troxels wanted to have the two girls visit twice a month,
but their mother, Tommie Granville Wynn, wanted to limit the visits
to once a month.Wynn had married a man with several children and
claimed that arranging a visit every two weeks with the
grandparents would be too complicated and time-consuming. Unable to
reach an agreement with Wynn, the Troxels sued in 1995.Later that
year a trial judge ruled in the Troxels' favor, but in a 5-4 vote
the state Supreme Court overturned his decision in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``A parent's constitutionally protected right to rear his or her
children without state interference has been recognized as a
fundamental liberty interest,'' the state court said in its ruling.
``Parents have a right to limit the visitation of their children
with other persons.'' But Mark Olson, a Seattle lawyer for the
Troxels, told the high court that granting the opportunity for
children to see their grandparents isn't a serious intrusion into
parents' constitutional right to family privacy, and that in some
states the right of grandparents to see their grandchildren is
protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court should balance all interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Catherine Smith, a Seattle lawyer for Wynn, argued that
courts should stay out of private family decisions. ``Courts should
not micro-manage families when no one is showing any harm to the
child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is one of the most closely watched of the term and has
prompted friend-of-the-court briefs from many organizations and
more than a dozen states.Among those groups siding with the Troxels
are the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the
National Conference of State Legislatures, National League of
Cities and U.S. Conference of Mayors. Wynn is supported by
organizations that span the ideological spectrum from the American
Civil Liberties Union and gay-rights groups to the Christian Legal
Society.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states have some kind of grandparent-visitation law. In
some states, courts can order visits for grandparents only if
parents are deceased, divorced or unmarried. Some state laws
require proof of a close relationship between children and
grandparents before visits can be ordered. Still others insist that
courts consider the effect of such visits on parent-child
relationships. All states require that judges must determine,
before they permit visits between children and their grandparents,
whether such visits are in the best interest of the child.Some 31
percent of Americans, about 60 million people, are grandparents.
They include Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia, Ginsburg, Justice Anthony
Kennedy and Justice John Paul Stevens. Justice Clarence Thomas was
raised by his grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   An AARP survey released last week found about one in nine
grandparents over the age of 50 helps care for at least one
grandchild. The survey said 8 percent provide day care regularly
and 3 percent function as parents, rearing a grandchild.

25% OF BAY STATE FAMILIES NOT EARNING ENOUGH: STUDY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With the nation entering the ninth year of an economic
boom, one in four Massachusetts families still do not earn enough
to pay for the rising costs of housing, child care, and health
care, according to a study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, sponsored by the Women's Educational and Industrial
Union, portrayed the federal government's ``poverty level'' _
$16,700 a year for a family of four _ as an outmoded measure of
what it takes to support a basic standard of living. WEIU's
``sufficiency'' incomes range from $15,888 a year for a single
adult living in Boston to nearly $43,000 for a Boston family with
one toddler and one child in school.
</P>
<P>
   When sufficiency incomes are applied across the state, WEIU said
there are 602,100 families _ about one-quarter of all Massachusetts
families _ that do not earn enough money.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are a striking counterpoint to the economic
expansion, which in February will become the longest in US history
and has bestowed vast riches on the top tier of wealthy Americans
who own businesses or invest in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this wonderful, buoyant Nasdaq economy, most of the gains
have gone to the top,'' said former labor Secretary Robert Reich.
The standard of living for typical wage earners, he said, ``is
actually going nowhere. The person smack in the middle hasn't seen
much change, and the people below that are struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the median income is 5 percent lower than a
decade ago, despite a sharp drop in the state's unemployment rate
that has put many low-income individuals, especially minorities,
into the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Reich said families who earn too much to qualify for public aid
but are below WEIU's ``sufficiency'' income are ``caught in the
gap.'' Statewide, while 9 percent of the population is in poverty,
fully 27 percent of all families are below the income standards set
by WEIU.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of WEIU's income standards for families said they are
biased toward families with very young children whose child-care
costs are much higher than for, say, a family with two teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   But the study's authors, Laura Henze Russell of the WEIU and
Jean Bacon, a professor of sociology at Williams College, believe
their ``self-sufficiency'' standard is a more accurate measure of
living costs than are federal poverty guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty level was determined roughly by estimating the cost
of feeding a family and multiplying it by three. It was established
in the 1960s, before women entered the work force in droves and
families began paying for child care. Moreover, housing and health
care costs have risen much faster than food, factors that make the
inflation-adjusted poverty standard obsolete, WEIU said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal poverty line ``dramatically underestimates how many
families are struggling,'' Reich said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors urged state and federal lawmakers to adopt the
self-sufficiency standards as a first step toward changing
policies, from taxes to adult education, that would help a broader
group of struggling working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend two-thirds of my income just on housing and food,''
said Maria Andrade of Dorchester, a single mother who is raising
three children, ages 5, 12, and 16, on her $30,000 annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   Policies that would help people like Andrade include tax relief
for working families, which is entering the political debate as the
candidates head into primary season. Republican candidates are
promising to slash taxes for all Americans, while President Clinton
this week proposed expanding the earned income tax credit for
working poor. Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley has
made poverty a central theme of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is doing more than most states to help low-wage
workers, the WEIU said. State lawmakers late last year raised in
the state's earned income tax credit to 15 percent of the federal
credit, up from 10 percent. State deductions for child and
dependent care, and the deduction for rent, also were raised.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the income levels looked at provide families with
only a ``bare-bones budget'' that does not include extra money for
savings, loan payments, or emergency funds.
</P>
<P>
   Across Massachusetts, the percent of families below the
self-sufficiency standard varied widely among cities and towns,
from 22 percent in Weymouth to 45 percent in Lawrence. Boston was
in the middle, with 34 percent under the standard.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors heavily influence how well a family is doing
financially: the number of children and the number of wage earners.
More children add huge expenses due to child-care costs. Bacon said
that a family with a second wage earner ``makes a big difference''
in improving a family's living standard.
</P>
<P>
   But expenses also rise dramatically for families with two
children or young children who require full-time day care. Over
three-fourths of children in Massachusetts are under 12 years of
age.
</P>
<P>
   WEIU's income standards vary widely by family size and by
geography: A single adult living in Boston needs $15,888 to live,
while earnings for a two-parent family with one preschool and one
school-age child living in Boston would need to be as high as
$42,564. The same four-member family living in Pittsfield would
need $35,100.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the ``average'' family pays $721 a month for housing,
$408 for taxes, $301 for child care and $276 for food.
</P>
<P>
   A single-parent family in Boston with two children _ one of
pre-school age and one of school age _ needs $39,156, while the
same family in Pittsfield needs $30,492.
</P>
<P>
   For a two-parent family with two teenagers, income requirements
drop dramatically when day care is no longer needed, to $27,720 in
Boston or $24,288 in Pittsfield, WEIU said.

   SCOTUS-POLICE (Washington) _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday
that flight at the mere sight of a police officer could often, in
the context of other factors, be such suspicious behavior as to
justify a stop-and-frisk search by police. Although all nine
justices agreed with that broadly stated view, the court split 5-4
on how to apply it to the facts of a Chicago case in which a man
bolted at the sight of a convoy of police cars. By Linda

   TURKEY-OCALAN (Ankara) _ Responding to European pressure and
hoping to end a civil conflict that has shaken this country for 15
years, Turkish leaders decided on Wednesday to postpone executing
the country's most prominent rebel leader until a European rights
court has heard the case. The prisoner, Abdullah Ocalan, who
directed a guerrilla war aimed at winning more rights for Turkey's
Kurdish minority, was convicted of treason in June and sentenced to
die. Wednesday's decision means that he will probably remain alive
for at least a year. The decision may accelerate Turkey's move
toward membership in the European Union, which has become a
transcendent national goal. European leaders have urged Turkey not
to execute Ocalan. By Stephen Kinzer.

in a letter to lawyers for the boy's relatives in Miami, Reno added

the economy, this year they seem relatively content. That leaves

POPE SCHEDULES TRIP TO THE HOLY LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ Pope John Paul II will end up juggling delicate
Middle East politics with visits to the wellsprings of his faith,
according to a schedule announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Making public the itinerary for the second papal visit to
Israel, the Vatican said John Paul would tour Israel's memorial to
victims of the Holocaust as well as churches and shrines holy to
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerary, which is being closely analyzed by Israelis and
Palestinians, also includes a visit to a Palestinian refugee camp,
and to Jordan. Palestinians have sought to use the trip, scheduled
for March 20 to 26, to promote their drive for an independent
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The trip also lists stops to sites holy to Judaism and Islam, as
well as meetings with meetings with Palestinian, Jordanian and
Israeli political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials stressed that the main purpose of the visit was
spiritual. It is, they said, a holy pilgrimage by the frail
79-year-old pontiff to the Holy Land, where Christianity was born
and where it began to develop.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Middle East, politics and religion are rarely far
apart. The visit to Jordan, Israel and Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem
may be a spiritual pilgrimage, but it will also be a political
balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian committee for the pope's visit has planned a
stop in the Dheisheh refugee camp near Bethlehem in the West Bank.
This seems to be an attempt to raise the issue of the plight of
Palestinians who fled or who were forced out of their homes in
Palestine during Israel's fight for independence.
</P>
<P>
   What to do about the refugees, whether to offer compensation or
to let some back to their old homes, now inside the Israeli state,
is one of the tougher issues in peace negotiations between Israel
and Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We organized his visit to Dheisheh to see first hand the
living conditions of the Palestinian refugees at the beginning of
the third millennium,'' said Emile Jarjoui, who heads the
Palestinian committee.
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrimage may be grueling for the pontiff, who suffers from
symptoms of Parkinson's disease and who has trouble walking. But he
will be accompanied by vehicle called the ``popemobile,'' to keep
him off his feet as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which established full diplomatic relations with the
Holy See in 1994, has said it welcomes the visit of someone whom it
views as a man of peace and a fighter of racism and anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's trip through the Jewish state will include official
meetings with President Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
the country's chief rabbis and a visit to Yad Vashem, the memorial
to victims of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also will arrange the pontiff's trips to holy sites in
the Galilee, Nazareth and Jerusalem. This will be an intricate
exercise in logistics and security.
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrimage could be physically grueling for the pontiff, who
suffers from symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and who has trouble
walking. But he will use the ``Popemobile,'' the vehicle screened
with bullet-proof glass, to keep him off his feet as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   In the alleys of Jerusalem's Old City, too narrow for the
Vatican vehicle, Israeli authorities are planning to test-drive a
smaller but equally comfortable limousine to take the pope around
securely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going to try to read into the trip what they want
from their point of view, but the program's focus is on a Christian
pilgrimage,'' said an Israeli government spokesman, Moshe Fogel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to do everything we can to make his trip a
success,'' Fogel said.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Israel and the Holy See were strained for
decades after the Jewish state was founded in 1948. Israel felt the
Holy See had not done enough to fight the Holocaust while the Roman
Catholic Church backed the internationalization of Jerusalem, and
later was unhappy with Israel's rule over the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993 paved the
way for full relations between the Holy See and Israel. John Paul's
visit will be the first since Pope Paul VI came in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   But in what might be a sign of Israeli uneasiness with some
details of the visit, Israel's Foreign Ministry expressed regret
Wednesday that John Paul would not be able to spend more time
studying the renewal of Jewish life in their holy land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of Israel is convinced that the pope, too,
regrets . . . he will be unable to dedicate more of his time to
study in depth the resurrection and renewal of the Jewish people in
the land of their forefathers,'' the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican said the pope would celebrate Masses in Bethlehem,
Nazareth and Jerusalem, the sites of Jesus' birth, boyhood and
death, and on the Mount of Beatitudes overlooking the Sea of
Galilee, where Jesus made his most celebrated sermons.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican representatives have tried to play down any political
significance to the pope's itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visit will be a spiritual pilgrimage; he is coming to the
Holy Land as a pilgrim, and any type of political explanation is
away from the essential meaning of the visit,'' said the Rev. Raed
Abu Salah, chancellor of the Latin Patriarchate, the Roman Catholic
Church in the Holy Land.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Aisle 3, the new chain that Filene's Basement is hoping will
revitalize the company, is off to a poor start, and one reason the
famous retailer is now operating in bankruptcy protection is its
gross mismanagement, a former top executive named Kathleen Mason
has charged in court filings.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who claims she's owed $1.2 million in severance, also
alleged that chief executive Sam Gerson wants to turn the publicly
traded retailer into a private company.
</P>
<P>
   Citing pending legal action, Filene's Basement spokeswoman Nancy
Sterling declined to make a point-by-point rebuttal, but said of
Mason: ``She is a disgruntled employee, and any allegations,
however outrageous, should be viewed in that context.''
</P>
<P>
   In US Bankruptcy Court filings, Filene's Basement asserted that
Mason's allegations were ``scurrilous'' and ``inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason was one of several executives who held the title of
president at Filene's Basement. Sterling confirmed that the
highest-ranking president, Jay Carothers, had also left the
company, though under friendlier circumstances. Other top
executives remain, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Mason were unsuccessful. A call to her
attorney was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Wellesley-based Filene's Basement Corp. sought
bankruptcy protection, citing cash-flow problems. Over the next few
months, it said it would close 35 stores and reduce its work force
by 1,300 jobs as it looked to save itself by becoming a
lean-and-mean chain with about 22 stores and 3,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who previously held a top job with TJX Cos., joined
Filene's Basement in the late spring as the company's top merchant,
with an annual base salary of $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months later, as it announced another round of
layoffs, Filene's Basement let Mason go on the grounds that a
smaller chain needed a smaller management team, Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   In court filings, Mason alleged that she was ``fraudulently
induced'' by Gerson to take a job at Filene's Basement.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mason, Gerson told her Filene's Basement was poised
for a dramatic turnaround, thanks to its new weekend-only warehouse
chain called Aisle 3 and a proposed retail Web site under the
direction of Gerson's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Filene's Basement had posted a profit only once in the
past five years, Mason, a 20-year veteran in the retail industry,
agreed to sign on with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Once on board, she concluded that Gerson had misrepresented the
condition of Filene's Basement and that Aisle 3 and the Internet
venture were ``failures,'' according to her court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the eight Aisle 3 stores have been open only for several
months. It may be premature to judge the chain as either a success
or a failure.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling declined to discuss sales results for Aisle 3.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mason, it was her reputation with vendors and the
retail financial community that made her valuable to Filene's
Basment; for a time, she claimed she was able to persuade reluctant
vendors to ship merchandise to the stores that they might have
otherwise withheld.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Mason claims to have argued
vehemently with Gerson against filing for Chapter 11, but Gerson
ignored her recommendations to pursue other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, she alleged: ``Gerson grossly mismanaged the
company and has a personal agenda to take control of the company by
taking it private, which is intended to benefit Gerson personally
rather than shareholders and creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason also questioned the competency of some other Filene's
Basement managers and alleged that one executive collected a
six-figure annual salary while taking no active part in the
management of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In its court filings, Filene's Basement described Mason as a
``disruptive'' and ``counterproductive'' employee.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, Sterling said Filene's Basement held auctions
Wednesday to dispose of some of the real estate sites where it has
closed stores. So far, the auctions have raised ``millions of
dollars'' that will be used for operating capital, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement has said previously that it hopes to emerge
from Chapter 11 sometime this summer.

 &HT;    Tortured hero faces double dose of `Evil'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deputy Inspector Dave Creegan has this little vertical scar on
his forehead, the result of an old gunshot wound. As you watch the
pressure build and build on him in ``Touching Evil,'' you keep
expecting that scar to start growing down his face, like a crack in
a cinder-block basement wall.
</P>
<P>
   He's that kind of guy, and it's that kind of show.
</P>
<P>
   American TV audiences first met Creegan in 1998, when PBS
imported the British series ``Touching Evil'' as part of its
``Mystery!'' series. Now Creegan and his Organized and Serial Crime
Unit are back for another round of three two-hour stories, doled
out an hour a week.
</P>
<P>
   Creegan (Robson Green) is a driven, obsessive loner, wracked
with guilt for what he has done and what he has failed to do. He's
probably not the jolliest guy to hang out at the pub with, but
definitely the sort you want tracking down psychopathic murderers.
(He makes ``The X-Files''' Fox Mulder look like Robin Williams.)
</P>
<P>
   In the first installment, which starts tonight and concludes
Jan. 20, Creegan has two psychos to contend with. The first one is
easy: a young man named Emerson who is prone to hippy-dippy
babbling about the expanding universe, and who has killed several
young women. Creegan and his crew nail Emerson fairly quickly and
lock him up, only to find that the murders are continuing, and that
Emerson appears to be directing an accomplice or copycat by proxy
from within his jail cell.
</P>
<P>
   As if Creegan needed more problems, his two assistants generally
just muck up the case. Susan Taylor has sex with the tabloid
reporter covering the murders, who may know more than he's telling.
And Mark Rivers is as unsteady as he is ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touching Evil'' takes place in a world of darkness, with light
provided by the cops' flashlights or streaming in from a single
window. It's a shadow universe, almost devoid of colors. The first
part lacks the creepy intensity of the 1998 debut _ where the
killer marked the boys' abduction spots with plastic daffodils _
and overall the series does not quite measure up to the best of
British police procedurals, such as ``Prime Suspect'' and
``Cracker.'' But it's still a worthy watchable for fans of the
genre.

 HIGH COURT BACKS U.S. LAW BARRING STATES FROM SELLING DATA ON
MOTORISTS
</HEADLINE>
   (With SCOTUS-POLICE; See also SAFIRE-COLUMN) 
 (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a federal law
that bars states from selling their databases of personal
information on licensed drivers and automobile owners.
</P>
<P>
   States had challenged the law in courts around the country, and
the unanimous decision was a rare federal victory in the ongoing
battle at the court over federal vs. state authority. Recent
decisions, including one Tuesday that states are immune from suits
under the federal law against age discrimination, have curbed
congressional authority and upheld state prerogatives in a variety
of contexts.
</P>
<P>
   States were earning millions of dollars a year by selling
drivers' personal information to direct marketers, charities,
political campaigns and various commercial interests until Congress
intervened in 1994 by passing the Drivers Privacy Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the information also fell into the hands of stalkers
or, in the case of abortion clinics, of people who wanted to track
down the identity of doctors and patients. The murder of an
actress, Rebecca Schaeffer, by a man who obtained her unlisted
address from California motor vehicle records helped spur passage
of the law, which generally requires states to safeguard the
privacy of personal information contained in the records of drivers
who have not consented to disclosure. There are exceptions in the
law for records needed for law enforcement, safety and certain
other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   While there were substantial privacy interests at stake in the
fate of the statute, which a federal appeals court had declared
unconstitutional in a suit brought by South Carolina, the Supreme
Court on Wednesday did not address either the policy behind the law
or the privacy issue in general.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's unusually brief nine-page
opinion was framed entirely in terms of federalism: whether
Congress had the constitutional authority to pass the law, and
whether the law infringed on state prerogatives.
</P>
<P>
   As to congressional authority, the chief justice said the law
fit comfortably within Congress' power to regulate interstate
commerce, because the information was ``an article of commerce'' in
the context of the statute and ``its sale or release into the
interstate stream of business is sufficient to support
congressional regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   As to state prerogatives, Rehnquist said the concerns that had
led the court recently to invalidate a provision of the Brady gun
control law and of a nuclear waste disposal law were simply
inapplicable. He said that unlike those statutes, which required
state officials to assist in federal law enforcement, and state
legislatures to deal with radioactive waste in particular ways, the
Drivers Privacy Protection Act was a straightforward federal
regulation of state activity that raised no federalism issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In effect, the court said the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
had made a category error in treating the driver privacy law as one
that raised states' rights concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The law ``does not require the states in their sovereign
capacity to regulate their own citizens,'' the chief justice said,
adding, ``It does not require the South Carolina legislature to
enact any laws or regulations, and it does not require state
officials to assist in the enforcement of federal statutes
regulating private individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the law simply ``regulates the states as the owners of
databases,'' a permissible federal role.
</P>
<P>
   When the case was argued in November, several justices expressed
their concern to Attorney General Charlie Condon of South Carolina
that under the state's theory, states could not be required to
adhere to federal food and drug laws or other garden-variety
federal regulations. Even in its tilt toward the states in its
recent series of federalism decisions, the court has not gone that
far.
</P>
<P>
   The court's view of the case, Reno vs. Condon, No. 98-1464,
permitted it to avoid confronting the most provocative aspect of
the 4th Circuit's 1998 ruling, that the federal government could
regulate the states only by means of ``generally applicable'' laws.
Since only states issue drivers' licenses, the law impermissibly
singled out the states for regulation, the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said that because the law also regulated use of the
information by ``private resellers or redisclosers,'' it was in
fact a generally applicable law, and there was no reason to rule on
the validity of the appeals court's approach. To this degree,
Wednesday's decision did not so much resolve an important
federalism issue as defer the debate to another day.
</P>
<P>
   States were not the only ones to object to the Drivers Privacy
Protection Act. A brief filed on South Carolina's behalf by the
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the American
Society of Newspaper Editors told the court the law ignored the
broad public interest in access to information that is a ``basic
tool for reporting.'' For example, the brief said, The Miami Herald
used drivers' records in 1991 to disclose that 70,000 people in
south Florida had been caught driving with suspended licenses.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the Feminist Majority Foundation, which filed
a brief in support of the law on behalf of abortion clinics and
victims of domestic violence, said the decision was an important
victory. Eleanor Smeal, the group's president, said the decision
``will save the lives of both abortion providers and women targeted
by stalkers.''

PAY FOR TEACHERS LAGS BEHIND OTHER PROFESSIONALS, REPORT FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Conn., La., Mont.,   N.J.)  (jw) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when the nation is embarking on a decade-long quest to
hire 2 million teachers, teachers' pay continues to lag far behind
that of other college-educated professionals _ by an average of
nearly $8,000 a year at the start of their careers, and by almost
$24,000 a year by the time they reach 50, a report released
Wednesday by the journal Education Week said.
</P>
<P>
   The report found the salary gap to be greatest when teachers
with master's degrees, ages 44 to 50, were compared with other
professionals of the same age and with the same level of education.
The difference in pay in that category was $32,511 annually, with
teachers earning $43,313 a year, compared with $75,824 for other
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the journal's researchers, using previously
unpublished census data, determined that the average salaries for
master's-degree recipients outside of teaching increased $17,505
from 1994 to 1998, while the average salary of teachers with
master's degrees rose by less than $200.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the report, Bob Chase, a former Connecticut
middle school teacher who is the president of the National
Education Association, said: ``For all of the discussions about
schools' adopting efficient business practices as a means of
reform, why should people believe the laws of supply and demand end
at the schoolhouse door?''
</P>
<P>
   The report documented numerous other shortcomings in schools'
efforts to recruit and retain teachers, especially those of the
highest quality.
</P>
<P>
   Though the editors found that 39 states required prospective
teachers to pass a basic skills test ``to ensure that they are at
least literate,'' 36 of those states have allowed some teachers who
have failed such tests to be hired anyway. Only nine states require
middle school teachers to pass tests in the subjects they teach,
with the rest permitting middle school teachers to teach after
obtaining broad elementary school certificates.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they set standards for who can enter the profession on
the front end,'' the editors wrote, ``most keep the door cracked
open on the back end.''
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the classroom, teachers are unlikely to get the
training they need, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Only 19 states require that districts offer orientation programs
for beginning teachers, and of those only 10 states provide some
money to help defray the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But those looking to understand districts' difficulty in
persuading the best qualified to teach need look no further than
the more alluring salaries of other professions.
</P>
<P>
   The gap is largest in Louisiana, where college graduates with at
least a bachelor's degree earned, on average in 1998, almost double
the salary of teachers: $52,379 compared with $28,266, the report
says. In Montana, where the disparity is the slimmest, the average
teacher earns $31,772, compared with $34,971 for other college
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   In the metropolitan New York region, the figures were as
follows: in Connecticut, the average teacher earned $39,268,
compared with $46,397 in other professions; in New Jersey, the
average teacher's salary was $37,989, compared with $48,635 &UR; ; &LR;  and
in New York, the average teacher earns $38,476, compared with other
college graduates who earn $48,827.
</P>
<P>
   The national average, for those who hold at least a bachelor's
degree, is $35,048 for teachers, compared with $49,362 for other
professionals.

ACCUSED KILLER MAY LEAVE HOME TO HELP IN DEFENSE CASE, JUDGE SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A 21-year-old former college student who is accused of
killing a wig shop clerk will be allowed to leave his house under
certain conditions so he can help prepare his defense, a judge
ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came as Dror Haim Goldberg, who took off on a
globe-trotting backpacking trip before he was indicted, made his
first appearance in state District Judge Joan Campbell's court.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, a former University of Houston student, sat quietly in
court next to his father. He's free on $100,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   He must wear an electronic ankle monitor so authorities can
track his movements and is under ``house arrest'' until his trial
for the Nov. 27, 1998, stabbing death of Manuela Silverio.
</P>
<P>
   But defense attorney Dick DeGuerin asked Campbell to allow him
to approach her without the knowledge of prosecutors to get
permission for Goldberg to leave his house to help prepare the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell agreed, but Goldberg must still wear the ankle monitor.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin later said it was essential prosecutors not know about
his requests so they would not try to track his client, though it
wouldn't be too hard considering he's wearing a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecution is holding their cards very close and is
refusing to volunteer information about their case, and we don't
have to do it either,'' DeGuerin said. ``Just because he's on bond,
I don't want them to be able to find out what we're working on.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Chuck Rosenthal, who talked with DeGuerin about
discovery issues before the lawyers met with Campbell, said he had
no ``legal objection'' to DeGuerin's request.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said he would be ready for trial May 1, the date
Campbell picked Wednesday for jury selection to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Palmer, the daughter of Silverio, said she and her family
and their supporters would be ready too, though it would be like
going to their mother's funeral each day of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, wearing a small picture of her dead mother on her lapel,
sat behind Goldberg in court Wednesday and said ``it was very
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was (like) cold blood just running straight through your
body,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Silverio, 52, who worked at the wig shop for 23 years, was
stabbed to death at the business. The shop's owners, Roland
Ingrando, and wife, Roberta, survived their stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg was questioned by police shortly after Silverio's
death, but not arrested. Later, authorities said a license-plate
number taken down at the crime scene led investigators to a Lincoln
Navigator registered to a woman living with Goldberg's father, Dr.
Isaac Goldberg, a Houston obstetrician/gynecologist.
</P>
<P>
   Dror Goldberg, who lived a few blocks from the wig shop, was
also reportedly seen running from the location.
</P>
<P>
   But between the time he was questioned and the time he was
indicted for murder in February, Goldberg left the country for the
Middle East, and even his parents did not know where he was,
DeGuerin has said.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin said Goldberg didn't find out about the charge until he
called from Bangkok, Thailand, and spoke to his father after seeing
an ad in an internationally distributed newspaper asking him to
call home.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's father arranged for his son to fly from Bangkok to
Frankfurt, Germany, and then to Mexico City, where he would meet
him.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin has said the two planned to fly to Houston, and
Goldberg was to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, authorities arrested Goldberg in Frankfurt
preparing to board the plane for Mexico. He remained in a German
jail for months while his extradition to the United States was
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   He was brought back to Houston by U.S. marshals Dec. 17 and
turned over to local authorities. Campbell ordered him to surrender
his passport.

IRAQ AGREES TO INSPECTIONS FROM ATOMIC AGENCY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Sweden)   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq said Wednesday that it would allow
inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit the
country next week to check its uranium stockpiles, ending a
monthlong standoff between the agency and the government of
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The inspections, however limited, will be the first by any
outside agency concerned with clandestine weapons programs to take
place in Iraq since December 1998, when inspectors from the atomic
agency were withdrawn in advance of American and British bombing
raids, along with U.N. inspectors who monitored biological,
chemical and missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   The new inspections are not related, however, to the monitoring
systems imposed on Iraq after the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf.
Next week's inspections are related solely to the 1968 nuclear
nonproliferation treaty, which Iraq signed and which demands annual
inspections of materials that could be used to make nuclear
weapons. Iraq has 1.8 tons of low-enriched uranium and 13 tons of
natural uranium. Both could be transformed into bomb-grade material
with the right equipment.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing visas to the IAEA inspectors, Iraq had put itself in
violation of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq's decision Wednesday to give a green light to the team
is not totally unrelated to efforts here to resume other U.N. arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to name a
chief arms inspector for the new monitoring commission created in
December by the Security Council to replace Unscom _ the U.N.
Special Commission _ which had been unable to return to Iraq after
the American-led bombing. Its executive chairman, Richard Butler,
resigned last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, which has been consulting with Annan as he
makes his choice, has yet to agree on a nominee. Several lists of
candidates have come and gone, and sometimes come again, as one
nation or another rejects them. In recent days, the leading
compromise candidate has become Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish diplomat
and arms control expert who created Unscom in 1991 and led it until
1996. Ekeus, now Sweden's ambassador to the United States, has
remained in touch with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, with
whom he worked when she was the American representative here.
</P>
<P>
   Annan is likely to name the new chief inspector on Friday,
officials and diplomats say. The deadline set by the Security
Council is Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As the new inspection system begins to take shape, Iraq is
finding little diplomatic support in its threats to defy
monitoring. Although Russia, China, France and Malaysia abstained
in the voting for the new surveillance and disarmament panel, to be
known as the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission, neither Russia nor China was prepared to veto the plan,
as the Iraqis had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Russians have been very active in
persuading the Iraqis to end their defiance of the atomic energy
agency, a senior European diplomat said. Furthermore, on a visit to
China this week, Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
apparently did not receive much encouragement as a long diplomatic
battle to force Iraqi compliance with new inspections begins.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Malaysia, a nonpermanent Security Council member
with a reputation for voting against the United States, Aziz was
more or less told to get in line with the program, although the
government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said it understood
some of Iraq's grievances.

COMMISSION PROPOSES CREATION OF A EUROPEAN FOOD SAFETY AGENCY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the wake of repeated food scandals on this continent,
the European Commission Wednesday proposed the creation of a food
safety agency for all member countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal fell far short of what some consumer groups had
hoped for, since it envisioned a rather small advisory body of
scientists, not a powerful independent regulator like the Food and
Drug Administration in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference in Brussels introducing the plan, David
Byrne, the European Union Commissioner for health and consumer
affairs, became more and more defensive as reporters repeatedly
asked him versions of the same question: If the proposed body has
no power to inspect food, seize tainted shipments, punish violators
or propose rules, how effective can it be?
</P>
<P>
   Byrne responded that politicians who, he said, ``are answerable
to the people,'' should be the ones charged with enforcing food
safety, while scientists ``should stick to the lab.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts interviewed later said that existing European
treaties make it legally impossible to create a strong central
regulator and that lingering nationalism, especially about food,
makes it politically unthinkable. For now, they said,
responsibility for clean, safe food will remain with the same
flawed national agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 countries in the European Union are collectively the
world's largest importers and exporters of food. In the last few
years, successive scandals have terrified and disgusted consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or ``mad cow disease,'' struck
first in Britain, forcing the slaughter of more than 4 million cows
by 1998. The French still ban the import of British beef, making
the issue the single touchiest point in relations between the two
countries. The disease has also been found in cows in France and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, motor oil contaminated with carcinogenic dioxin was
found in animal feed in Belgium. Sewage sludge was found to have
been deliberately added to animal feed in France.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the European Commission's new policy document
Wednesday, Byrne called for a ``major structural change in our
system of food safety'' to restore the public's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shopping cart is one of the most potent weapons on
earth,'' he said, and pointed out that lost confidence hurts
farmers, grocers and even national reputations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, Europe has ``one of the best
food-safety systems in the world.'' The document he put forth would
essentially leave that system in place while adding a layer of
European Union scientists whose job would be to gather information,
assess risks and issue alerts.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Harrison, a public affairs officer at the Consumers'
Association of Great Britain, called the proposal ``a toothless
watchdog _ a talking shop that offers little prospect of real
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters at the news conference hammered at Byrne. One
journalist pointed out that when the policy document was proposed,
Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, mentioned
the FDA as a model. Another said that scientific advisory panels
had been ignored several times lately, including when France most
recently refused to accept British beef.
</P>
<P>
   No budget for the agency has been proposed. Byrne said he
envisioned its employees numbering ``in the hundreds.'' By
contrast, the Food and Drug Administration has 1,100 inspectors and
2,100 scientists, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has 7,530
meat and poultry inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Only 8 European Union member countries have independent agencies
like the FDA or are creating them. The others rely on local
inspectors or their national agriculture or health departments.
</P>
<P>
   However, because the agriculture departments exist to promote
farming and agribusiness, their inspectors are saddled with the
perception that they will be under pressure to ignore problems or
cover up a crisis. Consequently, some countries are moving to take
those duties away from their agricultural agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission already has a Food and Veterinary Office
in Dublin with about 90 inspectors. Their missions include
spot-checking imported American beef for growth hormones, which are
forbidden here, and responding to reports like the scandal over
dioxin in Belgium. The new policy document envisions strengthening
the office, Byrne said, but he did not explain how beyond saying
that it could be the ``policeman's policeman'' and audit other
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers' groups welcomed the plan's outlines for writing new
laws on 80 topics. They include creating a list of ingredients
permitted in animal feed and other rules for tracking animal
diseases and tracing food ``from plow to plate,'' in order to hold
producers liable.
</P>
<P>
   The policy document also proposed creating new standards for
labeling food with ingredients grown from genetically modified
seeds. On Monday, the Commission approved a rule requiring labels
on food that contains 1 percent or more genetically modified
soybean or corn, most of which presumably would be imported from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murray, the director of the European Consumers'
Organization, said of Byrne's report, ``The recipe is OK, but the
proof is in the cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray called it ``unrealistic'' to hope that any European Food
Authority would be as powerful as the FDA in the United States. In
Britain, he said, ``the idea that a European corps of inspectors
could come in and replace existing British inspectors ``is just not
a runner. Would they really accept a guy from a European agency who
happened to be French?''

HMO EXECUTIVES LOSE $1.3M IN `GOLDEN PARACHUTE' PACKAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts officials Wednesday stripped Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care's former chief executive and chief financial
officer of the $1.3 million in ``golden parachute'' severance pay
the two had negotiated when they abruptly left the troubled health
plan last May.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly said he terminated the
executives' contracts ``for cause,'' and added that it was related
to ``discrepancies that led to the receivership,'' referring to
last week's dramatic state takeover of Harvard Pilgrim to prevent
its financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly declined to say whether the state has discovered specinancial decisions that led to the decision to cancel Greenberg's
and Brophy's severance packages. However, one source in the
attorney general's office, who asked not to be named, said, ``We're
not done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance commissioner Linda Ruthardt, the court-appointed
receiver now overseeing Harvard Pilgrim, said her staff has not
``had time to do the forensic audits'' to determine if auditors
should have known earlier about the health plan's disastrous
condition. Such questions may ultimately involve legal liability on
the part of Harvard Pilgrim and its auditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now we honestly don't know,'' Ruthardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are likely to question Harvard Pilgrim's past
accounting decisions as they attempt to unravel the health plan's
current financial tangle. People familiar with the probe said they
have already begun inquiries into why it took so long to recognize
the depths of Harvard Pilgrim's problems.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators are expected to question health plan officials
as well as outside accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, which
audited Harvard Pilgrim's yearly financial statements, the
individuals said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials sidestepped questions about whether Harvard
Pilgrim executives should have known earlier what dire straits the
health plan was in _ or may have known. They also declined to
speculate if criminal liability might emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason to believe that the information we got last
Tuesday was less than timely and accurate,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt added: ``Of course we believe there was an error or we
it wouldn't be in receivership.'' But she said she couldn't answer
the question of prior knowledge by the HMO's executives or
accountants. ``So far we have no indication that's true,'' she
said. ``That's so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation of former Harvard Pilgrim executives' severance
pay appears to have been motivated by a judgment that such
compensation was inappropriate, versus a discovery of specific
management decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys ran the place into the ground and walk away with
millions,'' said one source in the attorney general's office.
``It's offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation of the severance packages will cost former
Harvard Pilgrim chief executive Allan I. Greenberg as much as $1.3
million and former financial chief Thomas J. Brophy up to $500,000.
The HMO had already paid Greenberg approximately $330,000 and
Brophy about $204,000 since they resigned, according to the AG's
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly also announced the resignation of Alan R. Morse, who was
Harvard Pilgrim's $175,000-a-year board chairman, retroactive to
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Greenberg, Brophy, and Morse were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg collected an annual salary of $565,000 from Harvard
Pilgrim, while Brophy was paid $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the HMO has not reported what its current CEO Charles
Baker is paid, sources say his salary is just below $500,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Reilly noted, his actions will save financially
stressed Harvard Pilgrim almost $2 million. That's about 2.5
percent of what the HMO currently owes one its largest creditors,
Partners HealthCare, according to Partners officials.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Heffron, a spokesman for Reilly, said Ruthardt has broad
authority as Harvard Pilgrim's receiver to manage the company,
including termination of ongoing contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a provision in the severance contracts that says
they can be terminated `for cause,' '' Heffron said.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed on what he meant by ``for cause,'' Reilly turned to
J. David Leslie, a specialist in ailing insurance companies who has
been named special assistant attorney general for the Harvard
Pilgrim case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard Pilgrim reported surprising numbers last Monday
evening and Tuesday due to deficiencies in financial accounting
systems of long standing,'' Leslie said. ``Those deficiencies
should not have occurred. Therefore,'' Greenberg and Brophy
``merited termination for cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``surprising numbers'' Leslie referred to, which
precipitated the receivership, was the revelation that the HMO lost
as much as $177 million last year _ $58.5 million more than
projected.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they had decided not to release Harvard
Pilgrim's current cash-flow numbers, as they had promised earlier
this week. ``It's a constantly changing situation,'' Reilly said.
``Today's numbers looked more favorable than yesterday's.''
</P>
<P>
   He said reports on the HMO's cash and on its leading creditors
would be released at some unspecified time.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt said she signed $5 million in payment checks to
hospitals and other health providers Wednesday.

ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN CHINA IMPERILED BY ARREST, SCHOLARS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Pa., Mass., Australia, Britain, Calif.)  (jw) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The arrest here of a Pennsylvania-based Chinese
researcher as he collected historical documents from the Maoist era
has caused an uproar among Western scholars, who say it imperils
academic research and exchanges with China.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, more than 90 China scholars, including many leading
experts from American, Australian and British universities,
released a letter to President Jiang Zemin calling for the
immediate release of the researcher, Yongyi Song.
</P>
<P>
   The letter warns that Song's arrest _ on vague charges of
providing confidential information to foreigners _ could undermine
the academic exchanges that China has fostered over the last two
decades as it sought to modernize and end its former isolation.
Each year, thousands of Chinese students and professors study
abroad while smaller numbers of Western experts visit China to
study its history, politics and society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continued prosecution of this case will make it impossible for
foreign scholars or Chinese scholars associated with foreign
universities to conduct research in open sources in China with the
confidence that they will be safe from criminal prosecution,'' says
the letter, which was faxed to the Chinese Embassy in Washington on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the signers, Michel Oksenberg, a political scientist at
Stanford University and a former senior White House adviser on
China policy, said in an interview that by arresting an academic
researcher who was apparently seeking materials already in the
public domain, China might have violated the basic principles on
which the scholarly exchanges were based.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a sponsor and adviser of students who wish to do research
in China,'' Oksenberg said, ``I have some responsibility to ensure
that their research will not place them, or those in China who
assist them, at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Song, 50, is a researcher and librarian at Dickinson College in
Carlisle, Pa., and an authority on the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution,
when China was in turmoil and largely closed to outsiders. Song has
written a book and numerous articles in Chinese, but is best known
for his exhaustive bibliographic work on that chaotic decade.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer _ as he often had before _ he visited China to
collect materials from the period, including newspapers of the
radical young Red Guards, old books and mimeographed records that
lurk in second-hand book stores, street markets and private
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Many Western and Chinese scholars, including Chinese graduate
students at American universities, routinely engage in the same
kind of historical treasure hunt here.
</P>
<P>
   But on Aug. 7, Song _ a Chinese man who was on the verge of
becoming an American citizen _ was detained by security forces in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   After months of interrogations, on Dec. 24 he was charged with
``the purchase and illegal provision of intelligence to
foreigners.'' The charge is less severe than that for divulging
``state secrets,'' but depending on how the courts define the
gravity of his offense, Song could receive anything from a light
sentence to more than 10 years in prison. No trial date has been
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities have not revealed which of his activities
triggered the arrest. Song's wife, Helen Yao, a jewelry designer
who was detained along with her husband and held for more than two
months, said in a recent interview that when security officers
asked him about particular government documents he had acquired, he
argued that each had formerly been published in public sources.
</P>
<P>
   Roderick MacFarcquhar, a Harvard professor and author of a
multi-volume history of the origins of the Cultural Revolution,
said that the prosecution of Song would create two classes of China
scholars abroad: ``Westerners who can come and go with relative
freedom, and current or former Chinese citizens who will have to
tread very carefully for fear of being arrested or at least having
their relatives harassed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most affected will be Chinese scholars who live and work
in China, who fear that their already limited ability to pursue
historical evidence may be reduced even further. One historian in
Beijing said that he and his colleagues feared that collaborative
research with foreigners might become more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The international group of scholars, organized by David Strand,
a historian of China at Dickinson, also sent a copy of Wednesday's
letter to President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in the hope that the administration would step up efforts
on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the American Embassy in Beijing said Wednesday
that senior embassy officials had ``brought up the matter of Yongyi
Song several times'' with the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   A subject of endless fascination for historians, the Cultural
Revolution remains among China's most politically sensitive topics,
and accounts published here are carefully censored in an effort to
protect the legitimacy of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mao's banner of continuing revolution, millions of people
were persecuted, imprisoned or killed, schooling came to a halt and
the economy was nearly destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   After Mao's death in 1976, his successors declared the Cultural
Revolution to have been a disastrous mistake and said that Mao had
erred under the baleful influence of a small group of leaders,
including the ``Gang of Four.'' But Mao's achievements greatly
outweighed his missteps, the official line declared, and his memory
as the heroic father of the People's Republic has been carefully
nurtured ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Many key documents from the Cultural Revolution remain in closed
archives, including Beijing directives that may implicate Mao or
other leaders like the revered Prime Minister Zhou Enlai in vicious
purges or other misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   But during the early years of the Cultural Revolution in
particular, competing factions of Red Guards, fanatical young
Maoists, often published leaders' speeches and other documents in
newspapers or other documents. Such materials have been avidly
collected by scholars and libraries, largely without trouble up to
now.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, as word spread about the criminal charges
against Song, members of Congress and the State Department have
expressed concern and China scholars have been up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of its unpredictability and the absence of clearly
stated rules,'' said Thomas P. Bernstein, an expert on Chinese
politics at Columbia University, the case was dangerous from the
point of view of anyone doing research on contemporary China.
</P>
<P>
   Strand, the historian and colleague of Song's at Dickinson, said
Wednesday, ``This case strikes at every aspect of the work we do,
both practical and ethical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I think of Song in his jail cell,'' he said.

SNOWLESS NEW HAMPSHIRE JUST ISN'T THE SAME OLD HUSTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ A television network correspondent recently
called the campaign of George W. Bush with an unusual request: ``I
need a snowy backdrop. Otherwise, no one will believe I'm in New
Hampshire. Where can I go?''
</P>
<P>
   Oftentimes this winter, the answer has been: Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   There is something missing this year from the storied New
Hampshire primary tradition. Though Thursday's predicted snowfall
could remedy conditions a bit, much of the state _ especially where
the candidates travel in the southern tier _ has had no snow and
barely any ice. Campaign planners can't even consider the usual
``photo-ops'' of ice-fishing, snowmobiling and snowplow driving.
The only snow in the state is a modest amount ``north of the
notches,'' where candidates rarely travel.
</P>
<P>
   This is the talk of the state. Snow is as much as a part of the
New Hampshire primary as a no-tax pledge, often playing a
significant role in the outcome of the race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, when Edmund Muskie appeared in a storm outside the
Manchester Union Leader to denounce the newspaper, some observers
thought the melting snow on his face was tears, and his campaign
was over. In 1952, Estes Kefauver traveled around New Hampshire on
a dog sled and won the primary. In 1984, Vice President Walter
Mondale showed his Minnesotan mettle by ice-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, no one is snowbound. Discussions of thermal
underwear, normally a hot topic, get about as much mention as
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, Concord had gone 303 days without measurable
snowfall, according to the National Weather Service. The state
capital normally has 24 inches of snow by this time, but it has had
just a trace all winter, the lowest amount in 100 years of
record-keeping. Snow-lovers are hoping for some snowfall in the
southern fringe, but a National Weather Service forecaster
Wednesday said the amount probably would be ``very light.''
</P>
<P>
   It all seems like another sign that New Hampshire this year is
different than in past primaries. The economically booming state,
bursting with new high-tech employers and workers, is far less
hide-bound and traditional than its ``Live Free or Die'' slogan
suggests. But snow-free?
</P>
<P>
   When Senator John McCain arrived here earlier this week, the
temperature clock in downtown Concord read 45 degrees. ``I just got
here from Michigan,'' he said, as if talking to a crowd of
Floridians. ``It was cold!'''
</P>
<P>
   Grizzled campaign veterans, who usually can be counted on to
moan through dinner at Bedford's Wayfarer Inn about the lousy
weather, instead are marveling about the lack of it. Meanwhile, the
state is awash in a surplus of unused cliches, such as the one
about candidates ``tromping through the snows of New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently spent considerable time with an aide picking out
what he considered the perfect winter coat, a tan Timberland ski
jacket. But he has barely worn it, nor has he slipped on his new
snow boots. His pointy Texas cowboy boots have hardly lost their
buff.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush visits Laconia Thursday, he is likely to see a most
unusual sight. Lake Winnipesaukee is almost ice-free. Normally, the
lake is dotted with ice-fishing shacks and four-wheel-drive trucks.
This year, in many parts of the lake, boating would be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lake is wide open,'' said Jeff Barr of Irwin Marine in
Laconia.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few political observers have suggested that someone
call Hollywod and put things right. Here is the way it should be:
The freshly plowed roads should be lined with snowbanks, the pine
boughs weighted with slowly melting snow that re-freezes by night.
The skies should turn leaden and then, with an hours-long heave,
unleash a snowstorm that sends reporters and candidates scurrying
to their toasty hotel rooms. After the storm clears, the ice
crystals should glisten under a bluer-than-blue sky. Snow-mantled
mountains, iced-over ponds _ that is what New Hampshire winter is
really all about. For true winter mavens, the candidates are just
another part of the backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Only one candidate seems to make an issue of the weather. Vice
President Al Gore, the author of ``Earth in the Balance'' and a
longtime believer in the theory of global warming, frequently poses
this question at town meetings: ``Does anybody here think the
weather had been weird lately?''
</P>
<P>
   Often, every hand shoots up.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said the warm weather has given
Gore credibility on global warming. ``People do talk about their
concerns that New Hampshire's environment might be affected by
this,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the primary-conscious citizens of New Hampshire are
spending a lot of time opining about the issues, from the
intricacies of Medicare benefits to the various tax plans. Still,
talk of the weather dominates. New Hampshire Secretary of State
Bill Gardner, a longtime observer of presidential campaigns, can't
quite believe when he looks out his window that the primary is
about to take place. Last Saturday, he raked his leaves when he is
usually shoveling snow.
</P>
<P>
   Former Governor Hugh Gregg, who dispenses political trading
cards that show Mondale ice fishing and Kefauver dog sledding,
noted sadly that ``some of the best photo-ops are missing.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this recently led Ski NH, a ski area association, to
announce that it would demonstrate its snow-making capabilities on
the statehouse lawn. But Wednesday, a Ski NH spokesman said the
event has been canceled because the ski areas want to use the
machines to supplement what they say is the ample manmade white
stuff already on many slopes.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that Thursday the legislature plans to act on a
resolution applauding the snow-making industry for its ability to
do what Mother Nature has not. In this wildly unusual winter, the
measure is likely to pass without objection.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ After capturing a big share of the American market for
small and midsized cars in the 1980s, Japanese automakers set their
sights a decade ago on Cadillac and Lincoln, which had dominated
the American luxury market since the 1930s. Detroit watched and
worried.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac and Lincoln, respectively the luxury divisions of
General Motors and Ford, held their lead through most of the 1990s
_ until last year, when they were passed by not one but two other
carmakers, with a third close on their bumper.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only one of the upstarts _ Lexus, the luxury division of
Toyota Motor Corp. _ was Japanese, and it took second place.
Roaring by the entire field was Mercedes-Benz, which took first
place, while BMW, whose sales were once tiny, pulled nearly even
with Cadillac and Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Outsold 3-1 by American luxury-car brands as recently as 1991,
European-brand luxury cars as a group managed for the first time
last year to accomplish what once seemed impossible: beating
American luxury brands in sales in their home market. Honda's Acura
and Nissan Motor's Infiniti have been also-rans and even Lexus has
been losing ground to the Europeans, especially the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most optimistic European executives had not anticipated
seizing the lead from Cadillac and Lincoln. ``We were surprised,''
said Juergen Hubbert, the DaimlerChrysler AG management board
member who runs Mercedes. ``It was not our target to become number
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Having spent much of the last decade casting nervous glances
across the Pacific, American executives at the North American
International Auto Show here this week are looking warily at the
appeal of cars coming across the Atlantic instead. ``It's not cheap
but it's very fine product and we need to learn from it,'' said
Harry Pearce, the vice chairman of GM, which said on Monday that it
would buy the half of Sweden's Saab that it did not already own.
</P>
<P>
   There is rare unanimity here about how the Europeans surged into
first place. They have the strongest brands, at a time when a
rising stock market and vibrant economy have meant that money is
little object for many buyers. Even so, the Europeans have aimed
many new models to appeal to the so-called entry-level luxury
market that features base model prices of $24,000 to $32,000. And
Americans simply think the latest European models look and drive
better than anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for, quite frankly, more European
proportions,'' said Richard Parry-Jones, Ford's group vice
president for vehicle development.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans focused on driving performance and fresh, crisply
lined models at a time when their American and Japanese rivals were
still producing cautious variations of designs that had done well
in the 1980s. Models like the BMW 3- and 5-series, the Audi TT, the
Jaguar S-Type and the Mercedes E-Class have grabbed the public's
attention in a way that models like the Cadillac Catera, Chrysler
LHS and Lexus ES300 have not.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, European manufacturers have been able to keep
their brand images unusually clear. BMW has been able to associate
its name with driving performance, something that younger drivers
especially value. Volvo Cars, the Swedish manufacturer Ford bought
last year, has coupled its name with safety. Jaguar of Britain,
another Ford subsidiary, is known for elegance, and Mercedes for
square-shouldered reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for European cars is coming from the customers that
automakers covet most: successful young professionals like Joseph
Coviello, a 35-year-old financial adviser in Newark, Del., and his
wife, Karen. Coviello has just bought a BMW M3 convertible; he
owned an M3 sedan before it. Karen Coviello drove a Jeep Grand
Cherokee until two years ago, when the Jeep rolled over and its
roof caved in. She now drives a BMW, too, a 5-series wagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like, in no particular order, the style, performance, safety
and reputation,'' Coviello said. ``The BMW literally handles like a
sports car, and if you've not driven one, you can't understand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The European ascendance in luxury cars has come at an especially
disappointing time for American and Japanese luxury car executives.
A decade ago, experts had thought millions of increasingly
prosperous baby boomers would want a little more pampering, and
would migrate to entry-level luxury cars that were just a little
more expensive than their Honda Accords, Toyota Camrys and Ford
Tauruses. Instead, affluent middle-aged buyers snapped up sport
utility vehicles during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Cars' share of the luxury market plummeted from 95 percent in
1990 to just 44 percent in 1996, as automakers introduced new
models like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and GMC Yukon; their share has
now leveled off at about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Holding a shrinking share of a stagnant market segment has been
a new and unpleasant experience for Japanese automakers in
particular. ``I don't think the growth has been there that we
anticipated in that segment of the market,'' said Richard Colliver,
Honda's executive vice president for North American Honda and Acura
sales.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The luxury car market is now starting to expand, however.
Americans seem to be falling in love again with the fine handling
and easy access that exquisitely engineered cars can provide.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, manufacturers' plans for sport utility
vehicles are being crimped by rising gasoline prices and growing
regulatory pressures to reduce the big vehicles' emissions, improve
their fuel economy and make them less deadly to other motorists
during crashes. DaimlerChrysler executives cited all these issues,
particularly the uncertainty about future regulations, in saying
this week that they had canceled their well-advanced preparations
to introduce a giant Jeep that would have cost more than $50,000
and would have competed against the Ford Excursion and Chevrolet
Suburban.

 DETROIT: Chevrolet Suburban. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To reclaim the luxury car market, American designers are setting
aside their pride and emulating German automotive fashions.
Japanese designers, who have long copied German approaches to the
luxury market, have begun producing cars that are even closer to
the originals.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the luxury car market's growth in recent years has
been in the entry-level segment, so manufacturers have focused
their efforts there. Ford has had an instant hit ever since it
introduced the $31,475 Lincoln LS last autumn, which looks and
drives a lot like a BMW 5-series but is $10,000 cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese luxury sedans being introduced at auto shows this year
reflect very similar influences. The sporty, new Lexus IS300 has a
compact but powerful 3-liter, V6 engine that produces 215
horsepower, putting it in the same league as German engines, while
the new Acura 3.2CL Type S sedan manages 260-horsepower from a
slightly larger engine. Japanese auto executives expect both to be
priced about the same as the Lincoln LS.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Toyota is so confident that the entry-level luxury car
market will expand that it plans to keep selling its Lexus ES300
after the almost identically priced IS300 goes on the market in
July. Selling similar cars for similar prices in the same showrooms
is usually considered a marketing mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryan Bergsteinsson, the group vice president and general
manager of Toyota's Lexus division in North America, said that the
rear-wheel-drive IS300 was slightly smaller and intended for
customers in their 30s who might not want the front-wheel-drive
ES300, for which the average age is 51. ``If you see them on the
showroom floor, you'll see the difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sales of entry-level luxury cars are also growing because
traditional luxury car manufacturers have been most aggressive
lately in expanding the bottom of their price ranges. Mercedes has
been very successful with its C-class sedans, which cost $30,000 to
$35,000, and plans to introduce a completely redesigned but
similarly priced model this autumn. Jaguar has already increased
sales sharply with the $43,000 S-Type.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers are also looking for ways to build luxury cars that
look a bit like sport utility vehicles on the outside _ a high
roof, high front end and all-wheel drive _ but retain the driving
performance and interior comforts of a car.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known example of such a so-called sport wagon or
car-based sport utility is the Lexus RX300, essentially a luxury
wagon version of a Toyota Camry but with a taller suspension and
all-wheel drive. The BMW X5, which just went on sale last month and
is marketed as a ``sport activity vehicle,'' is another example.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday morning, Acura introduced a prototype here of its
answer to the RX-300; the final model, which will go on sale this
autumn, has not yet been named. Other automakers, including even
Porsche, are also working on luxury sport wagons.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers are experimenting with sport wagons partly because of
a belief that people now in their 20s may not want luxury sedans as
they grow older. ``What a lot of them are looking for is
distinctiveness _ they look at the current car, the box, as
boring,'' said Tom Orbe, the general manager of Infiniti, which
plans to introduce a competitor to the RX300 in the autumn of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But judging by some prototypes displayed here and, even more so,
at the recent Tokyo Motor Show, engineers working on the new sport
wagons must walk a fine line to avoid humdrum designs. ``A lot of
them just look like station wagons that they raised up a little,''
said Donald V. Esmond, Toyota's group vice president and general
manager for the Toyota brand in America.
</P>
<P>
   American automakers, including Cadillac and Lincoln, are also
working on similar vehicles. GM and Ford have been buying European
brands like Saab and Volvo with proven track records. And Ford
acquired Jaguar and Aston Martin in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes and BMW executives say they have little to fear from
their American rivals. ``I think that the American manufacturers
have concentrated in the last years on the sport utility vehicle
side of the market and they've probably paid too little attention
to the passenger car side,'' said Henrich Heitmann, BMW's
management board member for worldwide sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   American managers respond that given the high profits in the
sport utility vehicle market, such a strategy makes sense. Larry
Burns, GM's vice president for research, development and planning,
said that with some Chevrolet sport utilities selling for as much
as $35,000, traditional definitions of luxury brands are breaking
down.
</P>
<P>
   But such views mask an underlying concern that the Europeans are
moving ahead. Ford even went so far last year as to hire BMW's star
executive, Wolfgang Reitzle, to take charge of all its luxury
divisions: Lincoln, Volvo, Jaguar and Aston Martin. Reitzle said
that his goal was to fill the garages of affluent families with a
variety of vehicles, everything from Lincoln Navigator sport
utility vehicles to Jaguar sports cars and Volvo wagons.
</P>
<P>
   To be successful, Ford will need to sustain a consistent
approach to advertising, management and brand strategy _ a
combination which, he said, has eluded American carmakers in the
luxury market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took BMW 20 years to come from a fairly good position to a
very good position,'' Reitzle said. ``It's a question of 10 years
or so to execute what we really think American luxury should be.''

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Responding to European pressure and hoping to
end a civil conflict that has shaken this country for 15 years,
Turkish leaders decided Wednesday to postpone the execution of the
country's most prominent Kurdish rebel.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner, Abdullah Ocalan, who directed a guerrilla war
aimed at winning more rights for Turkey's Kurdish minority, was
convicted of treason in June and sentenced to die. Wednesday's
decision means that he will probably remain alive for at least a
year and perhaps escape the death sentence altogether.

   The decision could also accelerate Turkey's move toward
membership in the European Union, which has become a transcendent
national goal. European leaders have been pressing Turkey strongly
not to execute Ocalan. His fate has become a major factor in the
debate over Turkey's entry into the union, all of whose members
have banned the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Besides solidifying relations with Europe, the decision also
holds out the possibility of improved relations between the
government and Kurds who sympathize with Ocalan. Fighting in the
Kurdish region has died down, and there have been tentative steps
toward reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision taken Wednesday was to postpone the execution until
the European Court of Human Rights has ruled on his appeal. The
appeal focused on the fairness of the closed trial and not the
death sentence, and there was no guarantee that Turkey would accept
the European Court's ruling. But the court was set up under the
European Convention on Human Rights, which Turkey has ratified, and
Turkey has accepted rulings of the court in the past.
</P>
<P>
   However the appeal plays out, the government decision marked a
victory for Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit. He not only opposes the
death penalty but also hopes to secure his place in history by
leading Turkey toward the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit's task Wednesday was to win over his senior coalition
partner, Devlet Bahceli, who heads the far-right Nationalist Action
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders of Nationalist Action, along with many of its
rank-and-file members, have been clamoring for Ocalan's quick
execution. But on Wednesday Bahceli chose to overrule them.
</P>
<P>
   Bahceli made no statement after the meeting at which the
decision was reached. But Ecevit, evidently seeking to calm
emotions in Bahceli's party, asserted that he would support
executing Ocalan ``if the terrorist organization and its supporters
try to use this process against the high interests of Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, newspapers have been full of warnings that
executing Ocalan would not only alienate Europe but also lead to a
resumption of fighting in the mostly Kurdish southeast, hurt the
economy, and probably bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel had urged that the execution be
postponed in deference to ``Turkey's higher interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to proceed in accordance with reason, not emotion,''
Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to reports in the Turkish press, the country's
intelligence agency also opposed an execution. It reportedly
prepared a confidential memo urging the government to ``use''
Ocalan rather than risk turning him into a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Under Turkish law, Parliament must approve all executions. There
have been none here since 1984, although death sentences are still
occasionally handed down.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Within Turkey, Ocalan has two very different images. For years
the press has been describing him in terms like terrorist, murderer
and baby-killer. Many Turks have come to share this view, among
them relatives of fallen soldiers and nationalists who support
them.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of Kurds, however, speak of Ocalan with respect
and admiration. More than a few consider him their leader.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his capture in February, Ocalan began issuing calls
for an end to the guerrilla war. The government has not responded,
and in recent days the police carried out a new round of raids on
legal Kurdish political offices.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, however, that the political climate may be
slowly changing. Several Kurdish politicians have said they may
soon try to launch new pro-Kurdish parties.
</P>
<P>
   One pillar of the political establishment, former prime minister
Mesut Yilmaz, caused a stir last month when he declared, ``The road
leading to the European Union passes through Diyarbakir.''
Diyarbakir is the biggest city in the Kurdish region and a hotbed
of Kurdish nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of possibly softening attitudes, Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem said he believed Kurds should be allowed to
operate television stations in their own language. The authorities
have refused this right for years, fearing that Kurdish-language
broadcasts would encourage separatist feelings.
</P>
<P>
   After Cem made his statement, an aggrieved citizen filed a
complaint against him, demanding that he be prosecuted under laws
that forbid advocating separatism. A judge refused, saying Cem's
comment was not extreme enough to deserve prosecution.

BUCHANAN TRIES TO BREATHE LIFE INTO REFORM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Four years after he nearly took the early
Republican contests by storm, Patrick J. Buchanan returned quietly
to Iowa Wednesday to sign copies of his new book and to try to
energize a disorganized Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Talking with a few reporters in front of a suburban bookstore
where a dozen people were lined up to have ``A Republic, Not An
Empire'' autographed, Buchanan insisted he had not marginalized
himself by leaving the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were still running here in the Republican caucuses there
would have been a much larger crowd,'' he said, ``But the election
I'm in is not until November. After the two fields are cleared out
in Feburary, you're going to have Bush and Gore and people are
going to be bored by the choices they've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan predicted he would soon pop into the vacuum as the
Reform Party's standard-bearer, arousing the same sort of populist
following that beat the Republican favorite, Bob Dole, in New
Hampshire in 1996 and almost carried Buchanan to victory here.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a patriotic ``E Pluribus Unum'' necktie and a
mischievous twinkle in his eye, Buchanan took several swipes at his
erstwhile Republican allies and said he would ``turn this into a
three-way race'' by the time of autumn's general election.
</P>
<P>
   The task in front of him, Buchanan said, is a ``50-state chore
for us to get delegates and 29-state chore to get on the ballot.''
He met with supporters to begin rounding up signatures to get the
Reform ticket on the November ballot here.
</P>
<P>
   He minimized a report that the Reform Party's founder, Ross
Perot, might become a candidate again. In a story about discord
within the Reform Party in Wednesday's New York Times, Perot's
former hand-picked party chairman, Russell Verney, speculated that
the Texas billionaire ``hasn't ruled out the possibility of running
himself ... if this circus-like atmosphere gets out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot's loyalists, who are generally supporting Buchanan, are
involved in a struggle for control of the party with Minnesota
Governor Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Though Buchanan said he had not talked with Perot in months, he
said there was ``no indication'' that Perot intended to run.
</P>
<P>
   As for another potential rival, Donald Trump, Buchanan said, ``I
don't want to talk about a man when he's had a personal setback. He
broke up with his lady,'' the model, Melania Knauss. Buchanan
cackled.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House speechwriter said he had not been
troubled by the Republican candidates who criticized him for his
historical observations in his latest book, which suggested that
Hitler's Germany was no menace to America. ``They said what they
said, so that's sort of behind us. The book's sold well, better
than any other I put out,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ``class warfare'' aspects of his relationship, as a
pugnacious, middle-class Catholic, with the patrician Bush family
had been ``drastically overstated.'' Though he referred to
President Bush as ``King George'' during his challenge of the
Republican incumbent in 1992, Buchanan said the elder Bush ``was a
very good friend of mine in the Reagan White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his son _ whom I don't know very well _ seems to be a
very personable individual,'' Buchanan said. ``But I do think it's
become a Bush party, and that's not the Reagan Party I recall and
not the party I want to belong to.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Texas Governor George W. Bush had become ``King
George's heir,'' Buchanan laughed again and said, ``He looks like
it. I don't see anybody who's going to stop him right now. He could
wrap this up as of Feb. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   He complained that Steve Forbes had appropriated one of his old
mantras _ ``No US troops under UN command'' _ in an attempt to win
over the Buchanan bloc. Buchanan said he expected his former
followers to scatter their votes among all the GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who joined the Reform Party last October, expressed
annoyance that a presidential debate commission might cut the
Reform candidate out of next fall's nationally televised debates.
He said it was another instance of ``the two-party establishment
trying to deny a third party access to the American people.''
Speaking of one of the commission members, former Republican
national chairman Frank Farenkopf, Buchanan questioned Farenkopf's
right to make the determination and dismissed him as ``a
million-dollar-a-year lobbyist for the gambling industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his days as a Republican insurgent, he said he
expected to win support again for his views on limiting immigration
and for American intervention overseas, and for his support of a
trade policy ``that says `America First' and retains our economic
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that prosperity did not enhance a Buchanan
candidacy, he retorted: ``You mean I depend on hard times and bad
attitudes?'' He laughed, and then grew serious again. ``There's no
doubt that the issue of trade resonates more when people are
hurting, as they were in New Hampshire in '92.''

 &HT;    Marino, J.J. are allies for playoff cause
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   ``Things look swell,
</P>
<P>
   things look great.
</P>
<P>
   Gonna have the whole world on a plate
</P>
<P>
   starting here, starting now, honey.
</P>
<P>
   Everything's coming up roses!''
</P>
<P>
   Let's not read too much into Jimmy Johnson's double thumbs-up
signal to Dan Marino or into Marino's wave back in acknowledgement
as coach and quarterback left the Kingdome field in triumph Sunday
afternoon in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That was nothing more than Johnson, giddy in playoff victory,
celebrating his team's performance, in general, and Marino's, in
particular. And what was Marino going to do once he saw it was
Johnson shouting his name and flashing those thumbs? Ignore him?
Hardly, because such behavior only would have served to exacerbate
the long-standing bitterness that has existed between them.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson-Marino relationship is what it is _ they are
antagonistic protagonists in the Miami Dolphins drama _ and nothing
that happens this month is going to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Not if they lose Saturday in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Not if they win there and then again and then again in the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   They are allies in a common cause, and that's all. Almost
certainly, one or the other or both of them will be gone from the
Dolphins soon after the season comes to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   This is worth noting in the wake of Miami's 20-17 victory
against the Seahawks, because suddenly there has arisen the notion
the above lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and Jule Styne written long
ago seem a perfect fit for these Dolphins these days.
</P>
<P>
   That's because AFC Central champion and top-seeded Jacksonville
recently has been beset by injury to significant players (left
tackle Tony Boselli is out and quarterback Mark Brunell is
hurting). It's also because there is the undeniable study that the
Jaguars compiled their 14-2 record during the regular season
against a weak schedule _ they haven't beaten a team with a winning
record and their only two losses came in encounters with Tennessee,
which went 13-3 and still is alive in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that no sixth-seeded team (that's what the Dolphins
are) has reached a conference championship game, or that teams
coming off a bye week (that's what Jacksonville is doing) are 30-6
in their next appearance since the playoffs expanded in 1990 to
their current format.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Miami still faces a very difficult assignment.
Hey, there's a reason the Dolphins are 8 1/2-point underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is to remind everyone that one man's thumbs-up and
another man's wave are not signs a Johnson-Marino lovefest is about
to blossom. At Seattle, they managed to do what was necessary to
move the team along its playoff path. But the connection remains as
fragile as Miami's season, which is now and forever on the edge of
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dolphins do somehow push to a Super Bowl title, all would
be mutually forgiven _ but never forgotten _ and the season would
end gloriously for both men. Anything less, though, and things will
get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   It's all well and good that Tuesday was a happy-face day at the
Dolphins practice facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I think Dan and I have a very good relationship,''
Johnson said. ``Some people try to read more into every statement
made than what's really there.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino's reaction was that he doesn't pay much attention to any
of the stuff said or written about the team or Johnson or himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care about our critics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear the singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtain up.
</P>
<P>
   Light the lights.
</P>
<P>
   We got nothing to hit but the heights.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be swell.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be great.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell, just you wait.
</P>
<P>
   That lucky star I talk about is due.
</P>
<P>
   Honey, everything's coming up roses for me and for you!''
</P>
<P>
   That's nice.
</P>
<P>
   Convenient, too.
</P>
<P>
   Because whether the Dolphins win or lose in Jacksonville, and
depending on your allegiance, roses are suitable for celebration or
sorrow.

 &HT;    Armstrong teaching lesson in history
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ He is the oldest player on a young defense. So
Trace Armstrong's teammates like to tease him. They call him
``grandpa.'' They overhear reporters asking about being a history
buff and they cackle, saying of course he's a history buff ... he
was there when it happened.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   It's when they stop teasing that you need to worry. That's when
you know there is something to the age talk. That's when you know
you've reached the end.
</P>
<P>
   So go ahead and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked him Tuesday if, two days after a
three-sack game at Seattle in the first-round of the NFL playoffs,
he felt more like 24 than 34, Armstrong smiled and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   OK, truth be told, he didn't really shake his head. Just moved
it slightly. His neck, which has been aching for a couple weeks, is
stiff again. So is just about everything else on his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I feel like about 54,'' he said. ``Ask me Thursday or
Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   In a season filled with talk of passing birthdays _ specifically
whether Dan Marino should retire at age 38 _ Armstrong has a better
appreciation than most for what the Dolphins' quarterback has been
going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is who you are,'' he said. ``I've been playing football
since I was 7. I'm a father. I've been a student and a lot of other
things. But I've always been a football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the strange things about this game. You're 34. In
regular society, that's still a fairly young man, but in football
they're starting to tell you you're too old to do what you've done
your whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anybody is saying that to Armstrong today.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on Tuesday, the NFL named him the Defensive Player of
the Week for his performance in the 20-17 victory at Seattle. It is
the fourth time in his 11-year career Armstrong has received the
honor _ but the first since the Chicago Bears traded him to the
Dolphins in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as significant is the praise coming from his coach.
There was a time when it didn't look like it would work to have
Jimmy Johnson and Armstrong, two psychology majors, in the same
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson loves young players, players who won't rock the boat,
players who will stay in South Florida all summer.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong hasn't been young by NFL standards for a while. And he
has been known to rock the boat. He spends his off-seasons in
Gainesville. He was the youngest member to serve on the NFL Players
Association's six-member executive committee. And in 1996 _ the
year Johnson arrived in Miami _ Armstrong became the NFLPA
president.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Armstrong? It was like trying to put Jimmy Hoffa and
Bobby Kennedy on the same team.
</P>
<P>
   But with time, it has worked. Tuesday, Armstrong could be heard
gushing about the way Johnson ``refocused the team for the
playoffs.'' And Johnson could be heard praising Armstrong for
adjusting from being a starter for the first nine seasons of his
career to a pass-rushing specialist the past two.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first proposed this to him, I'm sure he wasn't all
that fired up about it,'' Johnson said. ``But I think it's doing a
couple things for him. It's allowing him to make an impact on the
game even more so than if he were an every-down player. It's
keeping him fresher and healthier. And I think it's going to extend
his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has one year remaining on the contract he signed when
he was traded to the Dolphins. The team could release him in March
if they opt not to pay him a $500,000 roster bonus. Considering the
way Armstrong has played, that seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   He has led the Dolphins in sacks three of the past four seasons.
And as good as he has been in the regular season _ a team-leading
40 sacks in the past five years _ he has been ever better in the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   While young players like Jason Taylor have fizzled late in the
year, Armstrong has hardly looked grizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Two years in a row, he has sealed first-round playoff victories.
Last January, he blind-sided Buffalo's Doug Flutie, jarring loose
the ball and making sure the Bills' quarterback didn't pull off
another last-minute miracle against Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend in Seattle, after Marino led an 85-yard,
fourth-quarter scoring drive, the Dolphins sacked Seahawks
quarterback Jon Kitna on the next three plays. Two of those sacks
were made by a defensive end who now has played NFL games in three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Marino and Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   It was, you might say, one for the aged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature plays a cruel trick on you in this game,'' Armstrong
said. ``Just when you're starting to figure it out, your physical
skills start to go. But you get in a game like last week and the
one this week and experience helps.''
</P>
<P>
   He is two games from the Super Bowl. He has been this far a few
times in his career. But never further. And although he isn't
thinking about retiring anytime soon _ ``They'll have to run me
off,'' he says _ he looks at Saturday's game at Jacksonville with a
perspective that you won't find in a 24-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized going into this year that we had an opportunity,''
he said. ``We tried to screw it up along the way, but we've been
fortunate and we're still in it. You just start to develop this
sense of urgency because you know you're not going to be back too
many more times.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong chuckled when asked what on his body hurts these days
_ or if it would be easier to say what doesn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of fires to put out,'' he said. ``But that's the
playoffs. It's a grind physically. You come in almost bankrupt
physically. And this is a time when you've got to dig and try to
find something to get out there and play with.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong digs a little differently than some of his teammates.
His fellow linemen bounce up and down when rap music comes blaring
over the loudspeakers. Armstrong is more of a Van Morrison guy. And
when he needs inspiration, he has been known to think about
American history.
</P>
<P>
   When he was growing up, he often would visit his grandparents'
farm in Virginia and find arrowheads, muskets and Confederate belt
buckles. That stoked an interest that continues to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I draw motivation from people who have been put in exceptional
circumstances and done amazing things,'' he said. ``There are
millions of stories throughout history of no-name guys doing
incredible things for their country, for the guys that they fought
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there may be a generation gap, the guys Armstrong is
fighting with these days appreciate what he does on their version
of a battle field. Rich Owens, who at age 27 led the team in
tackles this season, says he hopes to follow Armstrong's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives me hope that if I make it that long that I can still
be productive,'' Owens said. ``It's a testament to his work ethic
and that if you're smart, you can take care of yourself. Trace is
in great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens stops and points at the reporter's notepad.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone his age,'' he says with a smile. ``Put that he's
in great shape for someone his age.''
</P>
<P>
   Still teasing.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good sign.

HMO EXECUTIVES LOSE $1.3M IN `GOLDEN PARACHUTE' PACKAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts officials Wednesday stripped Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care's former chief executive and chief financial
officer of the $1.3 million in ``golden parachute'' severance pay
the two had negotiated when they abruptly left the troubled health
plan last May.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly said he terminated the
executives' contracts ``for cause,'' and added that it was related
to ``discrepancies that led to the receivership,'' referring to
last week's dramatic state takeover of Harvard Pilgrim to prevent
its financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly declined to say whether the state has discovered specific
financial decisions that led to the decision to cancel Greenberg's
and Brophy's severance packages. However, one source in the
attorney general's office, who asked not to be named, said, ``We're
not done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance commissioner Linda Ruthardt, the court-appointed
receiver now overseeing Harvard Pilgrim, said her staff has not
``had time to do the forensic audits'' to determine if auditors
should have known earlier about the health plan's disastrous
condition. Such questions may ultimately involve legal liability on
the part of Harvard Pilgrim and its auditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now we honestly don't know,'' Ruthardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are likely to question Harvard Pilgrim's past
accounting decisions as they attempt to unravel the health plan's
current financial tangle. People familiar with the probe said they
have already begun inquiries into why it took so long to recognize
the depths of Harvard Pilgrim's problems.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators are expected to question health plan officials
as well as outside accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, which
audited Harvard Pilgrim's yearly financial statements, the
individuals said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials sidestepped questions about whether Harvard
Pilgrim executives should have known earlier what dire straits the
health plan was in _ or may have known. They also declined to
speculate if criminal liability might emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason to believe that the information we got last
Tuesday was less than timely and accurate,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt added: ``Of course we believe there was an error or we
it wouldn't be in receivership.'' But she said she couldn't answer
the question of prior knowledge by the HMO's executives or
accountants. ``So far we have no indication that's true,'' she
said. ``That's so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation of former Harvard Pilgrim executives' severance
pay appears to have been motivated by a judgment that such
compensation was inappropriate, versus a discovery of specific
management decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys ran the place into the ground and walk away with
millions,'' said one source in the attorney general's office.
``It's offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation of the severance packages will cost former
Harvard Pilgrim chief executive Allan I. Greenberg as much as $1.3
million and former financial chief Thomas J. Brophy up to $500,000.
The HMO had already paid Greenberg approximately $330,000 and
Brophy about $204,000 since they resigned, according to the AG's
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly also announced the resignation of Alan R. Morse, who was
Harvard Pilgrim's $175,000-a-year board chairman, retroactive to
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Greenberg, Brophy, and Morse were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg collected an annual salary of $565,000 from Harvard
Pilgrim, while Brophy was paid $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the HMO has not reported what its current CEO Charles
Baker is paid, sources say his salary is just below $500,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Reilly noted, his actions will save financially
stressed Harvard Pilgrim almost $2 million. That's about 2.5
percent of what the HMO currently owes one its largest creditors,
Partners HealthCare, according to Partners officials.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Heffron, a spokesman for Reilly, said Ruthardt has broad
authority as Harvard Pilgrim's receiver to manage the company,
including termination of ongoing contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a provision in the severance contracts that says
they can be terminated `for cause,' '' Heffron said.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed on what he meant by ``for cause,'' Reilly turned to
J. David Leslie, a specialist in ailing insurance companies who has
been named special assistant attorney general for the Harvard
Pilgrim case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard Pilgrim reported surprising numbers last Monday
evening and Tuesday due to deficiencies in financial accounting
systems of long standing,'' Leslie said. ``Those deficiencies
should not have occurred. Therefore,'' Greenberg and Brophy
``merited termination for cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``surprising numbers'' Leslie referred to, which
precipitated the receivership, was the revelation that the HMO lost
as much as $177 million last year _ $58.5 million more than
projected.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they had decided not to release Harvard
Pilgrim's current cash-flow numbers, as they had promised earlier
this week. ``It's a constantly changing situation,'' Reilly said.
``Today's numbers looked more favorable than yesterday's.''
</P>
<P>
   He said reports on the HMO's cash and on its leading creditors
would be released at some unspecified time.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt said she signed $5 million in payment checks to
hospitals and other health providers Wednesday.

 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The director of Tokyo's huge electric power company made
no mention of public opinion when he announced the postponement of
plans to use a new plutonium fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But the politician whom he was with when he made the
announcement, Gov. Eisaku Sato of the Fukushima prefecture, the
site of many nuclear plants, left no doubt that the public's newly
raised suspicions about nuclear power were precisely what the
postponement was all about.
</P>
<P>
   This was no time for an expansion of the nuclear program, Sato
said, citing Japan's worst nuclear accident, in September, which
killed one worker and exposed scores of people to radiation. ``Now
is the time for mourning &UR; . &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   The brief meeting between the industry chief and the governor
illustrated how sharply the ground has begun to shift under Japan's
electric utilities since workers set off the accidental chain
reaction at Tokaimura, 70 miles north of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   More than any event in a history full of serious mishaps, the
accident, which forced a partial evacuation of the town and set off
a death watch for the irradiated workers, rattled the ironclad
coalition between industry and government that has long made Japan,
a country with precious few domestic sources of energy, the world's
most ambitious user of nuclear energy, providing one-third of it
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, in a country known for its political quiescence, the
sharp movement of public opinion against nuclear power has taken
the form of a genuine groundswell, from subway straphangers
horrified by stories about safety lapses and small civic groups
that have started petition drives against the industry's expansion
to local political candidates who are running for office on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Public protest has not been common in Japanese society for well
over a generation, having mostly died out since Japan attained the
level of affluence of many Western countries, starting in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years _ timidly at first, and then with growing
speed _ localized movements have been springing up and asserting
themselves more boldly, notably in the courts, to protect consumer
interests or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Tokaimura accident, small citizens' groups, encouraged
by the spreading awareness of the risks of nuclear energy, have
sued regional power companies to prevent the introduction of the
new plutonium fuel and petitioned local governments to block plant
construction. A scandal involving the falsification of inspection
data by the British maker of plutonium pellets has also
strengthened resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The grassroots activists have put the nuclear industry on the
defensive in ways that recall its decline in the United States and
much of Europe after the accidents at Three Mile Island and
Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   In the clearest example of the impact of local mobilization,
Mayor Takaaki Sasaguchi of Maki, in the Nigata prefecture, used his
announcement of his re-election campaign on Tuesday to declare his
opposition to plans to build a new plant in his city.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, citing unflinching support from the national
government and Japan's near total dependence on imported fuels, has
pledged to stick to its plans for plutonium, which it describes as
a step toward developing so-called fast-breeder technology.
</P>
<P>
   With fast-breeder reactors, whose development remains, perhaps,
decades away, proponents say Japan will be able to produce more
plutonium fuel than it consumes and achieve the holy grail of
energy independence.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, industry officials say they merely need to be
patient until public passions against nuclear energy die down, and
they will proceed with plans to build many plutonium-burning
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only enough uranium in the world to last 72 years,
and our country is not endowed with fossil fuels,'' the chairman of
the Federation of Electric Power Companies, Hiroji Ota, said.
``There are some other alternative power sources like solar and
wind energy. But they all present technical problems. For all these
reasons, MOX fuel is appropriate for Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   MOX, or mixed oxide, fuel is the new plutonium-based fuel that
the largest utilities had planned to start using late last year.
</P>
<P>
   In western Takahama, a former fishing village that is home to
four nuclear power plants, the surprising face of the antinuclear
activism is a citizens' group largely made up of homemakers and
elderly people. Judging from the group's determination, the
utilities may be underestimating the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the group started a drive that collected 2,170
signatures in a town of fewer than 9,000 inhabitants. The focus of
the drive, like that of much of the recent opposition to nuclear
power in Japan, is the new plutonium-based fuel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, the group delivered a letter to Mayor
Riichi Imai, exquisitely polite in its protocol in a typically
Japanese manner but absolutely firm in its message _ the town must
refuse the new fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Lighting a cigarette, Imai refused to commit himself, saying he
would explain his position soon before the regional assembly. That
provoked a bitter laugh from Masae Sawayama, 90, the group's
doyenne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It occurred to me that our mayor might do like most
politicians do and go tell a bunch of lies later,'' Ms. Sawayama
said.
</P>
<P>
   The uphill struggle of the group becomes clear on entering City
Hall, where large interactive displays show idyllic color images of
the town's plants nestled in the hills by a rocky bay. Even public
parks there are decorated with statues and monuments that
commemorate mastery of the atom.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing has almost disappeared as a way of life. Nowadays,
whether directly or indirectly, the regional utility, the Kansai
Electric Power Co., employs the bulk of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The electric company has spared no effort to keep the
townspeople on its side, subsidizing regular bus tours to its
headquarters in Osaka, more than two hours away, for safety
briefings. And residents say the cable television company runs
annoyingly frequent public-service-style announcements on the
benefits of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, the Tokaimura nuclear fuel processing accident
seems to have awakened the deep Japanese allergy to things nuclear,
born after the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the
country in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   And many have put their foot down and said no to the new
program, seizing on studies by scientists in France, which uses MOX
fuel in a limited way, and in the United States, which does not,
that have shown that the fuels are more unstable during burning
than the plain uranium fuels that they are intended to replace.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Imai, who has been a strong supporter of nuclear
power throughout his career, had no choice but to oppose the new
fuel, at least for now. Announcing his turnabout, Imai spoke
bitterly, saying he felt betrayed by the industry experts who had
campaigned for his approval of MOX.

 &HT;    United 'rubbish' drawing fire
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Europe might have the world's most glamorous club
teams, but its two representatives at the FIFA World Club
Championship did nothing to endear themselves beyond the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United and Real Madrid, the reigning and 1998
European champions, respectively, both crashed out of group play in
lackluster fashion and earned substantial media derision as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, two Brazilian clubs, Vasco de Game and Corinthians,
will meet for the title at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro.
Necaxa of Mexico will play Real Madrid for third place.
</P>
<P>
   A red card to midfielder David Beckham for an atrocious tackle
in an opening 1-1 draw with Mexican club Necaxa set a grim tone for
United. Vasco ripped United 3-1 while Real Madrid, reduced to eight
men, held off Raja Casablanca 3-2 but were nipped by Corinthians on
goal difference.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its stay in Brazil, the United entourage was openly
concerned about the summer heat and was lectured in the local press
for not venturing out more in public. Allusions were made to Rio's
high crime rate, especially its reputation as a haven for
pickpockets.
</P>
<P>
   United, which received enormous criticism in England for passing
up its defense of the FA Cup to come to Brazil, fielded a team
largely of youth players in beating South Melbourne of Australia
2-0 in its finale.
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid was chastised in the Spanish press for getting three
red cards against Raja. Forward Fernando Morientes even accused his
teammates of being ``childish'' in their lack of discipline.
</P>
<P>
   But the most scathing comments were against United, the
international merchandising phenomenon that might have blown a good
chance to curry some favor _ and tap into new markets _ in South
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manchester United came here to drink whiskey and make the most
of the sun,'' said Gerson, a legend with Brazil's 1970 World Cup
champions. ``What they did was a joke. They played like rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: SURPRISE IN STORE?
</P>
<P>
   After the spectacular end to the Invierno, or winter, playoffs
last month, the Torneo Verano, or summer, season kicks off this
weekend, after a flurry of player moves.
</P>
<P>
   Pachuca, which won its first league title in overtime in the
finale against Cruz Azul, is hoping to continue its momentum
despite losing Benjamin Galindo to Guadalajara. Former MLS
goalkeeper Jorge Campos had made what seems at best a lateral move.
He has gone from UNAM Pumas to UNL Tigres, neither of which made
the Invierno playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the move again is Los Angeles Galaxy forward Carlos
Hermosillo, who leaves Necaxa for a second tour of duty with Club
America, the wealthy Mexico City club that hasn't won a trophy in
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Group 1, Cruz Azul and Guadalajara are the strongest teams,
while America should set the pace in Group 2. Necaxa is the
favorite in Group 3, and defending champion Toluca and Atlas should
knock heads in Group 4.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLAND: LIVERPOOL STUNNED
</P>
<P>
   A goal in the 85th minute by Nathan Blake was the difference as
First Division Blackburn Rovers ousted FA Cup co-favorite Liverpool
1-0 on Monday in fourth-round play. Two other Premier League teams
were defeated by lower division sides. Fulham trounced Wimbledon
3-0 and Tranmere Rovers edged Sunderland 1-0 after being allowed to
bring on a substitute after a player was red-carded. The FA let the
result stand in spite of the officiating error.... Chelsea has
obtained 1995 world player of the year George Weah on loan from AC
Milan, where he had become the fourth striker in a three-man
attack.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: MILOSEVIC MAY STAY
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after expressing a desire to play in Italy, Real
Zaragoza forward Savo Milosevic is hinting that Spain might be just
the place for him after all. On Sunday, he scored a league-leading
18th goal as Zaragoza trounced Valencia 4-2 to move to within three
points of Deportivo La Coruna in the Primera Division. The Yugoslav
international said if Zaragoza qualifies for the Champions League
next year he might stay. ... Rivaldo scored on a header in the 90th
minute, and Barcelona beat Celta Vigo 2-0 to move into third place.
It was the first action in three games for the European player of
the year, benched in a power struggle with coach Louis Van Gaal.

BAY STATE CAUTIONING ON HUDSON RIVER PROJECT DRAWS NYC IRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusual foray into New York City politics, Massachusetts
Senators John F. Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy are calling for a
detailed environmental study of a $350 million pier and park
project on Manhattan's West Side, drawing a sharp warning to back
off from the office of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry and Kennedy said the piers, which will cover 490 acres of
the Hudson River, could disrupt spawning for fish that New England
fishermen catch, such as striped bass, and they asked the Army
Corps of Engineers to require an environmental impact study before
allowing constuction to begin.
</P>
<P>
   But a top aide to Giuliani, concerned that the proposed Hudson
River Project is already behind schedule, accused Kennedy and Kerry
of meddling and causing delays. He said New York officials will
make sure that the environment is protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous that senators from Massachusetts are
interfering in the inner workings of the city of New York,'' said
Deputy Mayor Randy Levine.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed park is intended to revitalize the little-used
waterfront from Manhattan's Battery Park to 59th Street, where many
of the existing piers are rotting into the water. But the project
has divided environmentalists between mainstream groups that
support the project and 41 grassroots groups that argue it will
lead to large-scale private development.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Kerry's entry into the fray comes as the Republican
Giuliani is locked in a US Senate race with Hillary Clinton, but
observers said their intervention is unrelated. The need for an
environmental impact study has divided New York Democrats, while
Clinton has not addressed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts senators, along with US Rep. William Delahunt
of Massachusetts, say they were drawn by appeals from Massachusetts
fishermen who fear that the new piers could reduce their already
depleted catch.
</P>
<P>
   Though the section of the Hudson that would be covered by the
piers is far from pristine, partly facing the Statue of Liberty, it
is a remarkably popular feeding area or nursery for at least 15
fish species from bass to eel to shad, many of which are ultimately
caught in the waters off New England.
</P>
<P>
   In an October 12 letter to Assistant Secretary of the Army
Joseph Westphal, who oversees federal approval for coastal
projects, the senators warned it would set ``a dangerous
precedent'' to allow the Hudson River Project to go ahead without a
detailed analysis of its environmental impacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members of Congress are very dedicated to protecting fish
habitat, so they stepped in and requested that the full letter of
the law be carried out,'' said Paul Parker of the Cape Cod
Commercial Hook Fishermen's Association. ``They did the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy's and Kerry's letter drew criticism from New York
politicians and some environmental groups as well. Members of the
Hudson Park Alliance, 31 groups supporting the park and pier, wrote
the senators assuring them that New York law already prohibits
damage to fish habitat during pier construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respectfully disagree with your request because the Hudson
River Park . . . does not have any significant impact on the
aquatic environment,'' wrote Alliance leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And officials in Mayor Giuliani's office argued the pair had no
business getting involved in the debate in the first place,
prompting Kerry aides to appeal for calm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the Red Sox versus the Yankees,'' said Kerry
spokesman David Wade. ``We're doing this because of the Cape Cod
fishermen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, aides to Kennedy and Kerry say they would settle for less
than a full environmental study, but only if the Army engineers
require precautions to protect the fish that have been developed by
the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Kerry is adamant that all of the conditions NMFS has
set forth should be included in the final project and that anything
less requires a full environmental impact study,'' said Wade.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps' decision on the piers is expected in March.

DEADLINE LIFTED FOR RETURN OF RESCUED CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Fla.)  (jw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Wednesday
emphatically reaffirmed her belief that Elian Gonzalez, the
6-year-old boy rescued at sea clinging to an inner tube after his
mother drowned, should be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter to lawyers for the boy's relatives in Miami,
Reno added that immigration officials had lifted their Friday
deadline for Elian to be returned to Cuba. She said the extra time
would give the relatives who hope to keep Elian in the United
States an opportunity to file a challenge in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Justice Department is considering going to
court itself this week to ask a federal judge to enforce the
immigration ruling in hopes of hastening a resolution to what has
become a difficult, emotional political and diplomatic problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has adopted a dual approach to
dealing with the poignant story of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, officials are striving to show that their decision
giving Elian's father the right to make the decision for the boy is
the product of well-established law that sets a priority on family
unification, and they are willing to have it tested in federal
court. At the same time, the administration is moving to end the
stalemate quickly, possibly seeking a court order that could lead
to U.S. marshals' being sent to fetch Elian from the Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Reno said that a separate lawsuit filed in
Florida state court by the relatives to gain custody of Elian had
no bearing on the case, which she said could only be decided in
federal court. Judge Rosa Rodriguez of the Miami-Dade Circuit Court
ruled Monday that Elian had to remain in the United States until a
March 6 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno brushed aside that ruling Wednesday, saying that the
state court order ``has no force or effect'' on the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's decision in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of who may speak for a 6-year-old child in
applying for admission or asylum is a matter of federal immigration
law,'' Reno wrote. Spencer Eig, a Miami lawyer who represents the
Florida relatives, said in a telephone interview that the family
would soon take up Reno's invitation to file a challenge to the
immigration service ruling in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   But Eig said the relatives would also maintain their efforts to
have a state court award them legal custody of Elian. ``We are not
removing this case from the state court,'' he said. ``We will seek
protection for Elian's civil rights in federal court as a separate
action.''
</P>
<P>
   No clear end appears in sight in the stalemate over Elian's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials had been hoping that Elian's
relatives would not dig in their heels and refuse to allow the boy
to return to Cuba. But since last week's ruling by the immigration
service, hundreds of Cuban-Americans have taken to the streets in
South Florida, vowing to prevent his return.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's action in lifting the deadline is part of the
effort, officials said, to demonstrate that the decision to rule in
favor of the father is a product of the law.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that the deep fear behind all the legal
maneuvering was that the situation would deteriorate to a stage
where the federal government would have to use marshals to assume
physical custody of the boy. ``We are still hopeful that we can
resolve this matter soon,'' a senior official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eig said that the family would abide by any court decision and
fully understood that it would not be in the best interests of the
child to have any confrontation with federal authorities in which
Elian would be forcibly taken from them. But he left open the
possibility that the relatives might feel that a state court ruling
in their favor on custody could trump federal authorities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I was surprised that Ms. Reno would not respect a state court
ruling on what is essentially a state matter,'' he said. Eig
asserted that it was common for federal courts to look to state
courts to determine a person's status in making immigration
rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Wednesday made it clear that she believed otherwise. She
also offered a long rebuttal to the lawyers' contention that
immigration service guidelines mandated that Elian be given a full
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Lichtman, a veteran immigration attorney in Washington
who has no connection to the case, said in an interview that he
believed the state court was ``getting into something clearly
beyond its jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Lichtman said it appeared that the Justice Department had been
correct in its approach, ``but the question is how are they going
to enforce it.''

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   You've ignored the Internet. You've dissed DVD. You've taken a
Luddite-like pleasure in watching technology pass you by. But as
Monday's merger of AOL and Time Warner shows, the future is here,
and a high-tech colossus is headed for all our living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still plenty of time to get up to speed with the
latest and greatest.
</P>
<P>
   To help, here's a primer to yank even the most reluctant into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   My kids are into MP3s. What are they and how can I play along?
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3'' stands for something too obscure to talk about, but what
it means is near CD-quality music that you can download quickly
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is a technology that compresses music _ which typically
takes loads of computer storage space _ into tiny digital files.
Once compressed, these files can be dumped from the Web onto your
computer in a matter of minutes. And if you have a broadband
connection, it's even better. You can grab a standard three-minute
pop tune in less than 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Once the song is on your computer, you can play it back through
the computer's speakers. Or, if you have a recordable CD drive, you
can ``burn'' your own MP3 discs, or decompress the files and create
standard music CDs. While an audio CD holds about 13 songs in
standard format, it will hold as many as 200 songs in MP3.
</P>
<P>
   There's one catch: Right now, standard stereo CD players won't
play MP3 discs. But several companies have announced players that
will play both ordinary CDs plus MP3 CDs. Look for these in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   What is broadband and what can it do for me?
</P>
<P>
   In geek-speak, broadband has something to do with ``data
streams'' and ``bytes per second.'' But all you really need to know
is this: It's fast.
</P>
<P>
   A broadband Internet connection _ using a special phone line or
TV cable _ is 50 to 100 times faster than the standard 56K modem
that's built into most PCs.
</P>
<P>
   That means no more waiting for Web pages to ``load.'' They'll
snap into place almost instantly when you log on. And no more long
waits to download movie clips and music. A film trailer that took
an hour to download with your old modem will take about a minute
with a broadband connection. Also, broadband makes it possible to
watch video on the Web without all that herky-jerky motion that
ruins Webcasts when they're viewed through a standard connection.
</P>
<P>
   What is HDTV, and am I going to have to buy one to watch
``RugRats''?
</P>
<P>
   High-definition television is super high quality TV that will
change forever the way you watch your favorite shows. After one
glimpse of HDTV, standard color television will look as archaic as
Beaver Cleaver in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, you'll be able to buy only high-definition
television sets. But for now, don't rush to get one. They're
incredibly expensive (thousands of dollars), and stations are
broadcasting few HDTV shows. It will be years before HDTV rules the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   What is DVD and should I buy one when the VCR conks out?
</P>
<P>
   The VCR is most definitely doomed. Its successor is DVD, which
stands for digital versatile disc.
</P>
<P>
   DVD discs look just like CDs, but there's one huge difference:
They can hold about 20 times more information. So rather than an
hour of music, a single disc could contain several versions of an
entire movie or a whole encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   All that extra space leaves room for lots of neat features.
While watching many DVD movies, you can click a button with your
remote and hear commentary by the film's cast and crew. You can
hear audio in several languages, watch the movie frame-by-frame or
even view different camera angles of the same scene. DVDs also
eliminate rewinding and let you jump instantly to any part of the
movie. Plus they look and sound much better than tape and never
wear out like videocassettes.
</P>
<P>
   There has been one drawback to DVD, though _ you can't record
from TV onto a DVD disc. But last week, Panasonic introduced the
first DVD recorder. It hooks to the TV just like a VCR and lets you
record from television as well as play back movies. The gadget
won't be available till fall, but these machines are almost certain
to be the VCRs of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's no hurry to get a DVD player: Tape still
rules in most video stores.
</P>
<P>
   Will the telephone be obsolete?
</P>
<P>
   The lowly telephone doesn't seem high-tech enough to compete
with something as big as an AOL-Time Warner merger, but it's not
going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are gizmos that will let you call Grandma for free
over the Internet and talk to her face to face on your television
set or computer monitor without ever dialing a phone. But few
people want or use them. After they get over the gee-whiz stage,
they go back to the phone because it's so much easier than cranking
up a computer program.
</P>
<P>
   Will my PC replace my TV? Or will my TV replace my PC?
</P>
<P>
   Neither. While it's possible right now to do almost anything on
a TV that you can do on a computer, and vice versa, neither is
going away. The reason is simple: People don't want to watch TV
while sitting at a desk, and they don't want to write a letter on
their televisions.
</P>
<P>
   I keep hearing about ``interactive TV.'' I want to interact with
my TV. Is it heading our way?
</P>
<P>
   The technology is already here. Products such as WebTV allow you
to watch television and use the Internet at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   During a basketball game, for instance, you can click on an icon
on the screen with your remote control and view player stats or
other information culled from the Web. Or you might order something
from the home shopping channel _ or after watching a commercial _
by clicking another icon. Interactive TV also lets you participate
in online/TV polls, and some companies are talking about creating
game shows that let viewers play along from their living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Other gadgets such as Replay TV and Tivo aren't necessarily
interactive, but they do give you new power over your TV viewing by
recording what you're watching without videotape. They let you
freeze a live TV show so you can take a phone call or answer the
door and then resume the show at the point where you left off. Or,
if you missed the beginning of the show, you can ``rewind'' it and
watch it in its entirety from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth noting: The days of the TV listing books are
numbered. All these devices _ as well as most new TVs and VCRs _
automatically display programming on your screen. To watch a show,
you click on the selection. Your set will change channels, and your
VCR, if you like, will start to record.

NEW EVIDENCE OF TERRORIST CONNECTION KEEPS WOMAN UNDER ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY GOOD GLOBE CORRESONDENT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ A web of mobile phone calls provides the
strongest evidence yet that a Montreal mother played a role in a
terrorist plot to smuggle explosives into the United States,
federal prosecutors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While 35-year-old Lucia Garofalo has not been charged in
connection with the Dec. 14 smuggling attempt in Washington State,
the prosecutors' evidence persuaded a federal judge to keep her
jailed pending her trial on less serious immigration violations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerome J. Niedermeier said he was
particularly troubled by a call made from Garofalo's phone to a man
prosecutors described as an ``associate'' of Ahmed Ressam, the
Algerian charged in the Washington State case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may only be one telephone call, but there is one telephone
call,'' Niedermeier said.
</P>
<P>
   That call went to Raja Aslam of Long Island, N.Y. Prosecutors
would not say Wednesday whether Aslam had been charged with any
crime. Reached at the home phone number given by prosecutors, Aslam
told a reporter that he does not know Ressam, Garofalo or anyone
else associated with a terrorist network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no connection with these people,'' said Aslam, who said
he was a Yellow Cab driver who was born in Pakistan and has lived
in the United States for 15 years. ``I have nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Aslam said he thinks federal prosecutors are tying him to the
case because one of his former roommates had been stopped at the
border around Dec. 14 or 15 and called him. ``He told me he paid
$1,000 to some people to smuggle him back into the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Aslam identified his former roommate as ``Ahmed Shaheen.'' In
court filings, prosecutors said that on Dec. 15, Garofalo
unsuccessfully tried to bring an Algerian national named ``Ahmed
Saeen'' into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged telephone links between Garofalo and the men
arrested in the Washington explosives-smuggling case are
complicated. According to their statements and court filings:
</P>
<P>
   -- On Dec. 14 _ the day of the alleged smuggling attempt near
Seattle _ Garofalo used her mobile phone to call a mobile phone
belonging to Aslam, the Long Island man.
</P>
<P>
   -- From Dec. 14-16, Aslam made at least six phone calls to
another cellular phone number in New York.
</P>
<P>
   -- From Dec. 11-19, someone at that other cellular phone number
made more than 20 calls to a number belonging to Abdel Ghani, a
Brooklyn man who has been charged with being Ressam's
co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors acknowledge that the connections are circuitous, but
make no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a close and concerning link between Ms. Garofalo and
the investigation that is going on in New York and Seattle,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Tristram Coffin. In documents filed in
Ghani's New York arrest, prosecutors said, ``Ghani has also
explained that each person involved would only know the tasks of
two others involved so that, in the event of an arrest, no one
could expose more than two other confederates.''
</P>
<P>
   Aslam said he did not know Ghani. Nor, he said, did he have
phone conversations with anyone at the number cited by prosecutors.
Aslam said FBI agents had spoken to him Wednesday, and he told them
the same thing. ``I have to clear my name.''
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury indicted Garofalo last week on charges that she had
transported illegal aliens from Canada to the United States during
December. While prosecutors alleged that ``it is likely that her
actions were taken on behalf of an Algerian terrorist organization
or organizations,'' they have not yet charged her with a crime
reflecting that alleged link.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered Wednesday's hearing after Garofalo's lawyer
complained that her client was being denied bail based on
suspicions of terrorist activity the government had yet to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo arrived looking more chipper than she had since her
arrest Dec. 19, dressed in a black blouse and green slacks. As
reporters and courthouse observers crammed the courtroom,
Garofalo's two daughters -- Melissa, 14, and Sabrina, 12 -- were
ushered in, their heads covered with scarves.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's lawyer, Maryanne Kampmann, called to the stand the
secretary of Garofalo's Montreal mosque to bolster the case that
she was a kindly woman who would pose no threat if released. Bahaa
Elbatal recalled Garofalo bringing a member of the mosque to cancer
treatments, and visiting him in the hospital before his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to take him from the mosque to the hospital for
treatments,'' he said. ``I heard that she used to go visit him
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's daughters did not testify, but they sat on a
honey-colored bench in plain view of the judge, giving mute
testimony to the wish for their mother's freedom. Niedermeier said
he did not doubt that wish, but he questioned why a devoted mother
would stand accused of shuttling illegal aliens during midnight
border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Neidermeier said he saw an apparent contradiction between ``a
defendant who is concerned with her children ... and at the same
time is wandering around the border at 2 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Niedermeier seemed to give most weight to
the new evidence of a terrorist connection. Garofalo's lawyer
argued that this was not fair, especially since it was not her
client, but an unnamed ``gentleman'' who had made the call to
Aslam.
</P>
<P>
   ``She herself did not dial this phone number,'' Kampmann said.
``She does not know who Mr. Raja Aslam is.''

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; Department of Justice to Review Abu-Jamal Case &QL;   &UR; Laura J.
Winter &QL;  &QC;  C. 2000 States News Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 -Justice
Department officials today gave assurances to an international
group of activists that they would review allegations that
death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal's civil rights had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will review the information that they provided us,'' said
Christine DiBartolo, a department spokeswoman. ``We will certainly
respond to them. We don't' know how long it will take.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee tthe Life of Mumia Abu-Jamal
is seeking a new trial for the convicted cop killer. The
committee's delegation, led by AFL-CIO organizer Baldemar
Valesquez, presented 29 claims of civil rights violations that his
group believes transpired in Abu-Jamal's trail, sentencing and
post-sentencing proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about the plight of Mumia Abu-Jamal,''
Valesquez said. ``We believe that if there is such a thing and the
death penalty of human beings, the we have to be certain about the
quality of due process.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, which included a Spanish senator and European and
American union officials and actor Ozzie Davis, requested President
Bill Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno use their office to
secure a new trail for Abu-Jamal. What they got was a meeting with
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steward Ishimaru, who assured
them he would review their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal, incarcerated in the Waynesburg, Pa. State prison, was
sentenced to death for the December, 1981 murder of Philadelphia
police officer, Daniel Faulkner. The state has issued two death
warrants since his 1982 sentencing. The last warrant was suspended
in October.
</P>
<P>
   In the closed-door conference, Alisa Wilkins, the national vice
president of the Lawyers Guild, explained each of the group's
claims. Ishimaru informed them he would review the claims and any
additional information that might be submitted at a later date,
said Lindsay McLaughlin, an International Longshore and Warehouse
Union official present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 50 people waited outside the department's
Washington headquarters until the 10 core members of the delegation
returned with news.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge William H. Yohn Jr. in October put off
the Dec. 2 execution date indefinitely to allow prosecution and
defense lawyers to prepare arguments for and against a new trial.
The Supreme Court in earlier that month refused to act on his case.
His appeal has been refused at all levels of the state court
system. Gov. Tom Ridge has also refused act on Abu-Jamal's behalf.

FEMINIST COALITION PROTESTS U.S. STANCE ON SEX TRAFFICKING TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An unusual coalition of women's groups,
family-planning advocates and conservative Republicans is
protesting what it describes as the Clinton administration's effort
to weaken international laws against the trafficking of women and
children for prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last week, the presidents of the National
Organization for Women and the Planned Parenthood Federation of
America, along with Gloria Steinem and other feminists, accused the
administration of taking a position that was ``extremely
detrimental to women'' in negotiations over a new U.N. treaty on
sex trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   They were referring to the administration's support for wording
in the treaty that would define ``forced prostitution'' _ but not
other types of prostitution _ as a form of ``sexual exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter to the State Department said that the wording would
make it more difficult to prosecute prostitution rings because the
definition ``would not cover some of the most common methods of sex
trafficking, which prey on and profit from the economic desperation
of women, girls and their families by securing their `consent.'''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Heritage Foundation and other politically
conservative groups sent a similar letter of protest last week to
the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs. Clinton has focused on
the issue in her foreign travels and has repeatedly called for a
crackdown on all types of trafficking of women and children across
international borders.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials insist that American negotiators in
Vienna, where the U.N. treaty is being drafted, are seeking a
document that is as tough as possible in demanding punishment for
criminals who transport women or children across borders for
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the United States risked alienating other
governments, and undermining international support for the treaty,
if it pressed too hard for a definition of sexual exploitation that
included all forms of prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   They said a number of European governments that have legalized
prostitution might refuse to sign the treaty unless it made a
distinction between forced prostitution and situations in which
women choose freely to become prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suggestion that we are trying to weaken laws on
international trafficking of prostitutes is nonsense,'' said James
P. Rubin, the State Department's chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups estimate that each year hundreds of
thousands, and perhaps millions, of women and children are forced
into lives of sexual exploitation. Many are transported across
international borders by criminal organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the wording of the U.N. treaty pits the
administration against some of its natural constituencies in the
women's movement and among family-planning organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's position does have support from some human
rights organizations and women's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Regan Ralph, executive director of the women's rights division
of Human Rights Watch in Washington, said that the treaty was too
important to be undermined by a squabble over the exact wording of
one section.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that the treaty is moving forward, and
that it offers significantly improved protections of the victims of
trafficking,'' she said. ``We shouldn't allow this debate to derail
those efforts.''

 &HT;    Key Turner executive resigning
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bill Burke, one of Turner Broadcasting's most
prominent young Turks, has unexpectedly resigned as head of the
company's fledgling Digital Media unit.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old executive says his resignation was independent
of the pending merger of company parent Time Warner and America
Online. Indeed, he actually resigned privately last week before he
knew of the $165 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   Burke portrayed his departure as deeply personal. He has been on
a fast track at Turner Broadcasting and then Time Warner for the
past several years, running several of the company's cable TV
channels, and felt something was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to the point where I was thinking about what I could do
new with my career,'' said Burke. ``I didn't want to be looking for
a job while working at Turner Broadcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke is leaving one of the top assignments at Turner. As chief
executive of Time Warner Digital Media, his assignment was to
devise a new comprehensive strategy for CNN.com and the company's
other Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is a terrific guy in all respects,'' said Olaf Olafsson,
vice chairman of Time Warner Digital Media in New York. ``Like all
good people, he will be missed, but we want him to be content.
We've known about this for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke leaves Digital Media with his task largely complete. The
unit has developed a new game plan and has begun to put it in play.
</P>
<P>
   That plan calls for enriching CNN.com with new content and
functionality. To that end, the company has begun to announce deals
such as a recent one with Internet search engine LookSmart.
</P>
<P>
   The company has begun actively searching for a new chief
executive for Digital Media.
</P>
<P>
   Burke says he has no immediate plans other than hanging around
with his wife and two small children. ``I'm just going to take some
time off. I've worked very hard in the past several years. I'm
fortunate that I'm a company shareholder and can now afford to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke will also be thinking about what comes next for him. ``I
don't know what's missing, but I'm looking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the things he is considering are teaching graduate school
or working with a start-up company. ``I used to speak to a media
class at Emory and always enjoyed it.'' His wife is a teacher at
the Galloway School.
</P>
<P>
   Burke had quite a run during his 7 1/2 years at Turner
Broadcasting. He was named president of TBS in 1995 at the age of
29.
</P>
<P>
   His mission was to raise the brand recognition of the channel,
which had been stagnating. Burke did so by adding lots of
contemporary reruns from network television.

NEW EVIDENCE OF TERRORIST CONNECTION KEEPS WOMAN UNDER ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY GOOD GLOBE CORRESONDENT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ A web of mobile phone calls provides the
strongest evidence yet that a Montreal mother played a role in a
terrorist plot to smuggle explosives into the United States,
federal prosecutors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While 35-year-old Lucia Garofalo has not been charged in
connection with the Dec. 14 smuggling attempt in Washington State,
the prosecutors' evidence persuaded a federal judge to keep her
jailed pending her trial on less serious immigration violations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerome J. Niedermeier said he was
particularly troubled by a call made from Garofalo's phone to a man
prosecutors described as an ``associate'' of Ahmed Ressam, the
Algerian charged in the Washington State case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may only be one telephone call, but there is one telephone
call,'' Niedermeier said.
</P>
<P>
   That call went to Raja Aslam of Long Island, N.Y. Prosecutors
would not say Wednesday whether Aslam had been charged with any
crime. Reached at the home phone number given by prosecutors, Aslam
told a reporter that he does not know Ressam, Garofalo or anyone
else associated with a terrorist network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no connection with these people,'' said Aslam, who said
he was a Yellow Cab driver who was born in Pakistan and has lived
in the United States for 15 years. ``I have nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Aslam said he thinks federal prosecutors are tying him to the
case because one of his former roommates had been stopped at the
border around Dec. 14 or 15 and called him. ``He told me he paid
$1,000 to some people to smuggle him back into the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Aslam identified his former roommate as ``Ahmed Shaheen.'' In
court filings, prosecutors said that on Dec. 15, Garofalo
unsuccessfully tried to bring an Algerian national named ``Ahmed
Saeen'' into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged telephone links between Garofalo and the men
arrested in the Washington explosives-smuggling case are
complicated. According to their statements and court filings:
</P>
<P>
   -- On Dec. 14 _ the day of the alleged smuggling attempt near
Seattle _ Garofalo used her mobile phone to call a mobile phone
belonging to Aslam, the Long Island man.
</P>
<P>
   -- From Dec. 14-16, Aslam made at least six phone calls to
another cellular phone number in New York.
</P>
<P>
   -- From Dec. 11-19, someone at that other cellular phone number
made more than 20 calls to a number belonging to Abdel Ghani, a
Brooklyn man who has been charged with being Ressam's
co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors acknowledge that the connections are circuitous, but
make no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a close and concerning link between Ms. Garofalo and
the investigation that is going on in New York and Seattle,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Tristram Coffin. In documents filed in
Ghani's New York arrest, prosecutors said, ``Ghani has also
explained that each person involved would only know the tasks of
two others involved so that, in the event of an arrest, no one
could expose more than two other confederates.''
</P>
<P>
   Aslam said he did not know Ghani. Nor, he said, did he have
phone conversations with anyone at the number cited by prosecutors.
Aslam said FBI agents had spoken to him Wednesday, and he told them
the same thing. ``I have to clear my name.''
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury indicted Garofalo last week on charges that she had
transported illegal aliens from Canada to the United States during
December. While prosecutors alleged that ``it is likely that her
actions were taken on behalf of an Algerian terrorist organization
or organizations,'' they have not yet charged her with a crime
reflecting that alleged link.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered Wednesday's hearing after Garofalo's lawyer
complained that her client was being denied bail based on
suspicions of terrorist activity the government had yet to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo arrived looking more chipper than she had since her
arrest Dec. 19, dressed in a black blouse and green slacks. As
reporters and courthouse observers crammed the courtroom,
Garofalo's two daughters -- Melissa, 14, and Sabrina, 12 -- were
ushered in, their heads covered with scarves.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's lawyer, Maryanne Kampmann, called to the stand the
secretary of Garofalo's Montreal mosque to bolster the case that
she was a kindly woman who would pose no threat if released. Bahaa
Elbatal recalled Garofalo bringing a member of the mosque to cancer
treatments, and visiting him in the hospital before his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to take him from the mosque to the hospital for
treatments,'' he said. ``I heard that she used to go visit him
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's daughters did not testify, but they sat on a
honey-colored bench in plain view of the judge, giving mute
testimony to the wish for their mother's freedom. Niedermeier said
he did not doubt that wish, but he questioned why a devoted mother
would stand accused of shuttling illegal aliens during midnight
border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Neidermeier said he saw an apparent contradiction between ``a
defendant who is concerned with her children ... and at the same
time is wandering around the border at 2 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Niedermeier seemed to give most weight to
the new evidence of a terrorist connection. Garofalo's lawyer
argued that this was not fair, especially since it was not her
client, but an unnamed ``gentleman'' who had made the call to
Aslam.
</P>
<P>
   ``She herself did not dial this phone number,'' Kampmann said.
``She does not know who Mr. Raja Aslam is.''

FLEEING POLICE ON SIGHT MAY BE GROUNDS FOR FRISK, COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Wash., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a person's
flight at the mere sight of a police officer could often, in the
context of other factors, be suspicious enough to justify police in
conducting a stop-and-frisk search.
</P>
<P>
   Although all nine justices agreed with that broadly stated view,
the court split 5-4 on how to apply it to the facts of a Chicago
case in which a man bolted at the sight of a convoy of police cars.
An officer chased him down an alley and found that he was carrying
a loaded gun.
</P>
<P>
   The majority, in an opinion by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, held that the man's presence in an area known for heavy
narcotics trafficking, combined with his unprovoked flight,
justified the search. The dissenters, in an opinion by Justice John
Paul Stevens, said the known facts of the case were too ambiguous
to justify the conclusion that the officer had the requisite level
of suspicion under the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against
unreasonable searches.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a ruling by the Illinois Supreme Court
that fleeing at high speed could not provide the ``reasonable
suspicion'' necessary to justify a stop-and-frisk search. The state
court reasoned that because people have the right to walk away from
an encounter with police _ a right that earlier Supreme Court
decisions have made clear _ they also had the right to leave the
scene at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, the state of Illinois had requested a flat rule
the other way: that unprovoked flight always gave rise to
reasonable suspicion, regardless of the presence or absence of any
other element. The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday did not go that
far, adhering instead to its traditional inquiry into the broader
context. ``The determination of reasonable suspicion must be based
on commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior,''
wrote the chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Wednesday's case is one that occurs frequently
in ordinary police work, and state courts have been in considerable
disarray. Most have held that running from police, even in a high
crime area, is not enough to justify a stop-and-frisk. The
Connecticut Supreme Court has ruled that it is.
</P>
<P>
   The full import of Wednesday's ruling, Illinois vs. Wardlow, No.
98-1036, will be uncertain until state courts begin applying it in
actual cases. Rehnquist's five-page majority opinion was
sufficiently cryptic to permit several shades of interpretation
over how much weight to attach to the element of flight.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion did make clear that flight alone would not
automatically justify a stop, but it should be given heavy weight
in any analysis. ``Headlong flight _ wherever it occurs _ is the
consummate act of evasion: it is not necessarily indicative of
wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of such,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's opinion said flight was not a ``mere refusal to
cooperate'' with police, or an aspect of ``going about one's
business,'' but was ``just the opposite.'' He added: ``Allowing
officers confronted with such flight to stop the fugitive and
investigate further is quite consistent with the individual's right
to go about his business or to stay put and remain silent in the
face of police questioning.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement organizations that had filed briefs in the case
regarded the outcome as a substantial victory. Robert Scully,
executive director of the National Association of Police
Organizations, said the decision was a victory for ``effective law
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Professor Barry Friedman, a criminal-law
expert at New York University Law School, said the decision was a
``troubling indication of the court's obliviousness to what's
really going on in the country.'' Friedman said the majority
opinion failed to acknowledge the growing evidence of police
practices of ``racial profiling'' and the singling out of black
people and members of other minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' dissenting opinion contained lengthy references to such
incidents and investigations in New Jersey, Massachusetts and
elsewhere. ``Among some citizens, particularly minorities and those
resident in high crime areas,'' Stevens wrote, ``there is also the
possibility that the fleeing person is entirely innocent, but, with
or without justification, believes that contact with the police can
itself be dangerous, apart from any criminal activity associated
with the officer's sudden presence.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The incident that led to Wednesday's decision occurred at
mid-day on a Chicago street in 1995. As four police cars on
narcotics patrol approached the sidewalk where he was standing, Sam
Wardlow turned and ran down an alley. An officer caught him and, in
a pat-down search, felt a gun in a bag he was carrying under his
arm. Stevens said the police officer's testimony about what
actually happened was too vague to support a finding of reasonable
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was an application of the court's 1968 decision in
Terry vs. Ohio, which for the first time authorized a warrantless,
brief detention and search of a person acting suspiciously but
under circumstances less conclusive than probable cause. Rehnquist
wrote in Wednesday's ruling that ``in allowing such detentions,
Terry accepts the risk that officers may stop innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The dissent was joined by Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   (MAIN STORY ENDS HERE. FOLOS ON OTHER RULINGS WEDNESDAY ARE IN
2nd TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These were among the court's other actions Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   Appeal Rights
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 9-0, that criminal defendants do not have a
constitutional right to represent themselves on appeal. The
decision, Martinez vs. Court of Appeal, No. 98-7809, upheld a
ruling by a California appellate court.
</P>
<P>
   The case was somewhat unusual in that a California prison
inmate, convicted of embezzlement and serving a sentence of 25
years to life under the state's three-strikes law, filed his own
Supreme Court appeal on the representation issue and persuaded the
justices to take his case. But that was as far as the court went;
it appointed a lawyer, Ronald Maines, to represent the inmate,
Salvador Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The basis for the debate on the right of self-representation was
a 1975 Supreme Court decision, Faretta vs. California, which gave
criminal defendants the right to represent themselves at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court Wednesday, Stevens said the historical
analysis that supported the 1975 ruling did not apply to appeals,
which were not available under common law and, although provided
for by law in the state and federal systems today, are not
guaranteed by the Constitution. Stevens said states were ``clearly
within their discretion'' to conclude the government's interest in
the integrity, efficiency and fairness of the appellate proceeding
outweighs the inmate's interest in acting as his own lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Parents' Rights
</P>
<P>
   The justices displayed a lively interest during an argument on
whether a state can constitutionally permit grandparents or others
to petition for the right to visit with a child over the objection
of parents who have not been shown to be unfit. The Washington
state Supreme Court declared that state's law unconstitutional; all
states have some form of ``grandparents' visitation'' law, although
the Washington state law, permitting petitions by any third party,
was one of the broadest.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the law was ``breathtakingly broad,'' O'Connor told
Mark Olson, the lawyer for grandparents seeking visitation with the
children of their late son. Most of the justices appeared troubled
by the law but, at the same time, appeared unready to give full
endorsement to the argument of Catherine Smith, representing the
children's mother, that in the absence of evidence that children
are being harmed, the parents should have an absolute veto power
over who gets to see them. The case is Troxel vs. Granville, No.
99-138.

 &HT;    Hispanics forecast to outnumber blacks
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The U.S. Census Bureau says Hispanics will replace
black people as the nation's largest minority group within five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The census report issued today forecasts the number of Hispanics
and Asians going up nationally even after the end of the current
wave of immigration, the greatest such influx of immigrants since
the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: The country's Hispanic and Asian populations are
relatively young and have high birth rates and low death rates,
said Frederick W. Hollmann, a demographer who helped conduct the
study.
</P>
<P>
   In 2005, the study says, Hispanics will make up 13.3 percent of
the national population, slightly higher than the 13.1 percent
figure for blacks. Hispanics already outnumber blacks in 21 states,
including California and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons of black and Hispanic populations are tricky because
Hispanics, though recognized as a distinct ethnic minority, may
count their race as white or black. Another way of crunching the
numbers _ comparing the nation's Hispanic population with its
population of blacks who are not of Hispanic origin _ shows that
Hispanics will outnumber non-Hispanic blacks in 2002 _ 12.4 percent
to 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL CUT _ Georgia specific)
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of Hispanics in Georgia doubled in the
1990s, according to previous census estimates, only 2.9 percent of
the state is Hispanic while 28.5 percent of Georgians are
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think historically we've been a black-white state and I
think we'll stay there,'' said Douglas C. Bachtel, a demographer at
the University of Georgia. He said ``not even in the foreseeable
future'' will Georgia's Hispanic population seriously rival the
state's black population for the claim of largest minority group.
</P>
<P>
   Bachtel said Georgia's Hispanic population has increased sharply
in recent years as Hispanics moved here to take hard-to-fill jobs.
He said large numbers of Hispanics work in carpet mills and poultry
plants in north Georgia and on farms in south Georgia. In metro
Atlanta, many Hispanics work in construction and landscaping
businesses and in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are jobs that Americans don't want _ hard physical labor
with low pay,'' the demographer said.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Rodarte, an announcer on a Spanish-language radio station
in Gwinnett County and who came here from Mexico 16 years ago, said
jobs lured most of his listeners to Georgia.

   ``Some have lived here one year, others already have lived here
eight years, others have lived here six months. The majority have
lived in other states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Formal estimates of the state's Hispanic population range from
220,000 to 480,000, but Bachtel said the real number might be
closer to 750,000.
</P>
<P>
   The census report says Asians and Pacific Islanders will remain
the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group for years to come. The
Asian population in Georgia increased about 92 percent since 1990,
but Asians and Pacific Islanders make up 1.9 percent of Georgia's
population.

BRITAIN TO PERMIT OPENLY GAY MEN AND WOMEN TO SERVE IN MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The government announced a code of conduct for the
military Wednesday that ends its ban on gay men and women serving
openly in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The action follows a European court ruling last fall that
Britain could no longer keep the exclusion. It ends a decades-old
practice of subjecting gays in the military to intrusive
investigations and dishonorable discharges.
</P>
<P>
   The change brings Britain into line with almost all other NATO
nations, including France, Canada and Germany, which allow openly
gay men and lesbians to serve in their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, with its ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, is
at variance with that trend. The policy, adopted by the Clinton
administration, allows gays to serve provided they do not disclose
or discuss their sexuality. President Clinton himself has objected
to the results of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. presidential campaign, both contenders for the
Democratic nomination have said they would work to change the
policy to allow gays to serve openly, while leading Republicans
stand by the policy. The topic has become more charged since the
killing of a gay soldier at a Kentucky base last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The new British policy sets out a code of conduct for all manner
of social and sexual relations, whether heterosexual or homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, ``unacceptable social conduct'' that might
result in disciplinary action includes sexual harassment; overt
displays of affection which might offend others; and taking sexual
advantage of subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   The code determines that commanders have the right to be aware
of and to intervene in the personal lives of their subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the area of personal relationships,'' it says, there is an
``overriding operational imperative to sustain team cohesion and to
maintain trust and loyalty between commanders and those they
command.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``imposes a need for standards of social behavior which are
more demanding than those required by society at large,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face in British policy became inevitable on Sept. 27
when the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France,
unanimously ruled in favor of four former servicemen and women who
were discharged in the mid-1990s because of their homosexuality. In
ruling against the British government, the court found that its ban
violated the fundamental human right to privacy, as set out in the
European Convention on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where Britons argue that their rights have been
violated, Strasbourg serves as a court of last resort, much the way
the Supreme Court functions in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Britain signed the European convention, with 40 other countries,
and thus obliged itself to abide by the court's rulings, even to
the extent of changing its laws if necessary. Previous cases have
forced Britain to end corporal punishment in schools and to give
greater rights to prisoners and to suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement follows a decision on Tuesday by the
European Union's highest legal body, the Court of Justice in
Luxembourg, which ruled in favor of a woman who argued that
Germany's constitutional ban against women bearing arms amounted to
unlawful sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In the House of Commons Wednesday afternoon, Geoffrey Hoon, the
defense secretary, acknowledged that the human rights court's
ruling had left the government with no choice but to end the ban.
``The European Court of Human Rights ruling makes very clear that
the existing policy in relation to homosexuality must change,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As all personal behavior will be regulated by the code of
conduct,'' he said, ``there is no longer a reason to deny
homosexuals the opportunity of a career in the armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The British defense department has long argued that the presence
of gays in the military would depress morale among the 210,000
uniformed personnel and disrupt the services' effectiveness as
fighting forces. In defending its ban, it also pointed to surveys
that it says show that members of the armed services are reluctant
to serve with gay men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Wednesday's announcement, Iain Duncan Smith, the
Conservative Party's defense spokesman, said that there was no
reason to believe that people in the armed services would be more
willing to accept gays than they had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe and have always believed,'' Duncan Smith said,
``that we should follow the advice of the armed forces, which had
always been that lifting the ban would adversely affect operational
effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of gay rights and civil liberties applauded the
change, saying that it was overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came to Stonewall seven years ago, I was shocked
that lesbians and gay men in the armed forces were treated so
brutally,'' said Angela Mason, the executive director of the
gay-rights group Stonewall. ``I am very proud that as from today,
they will be able to serve their country with dignity and
respect.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Roger Garford, a member of Rank Outsiders, a support group
for gay men and lesbians who are serving or have served in the
military, said he welcomed the news that no one in the armed forces
could now be forced to go through what he did in the early 1980s,
when rumors that he had had a homosexual relationship with a
civilian reached his commanding officer. A chief technician in the
Royal Air Force, Garford had then served for about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Branch was called to investigate, he said, and
interrogated him for nine hours. After he broke down and admitted
that he had had an affair with a man, Garford, who was married at
the time, was released by the officers. But they then embarked on a
long investigation of his friends and colleagues in an effort to
amass further evidence that he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Garford said, they gave him a dishonorable discharge
four months before he was to become eligible for a pension. He soon
divorced and is now waiting, along with some 60 others who were
dismissed by the military because of their homosexuality, to see
whether he is entitled to compensation.

STUDENT VOLUNTEER UNSETTLED BY PROPOSED ROLE IN BUSH AD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEENE, N.H. _ Heidi Quigley, a communications major at American
International College in Springfield, Mass., won't be returning to
her duties as a New Hampshire volunteer for the George W. Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old volunteer from Westfield, Mass., said a Bush
aide asked her to appear in a question-and-answer TV advertisement,
part of which compared the Texas governor's tax plan with GOP rival
Arizona Senator John McCain's.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley told the aide she didn't have enough information to
comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign, filming the commercial last weekend, said they
would feed her the lines when the cameras rolled, encouraging her
to say that McCain's plan would keep taxpayers' money in Washington
while Bush's proposal would return it to people's pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got nervous,'' Quigley said over the phone Wednesday. ``I
had to keep repeating it. I felt very flustered.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the ad interviewer asked her what she thought of Steve
Forbes's negative ad toward Bush. Again, Quigley said she didn't
know enough about it. But she claims they fed her this line: ``Four
years ago Steve Forbes hurt the Republican party by running
negative ads and he's doing it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley tried to repeat the line but stumbled again. She said
she left the shoot feeling ``hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the comment on McCain was negative and they tried to
overshadow it by saying they're against negative ads,'' said
Quigley, who is laying low and screening calls after news of her
hand-wringing broke.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said she likes McCain and was considered voting for him,
though she planned to stay with the Bush camp because she was
committed to the job. The flap, now being exploited by the rival
campaign, ``just opened my eyes to what goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to graduate in May, Quigley said she would like a career in
public relations, and perhaps only half jokingly added, ``although
I'm wondering now if sports PR would be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who shook McCain's hand at Monday's debate in Michigan and
pledged there would be no negative campaigning, said the
advertisement will not run, and repeated his vow not to run such
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to treat my friend and opponent with respect, and
he deserves to be treated with respect. He's a buddy,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, communications director for McCain, said that
``taping a negative ad but promising not to run it is the high-tech
equivalent of smoking marijuana without inhaling it.''

SUPREME COURT BACKS CITIZENS' RIGHT TO SUE TO FIGHT POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: S.C., Va.) (With SCOTUS-POLICE, SCOTUS-LICENSE-DATA) 
 (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an important environmental ruling Wednesday, the
Supreme Court removed a legal cloud from the ability of private
citizens to invoke federal environmental laws in suits to stop
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision in a case involving a hazardous waste
incinerator on a South Carolina river breathed new life into the
provisions of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and other laws
that authorize individuals to act as ``private attorneys general''
and collect fines on behalf of the federal treasury.
</P>
<P>
   These ``citizen suit'' provisions remove environmental
enforcement from the exclusive control of federal agencies, and
have long been opposed by businesses and conservative interest
groups. Recent decisions by the Supreme Court and lower federal
courts had suggested that citizen suits stood on dubious
constitutional ground because the plaintiffs _ individuals or, as
in this case, private environmental organizations _ did not meet
the ordinary requirements of standing to pursue cases in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, reinstated a case under the Clean Water Act that had been
dismissed by the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in Richmond,
Va. Ginsburg said members of the environmental groups had shown
sufficient personal injury from their loss of enjoyment of the
North Tyger River to entitle them to pursue their case even without
being able to prove direct harm to the river from discharges of
mercury that exceeded permissible levels.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg said the test was ``not injury to the environment but
injury to the plaintiff.'' She added that if the requirement for
standing was injury to the environment, it would be more difficult
to bring a case than to win one, since the ultimate question under
the Clean Water Act is whether the defendant has complied with a
permit for discharging substances into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Schiffer, the assistant attorney general for environment
and natural resources, said Wednesday that the decision ``assures
that citizens affected by pollution have the right to go to court
to enforce environmental laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the U.S. District Court in Columbia, S.C., found
that Laidlaw Environmental Services, the owner of the incinerator,
had violated the permissible limits on mercury discharges 489 times
from 1987 to 1995 and imposed a fine of $405,000.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Earth and a local group known as Clean brought
their suit in 1992. Soon after, Laidlaw installed new equipment and
corrected the problems that had led to the discharges. That led the
appellate court to declare the case moot and dismiss it, a ruling
that alarmed environmental advocates by indicating that a defendant
could avoid liability by bringing itself into compliance as soon as
a suit was filed. Laidlaw, now the Safety-Kleen Corp., an
industrial and hazardous waste management service based in
Columbia, subsequently closed the incinerator but retained its
discharge permit.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion Wednesday, Friends of the Earth vs. Laidlaw, No.
98-822, Ginsburg said the 4th Circuit had confused the inquiry into
standing and mootness. She said that while the plaintiffs
indisputably had standing, the case might be moot, but only if it
was ``absolutely clear'' that the violations would not recur. The
court remanded to the district court both that question and the
question of whether the plaintiffs were entitled to reimbursement
of their attorneys' fees, which the 4th Circuit had rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In an important part of her analysis of the plaintiffs'
standing, Justice Ginsburg said the fact that fines won under
citizen suits went to the federal treasury and not the the
plaintiffs did not deprive citizen-plaintiffs of the requisite
concrete stake in the outcome of the case. The prospect of fines
encourages polluters to comply with the law, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said the citizen
suit provision ``does not provide a mechanism for individual relief
in any traditional sense, but turns over to private citizens the
function of enforcing the law.'' The provision, he added, gave
citizen plaintiffs ``massive bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said the court had made ``new standing law'' that ``has
grave implications for democratic governance.'' Justice Clarence
Thomas joined the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of rulings since 1992, Scalia has been the driving
force on the court to limit access to court in environmental cases.
Wednesday's surprisingly lopsided vote to reject his position may
indicate not so much a turning point for the court on the issue as
a reflection that the 4th Circuit, the nation's most conservative
federal appellate court, had pressed the logical implications of
Scalia's opinions further than a Supreme Court majority was willing
to follow.

`DUKES' IS GOOD FOR A ROYALLY ENTERTAINING TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not even a month into 2000, and the vid-game industry is still
digging up the grave of the past. Two latest _ and greatest _
examples:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dukes of Hazzard: Racing for Home'' (WB for PlayStation, $45):
Yes, those Dukes of Hazzard have their own video-game. What's even
scarier is that it's a really, really cool game. Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   More thought than one could imagine went into creating this
thing. It features the voices of original ``Dukes'' cast members,
including Tom Wopat (Bo Duke) and country singer Waylon Jennings,
who sang the theme song and narrated. In one form or another,
Rosco, Daisy, Uncle Jesse, Cooter and Boss Hog are here, too, along
with the Dukes' car, the General Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Players must complete a series of missions _ rescue Daisy, save
Jesse's farm, thwart Boss Hog. Most of the time, you'll drive the
General, but there are times when you have to use Daisy's jeep or
Cooter's tow truck to complete a mission. So this isn't just
tearing through the hills of Hazzard, trying to outrun Rosco,
although you do spend a good amount getting chased by him and,
consequently, watching him wind up belly-up in a ravine.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling certain ``stunts'' _ launching the General over a river,
for example _ is often required to finish a scene, multiplying the
challenge factor. In other words, there's a lot more going on than
there was with the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interstate '82'' (Activision for PC, $50): As the name
implies, this war-of-the-cars game _ and sequel to Interstate '76 _
is set in 1982: All the cars reflect the time period, the pink
shirt/white suit of lead character Taurus is in full effect and the
pumping music is straight out of an ex-''Miami Vice'' cast member's
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Really, the whole thing is sort of a ``Miami Vice'' marathon,
except there's very little talking, only cars blowing up. The story
line revolves around Taurus, who's trying to stop a rash of auto
terrorism. He does this by, naturally, mounting a bunch of weapons
on his Don Johnsonish lovemobile and driving around wasting the
bad-guy cars.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not as simple as that. Taurus has to complete a
grueling 40 missions, and a lot of them are frustrating to the
point of making you want to give up. What kind of keeps you going
is the fun factor: Players can choose from 15 different '80s-style
cars _ which tout realistic auto physics _ and customize 'em with
up to 25 weapons. It's so much fun to screech around corners and
blow enemies up, sometimes you just say, ``Forget the missions.''
</P>
<P>
   With lots of explosions, ``Interstate '82'' is definitely for
teen gamers. Younger kids can stick with ``Twisted Metal,'' which
is basically the same game, minus the pink shirt.

 &HT;    Atlanta archdiocese pulls lawmaker's invitation to speak for
King holiday
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta has quietly
withdrawn an invitation asking Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) to speak in
honor of the upcoming Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, because Lewis
believes women should have the right to choose abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop John Donoghue decided to rescind the invitation just
before Christmas and some five months after Lewis was first asked
to commemorate the slain civil rights leader's nationally observed
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision surprised the congressman, a former civil rights
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had looked forward to speaking about King, his mentor and
close friend, having turned down 28 other invitations in favor of
the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had planned to talk about King's legacy of compassion, not
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply saddened by this,'' said Lewis, a Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese's decision upset Lewis, because he frequently
speaks at Catholic schools and churches across the country.
</P>
<P>
   His wife Lillian's father and sister are Catholic, and the
church has honored Lewis several times in the past for his
leadership during the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   If abortion had come up dur appearance, Lewis said he
would say what he always says about the politically explosive
issue: ``It's between you and your God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The invitation was a regrettable mistake on our part and we
offer apologies to Congressman Lewis for any inconvenience this may
have caused to his schedule,'' said Monsignor Peter Dora, spokesman
for the Atlanta archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Dora said Lewis was invited by the archdiocese's Office of Black
Catholics, which plans a King observance each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are totally opposed to abortion, and Congressman Lewis has
made it abundantly clear that he is 100 percent pro-choice,'' Dora
said. ``Whenever his name comes up, we hear vociferous complaints
from Catholics across North Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   But African-American Catholics, including those who oppose
abortion, said they were dismayed by the decision to withdraw the
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The archbishop's view is a particularly narrow view,'' said
Lyn Vaughn, who was a eucharistic minister and lector at the Sacred
Heart Catholic Church in Atlanta before moving to Norfolk, Va., in
September. ``Given that many Catholics are pro-choice, it misses
the point and the spirit of Dr. King's life to uninvite him now.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Catholics praised the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the context of social justice, which is the framework
in which pro-life activities fall in the Catholic church, respect
for human life is the primary concern,'' said Kel MacDonald, an
active member of Georgia Right to Life who attends St. Philip
Benizi Catholic Church in Jonesboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to express himself in support of civil
rights, the most basic civil right of all is the right to life,''
MacDonald said.

<P>
   Turning a lengthy novel into a two-hour movie is a process of
elimination. A screenwriter must decide which scenes can be
sacrificed without gutting the novelist's tale.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tough task, rarely completed to the satisfaction of the
author. Unless, of course, the author is also the screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   In ``My Movie Business,'' John Irving relates his 13-year effort
to turn his 1985 novel, ``The Cider House Rules,'' into a feature
film. His odyssey encompassing four directors and multiple scripts
has a happy ending. The film, with Michael Caine playing orphanage
director-abortionist Dr. Wilbur Larch, was released just before
Christmas. (And Irving likes it.)
</P>
<P>
   As with any John Irving book, the beauty of ``My Movie
Business'' is in the details.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong wordsmith whose style of ``big'' novels with social
themes has been compared with that of Charles Dickens, Irving
brings a unique perspective to the quirky ways of Hollywood. In an
age when movies have overtaken novels as the most popular mode of
storytelling, this memoir offers a bird's-eye view of the two art
forms. Irving fans, in particular, will enjoy peeking into his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book involves an analysis of screenwriting
decisions: which scenes to leave in and which to leave out. Irving
bemoans this compression. A movie, he writes, offers less time for
character development or the passage of time. So things must be
simplified.
</P>
<P>
   What comes across is his passion for his creations. ``It pained
me to lose Melony, but I had to do it,'' he writes of one character
trimmed from the movie. He speaks of his fictional characters with
an attachment normally reserved for children.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's overriding concern is that the meaning of his story
survives on the big screen. ``The Cider House Rules'' is about
abortion, and Irving doesn't disguise his pro-choice beliefs. Set
in Maine in the 1930s and '40s, the novel centers on an orphan
named Homer Wells, who is taught to perform illegal abortions by
Dr. Larch and must decide whether to carry on his mentor's
profession.
</P>
<P>
   There are subplots, including Homer's romantic dalliance with
Candy, the girlfriend of a soldier off to war. Irving, who picked
the director and helped with casting, frets that he can't control
what is pictured on the movie poster. Sure enough, Miramax has
avoided the A-word in its marketing of ``The Cider House Rules.''
Homer and Candy are pictured in movie ads that evoke a
heart-rending romance.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders why a serious writer like Irving got involved with
Hollywood at all. He sees very few movies. (''I don't like sitting
in large dark rooms with a lot of strangers.'') He was minimally
involved when two previous books, ``The World According to Garp''
and ``The Hotel New Hampshire,'' were made into films. And he so
dissociated himself from 1998's ``Simon Burch,'' based loosely on
his masterpiece, ``A Prayer for Owen Meany,'' that it's not
mentioned at all in ``My Movie Business.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving never tells us, but it's obvious that he loves his
stories and he wants them told onscreen as well as in print. He has
completed a second screenplay, for ``A Son of the Circus,'' which
goes into production next year. Yet his primary love has not
changed; he's at work on his next book. ``When I feel like being a
director, I write a novel,'' he concedes.
</P>
<P>
   His cameo role in ``The Cider House Rules'' aptly describes his
offscreen role as screenwriter. He plays a disapproving railroad
stationmaster, shocked by the world moving past him. Ever a
novelist, Irving never fully approves of a cinematic world beyond
his control.

GAILEY NOT GIVEN A GOOD CHANCE (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Two days ago, a bloodied but unbowed Chan
Gailey relinquished the reigns of the Cowboys coaching job saying
he wished he had a better chance to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Gailey cleaned out his office at the Cowboys Valley
Ranch training complex knowing full well he never had a chance to
be Chan the Man, as owner Jerry Jones so aptly put it when he hired
him roughly 688 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey never did have a chance, not even from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   When Jones shocked the football world with his Feb. 12, 1998,
announcement that Gailey would be the man to lead his downtrodden
team back to prominence, he bypassed more high-profile names such
as George Seifert, Terry Donahue and Sherm Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he took a chance on the unknown Gailey because he
felt the team needed a radical change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we could take that risk and hit a home run,'' Jones
said. ``I thought a fresh approach just might be the ticket. The
players tried their hearts out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Jones said talked about how Gailey's offensive
philosophy didn't mesh with the talents of his star players (read
quarterback Troy Aikman) and that a change was necessary to get
everybody on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost laughable that Gailey was fired for the same reason
he was hired _ because his offensive philosophy was different than
the one that took the Cowboys to Super Bowl titles in 1992, 1993
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Times they are a changing? How about the more things change, the
more they stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   And actually, the only person who tried to change and eventually
did change was Gailey _ Aikman and Co. were resistant from
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' future Hall of Fame quarterback never missed an
opportunity to tell all who would listen that he never thought
anything was wrong with the old offense.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of assistant coaches acknowledged yesterday that over
the course of Gailey's two-year tenure, he continually modified his
offense to look more and more like the old offense.
</P>
<P>
   It began last year as Gailey changed his running game from being
primarily based on a zone-blocking scheme back to the old
man-to-man blocking strategy that running back Emmitt Smith stated
best fit the skills of him and the Cowboys' gargantuan offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Gailey acquiesced to Aikman's wails about the
passing game. So out went Gailey's philosophy on pass routes and
route depths. In came Aikman's philosophy based on his experience
with the old offense under Norv Turner and Ernie Zampese.
</P>
<P>
   Did the changes prompted by Smith and Aikman work? There's no
question about that. Smith responded in 1999 with his best season
since 1995 and has silenced critics who claimed he was over the
hill.
</P>
<P>
   The reintroduction of the slant pass and the adjusted routes
certainly played a role in Jason Tucker's emergence late in the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But so what. That doesn't mean Gailey's offense wouldn't have
worked if had gotten the full support from his players.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Cowboys' hierarchy at the end, Jones controlled the
front office, Dave Campo controlled the defense and Aikman
controlled the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's confusing Gailey with legendary offensive masterminds
Don Coryell and Bill Walsh. And there's no question that his play
calling left a lot to be desired. And his handling of receiver
Michael Irvin was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   However, before getting the rug yanked from under him, shouldn't
Gailey have gotten a chance to do the job like he wanted to do the
job _ like he was hired to do the job?
</P>
<P>
   Gailey leaves here knowing that his first head coaching job was
compromised by disloyal subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, however, will coach again. His belief and faith in his
offense remain unconquered. He could wind up as offensive
coordinator in Atlanta or maybe back in Pittsburgh, considering
that he might be the only coach who can revive Kordell Stewart's
career as a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   And it all might be for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Was Gailey's offense suitable for the skills Aikman and Co.?
Maybe not. Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   But could it be that we never got a chance to find out?
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly what Gailey's thinking as he looks in the
rear-view mirror.

INCESTUOUS FAMILY TALE IS GOOD, BUT GRIM GOING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Roth's acting choices have never shied from the
confrontational, so it's no surprise that his directing debut tells
a harsh tale. Nothing Roth has done as an actor, though, can quite
prepare us for the unsettling grimness of ``The War Zone,'' his
realization of Alexander Stuart's novel about a family imploding.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a good time, look elsewhere. This is not a
happy movie, and it's virtually devoid of comic relief. Even the
early scenes, which depict the chaos as 15-year-old Tom (Freddie
Cunliffe) and his family move from London to Devon on the craggy
English coast, carry a sense of foreboding. The family is isolated;
visitors are rare. Tom's dad (Ray Winstone) spends a lot of time on
the phone, in conversations that we never quite hear clearly. His
mom (Tilda Swinton) is pregnant with her third child, who is born
in tumult, literally upside-down after a car crash that the family
somehow survives.
</P>
<P>
   Tom, whose acne is barely distinguishable from his auto-wreck
scars, is already a brooding teen-ager, viewing everything around
him with a suspicious stare. You'd probably look askance, too, if
your family were this candid. It's not unusual for family members
to walk into one another's rooms unannounced and hold discussions
while one or the other is naked.
</P>
<P>
   Things take a turn for the worse when Tom suspects that his
father and his sister Jessie (Lara Belmont) are involved in incest.
She denies Tom's accusations until his suspicions _ and ours _ are
confirmed in a scene explicit enough to rattle even the most jaded
filmgoer. And it's not even the most jarring scene in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Roth and screenwriter Stuart, who adapted his novel, aren't the
first to discover evil amid banality, or to show that a beautiful
setting such as the English coast can conceal nasty doings. But
they're brutally matter-of-fact about their revelations, sparing in
their use of dialogue and allowing horrific things to happen in
near-silence. Even most of the spoken confrontations are whispered,
and the quietness makes the movie all the more unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   Roth is sympathetic to his actors, getting heartfelt
performances that belie his usually punky screen persona. Winstone
(who appeared in Roth crony Gary Oldman's ``Nil by Mouth'') and
Belmont pull off difficult roles as the near-sociopathic father and
the daughter who unaccountably protects him. Swinton's performance
is impressive in its lack of vanity. Cunliffe anchors the movie
with his growing, repressed rage.
</P>
<P>
   As well-executed as the movie is, though, it's also thoroughly
unpleasant, and its frankness is liable to prevent many viewers
from enjoying its artistry. ``The War Zone'' is disturbing, yes,
right down to the three questions asked at movie's end, and its
imagery can haunt you for days. Try finding redemption in it
though, and, once again, you might as well look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The War Zone'' is not rated. It's an R or possibly NC-17
equivalent for strong language, violence, nudity and frank
depictions of incest. &QL;

BOEING SAID READY TO BUY HUGHES' SATELLITE BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a big expansion into the space business, Boeing
Co &UR; . &LR;  is expected to announce soon that it is buying the satellite
manufacturing business of Hughes Electronics Corp &UR; . &LR;  for about
$3.75 billion in cash, executives close to the matter said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction would make Boeing the world's largest producer
of commercial communications satellites while transforming Hughes
almost entirely into an entertainment and communications company,
led by its DirecTV satellite television operation.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has been approved by the boards of Hughes and General
Motors Corp &UR; . &LR; , which owns Hughes, the executives said. Boeing's
board is scheduled to meet on Thursday, with an announcement
possible after that, they said. All three companies declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the move would be good for Hughes because the
satellite manufacturing business is growing slowly, if at all, and
has far lower profit margins than communications services. Hughes
can now invest more in DirecTV and in its planned Spaceway system
to provide Internet service from satellites. ``It is a fundamental
shift that will benefit shareholders,'' said Robert B. Kaimowitz,
satellite analyst for ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the move could also help Boeing strategically but
that the Seattle company might be paying too much. ``I'm in shock.
That's a big number,'' said Cai von Rumohr of S.G. Cowen &AMP; Co &UR; . &LR; ,
who had valued the satellite manufacturing operations at $2 billion
to $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, reported Wednesday by Bloomberg News, will most likely
renew speculation that GM will spin off Hughes to shareholders.
Some investors have been urging such a move, saying it would allow
the stock of Hughes to rise freely and also lift shares of GM.
</P>
<P>
   GM has generally discouraged such speculation, saying its
automobile operations benefit from the satellite company's
technology. The decision to sell the satellite manufacturing
business could indicate a new willingness on GM's part to separate
from Hughes. In Detroit, Harry Pearce, GM's vice chairman, said in
an interview on Monday that Hughes was well along in a broad review
of its long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hughes is undergoing its own internal review of its
enterprise,'' he said, while seeming to hint that changes might be
made soon. ``I always like to move more quickly than more slowly.
We can't let the grass grow under our feet.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, because the sale by itself will lift stock
prices, it could relieve some of the pressure for a broader
spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of GM rose $3.4375, to $76.375, a gain of more than 4
percent. GM Class H shares, the tracking stock for Hughes, also
gained more than 4 percent, closing at $106.8125, up $4.25. Boeing
shares rose 18.75 cents, to $43.0625.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the satellite manufacturing unit, known as Hughes
Space and Communications, virtually ends Hughes' role as an
aerospace manufacturer, which began with the aircraft made by
Howard Hughes. The aircraft and other military operations were sold
to Raytheon in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes officials have said that the future of the company was in
services like fast-growing DirecTV, which delivers scores of
digital television channels to home dish antennas. DirecTV has 8
million customers, having added 1.6 million in 1999, and is now
turning profitable on a cash-flow basis. Hughes also provides
communications services for business and owns 81 percent of
PanAmSat, the nation's largest operator of communications
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Michael T. Smith, the chairman and chief executive of
Hughes, had maintained that manufacturing satellites gave the
company an edge in conceiving and developing new services like
DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives say pressure to sell the satellite manufacturing
business has been growing in part because it was perceived that
owning it was holding down Hughes' share price. The shares have
doubled since early September nonetheless, mainly on the prospects
for fast growth of DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite manufacturing business also got into hot water
over accusations made by Congress that it aided China's military
development. And it suffered manufacturing glitches that caused
Hughes to take a $125 million charge in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, EchoStar Communications Corp., DirecTV's main
competitor, has done well without making its own satellites. ``We
haven't proved that there's any special advantage to owning your
own satellite company,'' said one Hughes executive, who added that
executives at DirecTV and the other service units wanted the
flexibility to buy satellites made by other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, meanwhile, has been pushing strongly into the satellite
and rocket launching business as a third leg for the company in
addition to its commercial aircraft and military operations.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing already makes global positioning system satellites, a
business it acquired with the purchase of the aerospace business of
Rockwell International in 1996. Boeing recently won an estimated $5
billion contract to make the next generation of military spy
satellites, beating out the incumbent Lockheed Martin Corp. It also
won a contract to build commercial communications satellites for
Skybridge LP and has bid on manufacturing contracts for other
services like Ellipso, a proposed satellite telephone service, and
Teledesic, which would provide Internet service from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the Hughes operation, which had estimated 1999 revenues
of $2.3 billion, would expand Boeing's $7 billion space and
communications division by more than 30 percent. It would also give
Boeing some expertise to develop some satellite communications
services it is planning, like one that would deliver Internet or
video to airplanes or ships.

A CENTER DEVOTED TO MAKING THE WORLD A SAFER PLACE  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 YT  By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEREY, Calif. _ In universities, as in real estate, location
and timing are everything. Fortunately for Dr. William Potter, an
indefatigable promoter of arms control and American-Russian
cooperation, his Center for Nonproliferation Studies has enjoyed
both.
</P>
<P>
   Established a decade ago as the Soviet Union was disintegrating
and control over its vast stores of weapons was slipping into
limbo, the center is the only place of study in the United States
that offers a graduate certificate in nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1989 in two small offices in a bungalow and with a
budget of $35,000, it has flourished over the past decade on the
notion that by bringing together students, officials and analysts
from around the globe to study weapons of mass destruction on the
spectacular, secluded shores of this northern California town, the
world may become a safer place.
</P>
<P>
   Today the center has 50 staff members, 65 graduate students _
including Russians, Ukrainians, Chinese, Indians and Koreans _ a $6
million budget and offices in Washington and Kazakhstan. It is part
of a private graduate school, the Monterey Institute of
International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   By producing information and analysis about nuclear, biological,
chemical and other unconventional weapons and training a new
generation of arms control specialists, the center has become the
largest nongovernmental organization dedicated to fighting the
spread of weapons of mass destruction, a hub of arms control
expertise, and a magnet to those committed to nonproliferation,
which focuses on stopping the spread of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Monterey's exquisite location out of the so-called Bosnywash
(Boston-New York-Washington) corridor amuses some of its fans.
``There's something a little odd at times about having so many
bioweaponeers, who tend to be type-A personalities, in laid-back,
New Age Monterey, where most people are either retired or massage
therapists,'' said Jonathan B. Tucker, a leading germ warfare
expert on leave from the center.
</P>
<P>
   The center occupies part of the historic two-and three-story
adobe buildings of the Monterey Institute. A third of the center's
budget comes from foundations and another third from government
contracts and grants, including a $9 million, multi-year grant from
the Pentagon. The rest comes from sales of publications and
subscriptions to the center's databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center must be commended for doing the nitty-gritty,
nonglamorous reference work upon which so much analysis depends,''
said Philip Zelikow, a former White House official who directs the
Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia.
``These patiently accumulated databases are probably the best
source of information outside of classified government sources
about developments that affect nonproliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   The databases benefit from having veritable slave labor to help
build them _ the center's graduate students who cull information
from sources available to the public in 22 languages. The students,
in turn, Potter says, benefit from learning the computer skills and
technology upon which so much modern political science research
depends.
</P>
<P>
   Working on the databases is only one dimension of the center's
training. To obtain a certificate in nonproliferation as part of
their masters' degree, the center's students take 15 units of
specialized lecture and seminar courses and participate in a
15-week simulation in which they assume the roles of arms control
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for instance, Potter and other staff members
simulated the talks surrounding the third planned treaty between
Moscow and Washington to limit strategic nuclear arms, known as
START III. At that session, the role of the representative of the
U.S. National Security Council was played by one of two young
Chinese foreign ministry officials sent to Monterey each semester
by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese's Russian counterpart was played by a young Russian
scientist from Snezhinsk, one of Russia's two nuclear weapons
laboratories.

   ``They negotiated intensively,'' Potter said, ``and the Russian
often tested the patience of his Chinese counterpart by using
actual arguments that the Chinese government had used in
criticizing America's missile defense policy. This time, the
Chinese diplomat, who was playing an American, had to respond as an
American official.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had very tense and testy negotiations _ despite their
camaraderie as students. But in this case, they negotiated a treaty
that reduced not only strategic, but tactical, or short-range
nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Tactical weapons are yet to be addressed by the real Russian and
American negotiators, who are to begin their talks when the START
II treaty is ratified.
</P>
<P>
   This coming semester, Potter will simulate the international
conference at the United Nations to review the 1970 Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty, which bans the acquisition of nuclear
weapons by non-nuclear states and provides for inspections of
nuclear facilities. Several of the students will attend the
conference this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The leap from theoretical to actual negotiations, a unique
aspect of the training, is one of the center's hallmarks. Dozens of
its graduates have gone on to jobs in their respective countries
arms control groups and agencies. Tucker and several other faculty
members have been U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq. Amy Sands, the
center's deputy director, is a former assistant director of the
now-defunct Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir A. Orlov, a Russian scholar who was one of Potter's
original trainees, was so impressed with center that he founded his
own institute in Moscow, the Center for Policy Studies, which now
collaborates with Potter's center on several projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's work and approach inspired mine,'' said Orlov, who
returned to Monterey in December for a conference assessing the
Clinton administration's efforts to stop the spread of
unconventional weapons. ``Hopefully, together, we will build a
community of people from all of our countries dedicated to stopping
the spread of these weapons.''

TECHNOLOGY STOCKS SLIDE AS INVESTORS TURN CAUTIOUS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks slumped again Wednesday, dragging
the Nasdaq market down 71.17 points, or 1.82 percent, in a nervous
session as investors braced for government reports on retail sales
and inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates also kept investors cautious as did
further appraisal of the blockbuster merger proposed Monday by
America Online, which was down 4{, to 60, and Time Warner Inc.,
down 5], to 79 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been excess there,'' said Cummins Catherwood, managing
director of Rutherford, Brown &AMP; Catherwood in Philadelphia,
referring to the 1999 run-up in Internet and other high-technology
shares. ``Now there's a reshuffling of the deck.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth consecutive day in which the Nasdaq composite,
which ended at 3,850.02, ranged more than 100 points from high to
low.
</P>
<P>
   With some technology money moving into blue chips, the Dow Jones
industrials explored record territory for much of the day but gave
up more than half its best gain to finish ahead by 40.02 points, or
0.35 percent. The closing level, 11,551.10, was shy of the record
11,572.20 set on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fixation we've seen on high-tech and Internet has broken
somewhat,'' said Neil Eigen, a managing director at J.&AMP; W.
Seligman. ``Some sanity is returning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank stocks were among the day's best performers, with J.P.
Morgan and Citigroup among the biggest contributors to the Dow's
advance. Analysts said investors might have decided that bank
stocks had been battered enough in anticipation of more
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve, which has a policy
meeting scheduled for the first two days of February.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also weighed heavily on the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index, which sagged 6.31 points, or 0.44 percent, to
1,432.25. The biggest depressants other than America Online were
Microsoft, down 3 9/16, to 105 13/16; Yahoo down 39 13/16, to 357
9/16, and Oracle, down 6}, to 105|.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues in the index narrowly outnumbered advancing
ones, 246 to 234, with 20 stocks unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors surged 3 7/16, to 76], after a report emerged
that Boeing planned to buy the satellite-manufacturing business of
Hughes Electronics, 69 percent owned by GM Hughes climbed 4\, to
106 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin rose 1\, to 21 3/16, after winning a Navy
missile contract, while Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
benefited from a recommendation by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and
traded as high as 103| before settling at 100}, up \.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 1 9/16, to 91\, as investors awaited its earnings
report today. Hewlett-Packard gained 3 13/16, to 112].
</P>
<P>
   ``The message so far this year is the first shall be last and
the last shall be first,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment
officer at Wells Capital Management. He noted that utilities also
posted broad, though modest, gains Wednesday and that beaten up
consumer stocks like McDonald's, up 1}, to 42}; Coca-Cola, up
11/16, to 61{, and Merck, up 1 7/16, to 74 7/16, have all bounced
higher of late.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume eased a bit on the New York Stock Exchange, to a
still heavy 974.6 million shares as 1,710 issues declined and 1,355
advanced. There were 85 stocks that hit 52-week lows and 53 that
hit new highs. Nasdaq volume was 1.52 billion, down from 1.65
billion Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign markets were mixed Wednesday. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo
fell 0.92 percent, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong, 0.93 percent, and
the Paris CAC, 0.56 percent. Prices rose by 0.31 percent in
Frankfurt, 0.21 percent in London, 0.27 in Sao Paulo and 0.43
percent in Mexico City.

GLOBAL AUTOMAKERS ANTE UP BIDS FOR AILING DAEWOO MOTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The General Motors Corp. sought to gain an
edge on Wednesday in the foreign competition to acquire the Daewoo
Motor Co., saying it wanted to preserve the ailing South Korean
automaker's national identity.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by GM came against a backdrop of rising concern
among Daewoo Motor employees about their fate. Their union has
protested what it calls the rushed effort by Daewoo creditors to
sell the company to an overseas buyer, and it has scheduled a Jan.
21 meeting to decide whether to strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested in acquiring all of Daewoo Motor's assets,
therefore allowing the highest number of employees without
disrupting the company,'' said Henry Wong, a GM spokesman. ``GM is
the world's largest automaker, and Daewoo Motor suppliers will gain
access to the rest of GM's network.''
</P>
<P>
   Both GM and the Ford Motor Co. have expressed strong interest in
acquiring Daewoo Motor to help anchor their expanding operations in
Asia, where vehicle sales are expected to jump as the region's
economy recovers from a financial crisis that began more than two
years ago. Daewoo Motor is a main affiliate of the Daewoo Group,
which has been struggling under an estimated $73 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, which recently hired a former Daewoo executive as an
adviser in talks with Korean creditors and government officials,
said it was reviewing Daewoo Motor's assets. ``We're still
interested in Daewoo Motor,'' said Jim Bright, a Ford spokesman.
``We feel we owe it to our stockholders to take a good look at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A developing takeover struggle for Daewoo Motor began a month
ago when the South Korean government said it was likely to choose
GM as the exclusive buyer. Shortly afterward, Ford announced its
interest, and the government decided to conduct an auction, which
could take place in March.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai, South Korea's largest automaker, is also said to be
interested in Daewoo Motor, and other automakers may be interested,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The value of Daewoo Motor is unclear, partly because it holds
more than $16 billion of the parent company's debt. GM reportedly
had offered $6 billion to $7 billion plus the assumption of an
unspecified amount of Daewoo Motor's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Able to manufacture more than a million cars a year in its South
Korea factories, Daewoo Motor would be a valuable asset for any
major carmaker wishing to expand sales in Asia, which is expected
to generate most of the global growth in the industry in the next
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But Daewoo Motor's debt is rising and could ultimately
discourage any potential buyer. It is increasingly unclear how much
debt might be assumed by Daewoo Motor's creditors if there was a
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Korea Development Bank, Daewoo Motor's main
creditor, recently provided the automaker with an additional $100
million in credit, said Seo Kyong Won, a Daewoo Motor spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors reached a tentative agreement in November to provide
Daewoo Motor about $440 million in additional operating funds, $1
billion to cover unpaid export fees and $250 million to cover
purchases of raw materials. But disagreements between individual
creditors led to delays in those payments, which began only
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cash infusions will pay for back wages for around
10,000 assembly line workers, but that may not soothe the anger
employees harbor toward the company.
</P>
<P>
   Park Doo-young, a union spokesman, said members were frustrated
by what he called the alienation they have felt from the government
and creditors during negotiations and offers that will determine
their future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already planned our strikes,'' Park said. ``What comes
first should be funding support to normalize operations at our
plants. We will strike if the government continues with its
single-handed approach to find a foreign buyer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Korea Development Bank, which is overseeing the auction of
Daewoo Motor, intends to complete a sale by the end of June, said
Yang Won-seok, an official at the bank's Daewoo credit division.
The bank has formed a separate office to oversee the sale and plans
to receive letters of intent from interested buyers by the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
   But there is considerable skepticism about whether the bank can
sell Daewoo Motor by midyear. The South Korean government's last
attempt to sell an ailing carmaker, the Kia Motors Corp., which
went bankrupt in 1997, dragged on for almost a year as the
government haggled over how much debt a foreign buyer should
assume. Eventually Hyundai acquired Kia.
</P>
<P>
   ``First it was GM and Ford, and now everyone's jumped in,'' said
Joe Lee, an automotive industry analyst at Daiwa Securities. ``It's
going to be about who'll pay more for Daewoo Motor's debts. I don't
think that will be resolved in a few months.''

 &HT;    Texas A&AMP;M chief may resign if probe finds lack of supervision in
bonfire
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen says he
will step down if investigators conclude that lax official
supervision played a role in the fatal Nov. 18 bonfire collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Amid lingering questions about the university's role, Bowen was
quoted in the local newspaper as saying he would resign if it is
determined that poor leadership contributed to the accident that
killed 12 and injured 27 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I say to someone, `I want you out of this job,' when
I'm at the top of that command?'' Bowen was quoted in The Eagle.
``I have to set that standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as the chairman of a special commission
looking at the collapse said the university's supervision will be
part of their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no plans specifically to bring the university into it
but, in trying to determine the cause, we're looking at the
physical, structural and behavioral issues _ and I can see where
the university's supervision could be a part of that,'' said Leo
Linbeck Jr., a Houston businessman whom Bowen selected as head of
the five-member panel. ``I don't think we should rule them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling Bowen's comments ``a pretty dramatic statement,''
Linbeck said they will not influence the commission's work. ``I
regret that this has spilled over into the life of the president in
this way, but that doesn't add any pressure to us,'' he said. ``I
can't imagine the stakes in this being any bigger than they already
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck said he was unaware of Bowen's stance until Wednesday,
but added: ``I would assume that his feelings reflect the gravity
with which he attaches to the occurrence. ... I know I think about
those 12 students every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which began preliminary work in December, is to
meet again Tuesday for an update from its consultants on the
inquiry. A&AMP;M officials earlier said they hoped to have a final
report by March 31, but some of the consultants have said they
expect it to take longer.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen, 63, has been president of the 45,000-student university
since June 1994, previously having served as interim president at
Oklahoma State University. He received a mechanical engineering
degree from A&AMP;M in 1958 and, while a student here, helped cut logs
for the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen could not be reached for comment Wednesday about his
remarks. But Cindy Lawson, the university's chief spokeswoman
confirmed that Bowen said he would resign if asked to or if a
failure of university leadership over the bonfire is eventually
found to have been a factor in its collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the ultimate leader, he feels he would be responsible,''
Lawson said. ``And that is not out of character for him. Honesty
and integrity are paramount to him. Taking responsibility goes with
that and doing what is right is part of the cost of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bonfire collapse, no one has publicly suggested Bowen
should resign. And A&AMP;M officials have repeatedly insisted that they
think the university provided proper oversight of the student-built
project.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent time came Tuesday at a press briefing, where the
university's official bonfire adviser and four top university
officials _ all of them previous bonfire advisers _ said safety of
the construction was closely monitored every year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though students planned and supervised the construction of
the bonfire _ reportedly the world's largest college bonfire, an
A&AMP;M tradition dating back 90 years _ the officials said the
university provided advisers to ride herd on the project, kept
track of the money and insurance, even capped its height at 55
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the bonfire adviser, Rusty Thompson, admitted he
thought the ill-fated stack was 40 to 45 feet tall when it
collapsed. The investigation, however, showed it was 60 feet and
would have been at least 75 feet when completed. And, according to
investigators, student leaders knew they were building the bonfire
beyond the university's height limit.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, no design blueprints were ever required. And from
internal A&AMP;M documents made public so far, there appeared to be
little, if any, concern that an ill-built stack of logs might fall
over _ as it did on Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's student-run and staff-advised _ not by accident, but on
purpose,'' explained Bill Kibler, associate vice president for
student affairs and the bonfire adviser from 1983-92. ``Student
leadership is considered a fundamental part of A&AMP;M.''

DIVIDED JUSTICES BROADEN POLICE POWER UNDER FOURTH AMENDMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled Wednesday
that police may stop and frisk people who bolt upon seeing them,
saying that such a sudden scamper raises suspicions of underlying
illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   With its 5-4 decision, the justices broadened police power under
the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. The constitutional provision
bars officers from stopping and patting down an individual unless
they reasonably suspect evidence of criminality to be on his or her
person.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court said the Constitution gives police latitude
to make ``common-sense judgments and inferences about human
behavior'' and conclude that a fleeing individual, particularly in
a high-crime neighborhood, has something to hide.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP Legal Defense &AMP; Educational Fund assailed the ruling
as enabling police to harass minorities, particularly in high-crime
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overwhelmingly, stop-and-frisk activities are directed at
minorities,'' said George Kendall, an attorney with the fund, who
had filed a brief with the justices urging them in vain to limit
police power. ``Many of these stops result in no discovery of
criminal activity at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The specific case before the justices involved Sam Wardlow's
decision in 1995 to run upon seeing Chicago police officers, who
were patrolling in a crime-laden neighborhood. Officers gave chase,
catching up with Wardlow and finding a .38-caliber handgun and five
live rounds of ammunition in a bag he was carrying.
</P>
<P>
   Wardlow, who is black, was convicted of illegal gun possession
and sentenced to two years in prison. But the Illinois Supreme
Court threw out the conviction, saying Wardlow's decision to run
did not give the officers sufficient reason under the Constitution
to suspect him of having committed a crime or to frisk him.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court, however, reinstated the conviction,
saying the officers were well within their constitutional authority
to suspect the fleeing Wardlow of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Had Wardlow simply stood his ground and refused to even
acknowledge them, the officers would have had no authority to
search him or his bag, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an officer, without reasonable suspicion or probable
cause, approaches an individual, the individual has a right to
ignore the police and go about his business,'' Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist wrote in the court's majority opinion. ``And
any refusal to cooperate, without more (provocation), does not
furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for a
detention or seizure.''
</P>
<P>
   But once Wardlow started to run, his constitutional protection
from the police left with him as officers reasonably became
suspicious that his ``nervous, evasive behavior'' indicated
wrongdoing, Rehnquist added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Headlong flight _ wherever it occurs _ is the consummate act
of evasion: It is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing, but it
is certainly suggestive of such,'' he wrote. ``Allowing officers
confronted with such flight to stop the fugitive and investigate
further is quite consistent with the individual's right to go about
his business or to stay put and remain silent in the face of police
questioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Rehnquist's opinion were Justices Anthony M. Kennedy,
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens conceded that sudden
flight from officers is suspicious and might justify police action
in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   But he also went to great length to illustrate that running from
police could result from innocent intentions, such as to avoid
being caught in potential crossfire between officers and criminals.
Stevens added that innocent minorities in high-crime neighborhoods
might fear being stopped by the police simply because of their skin
color.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting justice also said the arrival of police and the
speedy departure of an individual might simply be a mere
coincidence in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pedestrian may break into a run for a variety of reasons _
to catch up with a friend a block or two away, to seek shelter from
an impending storm, to arrive at a bus stop before the bus leaves,
to get home in time for dinner, to resume jogging after a pause to
rest, to avoid contact with a bore or a bully, or simply to answer
the call of nature _ any of which might coincide with the arrival
of an officer in the vicinity,'' Stevens wrote. ``In short, there
are unquestionably circumstances in which a person runs for
entirely innocent reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   With regard to Wardlow's case, Stevens said he remains
unconvinced that the suspect was running from officers. The justice
said the trial record is unclear whether Wardlow even realized the
area was being patrolled by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not persuaded that the mere fact that someone standing on
a sidewalk looked in the direction of a passing car before starting
to run is sufficient to justify a forcible stop and frisk,''
Stevens wrote, referring to Wardlow's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The justice said the high court should have ordered a new trial
in which the police would have to show that Wardlow was
specifically running from them.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Stevens' dissent were Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter.

 &HT;    Florida Bible classes illegal, group claims
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Bob Wright began teaching Bible history at a
public high school in Ocala, Fla., it made good sense to him to use
the Good Book as his primary text.
</P>
<P>
   But using the Bible is one of the problems with the course,
according to a liberal advocacy group that claims classes such as
Wright's are unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Tallahassee, Fla., the People for the American Way
Foundation will charge that 14 Florida public school districts use
the Bible as a history book and promote Protestant Christian
religion _ a violation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation President Ralph Neas complains that including Bible
history on the state's list of classes has ``proven to be an open
invitation to local school districts to violate the Constitution
under the guise of teaching state-sanctioned courses.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Education said local
districts bear responsibility for any course. ``We do not monitor
how the districts teach the classes,'' said the department's JoAnn
Carrin.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida skirmish comes as some Georgia lawmakers push for
legislation that would force the state Board of Education to adopt
a Bible curriculum. Concerned about potential litigation, the
Georgia school board in December refused to vote on a request by
local districts that wanted funds for Bible classes.
</P>
<P>
   Neas, who will mail formal complaints to school superintendents
and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, advises school boards to revise their
Bible classes now and ``not wait to be sued.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat shut down Wright's class this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're winning by intimidation,'' Wright said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the People for the American Way began surveying how 14
Florida public school districts taught Bible history. The inquiries
came after the group successfully sued the Lee County school board,
which had proposed a Bible class that relied on a Christian-based
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's course material was requested. But no one ever visited
his class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a proselytizer,'' Wright said. ``I just present what's
there. I'm not trying to convince students to be Christians. That's
not the way to teach it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 60-page report claims that's how it's been taught in
Florida, from Pensacola to Fort Myers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Panhandle beach county of Santa Rosa, course material
``accepts the book of Revelation as primarily yet to be fulfilled
... We will accept the book as literal unless the facts are to the
contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says that approach ``clearly teaches ... from a
religious perspective.''

<P>
   America Online and Time Warner announced their engagement on
Monday, for richer or for poorer.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, investors decided the combination was for poorer,
sending shares of the two companies plunging for the second
consecutive day. The combined market value of America Online and
Time Warner is now less than before the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   With the specter of the 1999 failure of a similar merger between
USA Networks and Lycos hanging over them, AOL and Time Warner are
feverishly working to reassure investors that their combination
makes strategic sense, meeting with top shareholders, extolling the
virtues of the deal to the press and promising more details about
linkups between the two companies soon.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, people close to the deal say the drop in AOL shares was
not surprising, given that many AOL investors have come to count on
an extraordinary growth rate and care little about traditional
measures of stock value, like price-to-earnings ratios. Because
Time Warner is growing much more slowly than AOL, buying Time
Warner will dampen AOL's growth. Some AOL investors are selling
their shares as a result.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, AOL shares fell $4.50 to $60, and shares in Time
Warner shares dropped $5.375 to $79.625. While Time Warner's stock
price remains higher than it was on Friday, before the deal was
announced, shares in AOL have now lost one-fifth of their value in
three days. As a result, the total value of the two companies now
stands at about $280 billion. That compares with a total value of
$300 billion on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, investors believe the two companies are worth
$20 billion less together than they were separately. Still, the two
companies say the volatility will not derail the deal and point to
provisions in their agreement that lock them into a merger no
matter what their stocks do.
</P>
<P>
   So far, AOL's stock has been the loser. If it falls too far, AOL
shareholders may consider the merger unfair and rebel against it,
as Lycos shareholders did last year when their company announced a
merger with USA Networks. Lycos is a fast-growing new-media company
like AOL, while USA Networks is a traditional media company like
Time Warner. The collapse of the Lycos-USA deal was seen as a
signal that Internet investors would look very skeptically at
linkups with traditional companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A merger of this magnitude, with old world meeting new world,
with different fundamental business models, relatively different
corporate cultures, different analysts and bankers covering the
companies, is a recipe for questions and concerns,'' said Jeff
Mallett, the president and chief operating officer of Yahoo, AOL's
largest competitor on the Internet. ``What they're trying to put
together is a big leap of faith, that these two companies should
coexist under a single roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as AOL shareholders wonder about their new company's growth
prospects, some Time Warner shareholders are frustrated that they
are receiving less than half the equity in the new company since
Time Warner will contribute 80 percent of the revenue and cash
flow.
</P>
<P>
   The gap in expectations has some merger experts bracing for
trouble. ``It's shaping up to be a fairly rough time,'' said Eric
Longmire, senior managing director of Wyser-Pratte, which
specializes in investing in mergers. ``You're going to get a
natural shift in investor base. Those people who own Time Warner
would want to own a Time Warner-type company, and not to own AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   While the executives and boards of Time Warner and AOL have
approved the deal, shareholders have the ultimate power. More than
half the shareholders of each company must vote in favor of the
merger before it can be completed later this year.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure the Lycos example is not repeated, AOL and Time
Warner executives spent Wednesday proclaiming the strategic
benefits of their deal and lining up influential shareholders to
express support for it. Executives of both companies say they
remain confident the deal will go through, and say long-term
benefits far outweigh any pain from short-term stock declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no outs,'' said Richard Bressler, the chairman of
Time Warner Digital Media and an architect of the merger. Because
AOL is exchanging its stock for Time Warner's, a drop in the price
of AOL shares lessens the value of the deal for Time Warner
shareholders. This agreement, unlike many other merger contracts,
does not enable Time Warner to walk away no matter how much AOL's
stock price falls, Bressler said. ``That means you're both locked
going forward together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a collar on the deal that would allow for a change
in the ratio of 1.5 AOL shares for each Time Warner share. Whether
AOL stock rises or falls before the deal is completed, the ratio,
which will leave Time Warner shareholders with 45 percent of the
combined company, fairly represents the contributions of AOL and
Time Warner, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the deal are several large institutional investors,
including Janus Capital, which owns $12 billion in AOL and Time
Warner stock and would probably be the largest shareholder in the
combined company. John Schreiber, who follows Time Warner for
Janus, said Janus has bought shares in both AOL and Time Warner
since Monday's merger announcement. ``We think the combination is
far stronger than either of the two individually,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Kelly, AOL's chief financial officer, said he and
other top company executives had met with big shareholders this
week. ``There's no concern about the deal,'' he said. ``We met with
the largest shareholders and they couldn't be more excited about
what we are creating.''
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the benefits of the combination to investors, top
executives of AOL and Time Warner huddled Wednesday at AOL's
Virginia headquarters looking for ways to work together. When they
announced the deal, AOL and Time Warner described a number of minor
joint ventures, like adding content from InStyle magazine to
America Online. More joint ventures are coming, executives said.

TECHNOLOGY CONSULTING FIRM URGES DISMANTLING OF MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A leading technology consulting and research
company says that Microsoft, to resolve its antitrust case with the
government, should pre-emptively break itself up into four or five
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In a special report to its customers, International Data Corp.,
an independent research company with most of the world's major
technology companies as clients, concluded in a special bulletin
issued last month that a breakup of the company would be ``the best
outcome for consumers, for the industry and for Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-page document, which was first reported Wednesday in The
Los Angeles Times, was distributed privately to the software
companies that are the corporation's members _ including Microsoft,
which was given an advance look at the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their reaction was very professional,'' said Dan Kusnetzky, a
program director for the company who was one of the report's
authors. ``They thanked us for giving us notice that we intended to
publish it. They said most people don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Splitting Microsoft into several companies is one of a variety
of remedies state and federal prosecutors are discussing as a
possible resolution of the case, though in interviews Wednesday
several officials said no decision had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today reported Wednesday that government lawyers appeared to
have reached a consensus to break Microsoft into at least two and
perhaps three companies. Wednesday, the Justice Department said the
article ``does not accurately reflect our views.''
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, said, ``We can't speculate
on what the government is or isn't thinking. But a recommendation
to break up the company would be an extreme and radical proposal
that is not justified by anything in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said a consensus was developing among the state
and federal officers involved in settlement talks with Microsoft
that a structural remedy was needed _ one that refashions the
company or its products in some way. But no final decision can be
reached until all 19 state attorneys general who are part of the
suit are consulted, and that has not occurred.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, senior executives of the Justice Department,
and perhaps others in the Clinton administration, must agree on an
approach. And that has not occurred, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement talks, overseen by Richard Posner, a federal
appeals court judge, have been under way since Nov. 30, and the two
sides have held regular meetings. But officials said they remained
far apart.
</P>
<P>
   The International Data report is unusual because most
independent companies working in the software field have been
reluctant to weigh in on this issue for fear of antagonizing
Microsoft and its allies. But Kusnetzky said many of the company's
clients asked for an analysis of this sort.
</P>
<P>
   After Thomas Penfield Jackson, the federal judge who is trying
the Microsoft case, issued his findings of fact in early November,
Kusnetzky said, ``We started getting questions from our subscribers
asking what this could mean for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings concluded that Microsoft was a rapacious
monopoly whose actions harmed the industry and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The International Data report runs through many of the remedy
ideas that have been discussed and dismisses most of them. Under
one proposal long favored by the states, as an example, Microsoft
would be forced to license the source code for the Windows
operating system to other companies, which would create
competition. But the report concludes that Windows is so riddled
with weaknesses and vulnerabilities that other companies would be
likely to say: ``I'm not going to invest my limited resources to
fix Microsoft's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company concludes: ``Our recommendation to
Microsoft is to take the bold step to settle immediately and
voluntarily spin off a set of technologically coherent companies
whose mission is to produce best-of-breed software'' and thereby
``adroitly maneuver out of the current PR disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   While that is the recommended solution, the company says,
Microsoft will more likely remain defiant and accept a more modest
settlement in the end.

 &HT;    Big funding boost proposed for CDC
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The White House will announce today that it plans to
raise funding for an environmental research arm of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention by almost 60 percent in its 2001
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Environmental Health, based in Chamblee,
Ga., would receive $27 million under the plan, a $10 million
increase over its appropriation for the current year.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be targeted for research equipment and salaries,
said Dr. Richard Jackson, NCEH director. The center inhabits some
of the most dilapidated of the CDC's aging buildings, but
replacements have been funded by a separate appropriation and would
not be covered by the new money announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, whose lab is the only place in the country capable of
performing some extremely sensitive scientific tests, said the
funds would enhance the center's ability to test tiny biological
samples for exposure to toxins, and would assist in moving the
capacity to do those tests into communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big questions in environmental research is: What
are people exposed to?'' he said Wednesday. ``We often know what is
in water, air and food, but we don't usually know what is in
people. Being able to measure real people's exposures to real
toxins will help both allay fears when there is no problem and
focus our attention when we do find exposures. It's a question of
getting science to serve questions that people have in the real
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the environmental toxins the center is interested in, he
said, are potential causes for local clusters of breast and
prostate cancer, birth defects, asthma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
More than half of breast cancer cases have no known genetic or
lifestyle cause, and only 10 percent of prostate cancer cases can
be linked to genetics. Identifying environmental causes for even 10
percent of breast and prostate cancers could eliminate a potential
30,000 cases each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is technology transfer, moving these tools out to the
clinical world,'' Jackson said. ``Making these technologies faster,
cheaper, smarter and more reliable is extremely cost- effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the funds the White House is requesting _ which must be
approved by Congress when it debates the coming budget _ would be
earmarked for nationwide monitoring of more than 100 environmental
toxins and carcinogens to identify areas that are particularly
risky for women of childbearing age, children, minorities and the
elderly. Another portion would be funneled to state and local
health department investigations, the White House said. It did not
specify a dollar limit for either goal.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marks the second time this week that the White
House has announced appropriations for the CDC in advance of
disclosing the entire 2001 budget.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, it said it would ask Congress for $65 million to
create a nationwide electronic communications system to collect
data on disease patterns.

 COMMENTARY: THE GOOD GUYS WIN ONE AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Also see SCOTUS-LICENSE-DATA)  
 (bl)  
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ My favorite toy is a fake cellular phone made of
black rubber. When self-important friends take out their real
status symbols, I jab impatiently at my rubber phone, smack it
twice against the wall in mock frustration, then, cursing, toss it
into an ashcan to the horror of all.
</P>
<P>
   But moved by ads for a device that won't pull my jacket out of
shape, last week I went to buy a real cellular phone at the local
AT&AMP;T store. I paid with a credit card and signed up for the
service. The salesgirl asked for my Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   I refused, of course; what business is that of AT&AMP;T's? ``Then
you'll have to pay a $1,000 deposit,'' she said. I told her to void
the sale and I'd try Bell Atlantic down the street. She then asked
her manager for a ``waiver'' of the Social Security requirement and
signed me up.
</P>
<P>
   That got me thinking: Why does AT&AMP;T collect that private
information? To sell to intrusive telemarketers, probably; the SS
number is not a credit credential but may indicate age and place of
first job and opens the door to collectors of other personal data.
</P>
<P>
   To see if a beloved colleague shared my privacy concerns, I got
on the Web to find his number. Sure enough, there it was in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The SEC explained that
to stop making this available at a keystroke to every snoop around
the world, he would have to send in a new form without it. (When he
reads this, I trust he'll do that.)
</P>
<P>
   It's not illegal for AT&AMP;T or e-commerce con men to euchre your
Social Security number out of you. (There oughta be a law.)
Unfortunately, impelled by good publicity in tracking down
``deadbeat dads,'' Clinton policy has been in the opposite
direction _ toward a national ID card, a requirement that all
Americans carry ``papers.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's the good news: The Supreme Court, with all nine
justices in unaccustomed unison, Wednesday struck a blow against a
dangerous form of invasion of privacy: the sale by state
governments to private investigators of the personal data and
picture on your application for a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   Some states sell those applications, complete with color photo,
to anybody for about a buck a throw. A decade ago, a stalker in
California was able to use this license information to find and
identify a starlet named Rebecca Schaeffer _ and murdered her. That
led to a federal law, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, that
allowed drivers to ``opt out'' _ putting the burden of refusal on
the applicant who did not want his personal information sold.
</P>
<P>
   The state of South Carolina challenged Congress' right to pass
such a law, saying it infringed on states' rights to regulate
driving. A federal appeals court agreed, ridiculing a right to
privacy in personal information such as a birth date on a license
``often needed to cash a check, board an airplane, or purchase
alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Rehnquist court has been powerful in stopping
Congress' three-generation habit of snatching power from the
states, the betting was that this case would continue that
anti-centralist trend.
</P>
<P>
   But to the relief of those who think personal freedom worth
preserving, the anti-centralist majority on the court, despite its
states'-rights predilections, stretched its reasoning to find that
Congress ``did not run afoul of the federalism principles.'' The
liberal minority joined in, resulting in a stunning 9-0 decision
upholding privacy.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the strengthening of the act by Sen. Richard
Shelby, supported by Frank Wolf in the House, will also pass
muster. They changed the weak ``opt out'' clause to a tough ``opt
in'' _ meaning that motor vehicle bureaus everywhere must soon seek
drivers' written consent before selling marketers photos and
information about age, domicile or disability.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said the decision ``will help protect women from
stalkers, keep telemarketers from interrupting dinner and give
people peace of mind that private information collected by the
government is secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates (Steve Forbes excepted) fail to see
privacy as a gut principle to defend, but the Supreme Court does.
As hope glimmers, pay cash and don't give out your Social Security
number.

 &HT;    Virgin Mary visionary, ex-followers settle suit
 &HT;    By Henry Farber
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nancy Fowler, the housewife who claimed to get visions
from the Virgin Mary, has settled a lawsuit with a group of her
former pilgrims who no longer are seeking to use her writings in
their literature.
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale County Judge Sidney Nation closed the case on Fowler's
writings when he formally accepted a statement by the Our Loving
Mother's Children group relinquishing rights to some publications.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, group leader Robert Hughes said a religious
dispute of this nature should not be debated in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``After considerable prayer ... and discernment, it has been
determined that a court battle over Nancy Fowler's message is
inappropriate and displeasing to the Lord and the Blessed Mother,''
Hughes wrote. He listed a half-dozen titles of books and booklets
his group no longer wants to publish, including ``The
Commandment,'' ``There is Too Little Faith'' and ``Be Children of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rare example in court these days of somebody turning
the other cheek,'' said Michael Powell, an attorney for Our Loving
Mother's Children. ``Otherwise, this (litigation) would destroy
whatever good has come of the prayerfulness that has come to
Conyers through her visions.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ends one lawsuit in a legal battle between Fowler
and Our Loving Mother's Children, which helped to organize huge
gatherings at Fowler's Rockdale County farm and published her
writings in several books.
</P>
<P>
   However, a larger dispute between Fowler and the organization
remains in a separate lawsuit in Rockdale County Superior Court. In
that suit, Fowler accuses Our Loving Mother's Children of
racketeering and fraud, claiming the group misappropriated money
from donations and book sales. Organizers had handled Fowler's
finances since 1987 until she distanced herself with a lawsuit last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Our Loving Mother's Children have said Fowler
is jealous because the group diverted its attention to a rival
visionary, Catalina Rivas of Bolivia, after Fowler stopped having
her visions.
</P>
<P>
   A Fowler lawyer said her representatives would not comment on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler announced in 1998 that she would no longer experience
visions of the Virgin Mary, which had attracted large Catholic
prayer groups to the property surrounding her home since the late
1980s.

COMMENTARY: AN HONEST VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first thing you should understand is that Terri
Thomson and Harold Levy are thoughtful, honorable and hard-working
individuals who care a great deal about the New York City school
system. Both spend an enormous amount of their time trying to make
it better. So when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani starts publicly
badmouthing them, recklessly assailing the motives of one and the
qualifications of the other, he does them a disservice.
</P>
<P>
   The school system in New York City is undergoing major changes
and can do without the bullying and the hysterics and the cheap
politics of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomson, the Board of Education member from Queens, has been
a reasonably steadfast ally of Giuliani's, although you'd never
know it from the mayor's most recent comments. When Giuliani and
his closest allies on the board became fed up with the latest
chancellor, Rudy Crew, Ms. Thomson was right there with the swing
vote that sent Crew packing.
</P>
<P>
   She has consistently sided with the mayor on major issues since
her appointment to the board in July 1998. But Ms. Thomson is not a
robot programmed by City Hall, and on Sunday she had the temerity
to cross the mayor by casting the deciding vote for Levy to serve
as an interim chancellor until a permanent replacement for Crew is
found.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's response was swift and ugly. As Abby Goodnough wrote
in Monday's Times: ``Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that Ms. Thomson's
vote was ethically questionable. `She gave no explanation for her
vote,' he said. `So, you know, in the absence of an explanation, we
have to search for one.'''
</P>
<P>
   That comment, a typically cheap shot, alluded to the fact that
Ms. Thomson and Levy both work at Citigroup. The question of any
potential conflict had been presented to Board of Education lawyers
well in advance of the vote and they ruled there was no problem.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's assertion that Ms. Thomson gave no reason for her
vote was wildly untrue. She has said again and again that she found
Levy's strong background in business management as well as
education compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover _ and this is where the politics get really twisted _
the mayor had initially made it clear to the board members and
others that he had no use for the man he ended up supporting for
the interim chancellor post, Robert Kiley. The mayor's acolytes,
board member Ninfa Segarra first among them, let it be known that
Kiley, the executive director of the New York City Partnership, was
not acceptable _ repeat, not acceptable _ to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   And then, after the interviews had progressed and several board
members had been profoundly impressed by Levy, came a sudden change
from City Hall. Let the word go forth, it has to be Bob Kiley.
Forget all previous pronouncements. The mayor wants Kiley.
</P>
<P>
   To her credit, Terri Thomson did not succumb to the madness.
She's a fan of Robert Kiley, admires him a great deal. But she cast
her vote for Harold Levy because she felt he was the best choice.
</P>
<P>
   You can agree or disagree, but it was an honest vote.
</P>
<P>
   As for Levy, he's widely seen as a dedicated and gifted man. In
1994 he was chosen to head a commission that examined the physical
condition of the city's schools. The commission's report, issued in
June 1995, found that a generation of underfunding by the city and
the state, combined with ``flawed management'' by the Board of
Education, had brought school buildings ``to a state of imminent
calamity.''
</P>
<P>
   The report led to billions of dollars in new funding for
maintenance and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Levy is a Citigroup executive and a lawyer who has immersed
himself for years in critical state and city education issues.
Until he was named interim chancellor, he was a member of the State
Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Giuliani insists in his snarling, contemptuous way
that Levy _ a thoroughly decent guy _ is not qualified to serve the
four or six months it is expected to take to appoint a new
chancellor. He'd rather have Robert Kiley, who was anathema to the
mayor until just a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   So which do you think is on the mayor's mind _ the million or so
kids in the public schools, or politics 101? (BOX)

ICE CUBE'S ANTICS IN THE 'BURBS GOOD FOR LAUGHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Friday,'' rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube's 1995 homage to
getting high in the 'hood, was at once memorable and forgettable.
You laughed all the way through it, but it's hard to remember why.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for the sequel, ``Next Friday.'' Like the first
installment, it was written and produced by Cube, who also plays
the lead role. ``Next Friday'' has moments of pure hilarity but
suffers from a lame plot; nonetheless, you find yourself laughing
despite its predictability.
</P>
<P>
   Cube reprises his role as Craig, a jobless schmo who still lives
at home with his parents and whose ambitions are few: getting high,
chasing girls, talking trash _ hmmm, kinda like Cube's real-life
music. Four years have passed since, in a moment of frustrated
bravery, Craig laid out the neighborhood bully Debo, played then
and now by Tommy ``Tiny'' Lister Jr. Debo's getting out of the pen,
though, so Craig's parents send him from the mean streets of Los
Angeles to live with his lottery-winning relatives in suburbia.
``Mo' money,'' as Puff Daddy says, ``mo' problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Suburbia, it seems, is infested with the same quandaries that
dogged Craig's hometown. Namely, a crew of punks lives across the
street. Craig's got his eye on one of their sisters (Lisa
Rodriguez). Insert chaos here.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating things, Debo and his bumbling companion Sticky
Fingaz (uh, that is his real name) have followed Craig by stowing
away in the dog-catcher truck owned by Craig's pop, in a role
reprised by John Witherspoon, whose creaky facial expressions and
mumbled one-liners offer some of the funniest moments in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Also consistently entertaining is comedian Don ``DC'' Curry, a
staple of African-American stand-up comedy shows. Curry plays
Elroy, Craig's outrageously feisty uncle. If we're lucky, Curry
will get some bigger and better roles out of this thing.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely missed is comedian Chris Tucker, who played Craig's
in-pot-we-trust friend in the first ``Friday.'' Newcomer Mike Epps
replaces Tucker as the gawky Day-Day, but Epps lacks Tucker's
elastic body language, which was the perfect balance to Cube's
cold, emotionless stare.
</P>
<P>
   If you saw the first ``Friday,'' you know how the rest goes, and
even if you didn't, it's not hard to predict: lots of bathroom
humor, pot-smoking scenes, racial slags, crass sex jokes and a plot
line that snowballs from a little tiff to, finally, The Big Fight.
Everyone goes home happy or goes to jail.
</P>
<P>
   So predictable, but so much fun, thanks to the film's rapid-fire
delivery. It's tough, in other words, to digest all the lame
moments, because you're still laughing at the good ones. Yet this
is anything but sophisticated, brainy humor. Think of it as Cheech
and Chong starring in ``There's Something About Mary'' _ it's
shallow, crude and hardly believable. You'll have fun forgetting
it. &QL;

A HOUSE PARTY FOR ONE THAT GOT AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; The crowd gathered in Pauley Pavilion on Feb. 25, 1967 kept
chanting, ``Give the ball to Lew,'' so what else were the UCLA
Bruins supposed to do?
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore center Lew Alcindor responded with one of the greatest
performances of his legendary career, scoring a conference-record
61 points in UCLA's 100-78 victory over Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   To do it, Alcindor hit 26 of 35 shots and made three baskets in
the final minute, including a dunk at the buzzer. If the big fella
had made more than 9 of 18 free throws, he'd have approached 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played him straight (man-to-man defense),'' UCLA coach
John Wooden said at the time. ``I don't believe you can handle him
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   For 33 years, Alcindor's performance stood as the greatest in
league history. Now it has company.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in Cal's sparkling new Haas Pavilion, Arizona State
senior guard Eddie House scored 61 in a double-overtime victory
over the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most points by a major college player since Kansas
State's Askia Jones hit 62 six years ago and the most points ever
scored in the Bay Area (any level) by someone not named Rick Barry
or Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes sometimes talk about being ``in a zone.'' House was in
a different dimension. He scored 19 points in the overtime periods
and secured victory with two free throws with 2.9 seconds left. He
made 18 of 30 field goals, 7 of 10 3-pointers and 18 of 19 free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, House screamed, ``This is my house,'' and with good
reason. The Union City resident and Hayward High School graduate
did not receive a scholarship offer in 1995-96 from then-Cal coach
Todd Bozeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to me to come back home and get a win like
this,'' said House, who had his number retired at Hayward last
week.
</P>
<P>
   House saved his best for the Bears, but he's been picking on
everyone. In the six games since an 0-of-16 performance against
Brigham Young, he's averaging 37.5 points. He's the first player to
win the Pac-10 player-of-the-week award three straight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what Cal was thinking,'' said UCLA guard Ray
Young, an Oakland native who played against House in high school.
``I never envisioned anybody going for 60 at this level, but I
could definitely see Eddie getting 40. He puts in the work. The
dude just works.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to compare House's 61 to Alcindor's 61. House
had 10 more minutes, courtesy of two overtimes, and he made seven
3-pointers, which didn't exist in Alcindor's time. (The issue is
moot anyway; Wooden never would have let Alcindor shoot from 19
feet.)
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the 7-1 Alcindor was physically superior to his
competition, while House, at 6-1, is small by today's standards.
</P>
<P>
   There's really only one way to solve the argument: House has to
score 62.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; The right direction: The NCAA Convention lost its bite a
few years ago when college presidents and CEOs removed power from
the membership and gave it to committees.
</P>
<P>
   But one issue discussed in San Diego earlier this week is worth
noting: the elimination of summer basketball recruiting, which
would disempower the AAU coaches, camp organizers and leeches that
push _ and, in some cases, broker _ players to various colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Limit evaluation periods to the school year, the theory goes,
and you return influence to high school coaches, who are easier to
police than AAU coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last seven or eight years, the recruiting pendulum has
swung back to the more unseamly side,'' Oregon State coach Eddie
Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Desert depletion: Richard Jefferson's broken foot leaves
Arizona with seven scholarship players, and three freshmen in the
starting lineup: point guard Jason Gardner, wing guard Gilbert
Arenas and small forward Luke Walton, who replaced Jefferson
against Stanford and contributed seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson is out 6-8 weeks. He'll wear a removable boot, not a
cast, enabling him to maintain conditioning through aquatic drills.
It's possible he'll return in time to help the Wildcats in March,
but they aren't counting on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go as if he's not coming back at all,'' Arizona
coach Lute Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Jefferson is a bigger blow to Arizona than JaRon Rush's
suspension is to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Around the Pac-10: As Arizona showed, Stanford won't make a
deep run in the NCAA Tournament without superior play from one of
its guards _ the kind Art Lee provided in the 1998 Final Four run.
</P>
<P>
   Washington forward Thalo Green, who sports a Bill Walton '73
hairstyle, will grow his locks all season then donate them to the
American Cancer Society, which makes wigs for chemotherapy
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Cal might not have the best freshman class in the league, but
with so much playing time available, it's certainly the most
productive: Joe Shipp, Brian Wethers, Shantay Legans and Nick
Vander Laan scored 67 points against Arizona State _ six more than
House.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State center Jason Heide, one of the most underrated
players in the league, is using a cumbersome brace on his injured
right (shooting) thumb. The Beavers desperately need his
production.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: If he stays healthy and stays four years, Jason
Kapono will have the best career in Westwood since David Greenwood
(1976-79).

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON LEAVES LETTERMAN CROWD LAUGHING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton finally went on ``The Late
Show with David Letterman'' Wednesday night, and left the crowd _
and her once-taunting host _ laughing and cheering.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Letterman had been making an almost nightly shtick of
the First Lady's failure to appear on his CBS talk show, saying, at
one point, ``If she's going to be the Senator from New York, she
owes it to her constituency to be on this program because, it's no
secret, we are kingmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   His jokes about the Clintons were becoming more and more
merciless, and he began referring to Mrs. Clinton's campaign
staffers as ``pinheads'' and ``weasels.''
</P>
<P>
   When she at last sat in the guest chair, the funnyman was
gracious, even a little nervous, and the candidate-First Lady
stepped into the spirit of the show right out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that she has just moved into a new house in Chappaqua,
N.Y., Letterman asked if she was annoyed that ``every idiot is
going to drive by, honking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton replied, ``Was that you?''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone loved it.
</P>
<P>
   Before she appeared, Walter Cronkite, the august former newsman,
walked out on stage and solemnly told Letterman, ``Tonight you're
interviewing the First Lady.'' Pause. ``Try not to be a jackass,
will you?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton came up with her own Top Ten list _ a parody of a
regular feature on the show: ``Top 10 Reasons Why I, Hillary
Clinton, Finally Decided to Appear on `The Late Show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Reason number 10 was ``I lost a bet with Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons: ``If Dan Quayle did it, how hard could it be?...
I needed an excuse to get out of dinner with Donald Trump... To
tell you the truth, I thought Johnny hosted this show.'' Finally,
Reason Number 1: ``If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   While hardly a crucial moment in the campaign, going on
Letterman was a step of risks and opportunities. If she came off as
awkward, it would reinforce her widespread stereotype as
standoffish. If she came off as relaxed, it could dispel the image.
In any case, videoclips could materialize at random all through
this year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Burnett, the show's executive producer, said Mrs. Clinton's
``people'' sent over the Top 10 list ahead of time, though he
didn't identify these people. He said there were no advance ground
rules to the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's campaign has not yet taken off. The latest polls
show her trailing Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 49-41, with her
positive ratings falling below 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Burnett said the polls were not the reason behind her
appearance. For all Letterman's complaining, Mrs. Clinton's
campaign staff had said back in November that she would probably
appear in early January.
</P>
<P>
   She got in a few cracks at Giuliani, noting, ``He's done a lot
of stuff as mayor, but I think being a senator is a different kind
of job _ as senator, for instance, you can't go arrest a homeless
person.''
</P>
<P>
   She also dealt with the ``carpetbagger'' issue, saying she would
have lived in New York after the White House, even as a private
citizen, and, besides, ``New York has always attracted people from
all over the world _ that's what makes it such a great place to
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she aced a quiz about New York _ which Letterman
prefaced by saying her performance on it ``could make or break the
entire campaign'' _ identifying the state's official bird, tree,
number of counties, highest mountain range, and Great Lakes
borders.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Letterman _ who has had Giuliani on his show 16
times since 1994 and clearly gets along well with the mayor _
advised her: ``If you want to run a dirty campaign, mention
Giuliani's hair. It drives him nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton walked out of the studio at 6:30 _ the show is
taped hours before its 11:30 p.m. broadcast _ clearly elated,
telling reporters, ``I had a wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Dees, a staffer on the program who saw her afterward,
said, ``She knew she hit a home run.''

 &HT;    Turner's donations promote teamwork, U.N. official says
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two years ago, just as Atlanta businessman Ted Turner
was setting up the U.N. Foundation to administer his gift of $1
billion over 10 years to United Nations projects, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Louise Frechette as the
body's first deputy secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the foundation has distributed nearly $200 million,
mostly to projects on population and women's issues, children's
health and the environment. And Frechette, 53, a Canadian diplomat,
has helped implement Annan's U.N. reform, designed in part to
increase cooperation between different U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with staff writer Don Melvin, Frechette
talked of the U.N.'s ``10-year marriage'' with Turner, and said the
billionaire's goals mesh well with those of the international body.
Excerpts from that conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q: (Officials of Turner's U.N. Foundation) have gotten their
pace up to the $100 million a year they envisioned. Compared to the
$4billion a year spent by U.N. agencies on development, can that
type of money have a significant impact?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, absolutely. This is not an insignificant amount of money
in itself. Yes, of course, in relation to the full amount of ODA
(Official Development Aid) money spent around the world, or even
just by U.N. agencies, it's a small proportion.
</P>
<P>
   But first of all, Turner wanted to focus his effort. They chose
three very clear areas of concentration. Within that we have been
working with them _ quite productively, I must say _ in precisely
identifying where this kind of money can actually make a
difference. I think we've come a long way from a very general
concept of how we can work together, to now, a fairly detailed
understanding of what are the priorities.
</P>
<P>
   This is a kind of 10-year marriage we have with Turner, so I'm
sure that over time they may decide that they want to branch out or
add or subtract to the priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But once you start narrowing down the areas where you want to
work, (that amount) can make a big difference. Especially since
Turner is also very interested in, to the maximum extent possible,
trying to bring in other partners. And he wanted to use his money
to leverage other contributions or to leverage our own U.N. money.
</P>
<P>
   Q: (U.N. Foundation President) Tim Wirth has said that in
addition to the areas you were talking about, the U.N. Foundation
had other goals. One was promoting cooperation between different
agencies, another was strengthening the role of the
secretary-general, and another was building a constituency for the
U.N. in the United States. Taking those one at a time, how
effective has the U.N. Foundation been so far in strengthening the
role of the secretary-general?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is a tool the secretary-general can use to pursue his
reform. In a sense, point one and point two are intimately linked.
Since the projects pursued are based on recommendations the
secretary-general makes, it gives him a voice within the U.N.
system that he wouldn't have when contributions go directly to one
or another U.N. agency. In that sense, it's been helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Turner came in with his funds at the beginning of the
secretary-general's reform proposals. And we're seeing that this
and many other things have contributed, in fact, to creating quite
a different type of relationship within the U.N. system, where the
secretary-general is increasingly acting and recognized as sort of
the head of the family. The fact that we meet once a week to
video-conference, and that there's much, much closer interaction
between the secretary-general and the heads of the funds and
programs, as well as the heads of the departments here is another
example.
</P>
<P>
   So the Turner contribution fits in very well within the bigger
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some people might think that if the U.N. agencies have to
make Ted Turner happy _ after all, it's Turner's money _ that could
weaken the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not at all. Because I think the basis of our understanding
with Turner and Tim Wirth and the people in the U.N. Foundation is
that there is a very broad area of cooperation where Turner is
interested in doing things, and it fits very, very well within
established U.N. priorities.
</P>
<P>
   You know, I'm sure there are things that we might like to use
this money for, but this is not part of Turner's priorities, and
it's accepted. And in the same way, there may be things that one
day Turner would like to fund through the U.N. Foundation, but it's
not part of our established policy and priority, and they respect
that fully.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Increasingly, the U.N. Foundation is awarding grants only to
projects that have been developed jointly by two or more U.N.
agencies. Is that having an effect on the culture of the U.N.?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it is a contributing incentive to a trend that is now
pretty strong in the U.N. system.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been told that in the past, in many places around the
world, representatives of different U.N. agencies rarely met, if
ever.
</P>
<P>
   A: Now they probably would say they meet too often.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you have that situation, it seems it would be difficult
to have a coordinated assault on disease or poverty. How did the
U.N. evolve into such a state?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think (that) stems from a much greater degree of
sophistication in the U.N., and I'd say the international
community's understanding of the phenomenon of development _ that
there are complex interactions and interrelationships among various
dimensions of development. And that for successful development to
work, you really have to have a holistic understanding of the
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   So among what I call the inner family of the U.N. system _ the
UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA (U.N. Development Program, U.N. Children's
Fund, and U.N. Population Fund) _ it is mandatory. They must work
together.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for the specialized agencies, who do not have any
formal accountability relationship with the secretary-general, this
comes in quite naturally, because that makes sense. So it is very
good to have the kinds of funds that Turner has offered to try to
relate to the team concept. That's fairly innovative. And I think
over time we want to develop more and more this notion that we can
fund not only one program or the other, but that we can fund a
team.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With regard to political support in the United States, you
have Republicans who campaign against allowing any troops to be
under U.N. command. You have a Democratic president who did an end
run around the U.N. when he felt military action was necessary in
Yugoslavia. What's your assessment of the support that the U.N. has
in the United States and the difference, or lack of it, that the
U.N. Foundation is making?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Better World Fund (a sister organization to the U.N.
Foundation) has done some very interesting polling in the United
States about the U.N., which demonstrates that in fact there is
quite a lot of support. And that the perception of opinion-makers
and leaders of that support is significantly lower than the
reality. So in a sense, it's very comforting to know that. We're
not operating in a hostile environment _ far from it.
</P>
<P>
   What this polling has shown, however, is that the knowledge and
understanding of what the U.N. actually does is pretty shallow.
There are things that make the headlines all the time. These things
tend to be peacekeeping, essentially. But in fact the U.N. is not
only about peacekeeping. It's about just about every aspect of
human life. What it does is in fact very concrete. You can trace
back some things that affect your daily life to action in the U.N.
But most people in the United States don't necessarily see that. In
developing countries our presence is that of those humanitarian and
development agencies. In the developed world it's a tougher sell.
And that's where I think Turner's efforts can help very much.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What, other than dollars, does Ted Turner bring to this
enterprise?
</P>
<P>
   A: What was very useful for the U.N. is that, by choosing to go
public with such a big commitment, he drew the attention around the
world to the U.N., to the fact that it needed the support of people
who have influence as well as money. And he really did challenge
people with similar resources to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Former President Carter has said he thinks the biggest
problem in the new century is the increasing gap between the
world's rich and the world's poor. He doesn't see that turning
around, and it creates instability.
</P>
<P>
   A: I would share very much President Carter's assessment. I
think if you talk to most people in the U.N., that would probably
be the first thing they will mention _ the need to be more
aggressive on reducing the gap between rich and poor, and making a
real dent in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact is, it is possible. If one looks at it in a general
sense of, we'll eradicate poverty, some people tend to be very,
very skeptical. But if you break it down into concrete things, what
does it mean? It means people having access to clean water, and
having a primary education for all, and sending girls to school,
and eradicating some of the real endemic diseases like malaria and
a few other things, doing something on HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   All of these things, if you take them one by one and you look at
what would be needed, you realize that in fact you can make a real
difference if there is a convergence of efforts and a real
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   And, frankly, Ted Turner decided that he wanted to put his
weight behind the pursuit of a couple of goals. Bravo.

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON LEAVES LETTERMAN CROWD LAUGHING

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton finally went on ``The Late
Show with David Letterman'' Wednesday night, and left the crowd _
and her once-taunting host _ laughing and cheering.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Letterman had been making an almost nightly shtick of
the First Lady's failure to appear on his CBS talk show, saying, at
one point, ``If she's going to be the Senator from New York, she
owes it to her constituency to be on this program because, it's no
secret, we are kingmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   His jokes about the Clintons were becoming more and more
merciless, and he began referring to Mrs. Clinton's campaign
staffers as ``pinheads'' and ``weasels.''
</P>
<P>
   When she at last sat in the guest chair, the funnyman was
gracious, even a little nervous, and the candidate-First Lady
stepped into the spirit of the show right out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that she has just moved into a new house in Chappaqua,
N.Y., Letterman asked if she was annoyed that ``every idiot is
going to drive by, honking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton replied, ``Was that you?''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone loved it.
</P>
<P>
   Before she appeared, Walter Cronkite, the august former newsman,
walked out on stage and solemnly told Letterman, ``Tonight you're
interviewing the First Lady.'' Pause. ``Try not to be a jackass,
will you?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton came up with her own Top Ten list _ a parody of a
regular feature on the show: ``Top 10 Reasons Why I, Hillary
Clinton, Finally Decided to Appear on `The Late Show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Reason number 10 was ``I lost a bet with Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons: ``If Dan Quayle did it, how hard could it be?...
I needed an excuse to get out of dinner with Donald Trump... To
tell you the truth, I thought Johnny hosted this show.'' Finally,
Reason Number 1: ``If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   While hardly a crucial moment in the campaign, going on
Letterman was a step of risks and opportunities. If she came off as
awkward, it would reinforce her widespread stereotype as
standoffish. If she came off as relaxed, it could dispel the image.
In any case, videoclips could materialize at random all through
this year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Burnett, the show's executive producer, said Mrs. Clinton's
``people'' sent over the Top 10 list ahead of time, though he
didn't identify these people. He said there were no advance ground
rules to the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's campaign has not yet taken off. The latest polls
show her trailing Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 49-41, with her
positive ratings falling below 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Burnett said the polls were not the reason behind her
appearance. For all Letterman's complaining, Mrs. Clinton's
campaign staff had said back in November that she would probably
appear in early January.
</P>
<P>
   She got in a few cracks at Giuliani, noting, ``He's done a lot
of stuff as mayor, but I think being a senator is a different kind
of job _ as senator, for instance, you can't go arrest a homeless
person.''
</P>
<P>
   She also dealt with the ``carpetbagger'' issue, saying she would
have lived in New York after the White House, even as a private
citizen, and, besides, ``New York has always attracted people from
all over the world _ that's what makes it such a great place to
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she aced a quiz about New York _ which Letterman
prefaced by saying her performance on it ``could make or break the
entire campaign'' _ identifying the state's official bird, tree,
number of counties, highest mountain range, and Great Lakes
borders.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Letterman _ who has had Giuliani on his show 16
times since 1994 and clearly gets along well with the mayor _
advised her: ``If you want to run a dirty campaign, mention
Giuliani's hair. It drives him nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton walked out of the studio at 6:30 _ the show is
taped hours before its 11:30 p.m. broadcast _ clearly elated,
telling reporters, ``I had a wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Dees, a staffer on the program who saw her afterward,
said, ``She knew she hit a home run.''

 &HT;    Philips Electronics expanding
 &HT;    By Tony Wilbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Downtown Atlanta has Philips Arena and the huge
Philips sign. But DeKalb County will keep the headquarters of
Philips Consumer Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Wednesday it has signed a lease to double its
office space near Perimeter Mall, where it will expand its North
American headquarters. Philips Electronics already has 370
employees and will use the extra space to accommodate growth and
relocate jobs from other cities, spokeswoman Katrina Blauvelt said.
</P>
<P>
   She would not say how many people Philips would add, but the
company doubled the amount of space it leases to 180,942 square
feet. It signed a 10-year lease. ``It's been a pretty rapid
growth,'' Blauvelt said.
</P>
<P>
   A division of Royal Philips Electronics of the Netherlands,
Philips Electronics relocated its North American headquarters from
Knoxville, Tenn., to Atlanta in April 1997. Philips Electronics,
which produces televisions, CDs, DVDs, radios, digital audio
players and other electronic goods for consumers, had considered
locations in North Carolina, Texas and New Jersey before selecting
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move to Atlanta has been a very positive one for the
company,'' said Robert Minkhorst, president and chief executive of
Philips Consumer Electronics North America. ``You can see our
presence here when you drive by the Philips Arena, and now you will
be able to see our presence within Perimeter Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Blauvelt would not say if the new lease agreement will allow
Philips to hang a sign on the building. However, it is common for
landlords to allow major tenants to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In its recent search for a permanent North American
headquarters, Philips considered locations in DeKalb, Fulton and
Cobb counties. The company did not consider downtown because it
promised employees who moved to the Perimeter Mall area in 1997
that it would not stray too far when it selected its permanent
site, Blauvelt said.
</P>
<P>
   Philips' decision to stay in DeKalb reflects confidence in the
county's business environment, said DeKalb CEO Liane Levetan. ``We
didn't get the (Philips) Arena, but we are thrilled to have such a
prestigious worldwide organization be a part of the international
business community of DeKalb County,'' said Levetan, who personally
appealed to Philips to stay in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Philips' decision is another win for Perimeter Center and its
owner, Equity Office Properties Trust of Chicago. The real estate
investment trust bought the 3.3 million-square-foot park at
Interstate 285 and Ashford-Dunwoody Road in late 1997 as part of
its acquisition of Beacon Properties of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The lease also means Equity has started 2000 the same way it
ended 1999. Last year, several companies including BellSouth.net,
Nova Corp. and One Health Plan leased spaces of 90,000 square feet
or more at Perimeter Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing companies are our favorite problem,'' said Kristie
Abney, managing director at Equity. ``(Philips') decision to make
Perimeter Center their long-term home just really validates this
market's attractiveness.''

<P>
   MADBURY, N.H. _ Joy Wilson, a 24-year-old music teacher here in
southeastern New Hampshire, decided to vote for Gov. George W. Bush
in the Republican presidential primary because he had skipped a
debate to attend an event in Texas honoring his wife. Although Bush
was savaged by local Republicans for not showing up, Ms. Wilson
says the decision illuminated his values.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the whole wife thing that clinched it for me,'' she said.
``Besides, I like his dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Cooper Burkholder, a semiretired saleswoman here who
describes herself as of Social Security age, said she favored Vice
President Al Gore, because ``he's a good man and seems to have a
very good wife.''
</P>
<P>
   David Parker, 61, a truck driver from New Ipswich, N.H., said he
was leaning toward Sen. John McCain, in part because McCain had
been a prisoner of war in Vietnam. ``We owe him something,'' Parker
said. ``That guy went through hell.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than 50 interviews in Madbury _ best known as the
hometown of the Democratic governor, Jeanne Shaheen _ and elsewhere
around this state, voters were hard pressed to come up with a
policy issue on which they would select their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in contrast to the New Hampshire primary voters of four
or eight years ago, who were bursting with worries about the
economy, the voters here this year seem fairly content. That leaves
them the luxury to focus even more than in recent elections on the
personal attributes of the candidates, the candidates' spouses, the
candidates' parents and, in the case of Gore, the candidate's boss.
Little is heard of issues raised in debates, in television
advertisements, in news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing McCain, for example, few voters mentioned the
intense coverage over letters he wrote to regulators on behalf of
contributors. The dueling remedies for health care put forth by
Gore and his Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, rarely
cropped up. Voters did not seem familiar with, or interested in,
the tax-cut proposals of Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch people and pick out a personality you like,'' said
Richard Colprit, 50, who owns a flower business here and mused
about candidates as if he were inspecting petals on the latest
bloom of roses. ``That's why these guys are out shaking hands and
kissing voters. It's personalities that get them the job. It's
who's got the biggest smile. That's what elects people.''
</P>
<P>
   Colprit, who favors Bush, is not the only one who looks for the
smile, the smirk or other telltale clues of character and
disposition in deciding a candidate's fitness for the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The views of New Hampshire voters should not be considered
lightly. They are among the most spoiled voters in the nation. Many
have been courted personally by candidates and they are far from
oblivious to the intense politicking.
</P>
<P>
   With just three weeks before the first primary takes place,
polls here show that Gore and Bradley are locked in a neck and neck
competition on the Democratic side; so are two Republicans, McCain
and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates are aggressively seeking to differentiate
themselves on issues, most voters interviewed said they did not see
much daylight between McCain and Bush _ or Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, McCain and Bush are not that different,'' said
Colprit, who said his decision to back Bush has nothing to do with
the fact that the Bush campaign bought 1,000 yellow roses for a
Bush event when the governor first arrived in New Hampshire last
year. ``I've been a Bush supporter because of his family
background, his social values. And he has the whole party behind
him. McCain is a little better speaker. But I have complete faith
in George Bush, that he would gather good people around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Foley, 37, a special education teacher in Portsmouth,
said, ``I think Gore and Bradley are very similar. They're trying
to make themselves different. I'm leaning more toward Gore. My only
concern about Bradley is he may not have the experience or
sophistication to represent us internationally. His remarks can be
a little crude. His ideas don't seem as well thought out as Gore.
Gore seems to have more specific answers. But I like that Bradley
is somewhat of a maverick.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Foley said she would not dare vote for Bush because of his
facial expressions. ``He has that Bill Clinton smirk that goes
right through me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Burkholder backs Gore, she said she ``would not be
heart-broken'' if Bradley snatches the nomination from him. ``They
are men who are a lot alike,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Likening her candidate to the ghost of Jacob Marley, Scrooge's
former businesss partner who was weighted down with a chain, Ms.
Burkholder said, ``Of course, he's dragging Clinton behind him like
Marley and his chain. Remember `A Christmas Carol?' ''

SEAHAWKS TO INTERVIEW SIDWELL FOR DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New England Patriots' coaching carousel spins on as
the hunt to replace deposed Pete Carroll continues to play out.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Seattle Seahawks asked and received permission to
interview Patriots defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell for the same
position under Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell, who has been Carroll's defensive coordinator for three
years, confirmed he was in the process of setting a time to fly to
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell, who interviewed for the Patriots' head coaching
position last week, still has not heard back from Green Bay, which
asked permission to speak to him about its head job.
</P>
<P>
   Also associated with the Patriots' preference to land Bill
Belichick as their coach and general manager is a grievance hearing
to be held Thursday in New York to determine the validity of
Belichick's contract with the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Jets director of football operations Bill Parcells is also
expected to be at the hearing after Parcells had his first meeting
with new owner Robert ``Woody'' Johnson at the Jets' offices at
Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing appears to be the first step toward Belichick being
cleared to go elsewhere, presumably the Patriots, though
Belichick's side has been floating talk of other teams entering the
mix. There have been unconfirmed reports that Belichick is said to
be sought by the Dallas Cowboys, who fired Chan Gailey Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, who took over the Jets when Parcells retired at
season's end, quit Jan. 4 after one day as coach.
</P>
<P>
   If the decision is made that Belichick's contract is binding _
and the NFL has already made it clear it thinks it is _ either side
might then request Tagliabue to decide compensation through
arbitration. Tagliabue could also recommend a compensation figure,
but it would not be binding.
</P>
<P>
   That compensation will likely be less than the Patriots received
from the Jets three years ago when they forfeited a first-,
second-, third-, and fourth-round pick over a three-year period.
The compensation this time could be a second- and third-round pick
over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have decided not to interview any more candidates
to replace Pete Carroll until either the Belichick issue is
resolved or until St. Louis or Jacksonville is eliminated from the
playoffs. The Patriots are interested in talking to Rams offensive
coordinator Mike Martz and Jaguars defensive coordinator Dom
Capers.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coaches are preparing to head to Mobile, Ala., on
Monday for the Jan. 22 Senior Bowl, while Patriots vice president
of player personnel Bobby Grier will return from workouts for
Saturday's East-West Shrine game Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese's name is already
being tossed around as a possible head coach in Dallas after
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones bounced Gailey Tuesday. Gailey survived
only two seasons, going 18-16 in the regular season but 0-2 in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Zampese, 63, said Wednesday he's not interested. ``I've had
some opportunities in the past and I've turned them down,'' said
Zampese. ``That's not for me. I'm an offensive coordinator and
that's what I think I do best. I'm flattered when I hear that, but
I was meant to be sitting in that square box up there calling
plays. Nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Zampese was not interviewed for the Patriots' head job. He said,
to his knowledge, nobody had called the Patriots to ask permission
to speak to him about a job.
</P>
<P>
   With all of Zampese's contacts around the league and the
disciples of his offense, it appears he would have no trouble
finding work if he is fired by the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   One of his protege's is Martz, who is expected to get strong
consideration for one of the five jobs currently available. If
Martz gets a job, you can bet Zampese might be high atop his list
as a coordinator. Martz worked for Zampese with the Rams for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought (Washington Redskins coach and Zampese
follower) Norv (Turner) would be a very good head coach and I think
the same way about Mike,'' Zampese said. ``He's a bright young guy
with great ideas. You never know with anyone until you hire them
and give them the chance. Someone did that with Norv and someone
has to do that with Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong offensive coordinators are like gold around the league
nowadays. Jones is seeking an offensive coach to replace Gailey,
which is why Zampese's name has come up, as has Turner's. Zampese
said that Martz's system is a combination of what he does and what
Turner does, but ``it's all basically the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman likes Zampese and Turner, who
coached with Zampese in Dallas, and performed his best when they
were in control of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese still has no answers as to what went wrong with the
Patriots. ``If I knew, we would have corrected it,'' he said. ``I
thought we started well and then we just dropped off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Zampese has always had a decent offensive line and running back
to augment his passing game. Those two key elements were missing in
New England.
</P>
<P>
   In another matter, Patriots coaching candidate Willie Shaw,
fired by the Oakland Raiders Tuesday as their defensive coordinator
despite leading the league's fifth-ranked defense, spoke to the
Patriots Wednesday about his version of what transpired. Shaw had
interviewed with the Patriots last week for the head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shaw's agent, Ray Anderson, Raiders coach Jon
Gruden perceived Shaw as a threat to him. Anderson also blamed the
``dysfunctional'' Oakland organization for the happenings.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said after the Raiders removed the ``supervisory''
label off Shaw's job title Monday in order to give it to defensive
backs coach Chuck Bresnahan, the Raiders asked Shaw to keep guiet
about his dismissal. Shaw refused, saying he wasn't going to lie
about being fired.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's contract with the Raiders was up. The league is furious
with Al Davis about the firing because the league has worked hard
to put minority hiring programs in place, trying to expand the
number of minority coordinators and head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Rhodes was recently fired in Green Bay, leaving the league
with only two African-American head coaches, Tampa Bay's Tony Dungy
and Minnesota's Dennis Green, both of whom are still in the NFL
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   With Shaw, Sherm Lewis and Emmitt Thomas, the Packers' offensive
and defensive coordinators who were let go with Rhodes, there are
only seven African-American coordinators left.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders are now said to be considering Carroll for the
defensive coordinator's job.

MADBURY, N.H.: Christmas Carol?''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The interviews seemed to indicate that many voters were still
puzzling out the mystery of how they will vote Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But people described the leading candidates in strikingly
similar shorthand. Again and again, voters who were asked about
Bush mentioned his family heritage, namely his father, former
President Bush. As for McCain, voters repeatedly cited his
suffering as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and his
tell-it-like-it-is manner.
</P>
<P>
   The impression voters had of Gore was his relationship with
Clinton _ and very few thought it was a positive attribute, though
some gave the vice president credit for his seasoning in the White
House. People seemed to have less fixed opinions of Bradley; many
said they liked him because he seemed to be a fresher face than
Gore _ and was not burdened by the Clinton connection.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kurtz, 35, a Republican, said he was torn between Bush and
McCain, but said the governor may be more desirable because of his
family background. ``Bush has his father to rely on if he gets
stuck,'' said Kurtz, an air traffic controller at Logan airport in
Boston, as he was looking for a video to rent at a shop near his
home in Dover, N.H. ``That's a joke!''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was truly kidding, Kurtz turned serious: ``He has
connections. I liked his dad as president. McCain did very well in
the debate the other night. And he came up with the war stories _
that's pretty interesting stuff. But I don't know if he has the
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Ted Olivo, 28, a shipping supervisor at a Wal Mart in Dover,
said he too favors Bush because he liked his father. ``I'm sure
he'll give the same position on foreign policy that his father had:
Don't mess with the U.S. of A.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   As he was pumping gas in Madbury on a wind-whipped night, Perry
Shaw, a supermarket manager, said he was leaning toward McCain.
``I'm watching the debates, listening to them all,'' he said. ``But
McCain seems like a straight shooter. He says what he thinks right
off. I respect him for what he's been through in Vietnam. That
wouldn't decide my vote, but it's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who is 48, said he was withholding judgment on Bush.
``He's raised a lot of money,'' he said. ``But I want to hear his
opinions more.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Democrats said Gore benefited from his experience in
the White House, voter after voter said his ties to Clinton were
his biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's forever doomed because he's linked to Clinton,''
said Diane Lynch, 28, a graduate social work student at the
University of New Hampshire. ``I think he wants to back away and
put some distances between himself and Bill Clinton. And who can
blame him? He thinks that's his ticket in, that's his way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Lynch said she has nothing against Gore, but is
backing Bradley because she does not think the vice president can
overcome the cloud of Clinton. ``Does he rub me the wrong way?
No,'' she said of Gore. But she said Bradley appealed to her
because ``he's very similar to Gore but he's taking it to the next
liberal level.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Mary Desmond, 26, a systems anaylst from Hampton, N.H., said she
said backing Gore because ``he's not a snake like his boss. He just
seems to have a lot of family values and seems to be a normal
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hampsey, 36, a property rental manager from Jaffrey, N.H.,
who was one of the few voters interviewed who gave Gore credit for
the economy. ``I don't want to get off the bus right now, so that's
why I'm continuing to support Al Gore. Now if it was back in '90
when the economy stunk, then I'd consider trying to find somebody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore seemed widely disliked by Republicans, many had
nice things to say about Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley's the lesser of two evils they have on the
Democratic side,'' said Mark Chaffee, 28, a web systems developer
from the town near here of Somersworth. ``There's nothing that Bill
Bradley has said that I can disagree with. I've never liked Al Gore
at all. I don't find him to be very likable and being associated
with the administration is going to put him in a bad light for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaffee said that while ``it varies every day,'' on this day he
was leaning toward McCain but was also intrigued by Bush and Steve
Forbes, the wealthy publisher. ``I think I like McCain a little
more than the other two,'' he said. ``He seems to have a strong
character. That gives him an edge at this point.'' But, Chaffee
conceded, ``There's not a custom-made candidate for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who the perfect choice would be, he laughed, ``Ronald
Reagan.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMS. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most voters brushed off the candidacies of the four other
Republican contenders. ``I kind of like Steve Forbes but he is
becoming kind of a joke,'' said Stacie Gregg, 28, a paramedical
worker in Dover. ``He keeps running and nothing happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Colprit, who owns the rose shop, was more direct. ``Forbes is a
joke,'' he said. ``You have to be realistic about whether they're
going to win. I'm sorry. Alan Keyes is a very nice person _ and I
hate to bust his bubble _ but he's not going to be elected
president.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Valerie, said she was also backing Bush, not for his
issue positions but because of his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just that Campbell's Chicken Noodle-style type of
family,'' said Mrs. Colprit, who is 40. ``The best feeling I'm
going to get is, God Bless America! Clinton is out and we've got
the Bush family.''

 &HT;    Investment council targeting Latin America
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Overseas Private Investment Council is targeting
Latin America for U.S. investment deals, despite recent economic
turmoil in the region, and is looking to Atlanta to play a role.
</P>
<P>
   George Munoz, president and chief executive officer of the
federal agency, was in town last week to assess local interest in a
regional conference the agency is planning in Atlanta this year to
promote Latin American investment. He came away positive about
local interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an excitement and a definite capability,'' he said,
noting the involvement in Latin America of such local companies as
Coca-Cola, BellSouth, CNN, Southern Co. and Delta Air Lines.
``Atlanta is more and more coming to be known in Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   OPIC offers political risk insurance, project financing and
investment funds to U.S. businesses, large and small, that invest
in emerging markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has a portfolio of $18 billion and 650 projects
ranging from electric power plants to shrimp farms.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to foster economic development in countries that are
prime markets for U.S. exports, which in turn creates more jobs at
home. Since 1971, OPIC has supported $121 billion worth of
investments that it says will generate $58 billion in U.S. exports
and create more than 237,000 U.S. jobs. Congress recently
reauthorized funding for OPIC for four years, despite objections
from conservative activists who regard the agency as a risky
``corporate welfare program.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in $650 million worth of financing approved by OPIC's
board last month was $200 million in political risk insurance for
an expansion of BCP, BellSouth's cellular telephone network in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, that has 1.3 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Munoz, many big firms in the 1970s and 1980s
proceeded with investments in Latin America and elsewhere without
tapping OPIC programs because they didn't need them.
</P>
<P>
   But with recent economic turmoil in many emerging markets, OPIC
programs are becoming more popular. OPIC risk insurance, for
example, covers losses due to currency risk, expropriation and
political violence.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, said Munoz, carries about $400 million in risk
insurance for projects worldwide.

BABYSITTING, HELICOPTER CRISIS BRINGS APOLOGY FROM SWIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Abandoning her defiant stand, Lieutenant Governor Jane
Swift publicly apologized Wednesday for using her staff for
babysitting and moving chores, and said she should not have used a
state police helicopter to travel to her family's Berkshire County
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry if I accepted help from my staff even if it was
voluntary, because that can be perceived as an abuse of power,''
Swift said at a hastily called State House news conference. ``I
should not have done it and I will be very careful not to do it in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing the most difficult crisis of her political career, Swift
also said she had asked the State Ethics Commission to investigate
whether she violated any laws by using the helicopter. She said she
would wait for the commission's response before deciding whether to
reimburse the state approximately $1,000 for the helicopter ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should not have used the helicopter,'' Swift said. She also
said she would cooperate with the ethics agency if it seeks to
investigate her use of her staff to watch her daughter and move her
family from Boston to an apartment in Northbridge.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor, who has for days been scolded by
Democrats, newspaper columnists and radio talkshows, appeared
humble and contrite. Swift had insisted for days she had done
nothing wrong, and blamed the media for spreading
``misinformation'' about her personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks had angered the public, especially other working
women who said they had to balance work and family life without the
perks of power.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci administration opponents had also seized on the
controversy, and Wednesday a state employees union demanded the
adminsitration clarify rules governing state workers babysitting
for their bosses and whether employees can bring children to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our workers, the same as Jane, have emergency situations where
their children get sick,'' said John Templeton, president and
executive director of the Local 509 of the Service Employees
International Union.
</P>
<P>
   The state Democratic Party was also on the attack. Mark White,
the party's executive director, said Swift should not have waited
so long to make the apology. ``The press conference today is a week
late and thousand dollars short,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Swift acknoweldged she had created a political crisis for
herself and the administration. Backing off her accusations about
the press, she said she was taking full responsibility for her
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Her sudden decision to change course came after conferring with
political advisers to Governor Paul Cellucci, other top
administration aides, and Republican colleagues Wednesday. Most of
them had been urging her to apologize and show remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Swift said she had talked to Cellucci, who is vacationing in
Florida, earlier in the day, but he had not advised her what to do,
other than ``keep my chin up.'' The governor's chief political
aide, Rob Gray, and Cellucci's chief of staff Steven O'Neill met
with Swift in strategy sessions at the State House Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Swift said she had resisted offering an apology because she was
trying to protect her family. She said she decided to apologize
after weighing public feedback for the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have come to this conclusion earlier, but I'm
willing to accept responsibility for my actions and say when I've
been wrong,'' Swift said. ``I'm still learning quite a few things
about being a mother and even more about being a lieutenant
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift called the press conference after a day in which she was
again beseiged by the media at State House. Camera crews and
reporters chased her down hallways, but she refused to respond to
questions. She offered the apology in a 5 p.m. press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy first erputed last week when the Boston Globe
reported that Swift used her staff to watch her daughter,
Elizabeth, at her home and in the office. The Globe also reported
she used two State House aides to move her and her family from
Boston to a new apartment in Northbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Swift said at the time the aides had all volunteered for the
duties and the two aides who moved her had taken vacation days to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald reported that she had used the state police
helicopter to commute from a conference at Logan Airport to her
family's western Massachusetts home just before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Sources have told the Globe that some of the aides had privately
complained about the requests from Swift to babysit but felt they
could not turn her down. Swift and her husband, Charles Hunt, had
used the aides to babysit last year on weekends they stayed in
their Boston apartment, rather than traveling home to western
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In September, they moved to Northbridge, and sources said Swift
has not used staff for babysitting at home since then.
</P>
<P>
   Swift said she used the helicopter for a pre-Thanksgiving ride
to western Massachusetts because she was anxious about her child,
who was at home with pneumonia. The conference was over at about 3
p.m. and she faced a drive of three hours or more.

BELICHICK HIRES TOP SPORTS LABOR LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man has a great track record going head to head with the
National Football League and feels he ``has some powerful legal
arguments'' that could bring Bill Belichick to the New England
Patriots without any compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there is no basis for the league to issue any order
restricting Coach Belichick from coaching other teams,'' said New
York-based attorney Jeffrey Kessler, who is a last-minute hire to
represent Belichick when his case moves before commissioner Paul
Tagliabue and is heard in New York Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler is one of the top sports labor attorneys in the country.
He and partner Jim Quinn of the New York firm of Weil, Gotshal &AMP;
Manges, orchestrated the National Football League Players
Association's greatest win, bringing the players free agency in a
Minnesota courtroom in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler has also been heavily involved in union-league
confrontations in the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick filed a grievance with Tagliabue shortly after
resigning as the New York Jets' head coach Jan. 4 _ after holding
the job that he inherited for a little more than 24 hours following
Bill Parcells's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 3, the Patriots had asked permission to speak with
Belichick about becoming their head coach and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue ruled at that point that Belichick was under contract
to the Jets and was not allowed to talk to any other team about
employment as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said Wednesday: ``I don't think there are any loopholes
(in Belichick's contract with the Jets), but I feel we have clear
and powerful arguments that he should be allowed to talk with any
team in the league about being head coach, without restriction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is no longer the head coach of the New York Jets, and for
the league to try to prevent him from getting a job as head coach
is an antitrust violation. This is just one of several strong
arguments I hope to bring to the commissioner. I have looked at
(Belichick's) contract and I feel it restricts him from receiving
offers from others teams under the current circumstances. The Jets
no longer want him as head coach. He should be allowed to talk to
other teams about being their head coach without restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said he will present his arguments to Tagliabue at about
9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will go on until early afternoon,'' said Kessler,
``and then I'm told that the commissioner will make a ruling, if he
feels he has all the information he needs, at that point in time.
If not, he will bring in the people from the Jets and get more
information from them (Friday), and then make a ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is represented by agent Neil Cornrich of Cleveland.
Kessler said he was not retained by Belichick/Cornrich ``until just
the other day, so I didn't have time to file any briefs with the
commissioner,'' he said. ``But I have seen the contract and feel it
is a clear antitrust violation to prevent Coach Belichick from
seeking another job in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to represent the Jets are team president
Steve Gutman and Parcells, the team's director of football
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets claim Belichick is under contract for them as head
coach for the next three years, and cannot take another job in the
league without the Jets getting compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, attorney Joel Kozol of Boston, representing
Parcells in a similar hearing before the commissioner, argued that
to prevent Parcells from going to New York from New England, would
be an antitrust violation. Tagliabue ruled in favor of the
Patriots. After being asked to negotiate a settlement by then-Jets
owner Leon Hess, Tagliabue awarded the Patriots four draft choices
over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Parcells told Hess not to pay the compensation, and
keep Belichick in place as head coach until the final year of the
Parcells contract with New England was up, and then Parcells take
over as head coach. Hess told Parcells that he didn't have much
longer to live (he died last year) and wanted to see Parcells coach
the team right away, which is why he opted to give the
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   It was this move that prompted the Jets to sign Belichick as
assistant head coach at the time, and future head coach of the Jets
when Parcells retired.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells retired following the final game of the season with
Seattle, announced Belichick the next day to succeed him, only to
have Belichick walk away 24 hours after that.

AIRPORT SECURITY REVEALS BODY CURVES BENEATH CLOTHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - A new security system used at Los Angeles
International and some other airports can peer beneath clothes and
show intimate body contours, upsetting privacy advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The new BodySearch system uses low-power X-rays to search
travelers for concealed weapons and contraband, providing an image
similar to a black-and-white negative.
</P>
<P>
   Because it also captures intimate body details the searches are
seen as an invasion of privacy by the American Civil Liberties
Union and others and most passengers picked out for searching would
rather be patted down than X-rayed because it takes less time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my daughter, my wife, my grandmother to be
subjected to something that will look at them like a Playboy
centerfold,'' said Erich Miller, media liaison for the Libertarian
Party of Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs Service, which has installed the $125,000
device in six international airports so far, counters that
BodySearch is a less-invasive alternative to physical searches by
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we originally had this machine developed is it's
not pleasant for any passenger to be patted down,'' said Customs
spokesman Dean Boyd. ``They don't like being touched. And honestly,
our inspectors don't like touching people either.''
</P>
<P>
   They also note that few people are ever searched.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Customs branch in Los Angeles did not have
figures for the number of people scanned so far at LAX. He also
said he was unaware of any contraband that had been detected at the
airport with the system.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials use the system as one tool to screen
passengers suspected of smuggling illegal drugs and guns into the
country. Passengers thought to be hiding contraband are first
questioned by inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   If inspectors still harbor suspicious about a passenger, they
will offer the subject a choice - BodySearch or a pat-down search.
</P>
<P>
   Those who chose the scan must first sign a consent form. Customs
officials then use the device, which runs a low-energy beam of
x-rays over passengers' bodies. The results show up on a screen
monitored by an agent of the same sex as the person being scanned.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process is conducted in private, out of the site of
other passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's going to see this or see you,'' Boyd said. ``There's
not a crowd gathered around.''
</P>
<P>
   The images are only saved if the scan turns up contraband, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the system is voluntary, it has still alarmed
civil-rights watchdogs. The American Civil Liberties Union has
raised questions about the use of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is ever a place where a person has a reasonable
expectation of privacy, it is under their clothing,'' ACLU
legislative counsel Gregory T. Nojeim said previously in testimony
before government panels on aviation safety and security.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, airline passengers questioned by customs
officials don't seem eager to step in front of the BodySearch
machine. Michael Fleming, a spokesman with the Customs Service's
Los Angeles branch, said most people given the choice have opted
for a pat-down instead.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be that the pat-down is faster. While the scan
itself takes just a minute or two, inspectors must first explain
the procedure and obtain the passenger's written permission. The
whole process takes about 15 minutes, Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in a hurry,'' he said. ``They may have connecting
flights.''

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. ON LIST OF PROPOSED CATHOLIC MARTYRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Baptist minister,
civil rights leader and inspirational orator, is a leading
candidate to be declared a martyr by the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   King, who would have celebrated his 71st birthday on Saturday,
would be an unusual choice for martyrdom for several reasons,
according to scholars . He was not Catholic, he was killed not
while preaching but while advocating for labor rights and his
personal life has been the subject of some debate in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But the US Catholic bishops have included King among a list of
two dozen Americans to be considered by the Vatican for a list of
20th Century martyrs that Pope John Paul II plans to unveil on May
7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Luther King, whom I held in great personal esteem, is
somebody who was in many ways a charismatic figure and a prophet in
terms of civil rights,'' said Bishop Tod Brown of the Diocese of
Orange County in Southern California. ``His whole rationale had a
strong spiritual basis, and he immediately came to mind when we
started thinking about citizens of this country. I am hoping his
name will go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown headed the martyr nomination process for the United States
bishops, who wound up forwarding about two dozen names for
consideration to the Vatican. In all, the Vatican received about
9,000 nominations worldwide for inclusion on the list of martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the pope wants to do is, during this jubilee year, in
some way to honor men and women from the 20th century who have died
because of their faith,'' said Paul Henderson, executive director
of the Jubilee Year 2000 office at the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The list of nominees is not public, but most are likely to be
victims of totalitarian regimes, such as Nazi Germany and various
countries allied with the Soviet Union, or political violence,
particularly in Latin America. One of the nominees is expected to
be Archbishop Oscar Romero of San Salvador, who was murdered while
saying Mass in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The list of American nominees is small because few Americans
have been killed for their faith in this century. Among the
American nominees are four churchwomen who were murdered in El
Salvador in 1980, in killings that Representative J. Joseph
Moakley, the South Boston Democrat, used to criticize US policy
toward Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undoubtedly, history will remember the 20th century as a time
of persecutions _ an era of martyrs,'' Bishop Michael Hrynchyshyn,
the chairman of the Vatican's new martyrs commission, said last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The early church frequently issued lists of martyrs in the first
several centuries after the death of Jesus, starting with the first
one, St. Stephen, an early Christian leader who was stoned to
death. But lists of martyrs, once essentially a compilation of
those honored by local communities, have become less common as the
Vatican has asserted more authority over the process of honoring
exemplary Christians, including naming some as saints.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern era, the Vatican has named only Roman Catholics as
saints. Martyrdom has traditionally been one of the main paths to
sainthood, but this year's list of new martyrs is to include
non-Catholics who probably will not be considered for canonization
as saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something absolutely new,'' said Lawrence Cunningham,
a a professor of theology at Notre Dame. ``The pope is aware of the
fact that it wasn't only Catholics that went to concentration camps
or Siberia, and he thinks it's only fair to make a list of all
Christians that died for the faith. He says he does not want these
people to be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that naming non-Catholic martyrs carries great
symbolic importance as the Catholic Church reaches out to other
Christian denominations. King's very name _ Martin Luther _ is that
of the German theologian whose criticism of the church in the 16th
century led to the Protestant Reformation.

   ``For the pope to recognize Protestant martyrs is a very
important ecumenical move,'' said Daniel Boyarin, a professor at
the University of California at Berkeley and author of the new
book, ``Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and
Judaism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only a few centuries ago,'' Boyarin said, ``when
Catholics and Protestants were burning each other at the stake.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, King is an obvious choice for special Vatican
recognition, some scholars said. He was a religious leader who was
inspired by his faith to work for social justice and who was killed
for his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always thought that ultimately the cause of social justice
related back to the Old Testament's prophets,'' said Clayborne
Carson, a history professor at Stanford University and the editor
of King's papers. ``His notion of his jeremiad was rooted in the
Old Testament notions, that the purpose of Christian faith was to
be a corrective in society and to challenge society.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a committed Baptist, King was ecumenical in his work.
He met with Pope John XXIII and attended many meetings with leaders
of other faiths, and spoke often of the importance of brotherhood.
Catholics, in turn, were often active in his civil rights marches.
</P>
<P>
   ``As early as the 1970s, people were asking: `Why can't
Catholics venerate Martin Luther King Jr.?' '' said Maureen Tilley,
a religious studies professor at the University of Dayton who has
written about martyrs. ``Martin Luther King, if he shows up on the
list, will show up as a martyr. . . for taking the message of Jesus
and seeing how it applied to a very concrete situation where his
aim was not primarily political but religious or humanitarian.''
</P>
<P>
   King's personal life has been questioned in recent years. Among
others, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, a King confidant, said King had
had an affair with a Kentucky lawmaker, and the lawmaker later
acknowledged having had a relationship with King.
</P>
<P>
   Tilley said that King's personal life could be an issue at the
Vatican, but that others with blemished lives have been honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catholics believe Mary Magdalene was a saint, and the legend
is that she was a prostitute,'' Tilley said. ``There's always a
chance of someone being a martyr for the faith after a pretty
dissolute life, but that always complicates holding the person up
as a martyr.''
</P>
<P>
   King repeatedly urged people not to see him as a saint, but
since his death he has been frequently seen as a kind of prophet,
according to Gerald Platt, a sociologist at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst who writes about King's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``People frequently make associations between him and people
like Christ and Moses, people who've led others out of tyranny,''
Platt said
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, in outlining his goals for the year 2000,
John Paul spelled out his intention to issue a list of new martyrs
who need not be Catholic, and who would not be subject to the
lengthy and grueling examination that attends formal canonization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church of the first millennium was born of the blood of
the martyrs,'' John Paul wrote. ``At the end of the second
millennium, the church has once again become a church of martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope made clear his ecumenical intentions, saying ``the
witness to Christ borne even to the shedding of blood has become a
common inheritance of Catholics, Orthodox, Anglicans and
Protestants,'' and called for compiling a new martyrology, saying:
``As far as possible, their witness should not be lost to the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Martyrdom has a long history in Christianity, and martyrs are
looked upon as role models and objects of veneration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of
martyrs in the Catholic tradition,'' said the Rev. Harvey Egan, a
Boston College theologian. ``Since Jesus died a violent, bloody
death reviled as a common criminal, to die for faith was viewed by
Christians as the supreme way to imitate Christ.''

BOB LEMON, 79, A HALL OF FAME PITCHER, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Lemon, who pitched his way to the Hall of Fame with the
Cleveland Indians, then managed the New York Yankees in their
memorable pennant-winning comeback of 1978 when they overtook the
Boston Red Sox in a division playoff, died on Wednesday at a
nursing home in Long Beach, Calif. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon had been in failing health in recent years, the Indians
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was 25 by the time he threw his first major league pitch, but
in the late 1940s and the 1950s, Lemon became a key member of one
of the most formidable pitching staffs in baseball history. A
right-hander who dominated batters with a superb sinker and
curveball, Lemon won 207 games over 13 seasons as he teamed with
Bob Feller and Early Wynn, fellow Hall of Famers, and Mike Garcia
in the Indians' perennial duels with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, 1978 _ 20 years after his final season with the
Indians _ Lemon became the Yankee manager after a tearful exit by
Billy Martin. An island of calm in a stormy summer, he took the
Yanks from 10 games back to a division triumph over the Red Sox in
a drive climaxed by Bucky Dent's playoff-game home run at Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was pitching the Indians to a pair of pennants and a
host of second-place finishes behind the Yankees _ posting seven
20-victory seasons _ or managing the Yanks in the tumultuous Bronx
Zoo days, Bob Lemon remained unflappable.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankee outfielder Jay Johnstone put it in the spring of
1979: ``Lem's sort of like an Andy Griffith character. You know,
`Take it easy, don't panic, we'll think of something.'''
</P>
<P>
   In his Hall of Fame induction speech at Cooperstown in 1976,
Lemon revealed his secret for success: ``I had some bad days in the
field. But I didn't take them home with me. I left them in a bar
along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Granville Lemon was born Sept. 22, 1920, in San
Bernardino, Calif., and grew up in Long Beach. He was signed by the
Indians' organization in 1938 as an outfielder-infielder, then
learned to pitch on Navy teams during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   On the opening day of the 1946 season, his first full year in
the major leagues, Lemon made a ninth-inning sliding catch in
center field to save a shutout by Feller. But he couldn't make it
as a hitter so Manager Lou Boudreau switched him to full-time
pitching that summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon flourished in 1948, throwing a no-hitter against the
Detroit Tigers, winning 20 games with 10 shutouts and getting a
pair of victories in the Indians' six-game World Series triumph
over the Boston Braves.
</P>
<P>
   He was named to seven All-Star teams, and in 1954 he won 23
games as the Indians swept to the pennant with an American
League-record 111 victories. Lemon pitched 10 innings in the World
Series opener against the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds, only
to be beaten by Dusty Rhodes' three-run, pinch-hit homer down the
short right-field line. He was also bested in Game 4 as the Giants
swept the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon had a career record of 207-128 and an earned run average
of 3.23. He led the American League in victories three times, in
complete games five times and in innings pitched four times. And he
hit 37 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   He managed the Kansas City Royals from 1970 to 1972, served as
the Yankee pitching coach, under Martin, in 1976, then was hired to
manage the Chicago White Sox the following season.
</P>
<P>
   Midsummer 1978 brought a bizarre series of events.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, Lemon was fired by the White Sox. On the night of
July 23, Martin climaxed his feuding with his star slugger, Reggie
Jackson, and the Yankee owner, George Steinbrenner, remarking to a
pair of reporters, ``The two of them deserve each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``One's a born liar, the other's convicted,'' he said, the
latter a reference to Steinbrenner's guilty plea in connection with
illegal political campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Martin was forced to resign, and Steinbrenner
hired Lemon on the recommendation of Al Rosen, the Yankee president
and Lemon's former teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Old-Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium, Bob
Sheppard, the public-address announcer, told the crowd that Lemon
would become the Yanks' general manager in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managing the Yankees in the 1980 season, and hopefully for
many seasons after that,'' Sheppard intoned, ``will be No. 1. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Before he could say ``Billy Martin,'' the once and future
manager ran onto the field to a roar from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   After Lemon took over from Martin, the Yankees _ having trailed
the Red Sox by 14 games in mid-July _ went 48-20 en route to the
American League East title, beat the Royals in the American League
Championship Series, then defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the season ended, Lemon's youngest son, Jerry, was
killed in an automobile accident at age 26. In mid-June 1979, with
the Yankees in fourth place, Steinbrenner fired Lemon and brought
Martin back ahead of schedule, saying he felt that Lemon had
trouble motivating the team, perhaps because he was still mourning
the loss of his son. Lemon, who seemed to agree with Steinbrenner's
assessment, was reassigned to a scouting and personnel job and
never got that general manager's post.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was fired the following October and Dick Howser managed
for the 1980 season, then was forced out. Gene Michael began a
second term as manager, then was fired on Sept. 6, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon was brought back to succeed Michael, but Steinbrenner
second-guessed some of his moves as the Yankees lost a six-game
World Series to the Dodgers. Then, only 14 games into the 1982
season, Lemon was fired a second time and reassigned to scouting.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, in a statement on Wednesday, cited Lemon as a
``calming influence'' in that dramatic comeback to overtake the Red
Sox, saying, ``When our team was going through the turmoil during
the 1978 season, Bob Lemon was just what we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Randolph, a second baseman on that team and now a Yankee
coach, would remember how Lemon, in settling the clubhouse, ``was
the perfect guy for the job at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemon is survived by two sons, Jeff and Jim.

LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES RISE WITH DATA ON ECONOMY DUE
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long-term interest rates continued to move higher Wednesday as
investors awaited the release Thursday of government reports on
December retail sales and on producer prices. Retail sales are
expected to be strong, rising about 1 percent, while prices at the
producer level are forecast to increase 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such results would confirm the current conviction among many
bond investors that the Federal Reserve will raise its short-term
interest rate target by half a percentage point over the next three
months. Fed policy-makers will next meet on Feb. 1 and 2, and
analysts expect at least a quarter-point increase, to 5.75 percent,
in the federal funds rate, the overnight loan rate between banks.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.71
percent from 6.67 on Tuesday. The price, which moves in the
opposite direction, fell 14/32, to 92 17/32. Long-term yields are
now at the highest in 2{ years. Shorter-term interest rates also
rose, with the yield on the Treasury's two-year note edging up to
6.45 percent from 6.43 percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury auctioned $6 billion of new 10-year
inflation-linked notes Wednesday, and they received a surprisingly
warm reception. The real yield of 4.338 percent, which is adjusted
for inflation, was well below the 4.40 percent level at which the
last issue of such bonds, sold a year ago, was trading.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation-indexed bonds pay a coupon amount based on the stated
real rate, but their principal also increases by the amount of
inflation. In recent months, real rates have risen above 4 percent
for the first time since such bonds were first issued in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of increased public participation was noncompetitive
tenders _ an option used by individual investors to be assured of
buying bonds at auctions. These totaled nearly $81.8 million
Wednesday, the highest figure for any similar auction since the
first one, when such purchasers took $157 million in bonds.

MARKET PLACE: THE BOND MARKET, REFUGE OF THE STODGY, READIES FOR
E-COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The corporate bond market took a step into e-commerce Wednesday
as parts of two major deals were sold on the Internet. And the
World Bank is planning a $3 billion offering that could be
all-Internet, including orders, purchases and trading afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As usual on Wall Street, there was a rush to take credit for
being first and then debate over what was really an Internet
transaction. In fact, in one deal the electronic transactions were
repeated in old-fashioned phone calls, this having been the first
test.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that the selling of new issues is moving in the
e-commerce direction and that it could open buying opportunities to
many small investors who did not have them before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time we expect that most, if not all, of our new issues
will have an Internet component,'' said Jeff Chandler, a managing
director for debt markets at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Tracey Curvey,
executive vice president of Fidelity Online Brokerage, which sold
some new bonds to its retail customers Wednesday, added, ``That is
the whole point of this _ to make these deals more accessible to
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae, which buys home mortgages, sold $10 billion of notes
in two issues. The 10-year note was priced to yield 7.299 percent _
60.5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the
yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The two-year note was priced to
yield 6.723 percent, 26 basis points over the yield on the
Treasury's two-year note.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lead managers, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said that
with its share of the new offering it had ``successfully launched
the firm's fully integrated online distribution capability for
institutional, middle-market and retail accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill White, the head of e-commerce for debt capital markets at
Morgan Stanley, said the sale included the first purchases by
individual investors on the brokerage firm's Web site. ``This is an
avenue for mom-and-pop investors that was not available before,''
White said, adding that there had been about 100 purchases through
the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He said that for the first time at Morgan Stanley, institutional
investors had placed orders for the Fannie Mae notes electronically
and had the orders confirmed electronically. In excess of 35
percent, or more than $1 billion of the orders, came in
electronically. But he said that the final allocation _ in effect
the sale _ of the Fannie Mae notes was done by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   White says it is still unclear how far big investors want to go
with Internet sales. ``Institutional investors want to have a
relationship with a salesperson,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Merrill Lynch, another lead manager of the Fannie Mae deal, a
portion was also done over the Internet, including the final
allocation. But Chandler also said that this sale had been backed
up by the traditional telephone call between the institutional
investor and the Merrill Lynch sales representative. He would not
give the amount of sales made over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Ford Motor Credit sold $1.2 billion of
three-year notes, for which two-thirds of the orders were made over
the Internet. The note was priced to yield 7.34 percent, 80 basis
points over the three-year Treasury note. At the same time,
Fidelity Online Brokerage sold a portion of the notes to its retail
investors. Lehman Brothers said it received more than 200 orders
from retail investors through Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Weiss, head of global debt capital markets at Lehman
Brothers, the lead manager, said that as a ``fail safe'' measure,
all the orders and actual sales had been confirmed on the
telephone. He said it would take a couple of deals before all
investors would be comfortable with purely electronic buying,
adding, ``We will do this one and do another one, and as time goes
by, we will see where the comfort level is and then go to the next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weiss maintained that both institutional investors and
Lehman Brothers sales representatives were happy with moving to the
Internet. He said that with Web sites like Lehman's, which provide
a central place to obtain the information needed for assessing a
bond deal, institutional investors and sales representatives would
have more time to discuss the real value in a proposed bond sale.
The sales force, he said, will not be bogged down by administrative
details, including seeing that a prospectus got to an investor.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is not all the way to online selling, either. Ms.
Curvey said that while an investor could find out about the sale on
Fidelity's Web site, he or she still had to phone a salesman or go
to a local office to make the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that Fidelity is aiming to have an Internet buying
system ready in ``the next month or so.'' One difficulty in moving
to fully automated access is meeting all the government regulatory
concerns, she said, adding that once the system was operating,
retail investors would be able to buy new issues and also existing
issues, using various Fidelity sorting aids to help fit the bonds
with their particular financial strategies.
</P>
<P>
   With the World Bank deal, Goldman, Sachs and Lehman Brothers,
the lead underwriters, hope to make the leap into full Internet
commerce and trading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Victor Simone, Goldman's managing director for
e-commerce, institutional investors will be able to order and make
the final sale over the Internet, without any oral confirmation.
There is also an electronic syndicate being organized with the
Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity to bring the sale to the retail
level. He said that Schwab customers would be able to ``click and
buy'' the new issue.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, institutional and retail investors will still be able
to use the phone to buy the World Bank notes. But if this sale goes
well, the trend will be in the e-commerce direction.

   JACKIE-SUSANN-FILM (Undated) _ Before she started writing
fiction, ``Valley of the Dolls''; ``The Love Machine'' and ``Once
Is Not Enough,'' Jackie Susann spent the better part of three
decades trying to be a star before she died at 56, so it would no
doubt delight her that she's the subject of ``Isn't She Great,'' a
near-slapstick comedy with a melancholy undertow written by Paul
Rudnick and directed by Andrew Bergman. Loosely based on ``Wasn't
She Great?,'' a 1995 New Yorker article by Michael Korda, who
edited ``The Love Machine,'' the film opens Jan. 28 and stars Bette
Midler as Susann. By Karen Durbin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JAMES-TOBACK-FILMS (New York) _ Few film directors can boast a
career like James Toback's. Fewer still might want to. Half a dozen
movies that have not always rubbed critics the right way, or
translated into huge box office profits (or losses, for that
matter). And yet, at 55, this idiosyncratic writer-director still
makes the movies he wants to, lures marquee stars, finds the money
men and, lately, makes the cut at the big film festivals. By Rick
Marin. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   NINTH-GATE-FILM (Rome) _ Seated at a corner table at Il
Matriciano, one of his favorite haunts during the dolce vita of the
'70s, Roman Polanski was discussing his desire to make an
important, lasting film. Almost impatiently, he explained that his
latest release, ``The Ninth Gate,'' was not it. ```Ninth Gate' is
fun, it's nice, I think it's a good movie, but after all, what is
it about?'' asked Polanski, 66, the Polish-born director whose
repertory includes ``Repulsion,'' ``Rosemary's Baby'' and
``Chinatown.'' ``It's like every other movie that is made nowadays.
It may be different in style, but it doesn't make any important
statement.'' Actually, ``The Ninth Gate,'' is an occult thriller
opening March 31 that features satanic rituals, exotic locales and
gruesome deaths, and stars Johnny Depp. By Alessandra Stanley.

<P>
   BEAUTIFUL-PEOPLE-FILM (London) _ ``Beautiful People,'' is Jasmin
Dizdar's first feature film, which opens in New York in February.
The film by the young Yugoslav who has become a British citizen, is
a humorous, affectionate and poignant portrayal of a cross section
of Britons whose lives are unexpectedly disrupted by the Bosnian
nightmare in the fall of 1993. ``Beautiful People'' won the Certain
Regard competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. By Alan
Riding. (Moved).

<P>
   ZANDER-MUSIC (Undated) _ What is it about Boston and musical
cult figures? The opera producer Sarah Caldwell and the pianist
Russell Sherman are merely the more prominent of recent decades. If
a musician can make it there, in that hotbed of musical culture and
tradition, you might think, he or she can make it anywhere. The
quintessential cult figure of the moment is Benjamin Zander, 60, a
conductor and the founding music director of the Boston
Philharmonic Orchestra. By James R. Oestreich. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEPORELLO-MUSIC-FILM (Toronto) _ On the principle that every
exit is an entrance somewhere else, Tom Stoppard once wrote
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet's dim college pals from
Wittenberg, title roles in a show of their own. Now Barbara Willis
Sweete, a founding partner of the Canadian film production company
Rhombus Media, is doing the same for Leporello, the sidekick of
Mozart's Don Giovanni. Her hourlong film-within-a-film
``Leporello,'' which strings together in their original order
excerpts from Mozart's sulfur-singed operatic masterpiece, will be
introduced at festivals next fall, with television broadcasts to
follow on PBS and cultural channels around the world. By Matthew
Gurewitsch. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   ARCADES-PROJECT (Undated) _ Some of us don't read fiction. We
live on history, biography, criticism, reporting and what used to
be called belles lettres. We will be feasting on Walter Benjamin's
``Arcades Project'' for years to come. Just published by Harvard
University Press in the first full English-language edition, ``The
Arcades Project'' should also win readers with broader tastes. A
sprawling, fragmented meditation on the ethos of 19th-century
Paris, ``The Arcades Project'' was left incomplete on Benjamin's
death in 1940. In recent decades, as portions of the book have
appeared in English, the unfinished opus has acquired legendary
status. ``The Arcades Project'' surpasses its legend. It captures
the relationship between a writer and a city in a form as richly
developed as those presented in the great cosmopolitan novels of
Proust, Joyce, Musil and Isherwood. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   COURT-PAINTERS-ART (Madrid, Spain) From the 15th century to the
18th century, many fine painters were wooed with money, security
and status and in exchange spent their time glorifying the
``ideology'' of the Roman Catholic Church and exalting assorted
popes, monarchs and military heroes. They also produced prodigious
art. This was certainly the case with three masters of the
post-Renaissance, whose relationship with power is the subject of
``Velazquez, Rubens, Van Dyck: Court Painters of the 17th
Century,'' a new exhibition at the Prado Museum in Madrid that runs
through March 5. Each artist had his own style of painting, but
they nonetheless had much in common: their careers coincided during
two decades; they supported the Catholic Counter-Reformation;
Velazquez and Van Dyck looked up to Rubens, 22 years their senior;
and all revered Titian, who died in 1576, the year before Rubens's
birth. But what most united them was that they were first and
foremost court painters. By Alan Riding. (Moved).

 &UR; SCANNERS _ &LR;  Until recently, even the most wired of mobile warriors
had to resort to pen, paper or copy machine if she came across a
useful article or image at a client's office or in the library.
Even if with a laptop, scanning the item in wasn't an option,
because most scanners were simply too bulky to take on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, that's changing: Some new models are small and
light enough for a briefcase, a purse or in some cases even a
pocket. Of course, these new mobile scanners are still far from
matching the capabilities of their desktop cousins, but little by
little, they're making scanning on the go a realistic possibility.

 DiCon Bringing Fiber Optics To Marina Bay  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A fast-growing East Bay fiber-optics manufacturer will develop 28
acres of Richmond's Marina Bay, one of several spots the city is
trying to transform into a high-tech mecca.
<P>
   Richmond officials yesterday said DiCon Fiberoptics Inc. will
build a 470,000-square-foot campus in the former shipyard in the
southwest part of the city. The new  &LR; $30 million facility, which
will house manufacturing, engineering and DiCon's corporate
headquarters, will supplement the company's existing 93,000 square
feet of offices in Berkeley's.
</P>
<P>
   DiCon employs about 400 people, but it expects to have between
1,600 and 1,900 workers by 2004, when the complex is complete. In
addition to the new campus, which will accommodate about 1,200, the
company said it has signed a five-year lease to rent 50,000 square
feet of space for 200 to 300 additional workers in Richmond's
Regatta Business Park.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said the expansion is the result of exploding
demand for fiber optics. Privately held DiCon had about $35 million
in revenues last year and expects to double that this year, as
companies like Cisco, Nortel and Alcatel gobble up its fiber-optics
components.
</P>
<P>
   These companies' optical networks ``are the backbone of the
Internet,'' said David Polinksy, DiCon's co-founder and vice
president for business development. ``Basically, the widespread
deployment of high-speed network connections to business and homes
is only limited by the pace at which component manufacturers,
including DiCon, can build and ship. So we're building buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   For Richmond, the move validates a 10-year-old strategy to
diversify the local economy by bringing multimedia, biotechnology
and other high-tech firms to an area better known for its oil
refineries. ``We've been a one-industry town for a long time, and
that's not good,'' said Richmond Mayor Rosemary Corbin. ``We are
looking for the industries of the 21st century and fiber optics is
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Corbin also lauded the company for signing an agreement to look
within Richmond to fill the varied positions _ from assembly line
workers to middle managers _ at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Despite yesterday's announcement and the city's high-tech push,
Richmond is losing one high-profile corporate resident. Pixar
Animation Studios, the company behind ``Toy Story'' and ``A Bug's
Life'' is scheduled to move its headquarters from Richmond to a new
facility in Emeryville later this year.

 MEDIABYTES/DAN FOST  Internet Competitors See Nothing But Goodness
in AOL's Coup 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
It must be nice to be an Internet media company this week, as
America Online pulls off the coup of the century and snaps up Time
Warner in the biggest merger ever.
<P>
   The reaction around Yahoo, apparently, was a big ``Yahoo!''
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief executive, Tim Koogle, speaking in a
conference call after the Santa Clara company released earnings
Tuesday, proclaimed, ``I see nothing but goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the new behemoth represents your biggest rival? ``This
market is a big market,'' said Koogle calmly. ``It's more than big
enough to support several global branded network players, and we
fully intend to be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Koogle also took AOL and Time Warner execs at their word when
they said they would open up their cable networks to other Internet
service providers, and he saw goodness there, too. : &LR;   &LR; That means
more people will use cable to get on the Net and use services that
will benefit from high-speed connections, such as Broadcast.com,
which provides audio and visual programming over the Internet.
Broadcast.com is owned by, you got it, Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet chiefs hailed the deal _ Cnet CEO Halsey Minor
said it helps ``legitimize the currency of Internet stocks'' _ they
weren't entirely sure that it was a smart move for AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Now that AOL is such a huge company, it may have trouble
competing with ``a lot of very small, fast-moving, driven companies
focusing on very specific market segments,'' Minor said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Donnell, CEO of Salon.com, even went so far as to
suggest that the deal means AOL may no longer be an Internet stock.
O'Donnell watched as Wall Street punished AOL's stock _ it is down
18 percent since Friday _ and analysts reduced their estimates for
where the stock price would be in a year, with some targets falling
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking a white-hot Net stock and partnering with one
of the world's biggest bricks-and-mortar companies,'' O'Donnell
said. ``AOL's investor base is used to these incredible Internet
run-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lycos tried a similar deal with Barry Diller's USA
Networks, Wall Street hammered the firms so hard the merger fell
apart.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, when Salon engineered a deal with Cablevision, it
only sold 10 percent of the company. ``We did not want to take away
the Net value of the company by tying it to bricks and mortar,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has done the same thing, shying away from buying any old
media firms, Koogle said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cnet and Salon are Internet firms, they are also
content providers, giving them more in common with Time Warner than
AOL. Yet neither company's CEO saw the deal putting pressure on
them to sell out to larger interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds of us acquiring a traditional media company over the
next five years are greater than that of a traditional company
acquiring us,'' Minor said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said Salon is ``not feeling this pressure that we've
got to consolidate, or sell the company, or get big with another
media company in a hurry.'' He said Salon only needs to spend about
$22 million a year to create its well-regarded editorial content,
and in the next two or three years it should become profitable.
</P>
<P>
   As a niche player, all Salon needs to do is stay in the 50
most-popular Web sites, not the top three, O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
KNERD &QL; 
Cnet has made its name as an Internet company, but it's making
waves with its foray into radio. The San Francisco company, which
last week announced plans to air all-tech programming on radio
stations across the country, has plucked what it calls three
``rising young stars'' from San Francisco's most popular news radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Romine from KCBS and Kim Foster and Kevin Patrick from KGO
are joining the fledgling news team at Cnet, according to Brian
Cooley, the producer and leading on-air personality for the
venture.
</P>
<P>
   They'll start broadcasting at the end of this month on KNEW, at
910 AM, in San Francisco. The Cnet Radio venture is a partnership
with AMFM, the nation's largest owner of radio stations, which also
owns KNEW. Eventually, Cnet Radio will air on other AMFM-owned
stations in tech-savvy markets like Seattle and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   KNEW now simulcasts K101 FM, an adult-contemporary music
station, and may continue to do so on nights and weekends. Cnet
Radio will air from 5:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little ironic that Cnet has seen the future and it is
radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're forging new ground as an Internet company, using
100-year-old technology,'' joked Minor. Yet Minor says the radio
show should not only make money for Cnet, but help build the brand
and drive people to its Web sites. ``We view ourselves as a
prototypical media company for the 21st century, with the Internet
at its core,'' Minor said.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet already owns the domain www.radio.com and has been
Webcasting Cooley's reports there for the past four years. You're
most likely to hear it if you call Cnet and get put on hold. Cnet
plans to use a new domain, www.cnetradio.com, to promote its radio
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   As for the content of Cnet Radio, Minor promises a focus on tech
stocks and personalities, and Cooley said his new hires demonstrate
a solid news approach, although none have tech-reporting
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet won't be the first to experiment with tech programming on
the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Garcia of San Francisco hosts a three-hour weekend advice
and call-in show, ``On Computers,'' that airs on 17 stations (none
in the Bay Area) and the Armed Forces Network. Garcia is hoping
KNEW will pick up his show, and he has calls in to Cooley.
</P>
<P>
   Bob O'Donnell has hosted ``O'Donnell on Computers'' on KSFO (560
AM), for almost four years.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, whose day job is research manager for PC displays at
the tech research firm IDC, said Cooley's program on www.radio.com
is ``a great concept, but nobody listens.'' And he said Cnet will
have ``a real uphill challenge'' in its new venture. ``It takes a
long time to establish brands on radio,'' he said. ``There is a
need for tech news,'' he added, ``but 12 to 14 hours a day is a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell's show ranks 20th in the Bay Area during its 1 p.m. to
4 p.m. Saturday time slot, with 51,100 people age 12 or older
tuning in at least five minutes, according to Greg Raab, marketing
director of KSFO, citing Arbitron ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Among O'Donnell's core audience _ males age 35 and older _ his
show ranks 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley dismissed shows like Garcia's and O'Donnell's as
``absolutely awful.'' He said they're geared toward ``hobbyists''
and are loaded with jargon and acronyms that confound the average
listener.
</P>
<P>
   One thing O'Donnell's show proves, however, is that computer
programming pulls in the ads. Even before dot-com companies began
flooding the radio airwaves last year, KSFO had ``phenomenal
success'' selling advertising on O'Donnell's show to
computer-makers and retailers.

TRIBUNE CO.'S ASSETS LINKED TO AOL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   ( By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the fortunes of Time Warner Inc. and America Online are tied
up in the success of their proposed merger, the assets of at least
two other media companies will be directly affected by the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune Co., publisher of The Chicago Tribune and owner of
18 television stations, has the most at stake. It has a 25 percent
stake in Time Warner's WB network, whose increasing popularity and
revenue had helped push Tribune's stock price above $60 in November
from its 1998 low of slightly below $23, though it has since fallen
off that peak, closing Wednesday at $51.25.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune was also an early investor in America Online, buying a
stake at 7 cents a share in 1991, before the company went public,
according to Barry Hollingsworth, the company's investor relations
manager. That stake now totals 22 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   But 18 million of those shares are tied up in other financial
transactions. In April, Tribune issued 30-year bonds with a value
of $1.1 billion, based on the value then of 16 million of its AOL
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Any gain in the value of those shares will eventually be passed
along to bondholders as they redeem their notes. Another 2 million
of Tribune's AOL shares are also hedged.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the value of Tribune's remaining 4 million unencumbered
AOL shares is $240 million, based on Wednesday's closing price of
$60 _ about 1.9 percent of Tribune's current market value of $12.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   A Tribune spokeswoman, Katherine Sopranos, said the company had
no immediate plans to make any changes in its holdings of AOL stock
or the WB network.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror, an early investor in Netscape, received AOL shares
in exchange for its Netscape holding when AOL bought the Internet
browser company. The company now owns about 1 million AOL shares,
which it has also hedged. &QL;

 Improved Mobile Scanners Let Users Duplicate Documents Anywhere  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Until recently, even the most wired of mobile warriors had to
resort to pen, paper or copy machine if she came across a useful
article or image at a client's office or in the library. Even if
with a laptop, scanning the item in wasn't an option, because most
scanners were simply too bulky to take on the road.
<P>
   Today, however, that's changing: Some new models are small and
light enough for a briefcase, a purse or in some cases even a
pocket. Of course, these new mobile scanners are still far from
matching the capabilities of their desktop cousins, but little by
little, they're making scanning on the go a realistic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   These new-generation devices come in several sizes and shapes.
At least four companies now market pen-style mobile scanners. They
actually look more like a handyman's utility knife, but you use
them like a pen or highlighter, running them line by line over the
text you want to capture. They work without a computer connection,
storing scanned data temporarily in their own memory, so you can
use them on a plane, in a library or just about anywhere else, even
if you don't have a portable computer.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard has taken a different approach with its unique
CapShare 920. About the size of a sandwich, the $499 device
is &LR; scans entire blocks of text and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   For those who carry a notebook computer, NEC Technologies has
just released another intriguing option. Its new PetiScan, just
$149, is a flatbed color model that's no bigger than a book, weighs
only 1.3 pounds and gets its power from the computer it's connected
to.
</P>
<P>
   I recently put the PetiScan, the CapShare and two of the
pen-style units, Siemens' $99.95 Pocket Reader and Wizcom
Technologies' $149 QuickLink Pen, through their paces. Here's what
I found:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SIEMENS POCKET READER
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; In addition to being the least expensive of the scanners I tried,
the Pocket Reader works with more computer systems, including the
Mac and Linux.
</P>
<P>
   To scan text, you simply hold it at the beginning of a line,
press down gently and roll the scanning head across the line.
Built-in optical character recognition software instantly converts
the scanned image into digital text, the last 24 characters of
which show up in a one-line LCD window on the side. Then you go to
the start of the next line and do it again, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   When you're done, you connect the Pocket Reader to a computer,
via a serial cable, and then launch a small program where you can
download, edit and copy the text you've scanned.
</P>
<P>
   Although I appreciated the Pocket Reader's simplicity, I can't
recommend the device. First of all, it works only with type that's
between 8 and 16 points in size. That includes most standard text
in letters, books and magazines, but it excludes a lot: headlines
and much ad material on the big end and, in the opposite direction,
the fine print in product catalogs, stock listings and phone
directories, not to mention business cards.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Pocket Reader's memory is limited to about two pages
of text, so you can't scan much without offloading to your
computer. There's not much point, for instance, in taking the
device to a library to take notes unless you bring along a laptop
computer _ or unless you're looking for just a few tidbits of
information, in which case a pen and paper would probably do the
trick just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, I found the Pocket Reader's OCR feature
infuriatingly inaccurate. My results, even from clear, plainly
printed originals, were riddled with errors, sometimes to the point
of being flat-out incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said the company is aware of the limitations of the
Pocket Reader's OCR technology and hopes to offer improvements
soon. That's something to look forward to, but in the meantime I
can't see spending $100 on the product.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WIZCOM QUICKLINK PEN
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; The QuickLink Pen looks like the Pocket Reader, except that it has
a three-line window on the side and a slightly curved tip.
</P>
<P>
   The QuickLink Pen also works roughly like the Siemens product,
except that it can transfer text only to Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, though, the QuickLink Pen has fewer limitations. It
works with text of 6 to 22 points. And the QuickLink has more
memory than you're ever likely to need: It holds 1,000 pages
(according to the company _ I confess I didn't test this claim),
and if that's not enough, you can add an extra memory card.
</P>
<P>
   Wizcom's OCR engine also proved far more accurate. The price is
slower operation _ after each line you scan, there's a delay of 5
to 10 seconds. I ran into only one serious accuracy problem: In two
cases, the QuickLink inserted an extra digit into scanned numbers _
one a phone number, the other a product price. You can't correct
the mistake unless you wrote down the number _ which defeats the
whole purpose of scanning!
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that issue, my biggest gripe about the QuickLink Pen
is that it suffers from a severe case of featuritis. In addition to
free-form text notes, it has separate applications built into the
pen to handle URLs, tables and contact information. It even tries
to let you compose and edit text right on the pen, by selecting
letters one at a time on the screen or by scanning from a bar-coded
alphabet on a sheet pasted on the device's case.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, each of these features is a godsend to someone, but to
me _ and, I suspect, most users _ they're overkill. And you can't
just ignore them: The first thing the device does when you're ready
to scan is ask you to name the file, so you have to confront its
complex text-entry scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is compounded by an inadequate manual. It badly
needs an index and doesn't really give you step-by-step
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea of a pen scanner appeals to you, the QuickLink Pen
seems to be the one to get. Dedicated users can undoubtedly
accomplish a lot with its array of programs and features. Just be
prepared to spend a fair bit of time figuring it all out. And don't
forget to write down any critical numbers you scan.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; HP CAPSHARE 920
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  The CapShare 920 is a critter of a very different species.
Instead of rolling over a line at a time, you drag it across entire
blocks of text. If the material is wider than the device's
5-inch-wide scanning head, you simply make another pass over the
remaining text, and the device automatically stitches together the
separate swathes into a single image. You can scan a whole page of
text _ a task that would probably take 10 minutes with a pen
scanner _ in about 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the pens, the CapShare can record text of any size, and
even graphics, though it doesn't preserve colors. The 920 model,
which replaced the original 910 in the fall, even has a ``flip
chart'' mode, where you can capture conference-room scribblings and
sketches at 25 percent of their original size.
</P>
<P>
   Also in contrast to the pens, the CapShare doesn't do OCR on the
fly; instead, it stores scanned material as images. The 4 megabytes
of memory built-in holds about 50 letter-size pages. A small LCD
screen on the unit lets you review and manage stored files, zooming
in to see details and even cropping out unwanted material. The
screen is dim and small, but text is quite readable in magnified
mode.
</P>
<P>
   When you're back at the office, you can print directly, and
wirelessly, from the CapShare to printers from HP and other vendors
that have infrared capabilities. Or you can transfer the files to
your PC or handheld, using either IR or a serial cable.
</P>
<P>
   ScanSoft PagisPro, an included document-management program,
gives you lots of other options, including printing, faxing and
editing scanned material or sending it to another PC application.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, it offers the option of having scanned text
recognized by ScanSoft's TextBridge Pro, which is included.
TextBridge is one of the best OCR programs available, and on my
test files it worked almost perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, I found the CapShare a pleasure to use. At $499,
it's clearly not for everyone, but for mobile professionals with a
serious need for scanning, I recommend it highly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NEC PETISCAN
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  The PetiScan is different from the three products above, in that
it can't be used independently of a Mac or PC _ it has no memory to
hold scanned images on its own, and it even depends on the computer
for electric power, provided over the same USB cable through which
it transfers scanned data.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's really a conventional flatbed scanner, but so
small and light that it's easy to bring along with a laptop. It has
a resolution of 300 by 600 dots per inch, and it works in full
color.
</P>
<P>
   The PetiScan has a unique ``reversible scanning'' feature: If
you want to scan something that won't fit on its miniature flatbed,
such as a big book, or even a wall-mounted poster, you can remove
the flatbed's cover, flip the PetiScan over and place it on top of
the material you want scanned, using a see-through window to line
up the image properly.
</P>
<P>
   Bundled with the device are both Windows and Mac versions of
Adobe PhotoDeluxe, a simple image-editing application, and
NewSoft's Presto PageManager, a document-management and OCR package
roughly comparable to the PagisPro program included with HP's
CapShare. The NewSoft program isn't as polished as PagisPro, and
its OCR function isn't quite as accurate, but the Windows version
worked pretty well for me.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could say the same about the Mac version, which is
seriously buggy. It repeatedly stalled during scans, until I
figured out that I could keep it going just by sliding my finger
around on the iBook's touchpad. Several times, it froze solid.
</P>
<P>
   For both Mac and Windows users, the PetiScan has one serious
limitation: The maximum area you can scan at one time is only 5.8
by 3.9 inches. That's sufficient for postcards, small snapshots,
receipts and business cards, but not for most printed matter. It's
not even quite wide enough for the text in a standard letter
layout.
</P>
<P>
   Included software lets you stitch two scanned images together
but doesn't do it as seamlessly as HP's CapShare. And I never did
figure out how to stitch two pieces of scanned text together and
save them in a form PageManager could then OCR.
</P>
<P>
   In short, although the PetiScan is effective for images and
blocks of text small enough to fit its image area, it's not a good
choice if you expect to scan many documents larger than a postcard.

 Dialpad Delivers Free Phoning  &HT;     By David A. Steinberg 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Dialpad.com, which promises free long-distance calls to anyone
with a personal computer, Web access and a headset, can be a good
deal for someone on a budget, but less-than-pindrop quality means
AT&AMP;T, MCI and Sprint have little reason to be nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Telephony _ the ability to place phone calls using your computer
_ could be one of the most useful benefits of the Internet to the
average computer user. Not long ago, the only way to use your
computer to make Internet calls was through a PC-to-PC system that
required both caller and recipient to have the same software and be
logged on at a prearranged time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, several companies offer PC-to-phone service at discounted
rates. Some only work when calling U.S. numbers; others extend the
service overseas. A few companies offer free calling if you provide
some basic demographic information and agree to watch or listen to
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Dialpad.com _ which yesterday said it has signed up 2
million users since its launch in October _ offers probably the
simplest system. Download the Dialpad software (at
www.dialpad.com), fill out a questionnaire so the company can
target its ads to your demographic niche and start making free
calls to anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: You log on to your account at the Dialpad
site and a minibrowser/dialer pops up. Dial the phone number (on
your keyboard or by using your mouse to punch the numbers
on-screen) and the call goes through. Banner ads run continuously
on the Dialpad dialer, but they're pretty unobtrusive. You can't
totally ignore them, though: If you pull up another program or Web
browser, the Dialpad dialer keeps reasserting itself to remain on
top.
</P>
<P>
   When you place your call, Dialpad routs it over the Internet,
then automatically relays it to the telephone number you're
calling.
</P>
<P>
   What's the catch? Well, the sound quality is inconsistent, and
depending on the speed of your modem (my 56K modem performed
adequately but a slower connection could cause problems), the
degree of Net traffic and other variables, holding a conversation
via Dialpad can be a frustrating experience.
</P>
<P>
   The quality is pretty much on par with calls made over a cell
phone: sometimes fine, sometimes awful. The first time I called my
sister in Los Angeles, she hung up twice because she couldn't hear
me. She probably thought it was a crank call. Now, I'm prepared to
yell ``Hello'' as soon as the call connects. She doesn't hang up on
me anymore, but if the sound quality is bad, she berates me for
calling on ``that damn Internet phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The same problem makes dealing with answering machines dicey.
Many of these devices are voice-activated, so if the sound quality
isn't great, the machine is liable to hang up before you can shout
your message.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to save money on long-distance bills, but I quickly
realized Dialpad would be useless for calling most of my relatives.
To put it delicately, they're somewhat technologically challenged.
There's no way my mother would put up with dropped words and the
occasional delay in the transmission. After all, this is a woman
who only recently accepted the inevitability of call waiting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the real advantages of Dialpad is being able to make
phone calls while online. For those who have just one phone line,
you can use Dialpad to call an East Coast technical support number
at noon and not worry about paying day rates to sit on hold for 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, you can work online with the technician to solve a
problem you're having. Log in to the Dialpad Web site and the
minibrowser/dialer pops up. Dial that East Coast number, get the
tech on the line, then switch to your main browser, word processor
or spreadsheet to keep working while you talk.
</P>
<P>
   Dialpad and its fee-based competitors are Java-based systems
that run strictly on Windows, so Mac users are out of luck. The
services are useful when conditions are optimal; just make sure you
have a speedy modem and aren't trying to run too many programs at
once.
</P>
<P>
   All require Windows 95, 98 or NT, a sound card, some sort of
microphone and speakers. The best option is to use a headset that
plugs into the sound in and sound out ports on your PC. It will be
easier to hear the person on the other end and your voice will be
transmitted more clearly. You'll also have more privacy than if you
try yelling toward a computer-mounted microphone and listening to
the response on speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Even when sound quality is fine, though, Dialpad has some
quirks. The service goes down occasionally, so during busy times,
you might get a ``no channel available'' message. Also, you can't
dial directory assistance numbers (although since you're already
online, you can surf over to 555-1212.com, InfoSpace.com or other
Web sites that look up phone numbers for free).
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely worthwhile trying out Dialpad if you have a 56K
or faster Internet connection, plan to call somewhat-forgiving
friends and want to save money on daytime toll calls. Just be aware
of its limitations and be prepared for occasional ribbing from
friends and relatives who think you're calling from inside a tin
can.

 &HT;    Rocker's remarks continue to generate controversy
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga. _ Reaction was mixed in John Rocker's hometown after
his first public comments since his controversial remarks appeared
in Sports Illustrated last month.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rivera, a native of Puerto Rico currently living in
Macon, said Rocker's interview on ESPN did nothing to erase the
impact of his earlier comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the words are out of your mouth, there's nothing (you can
do),'' Rivera said. ``Everything you do has an effect. If I say
some racial statement, it may affect the four or five people around
me who hear it. If somebody like him says it, it may affect 5
million people.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Morey said he believes Rocker was sincere in his
interview, and that his earlier comments were the result of a
frustrated athlete blowing off steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's from New York fans being so rude,'' said
Morey, a bartender at Jocks &AMP; Jills. ``I don't think there was
anything else meant by it. I don't think it was right what he said,
but you show me somebody who's never made a racist comment some
time in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Kennedy, a self-employed native of Macon, blamed the media
for the outcry over Rocker's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Barkley (former NBA forward) is black and because he's
black, he talks and the press lets him off the hook,'' Kennedy
said. ``John Rocker is white, and it's journalism of the 1990s and
2000 to be politically correct. A lot of what Charles says is true,
but a lot of what John says is true, too. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But ... he hasn't hurt anybody, he hasn't taken any drugs, he
hasn't committed any crimes. It's his constitutional right to say
whatever he wants to say.''
</P>
<P>
   And what should baseball do about Rocker?
</P>
<P>
   ``What to do about it? Nothing is what to do about it,'' Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, however, some fans held a different opinion. Frank
Landgraff, a Braves season ticket holder, believes the team should
trade or release Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be interesting if he were a marginally good player,
because I think he would have been cut already,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an athlete, he is in a class that's consistent with a top
performer,'' said Mark Bogart of Marietta. ``Morally, it would seem
he's in a low class.''
</P>
<P>
   Landgraff, who watched the interview at the CNN Center, wasn't
impressed by Rocker's apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's easy after you make a statement like that to say
you're sorry,'' he said. ``The real proof of whether he means it or
not is if the team, if he does come back, accepts him.''

RATHER OBJECTS TO CBS' DIGITAL ALTERING OF REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Dan Rather, the CBS News anchor, called the
decision to superimpose a digitally created CBS logo to block out
an NBC-sponsored sign in Times Square during CBS' news coverage of
New Year's Eve celebrations ``a mistake'' that he regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for it,'' Rather said in a telephone
interview Wednesday. ``I did not grasp the possible ethical
implications of this and that was wrong on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   While he questioned whether CBS should have taken the step at
all to alter the reality of a scene in this way, he said, ``At the
very least we should have pointed out to viewers that we were doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS' decision to use a new form of technology that allows
electronically created images to replace actual structures had
stirred a debate inside CBS News, and on Wednesday _ at a news
conference here attended by Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS
News, and Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television _ it was
clear the debate was not over.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward, responding to questions about an article on the topic
in The New York Times on Wednesday, defended CBS' use of the
technology, developed by a firm called Princeton Video Image. The
network has regularly used it on its morning news program, ``The
Early Show,'' to display a CBS promotion on everything from the
back of horse carriages to a side of the General Motors building,
where the show originates.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward said he believed that the transmission of the digital
images during the morning show was ``a whimsical and creative way
to display our logo in various and unlikely places.'' The use
during Rather's coverage in Times Square was, he said, ``a closer
call,'' which was made based on his conviction that ``on New Year's
Eve with confetti in Dan's hair, I saw this as an extension of our
graphics, a change in this very festive, in effect, set.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Rather had not been part of the ``internal
discussion'' about using the technique and that ``reasonable people
could disagree on whether this was an appropriate use of digital
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves supported Heyward. ``Any time there's an NBC logo up on
our network we'll block it again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rather, in the phone interview, was steadfast. ``This is a
new tool and we're responsible for how we use it,'' he said. ``I'm
not satisfied with how we mete out ethical responsibility to
viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I'm troubled that this was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward said there had been ``vigorous debate'' on the use of
the technology inside CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certain we're not going to make blanket use of this
technology,'' he said, but added that the network would definitely
continue to use it on its morning news program.
</P>
<P>
   CBS recently poured more than $30 million into remaking that
program, but it still lags badly in ratings. Heyward is also
dealing with a ratings falloff for Rather's newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the other network morning news shows use the
Princeton Video Image technology. Jeff Zucker, the executive
producer of NBC's ``Today'' show, said, ``We were offered the same
technology and we passed because we didn't think it was
appropriate.'' Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for ABC News, said:
``It's been discussed at length. We wouldn't use it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Heyward said that on CBS' ``Early Show,'' the anchor
Bryant Gumbel had on occasions noted on the air that the digital
logo was being superimposed when he though it was being done in a
particularly creative spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody comes to New York and is surprised that it doesn't
say `The Early Show' in the middle of Fifth Avenue, I don't think
we've committed a journalism sin,'' Heyward said. ``I don't want to
apologize for being aggressive in exploiting this.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he understood the argument against the use of the
technology _which is widely employed in sports and some
entertainment programs _ on news programs. The danger is ``that it
looks too real and therefore it's wrong or potentially wrong,'' he
said. ``I certainly agree it's potentially subject to abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that advances in computer-generated techniques had made
things like missiles hitting Baghdad and airplanes crashing look so
real that it was incumbent on networks to underscore that these
were not real images.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sitting here rubbing our hands, saying how can we
use this again,'' Heyward said. ``We are not in the deception
business. We're in the reality business. We're in the accuracy
business. To the extent that this technology interferes with that
core belief we're not going to do it. We will absolutely take
seriously the use of this tool.''

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
They were the first team to clinch a playoff berth, the first to
win a division title and the first to secure the home-field
advantage throughout the postseason.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet there are still plenty who doubt the St. Louis Rams are for
real.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they went 13-3 in the regular season, and they've had
enough bad years to have stockpiled a number of top draft picks.
Still, there are those who would put an asterisk by their record.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, they earned that record, but they did so in a year in
which the theme of the NFL was mediocrity. What does that mean for
the Rams? It means they're slightly better than mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what they're hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure a lot of guys feel we have something to prove,
because we haven't gotten the respect we feel we deserve,'' St.
Louis quarterback Kurt Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams believe they've proved themselves over and over. They
scored the third-most points (526) in NFL history and outscored
their opponents by 284 points, the second-largest differential
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? The Minnesota Vikings made a similar run through
the league last season, scoring the most points ever (556) in
compiling a 15-1 record. But for all their flashy numbers, the
Vikings didn't make the Super Bowl, losing at home in the NFC
Championship Game to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams hope they can avoid such a fate Sunday against a
Vikings team that is a year wiser, if a lot less dominant. An
explosive offensive game is expected.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of those who believe the Vikings may be the
team that pulls off the upset this year. The Rams didn't exactly
have the toughest schedule, playing only four teams with winning
records at the time of the matchup. Of those four, only the
Tennessee Titans finished the season with a winning record. The
Titans handed St. Louis one of its three losses. The other two came
at the hands of Detroit and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no denying the numbers this Rams team put up.
Warner, the biggest surprise, was a last-minute fill-in (for the
injured Trent Green) better known for his exploits in the Arena
Football League and NFL Europe than in the NFL. Warner became the
NFL's Most Valuable Player this season, throwing for 4,353 yards
and 41 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been only half the story. Running back Marshall
Faulk, whom the Rams acquired from the Indianapolis Colts two days
before the April draft, led the NFL by gaining a record 2,429 yards
from scrimmage this season (1,381 rushing, 1,048 receiving).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rams figure it's time for the rest of the nation to see
how good they are,'' Warner said. ``We've played to the level of
talent that we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation saw the Rams only on highlight clips.
Considering the team was 45-99 (.311) in the '90s coming into the
season, the networks weren't inclined to schedule their games
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But now that his team has center stage, St. Louis coach Dick
Vermeil hopes the Vikings won't steal the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a pretty good defensive team, but they (the
Vikings) will test you,'' Vermeil said. ``They're going to score.
You just can't make a mistake and give them anything. If you can
prevent the one big-play type of thing, then you've got a shot at
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at Minnesota as being the best offensive team we
were going to play, or had the possibility to play, in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   So as much as these offenses have been getting attention, it's
the defenses that will likely make the difference between winning
and losing.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were the top-ranked pass offense in the league. The
Vikings ranked 30th in pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can score as many points as we scored last year,''
Vikings coach Dennis Green said. ``They have big-play receivers all
over the field. Marshall Faulk was very close to being the MVP. He
can make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' defense has been overshadowed this season by their
offense, but it's not afraid of the Vikings' powerful mix of the
run and pass. The Rams' defense ranked sixth overall and was the
NFL's best against the run. It didn't fare as well against the pass
_ 20th _ but that was in large part because of the enormous leads
that forced opponents to throw much of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams tied for the league lead in sacks with 57, thanks
mostly to defensive end Kevin Carter, the league's individual
leader with 17. The Rams also led the NFC with 29 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're No. 1 in points allowed, No. 1 in rush
defense (75.9 yards per game),'' St. Louis defensive coordinator
John Bunting said. ``I thought we'd be very good on defense this
year. I had no idea we'd be this good on offense. But I knew we'd
be good on defense. Now, we're going to get a chance to prove that
to everybody in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The way to do that is simple. Shut down the Vikings, and it will
be tough for even the most hardened cynics to continue doubting the
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be playing against Minnesota, it's a great thing,'' St.
Louis rookie cornerback Dre' Bly said. ``That was all the talk in
preseason: Randy Moss, Cris Carter and their offense _ their
explosive offense. I'm going to have my track shoes on Sunday.''

FDA WARNS OF OVERUSE OF NEW DRUGS AGAINST FLU 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a widespread outbreak of influenza swamps
hospitals and doctors' offices around the nation, officials at the
Food and Drug Administration Wednesday warned that doctors appear
to be relying too heavily on two new influenza drugs, and said that
some patients may have died because they did not get the more
aggressive treatment they needed.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs, Relenza by Glaxo Wellcome and Tamiflu by
Hoffman-LaRoche, were both approved by the government in the last
six months and are being heavily marketed in television and print
advertisements. Both are intended for patients with uncomplicated
cases of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   But FDA officials said Wednesday that they had evidence that
doctors were prescribing these new antiviral drugs to patients with
complicated cases. Two flu patients whose conditions were
complicated by serious bacterial infections were prescribed Relenza
when they should have received antibiotics; both died, said Dr.
Heidi Jolson, director of the FDA's division of antiviral drug
products.
</P>
<P>
   Three other very sick flu patients taking Relenza also died;
some might have needed more intensive therapy, such as oxygen,
intravenous fluids and hospitalization, Jolson said. In addition, a
flu patient with a serious bacterial infection was prescribed
Tamiflu instead of an antibiotic; that patient recovered, Jolson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths among flu patients are not uncommon; an estimated 20,000
Americans, many of them elderly and infirm, die of the flu every
year. But Jolson said that, with intense media attention focusing
on two heavily advertised drugs during a flu season that is
particularly severe, the agency felt compelled to issue guidance to
doctors about how best to use the new drugs, as well as two older
drugs, amantadine and rimantadine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newer products are being very heavily promoted by the
pharmaceutical companies,'' Jolson said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the deaths, she said: ``These cases suggest that
these products are being in used in patients who are at higher risk
of adverse outcomes. We want to make certain that physicians
understand that there is no evidence that these products work in
those patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have written 300,000 prescriptions for Relenza, an
inhaled medication, according to Lisa Behrens, a spokeswoman for
Glaxo Wellcome. Precise figures for Tamiflu, which comes in pill
form, were not available, but the prescriptions number in the
hundreds of thousands, said Charles Alfaro, a spokesman for Hoffman
LaRoche.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Behrens and Alfaro defended their companies' marketing
campaigns, saying the advertisements are intended to educate
consumers about the potential seriousness of influenza and how to
distinguish between the flu and a common cold. ``While we are being
aggressive, we are being responsible,'' Alfaro said.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, about 30 million Americans suffer from the flu,
which causes fever, aches and pains, and absences from work and
school. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta have said that the flu season arrived this year much
earlier than usual and has increased death rates from pneumonia and
other flu-related illnesses. Emergency rooms are crowded and
hospitals have been postponing elective surgery as a result of the
flood of flu cases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the media attention to Relenza and Tamiflu, neither drug
is a miracle worker. They cut flu symptoms by a little more than a
day, reducing the duration of the disease to a little less than six
days from seven. As a result, a panel of outside experts was less
than enthusiastic when it considered an application for approval of
Relenza, the first of the two drugs to receive the FDA's approval.
The panel recommended that the FDA reject the drug, by a 13-4 vote,
but the agency took the rare step of ignoring its expert advice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition, Relenza may pose a risk for patients with severe
asthma and other breathing disorders, such as chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. Clinical studies found that such patients may
experience a ``bronchospasm,'' a shutting down of the airways,
after taking the drug. As a result, Relenza's warning label
instructs doctors to use special caution when prescribing Relenza
for these patients. The FDA reiterated that warning Wednesday,
saying it had received ``reports of respiratory problems following
inhalation of Relenza.''
</P>
<P>
   In its advisory to doctors Wednesday, the agency said
vaccination remains the only way to prevent influenza. Although the
vaccine takes up to 14 days to produce antibodies that will protect
a patient against the flu, experts say that, even with the flu
season in full swing, it is not too late to get a flu shot.

 JOB OF HEAD COACH JUST A TRIVIALITY IN
JONES' EYES (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By RANDY
GALLOWAY c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ On second thought, we got it all wrong.
``We'' being the local media. ``We'' being the Cowboys' fandom who
applauded as Chan Gailey was canned.
</P>
<P>
   The story line from Valley Ranch seemed simple enough:
</P>
<P>
   Head coach fired.
</P>
<P>
   Give it a couple of weeks and the next story line will be:
</P>
<P>
   Head coach hired.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking of being canned, we can do just that with both
those story lines.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gailey ouster, what we actually had was an offensive
coordinator being fired. In the search for a new man, Jerry Jones
is seeking, yes, another offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The position of head coach at Valley Ranch has been declared not
just trivial, but also janitorial in importance. Mr. Jones does not
believe in the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry first told us that six seasons ago with his famous
statement of ``there are 500 coaches who could ...''
</P>
<P>
   That was Jones' way of saying the just-departed Jimmy Johnson
meant nothing to the success of the Cowboys. And then Jerry put
mustard on his hot dog by bringing in a guy from off the couch in
Norman and making him what? Head coach/gopher.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, why was Gailey the choice of Jerry? Because in
the interview process, Jones took a crash course in Gailey's
offensive expertise, and then declared Chan the answer to what
ailed the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be wrong. But the pattern of how Gailey was
hired won't change anything. Jones is again searching for Mr. Right
at offensive coordinator, and to get him, he might find it
necessary to also throw a bone labeled ``head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in Irving.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry's logic goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``With me in charge, we don't need a head coach. Just somebody
to make Troy happy and call the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   I paraphrase with that, but it's the truth, and Jerry knows it's
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   One little tidbit leaking out after the Gailey dismissal this
week was how angry Chan had been at times over veteran players
being allowed an open-door policy to Jones' office. In particular,
the so-called superstars were always welcome to go over the top on
the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Again, that's just the way it is, and always will be at Valley
Ranch. Plus, this goes right back to the point of Jones having no
respect for the title of head coach.
</P>
<P>
   What Gailey failed to understand was how he ranked in Jerry's
pecking order. He was offensive coordinator, with the ``title'' of
head coach. Those players were going over the head of an offensive
coordinator in taking their gripes to Big Boss Man.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, it has been reported often, was one of the lowest-paid
head coaches in the NFL, if not the lowest. But at the same time,
he was the highest-paid offensive coordinator. Money, of course,
speaks loudly with Jones. Gailey's salary structure comes in louder
and clearer on what Jones considered important.
</P>
<P>
   But if Jerry is successful in finding his desired exacta of
offensive coordinator/head coach, the next victim should ask a lot
of questions about which players can pull rank, and why?
</P>
<P>
   Take Troy Aikman, for starters.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm Aikman, I'd have been holding my own media conference
yesterday, the day after Jones held his on the firing of Gailey.
There is some explaining that needs to be done after the way Jones
verbally lateraled a hot rivet right to Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Jones took about five minutes at one point to finally say the
neck of Gailey had been offered up by offensive players unhappy not
with Chan the man, but Chan the offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry never mentioned the name of Aikman, but he darn sure
didn't mean Flozell Adams.
</P>
<P>
   By attempting to distance himself from the move, Jones put the
smoking gun in Aikman's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Personal opinion _ it made Aikman look cheap and cheesy, kind of
like the Linda Tripp of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   For image purposes alone, it would seem Aikman would want to
address what had been said by Jones. But he didn't, at least not
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong _ in fact, it should be a given _ with
the offensive coordinator needing to be on the same page,
system-wise, with Aikman's abilities. (Despite hearing a thousand
different explanations, I still haven't figured out why Gailey's
wasn't).
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, there should also be the normal separation of
power. The head coach comes first, and then the offensive
coordinator, even if those positions are held by the same guy.
</P>
<P>
   But at Valley Ranch such a thing is impossible. Jerry is the one
and only power. Head coach means nothing, and the new one will be a
fool if he believes otherwise. nn

 FIRED GAILEY PACKED AND GONE (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) By RAY BUCK c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Chan Gailey walked away from Valley Ranch
yesterday just as he had arrived 23 months earlier to the day.
</P>
<P>
   Through the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was fired Tuesday as coach of the Cowboys after getting
to fulfill only two-fifths of a five-year, $3.5-million contract.
He spent yesterday morning cleaning out his office, packing up his
belongings and moving himself.
</P>
<P>
   He received numerous phone calls of support from well-wishers
and friends inside the NFL coaching fraternity, including Atlanta's
Dan Reeves, Pittsburgh's Bill Cowher and Denver's Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   As of yesterday, though, Gailey had not yet received any phone
calls regarding interviews from teams that might be interested in
him for a coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who spent 10 seasons as an NFL assistant in Denver and
Pittsburgh before receiving his first NFL head-coaching job two
years ago, has indicated that he is flexible in listening to
offers, i.e., college or pro, head coach or offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   It has been speculated that Reeves might try to find room on his
staff for Gailey. Both are from Americus, Ga., where the older
Reeves was Gailey's Little League coach. Reeves presently has an
offensive coordinator (George Sefcik) as well as a ``passing
game//playing calling'' coach (Jack Burns).
</P>
<P>
   Fired for the first time in his life, Gailey received some help
from a team employee in loading boxes into Gailey's red sports
utility vehicle. Now with Gailey gone, the focus now shifts to
Jerry Jones finding a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Whom will that be?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Cowboys owner does face a competitive market with no
fewer than four other NFL teams currently looking for head coaches:
New England, Green Bay, New Orleans and the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bill Parcells did meet for two hours yesterday with the
Jets' new billionaire owner, Robert Wood Johnson IV, and the
possibility exists that Parcells (now chief of football operations)
will un-resign and return to coach the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Also yesterday, Texas coach Mack Brown took himself out of any
possible Cowboys head-coaching search by issuing a brief statement
in Austin that he is staying put, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered anytime my name is brought up for an opening,''
Brown said. ``But we're in the midst of a great recruiting year
here. My goal is to win the national championship. And at Texas,
it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas coach Houston Nutt also nixed speculation made in
several Fort Worth-Dallas media outlets that he is a candidate to
succeed Gailey. Yesterday, Nutt received a raise to $950,000 for
the 2000 season (purely coincidental, according to Arkansas
athletic director Frank Broyles) and maintained that he was not
``officially contacted'' by the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   University of Miami football coach Butch Davis, who spent six
seasons coaching with the Cowboys, including two as the team's
defensive coordinator, said yesterday that he's not interested in
coaching in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am flattered every time my name is mentioned as a candidate
for another head-coaching job,'' Davis said. ``However, I have no
interest in any other head-coaching position.''
</P>
<P>
   The hottest name in the NFL head-coaching derby remains St.
Louis Rams offensive coordinator Mike Martz.
</P>
<P>
   New England already has formally requested the opportunity to
interview Martz as soon as the Rams' season is over. The Rams play
host to Minnesota in an NFC divisional-round game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay also has expressed an interest in Martz, but the
Packers, unlike the Patriots, have not bothered to put in a formal
request. It's a moot point since NFL rules don't allow coaches
under contract to be contacted by other teams until their season is
finished.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain whether Jones plans to submit a formal request.
He was in New York yesterday on NFL business and could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Martz, 48, is both smart (summa cum laude graduate of Fresno
State) and tough, described by one observer close to the team as
having both ``good people's skills'' and ``an edge to him.'' Last
summer, Martz yanked rookie quarterback Joe Germaine out of a
``preseason'' game for taking a sack rather than throwing the ball
away.
</P>
<P>
   What would appeal to Jones also is that Martz is a disciple of
Norv Turner and the Washington Redskins' offense. It's an offense
to which Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman is accustomed and what
seemed to give him a greater amount of faith than did Gailey's
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, 47, has gone on record this week saying that he plans to
stay in Washington. The Redskins are in the second round of the
playoffs. Owner Daniel Snyder has openly endorsed bringing Turner
back in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams likewise want to keep Martz. Team president John Shaw
has all but assured his valued offensive coordinator that he is the
heir apparent to Dick Vermeil, who wants to fulfill his contract
through 2001. Vermeil will be 65 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   While Gailey had been a head coach at both the pro (World League
Birmingham Fire) and college (Troy State and Samford) levels before
coming to the Cowboys, Martz has never been a head coach at any
level.
</P>
<P>
   Martz has worked with two Aikman favorites: Ernie Zampese with
the Los Angeles Rams (1992-93) and Turner with the Redskins
(1997-98).
</P>
<P>
   Jones, meanwhile, has a deep admiration (and has stayed in
contact) with former Chicago Bears head coach and Cowboys defensive
coordinator Dave Wannstedt, who is assistant head coach and heir
apparent to Jimmy Johnson with the Miami Dolphins. Johnson tried to
retire a year ago. When the Dolphins (at Jacksonville Saturday) are
finished with the postseason, Johnson could retire again, this time
for good.
</P>
<P>
   Jones will be looking for somebody who can bring in an offensive
philosophy to fit his core of veteran offensive players. If Jones
did settle on Wannstedt or another defensive coach, he would need
to turn to an offensive coordinator along the lines of Zampese, who
helped the Cowboys win a Super Bowl in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese, 63, has one year left on his contract in New England.
There is strong speculation that Pete Carroll's successor will
immediately fire Zampese, who is being blamed for turning Drew
Bledsoe over the second half of the season (2-6) into a
six-touchdown, 17-interception quarterback ... who was sacked 36
times over the last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, there is one short list that counts.
</P>
<P>
   And that's inside Jerry Jones' head.

 RANGERS BRING BACK OLIVER (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The transformation of the Rangers from an
offensive ballclub to one that relies heavily on pitching might be
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The latest step in the makeover was taken yesterday when general
manager Doug Melvin, pushed hard by owner Tom Hicks, signed
free-agent pitcher Darren Oliver to a three-year, $19 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed Oliver is expected to join left-handers Kenny
Rogers and Justin Thompson and right-handers Rick Helling and
Esteban Loaiza in the rotation, with right-handers Matt Perisho and
Mark Clark in reserve. Throw in top prospects Doug Davis, Ryan
Glynn and Corey Lee at Triple-A Oklahoma, and the Rangers have
significantly increased their starting pitching depth.
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on Thompson recovering from shoulder surgery, but
combine a deep rotation with a bullpen headed by All-Stars John
Wetteland and Jeff Zimmerman, and the Rangers might have their best
pitching staff ever.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since the Rangers entered spring
training feeling better about their pitching than they did about
their offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we're queasy about our pitching,'' Melvin said. ``But
if you put the bullpen next to the starters, this is the best since
I've been here. It's a good mix. The look is much better, and the
depth is much better. Now it's up to them to show it's our best
pitching staff ever.''
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, Oliver probably needs to take his game to a
higher level. The Rangers thought he was close to doing that when
he went 14-6 with a 4.66 ERA in 1996, helping them win a division
title.
</P>
<P>
   But he was 13-12 with a 4.20 ERA in 1997 and 6-7 with a 6.53 ERA
in 19 starts in 1998 before being traded to St. Louis. Oliver was
13-13 with a 4.26 ERA in 40 starts for the Cardinals, but they
thought enough of him to offer a four-year, $24 million contract
after last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can go out there every fifth day and keep building up my
innings, with the bullpen they have here, there's no reason why I
can't be a 15-game winner,'' Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin suggested the Rangers were ``done'' when they signed
Rogers, another former Texas pitcher, to a three-year deal Dec. 29.
</P>
<P>
   But Hicks wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin admitted the owner ``challenged me'' to get something
done with Oliver. Negotiations with agent Scott Boras heated up
Monday and an agreement was reached yesterday after Oliver passed a
physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were open to getting both Kenny Rogers and Aaron Sele,''
Hicks said. ``We were open to getting Darren Oliver. The way Sele's
agent handled things was unfortunate, but Kenny Rogers was our No.
1 priority; we had to have a proven, experienced left-hander.
Getting Darren Oliver is a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's chances of re-signing with the Cardinals were
eliminated when they traded for Pat Hentgen and Darryl Kile. He
admitted he started getting nervous as the off-season proceeded
without him signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was kind of like a surprise for me,'' said Oliver, who
lives in Arlington with his wife, Melissa. ``I wasn't sure it would
happen. For some reason the market was frozen up; everything was
slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's contract calls for a base salary of $3 million in 2000
and $5 million in 2001 and 2002. He also gets a $6 million deferred
signing bonus, paid in installments starting in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have arbitration cases pending with Loaiza and
designated hitter Lee Stevens, but Hicks said the club will likely
have a payroll of around $67 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's $8 million to 9 million less than last year, but Hicks
said reducing the payroll wasn't the Rangers' most important issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three goals: develop a winning attitude, get younger
and more aggressive, and improve our pitching,'' Hicks said. ``I
think we've done that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Nelson Mandela, the former South African
president, will step into a new role here next week when the
Security Council plans an open debate on how to deal with a rapidly
worsening political and economic situation in Burundi and the
threat of renewed ethnic warfare in an already devastated part of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Mandela, more than half a dozen African leaders have
been invited to New York for meetings on Burundi and later on Congo
by Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. representative and this month's
Security Council president.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the largest gathering of African presidents ever to
meet with the council, diplomats say. The list of those planning to
come over the next two weeks includes Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe,
Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Pasteur
Bizimungu of Rwanda, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique and Sir
Ketumile Masire, a former president of Botswana who has been named
a mediator in the Congo civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke expressed optimism Wednesday that President Laurent
Kabila of Congo would also attend.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi's government, concerned that it will be under attack in
the council, will send a team of high-level ministers, although who
they will be was in some doubt after a cabinet shake-up on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela will address the council as the new international
mediator for Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi is mired in civil war and economic collapse and is under
pressure by relief and rights organizations, backed by some
diplomats, to make immediate changes in government policies before
any assistance can be extended.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the debate is Burundi's policy of
``regroupment.'' The Tutsi-led government of President Pierre
Buyoya has forcibly resettled about 300,000 mostly ethnic Hutus in
dozens of spartan camps. The purpose is to contain what the
government says is a rebel movement backed by the genocidal
Interahamwe militia, which was responsible for much of the killing
of Tutsi and moderate Hutu in neighboring Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Interahamwe and some exiled soldiers from the former Hutu
Rwandan army, chased out of Rwanda by a Tutsi force after the
genocide, have been returning to Rwanda and crossing into Burundi,
said Marc Nteturuye, Burundi's representative at the United
Nations. He said that Burundi's crisis can be dealt with only as
part of a larger regional problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Interahamwe is colluding with Burundi rebels and fighting
on Burundi soil,'' he said. ``Peace in Burundi depends also on
peace in the Congo. Burundi is mixed into that conflict.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nteturuye said that the aim of his government's policy is to
protect civilians, but the emptying of villages also deprives
rebels of support bases and hiding places.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. relief officials say they have been torn between a
conviction that the Burundian policy violates international law
governing the movement of populations and their own commitment to
meeting the needs of the civilians in the camps, where hunger and
disease are common. Complicating relief agency decisions was the
murder last year of two aid officials at one of the camps and the
government's failure to solve the case.
</P>
<P>
   Nteturuye said in an interview that the government had
identified the killers, who since fled across the border into
Tanzania and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the camps, people don't have everything they need, but they
are happy to be protected,'' he said. He added that if rebels were
allowed to continue to roam in and around the capital, there was
certain to be a backlash from other, presumably Tutsi, armed gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are extremists on both sides,'' he said. ``We have to
weaken them and strengthen the middle ground.''

WITH ZEAL, INCINERATOR OPPONENTS DOG GORE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ohio, W.Va.)  (jw) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LIVERPOOL, Ohio _ An old press release from Vice
President-elect Al Gore, issued in the first flush of victory in
1992, is being preserved here like the Magna Carta.
</P>
<P>
   And seven years after he issued that release pledging to block
the local hazardous waste incinerator that has become a national
environmental cause, the same determined protesters who believed
Gore in 1992 and have dogged him ever since _ staging protests and
suffering arrests _ are on his trail once more as he heads for
Ohio's presidential primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's developed a bit of courage,'' said Terri
Swearingen, a registered nurse and sharp-barbed opponent of the
toxic chemical waste incinerator which vents steadily into the air,
day after day, just 1,100 feet from an elementary school attended
by 400 children in this humble Ohio River valley town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Gore's broken promise,'' said Ms. Swearingen, a
nine-times-arrested local demonstrator who was carried off from one
sit-in inside the White House two months into the Clinton-Gore
administration, after she found the waste incinerator going into
operation despite campaign pledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``You promised!'' she and her colleagues have shouted at the
vice president across Gore's seven years in office even as the
administration insisted it discovered that it was legally unable to
block the plant's opening because in the final weeks of the Bush
administration approval was granted to test the plant's furnace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read your book!'' critics have shouted, reminding Gore, the
environmentalist author, of his claim to being the nonpareil
political watchdog on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions, Gore's office said this week that,
``as promised, we looked exhaustively'' at the issue and found the
initial test permit from the Bush administration ``can't be revoked
unless we can prove it violated health and safety standards.'' At
least two reviews could find no such violations, according to
Melissa Bonney Ratcliff, a Gore spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the Clinton-Gore victory in 1992, Gore, a leading
critic of incineration, promised that the new administration would
prevent the plant from opening until Congress investigated its
safety and how it received federal approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very idea of putting it in a flood plain, you know, it's
just unbelievable to me,'' candidate Gore had said of the
incinerator when he campaigned in July 1992 in nearby Weirton,
W.Va. ``We'll be on your side for a change,'' he promised
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In the third month of the new administration, the plant,
operated by Waste Technologies Industries, was permitted to begin
commercial operation. While Gore has maintained the incinerator
could not be blocked, environmentalists insist it could have been
stopped if the Clinton-Gore team resolved to do so after the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swearingen and other opponents have been fighting the
regional commercial incinerator, from proposal to construction,
across the past 20 years, turning a mayor out of office here over
the issue. In now pointing to the Ohio primary, they are determined
to show that a candidate's pledge that goes around, comes around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reminding Mr. Gore of his promise as he runs on his
own,'' said Alonzo Spencer, a retired steelworker, who is
galvanizing his Save Our County protest group once more at this
fresh opportunity to target the incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the primary, a dozen organizations, including the
environmental group Greenpeace and Ms. Swearingen's Tri-State
Environmental Council, have requested a meeting about the
incinerator with Gore, promising there will be no new civil
disobedience disruptions, at least not ``at or during this
meeting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We are now feeling that the health effects we first warned
about back then are starting to come true,'' Spencer said,
referring to a state health study in 1997 that reported
``strikingly higher'' cancer mortality rates for East Liverpool
than for the state and nation.
</P>
<P>
   The local cancer mortality rate for the four years through 1995
was 235.0 per 100,000, compared to 182.6 for the state and 172.2
for the nation. Spencer agrees the causes of cancer can be complex
and long running, but he insists that opening the plant so close to
a school in a troubled region of old steel, foundry and pottery
industries ``exacerbated an already high-risk situation.'' A
detailed study has been started to search for causal evidence
beyond the data, with no definitive tie yet reported to the
incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   The plant annually burns 63,000 tons of hazardous waste,
including lead, mercury and hundreds of other toxic chemicals.
Waste gases and particles from the smokestack, including dioxin,
are supposed to be within permissible federal limits, but opponents
note that the state fined the plant $126,000 in the past for
violations of air monitoring requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's proximity to the East Elementary School has been
underlined in various studies as a potentially risky situation. A
state law was passed soon after the incinerator began operating
that required at least 2,000 feet of separation between schools or
homes and any new incinerators, almost double the safety margin
here.
</P>
<P>
   As the primary approaches, critics are emphasizing that the
incinerator has been operating on an interim basis ever since the
initial federal permit expired in 1995. So this is the time once
more to press Gore over the issue and try to embarrass him if
necessary, according to the opposition, whose prowess is well
tested.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swearingen said she had already spoken with former Sen. Bill
Bradley, Gore's rival for the nomination. ``We are always looking
for that one person to take this seriously,'' she said.

DPS CHAIRMAN WARNS TOP OFFICIALS TO ROOT OUT RACISM, SEXISM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Department of Public Safety top officials were
ordered Wednesday to root out any vestiges of racism and sexism in
the agency and warned that there would be ``zero tolerance'' of
prejudicial activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not welcome in DPS if you are going to conduct your
business in a racist or sexist way,'' said James Francis of Dallas,
chairman of the three-member Public Safety Commission that oversees
DPS activities.
</P>
<P>
   His comments _ the strongest to date since reports surfaced
about birthday parties given for two black troopers more than a
decade ago by uniformed white troopers wearing Ku Klux Klan-type
hoods _ came during a Public Safety Commission meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to take every step you can possibly think of to
ensure that this never happens again in this agency,'' he added in
a stern warning to the agency's top leadership. ``I want you all to
enforce that in a relentless way. I mean zero tolerance, and it's
up to you all to root it out, not just turn your heads the other
way. I am serious. It cannot stand, people.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday marked the first time the commission has met since
news of the parties, held on two different occasions in the
Livingston, Texas, office, surfaced last week.
</P>
<P>
   Francis earlier this week was reappointed by Gov. George W. Bush
to another six-year term on the commission; its other members are
M. Colleen McHugh of Corpus Christi and Robert Holt of Midland.
Francis also is chairman of a high-level fund-raising organization
for Bush's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, DPS suspended with pay four East Texas
troopers who participated in the most recent party and two others
allegedly involved in making racist comments in more recent
incidents. DPS is continuing its investigation of the incidents.
Final disciplinary action is pending completion of a DPS internal
affairs investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the activities became public Jan. 5, when former
Livingston state trooper Darron Anderson, 35, released pictures
taken at his party in 1988 or 1989. He made the snapshots public
the day before he was in court on an arson charge. He is accused of
setting fire to his truck last April in a botched scheme to collect
insurance; he was fired from DPS after the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has said he was traumatized by the KKK party but waited
years to come forward because as a rookie he feared for his job.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, one of Anderson's former supervisors has said that
Anderson himself requested the party after seeing photographs of a
similar affair thrown for another black trooper four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want, in any way, to leave any doubt in anybody's
mind: This commission will not tolerate any acts _ overt, covert,
serious, funny, whatever _ of racism or sexism in this
organization,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Francis said that even if the parties were
thrown in jest, DPS employees should have known such behavior is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agency will not tolerate a jocular association with the
KKK. Period,'' he said. ``I'm not saying it was jocular, but given
some people are saying it was jocular, that's still not acceptable
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DPS not only needs to complete its investigation of these
activities but also ``look at the bigger picture of diversity
training, race relations, cultural sensitivity and we need to do a
better job. Obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Long before the Jasper case, in which a black man was dragged to
death behind a pickup driven by three white men two years ago, East
Texas has had a history of racial problems and suspected Klan
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things I asked our people to look into today
on a kind of a broader basis,'' Francis said. ``Is this an `old
trooper' problem? Are we dealing with old men who just don't get it
in the '90s?''

RENO SAYS ONLY FEDERAL COURTS CAN RULE ON RESCUED CUBAN BOY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Fla.)  (Eds.: SUBS to revise top 5 graphs, shifting emphasis; Pickup 4th

officials...' adding legal analysis is also new.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday that
only federal courts had the authority to decide whether a
6-year-old boy should be reunited with his father in Cuba but said
immigration officials had lifted a Friday deadline for his return
to allow his relatives to appeal in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to lawyers for the boy's relatives in Miami, Reno
said the issue of what happened to the boy, Elian Gonzalez, who was
rescued at sea clinging to an inner tube after his mother drowned,
was the sole province of the federal courts. She said that a
Florida state court had no jurisdiction in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Reno emphatically reaffirmed her belief that the
law required that Elian should be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is considering going to court this week
to ask a federal judge to enforce the immigration ruling in hope of
hastening a resolution to what has become a difficult, emotional
political and diplomatic problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has adopted a dual approach to
dealing with the poignant story of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, officials are striving to show that their ruling
giving Elian's father the right to make the decision for the boy is
the product of well-established law that sets a priority on family
unification, and that they are willing to have it tested in federal
court. At the same time, the administration is moving to end the
stalemate quickly, possibly seeking a court order that could lead
to U.S. marshals' being sent to fetch Elian from the Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Reno said that a separate lawsuit filed in
Florida state court by the relatives to gain custody of Elian had
no bearing on the case, which she said could be decided only in
federal court. Judge Rosa Rodriguez of the Miami-Dade Circuit Court
ruled on Monday that Elian must remain in the United States until a
March 6 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Reno brushed aside that ruling Wednesday, saying that the state
court order ``has no force or effect'' on the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's decision in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of who may speak for a 6-year-old child in
applying for admission or asylum is a matter of federal immigration
law,'' Reno wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials and legal analysts said they
believed that Reno had the authority to decide as she did because
the immigration issues that were under federal jurisdiction took
precedence over the custody matter before the Florida court.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the Florida relatives, said in a
telephone interview that the family would soon take up Reno's
invitation to file a challenge to the immigration service ruling in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   But Eig said the relatives would also maintain their efforts to
have a state court award them legal custody of Elian. ``We are not
removing this case from the state court,'' he said. ``We will seek
protection for Elian's civil rights in federal court as a separate
action.''
</P>
<P>
   No clear end appears in sight in the stalemate over Elian's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials had been hoping that Elian's
relatives would not dig in their heels and refuse to allow the boy
to return to Cuba. But since last week's ruling by the immigration
service, hundreds of Cuban-Americans have taken to the streets in
South Florida, vowing to prevent his return.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Wednesday's action in lifting the deadline
was part of the effort to demonstrate that the decision to rule in
favor of the father was a product of the law.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that the deep fear behind all the legal
maneuvering was that the situation would deteriorate to a stage
where the federal government would have to use marshals to assume
physical custody of the boy. ``We are still hopeful that we can
resolve this matter soon,'' a senior official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eig said that the family would abide by any court decision and
fully understood that it would not be in the best interests of the
child to have any confrontation with the federal authorities in
which Elian would be forcibly taken from them. But he left open the
possibility that the relatives might feel that a state court ruling
in their favor on custody might trump the federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised that Ms. Reno would not respect a state court
ruling on what is essentially a state matter,'' Eig said. He
asserted that it was common for federal courts to look to state
courts to determine a person's status in making immigration
rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Wednesday made it clear that she believed otherwise. She
also offered a long rebuttal to the lawyers' contention that
immigration service guidelines mandated that Elian should be given
a full hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Lichtman, a veteran immigration lawyer in Washington,
who has no connection to the case, said in an interview that he
believed the state court was ``getting into something clearly
beyond its jurisdiction''
</P>
<P>
   He said it appeared that the Justice Department had been correct
in its approach, ``but the question is how are they going to
enforce it.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. made it official Wednesday,
naming David Bowers to assume some of the responsibilities of its
longtime chief investment strategist, Charles Clough, who is
retiring this week.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Merrill announced plans to get out of some areas of
the commodities business, including the trading of futures
contracts on agricultural products and metals. The firm said it
would continue trading futures on oil and other energy products.
</P>
<P>
   Before the holidays, Merrill chose Bowers, who has been the
firm's European stock strategist in London, to be its global
strategist in New York. But it postponed announcing the appointment
as it sorted out who would fill which jobs on its strategy team.
Not all the seats have been filled.
</P>
<P>
   Clough's job is being split in two to create positions for a
global strategist and a United States strategist, a setup that
exists at some other big securities firms. At Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co., for example, Barton Biggs is the global strategist
and Byron Wien handles domestic strategy. On occasion, the two have
publicly disagreed on how much money investors should put into the
American stock and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said Merrill was recruiting somebody to be the firm's
domestic strategist, the primary voice its 14,000 American brokers
will hear on the outlook for the market and particular sectors and
stocks. That search should be completed within three months, a
Merrill spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to have somebody on the team who really does
understand the American market and the mindset of American
investors,'' Bowers said. Although, he added, ``Europe in the last
three months has seen some pretty wacky valuations as well, so I'm
no stranger to unusual market levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Melnick, co-head of Merrill's investment research
department, said Bowers' focus would be ``broader than a United
States strategist's, to emphasize those particular parts of the
world that are the most attractive for global investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, 40, who is British, said that he and his wife, who is a
doctor in London, and their young son would move to New York in
about three weeks. After that, he said, he will begin publishing
and broadcasting his views on where in the world investors should
be putting their money.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clough, 57, annoyed some Merrill brokers with his
persistent bearishness about American stocks in recent years,
Bowers said he would be tough to follow because he was ``a great
raconteur, a great performer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a start, people will have to get used to a slightly
different accent,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Clough, who has commuted to Merrill's New York headquarters over
the last 14 years, plans to manage money for wealthy families and
nonprofit groups in Boston, where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   As for Merrill's decision to stop trading some commodities,
analysts predicted that it would have only a slight effect on
Merrill's finances. In the last few years, Merrill has derived only
about $200 million, or 1 percent of its annual revenue, from
commodities-trading commissions over all, said Guy Moszkowski, an
analyst with the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup. The
changes Merrill is making should reduce Merrill's revenue by less
than $100 million.

DISNEY MOVIE CHIEF LEAVING TO FORM OWN STUDIO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Joe Roth, who has been in charge of Walt Disney
Motion Pictures since 1994 and chairman of Walt Disney Studios
since 1996, said Wednesday that he was leaving Disney to form his
own mini-studio, a company that will both make and distribute
movies. He is being replaced by Peter Schneider, his
second-in-command and the longtime head of the lucrative animation
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great time to be out forming a new company,'' Roth
said. ``As someone who has supervised over 250 movies over the last
15 years, I felt I would be happier cobbling together my own
company, which simply made movies, without the infrastructure and
cost and overhead that any big studio carries with it.''
</P>
<P>
   News of Roth's impending departure came as little surprise. He
had told friends and associates over the last year that he was
eager to run his own company again and unsure about remaining in a
corporate environment like Disney. ``Joe's been always saying he
wanted to get out and be his own boss and misses the independent
world,'' said Jerry Bruckheimer, who has produced several Disney
films during Roth's tenure, including the 1998 hit ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   It did, however, come as a big blow to Disney, which has been
struggling to overcome sagging earnings and has suffered other
high-level executive departures. Its shares fell $2.5625 Wednesday,
to $33.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's contract with Disney was extended last summer, but
negotiations on a new contract were delayed, and Roth, 51, said he
was asked by Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of Disney, to take
some time over the holidays and make a final decision about whether
he intended to stay with the studio or leave.
</P>
<P>
   It was while he was in Barbados with his family, Roth said, that
he finally decided that the time to break away from Disney and form
his own company was too ripe to resist, given the new and growing
opportunities offered by the Internet to market and, eventually,
distribute entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start thinking of this because of the AOL-Time
merger,'' Roth said, referring to Monday's deal between America
Online and Time Warner, ``but I did feel that there had to be a
coming convergence of new and old media.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked for three men in my life: Rupert Murdoch, Barry
Diller and Michael Eisner,'' he added. ``Kind of long shadows
there. It just seemed like a good time to go back out on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner and Roth discounted reports that Roth had been unhappy at
Disney or that he had chafed under Eisner's corporate rule. ``He
and I got along terrifically,'' Eisner said. ``It's just that the
entrepreneurial spirit is in the air. Joe is a guy who is an
adventurer. If he wants to do this, I'm behind him. The people who
do the jobs inside a corporation have to be really committed to it,
because they are really hard jobs.''
</P>

   During the six years that Roth played a role in building
Disney's slate of movies, the studio has been in first place at the
box office for five years and in second place for the remaining
year. In 1999, for instance, Disney was in first place on the
strength of successes like ``Toy Story 2,'' ``Tarzan'' and ``The
Sixth Sense.'' Some other Disney live-action efforts, though, like
``The Insider'' and ``Bicentennial Man,'' did not perform well at
the box office, although ``The Insider'' was a critical success and
is considered an Oscar contender.
</P>
<P>
   News of Roth's departure was to be made public next week, but
the announcement was moved forward when word began to leak out of
the studio _ particularly after a Los Angeles Times article
appeared Wednesday morning, quoting unnamed sources.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, 49, the longtime head of Disney's animation division,
was promoted a year ago to president of the studio. He was given
supervisory control of all films released under the Walt Disney
label (some of the studio's films are released under the Touchstone
and Hollywood Films banners). Schneider was also in charge of
Disney's theatrical efforts, including the Tony-winning Broadway
musical ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schneider was out of the country when the announcement was made
and unavailable for comment, studio spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said that the change from Roth to Schneider did not
indicate that there would be a major strategic shift at the studio
_ for instance, that Disney would be making more Disney-banner,
family-oriented films and fewer adult-oriented, live-action
features _ although he expects that the new chairman's creative
sensibility will inevitably be felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of Disney films now and we will continue to do
more,'' Eisner said. But the studio will continue to release
significant live-action features, and films by Miramax, a wholly
owned subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said that he intended to begin looking for new office space
and talking to partners who might want to be part of his new
effort, adding that he had no partners lined up as yet. Some of the
creative people he worked with over the years _ he is known to have
extremely close relationships with actors like Bruce Willis and
Julia Roberts, as well as with producers like Bruckheimer _ will
probably announce in coming weeks that they will work with him
again, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   His dream, he said, is to build a company that makes movies and
uses the new digital world in a creative way, to market and
distribute the films. In particular, he hopes to distribute his new
company's films himself, at least domestically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a place for a company that distributes film
and pictures, the way Miramax does, and that has strategic partners
who get to use these films in their own delivery,'' he said. ``I
got kind of caught up in the whole `Blair Witch' thing, when it
happened, on how you could use the Internet as a marketing tool,''
he said, referring to the movie that became a big hit last summer
largely on the strength of its online marketing campaign. ``If I
can do it, I would love to have a company that distributes itself,
at least in the U.S. market.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that the new company _ no name has been chosen yet _
will have a film in release by the summer of 2001.

ELLA GOLDBERG WOLFE, 103, COMMUNIST TURNED REAGANITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ella Goldberg Wolfe, who witnessed the rise and ebb of the
historic tide of communism with her husband, Bertram, one of the
founders of the American party and later one of Moscow's severest
critics, died Jan. 8 at her Spanish-style home in Palo Alto, Calif.
She was 103.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wolfe's life was lived in three centuries, but it is
emblematic of the searing ideological debates surrounding the rise
of communism, the holy war of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1919, her husband, Bertram D. Wolfe, wrote the manifesto that
created the Communist Party of the United States, and the couple
worked determinedly to build what they envisioned would be a
workers' paradise. By the 1970s both had become staunch Reaganites,
with Wolfe having become a prominent historian of why the Russian
Revolution had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wolfe, who was barely 5 feet tall and had arresting blue
eyes, tended to work behind the scenes. When Wolfe, who was well
over 6 feet, served in Moscow on the Comintern, then communism's
international governing body, she was a Comintern secretary. When
he wrote a dozen books and scores of articles, she helped edit and
polish them.
</P>
<P>
   But she was not a shrinking violet, and she never seemed too
timid to contradict her brilliant husband in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lived in primary colors,'' said Dean Crawford, an English
professor at Vassar who spent endless hours listening to the Wolfes
tell stories when he was a graduate student at Stanford. ``She was
an extraordinarily intelligent, passionate and committed person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfes were part of what was known before World War I as
``the lyrical left,'' that portion of the socialist movement that
combined the aspirations of radical labor with the passions of
Greenwich Village cultural rebels. Wolfe collaborated with John
Reed to write ``The Left Wing Manifesto,'' the document that
created the American Communist Party in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   If their life sounds like the movie ``Reds,'' that is perhaps
because researchers for the movie interviewed Mrs. Wolfe
extensively. During the Red scare of the 1920s in the United
States, the couple fled surreptitiously from city to city.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico they were friends of the artist Diego Rivera. In
Moscow they dealt personally with Stalin and the leaders of the
Bolshevik Revolution. During the Spanish Civil War, Mrs. Wolfe
became close to the poet Leon Felipe. Later in life, Mrs. Wolfe
became friendly with Edward Teller, the physicist and
anti-communist.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had quite an interesting life and knew a great many
interesting people,'' the author Ted Morgan said in an
understatement. Morgan's ``Covert Life: Jay Lovestone'' was
published last year by Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Ella Goldberg was born near Kherson, Ukraine, on May 10, 1896,
and as a child emigrated to Brooklyn, where she grew up among
intellectuals and idealists who gravitated toward socialism. At 14
she met Bert Wolfe on a Prospect Park tennis court. The
conversation developed quickly. ``If you were my girl, I'd take you
to the Black Forest for our honeymoon,'' Ted Morgan wrote that
Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   She soon became his girl, and in 1917, when Bert was 20 and Ella
18, they were married. The municipal judge who performed the
ceremony admired Wolfe's kiss _ ``Kissed like a pro,'' he said,
according to the book. Instead of taking a Black Forest honeymoon,
they put their money into a small Brooklyn apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In those early years, Mrs. Wolfe's activities were mainly as an
unpaid aide, editor and secretary to her husband in his activities
as a street-corner labor organizer and pamphleteer. To dedicate
themselves wholeheartedly to communism, the couple decided to have
no children, a decision Mrs. Wolfe later told confidants she
regretted.
</P>
<P>
   But they were a devoted couple, as suggested by Wolfe's
pseudonym in the anxious years after the passage of the Sedition
Act of 1918, when he could not write under his own name. It was
``Elbert Lovell,'' from Ella plus Bert and love plus Ella. When
Wolfe wrote perhaps his most influential critique of communism,
``Three Who Made a Revolution,'' published by Dial Press in 1948,
the dedication read, ``For Ella.''
</P>
<P>
   The days after the Wolfes' marriage were a dizzy intellectual
and political whirl. Vladimir Mayakovsky, the mercurial Soviet
poet, came naturally to their circle. Just as naturally, Mrs. Wolfe
lent him $200, which he never paid back. In fact, he began
spreading the rumor that she was his lover. ``She denied that with
great amusement,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfes fled repeatedly as state and federal crackdowns
against communists intensified. They lived underground in New York,
San Francisco and Washington. They used false identities and secret
residences, and several times were just a step ahead of the
authorities in midnight chases through the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   They also lived in Mexico City on several occasions. In addition
to Diego Rivera, they became friends with the photographers Edward
Weston and Tina Modotti and the exiled Bolshevik leader Trotsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wolfe became particularly close to Frida Kahlo, the
surrealist painter, who had had an affair with Trotsky. As Soviet
agents closed in on Trotsky, the painter gave love letters he had
written her to Mrs. Wolfe and asked her to burn them if anything
ever happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wolfe always asserted that she did, saying friendship is
stronger than history. But others suspect that the letters may be
found in her possessions. ``She was a squirrel,'' Morgan said.
``She kept everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1929 the couple went to Moscow so that Wolfe could serve on
the Comintern. Responding to requests from friends, they took along
a suitcase filled with toilet paper. According to Morgan's book,
Russian customs officials opened the suitcases, took out the rolls
one by one and unrolled them on the floor, looking for hidden
messages. The toilet paper was then unusable, so, like everyone
else, the Wolfes used Pravda.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting attended by Stalin, Wolfe defied party orthodoxy by
arguing in favor of ``American exceptionalism,'' the doctrine that
conditions in the United States require different approaches from
those used in Russia. That angered Stalin, who Mrs. Wolfe described
65 years later as fearsome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stalin was dressed in a tan tunic with leather boots,'' she
told Morgan. ``He was smaller than I expected, with a pockmarked
face, a brutal mouth and the yellow eyes of a mountain lion.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Beichman, a senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution and Peace and an expert on Russia,
said: ``It's a miracle they didn't have an accident happen to them.
Vehicular accidents, particularly ones involving the KGB, were
quite common in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   The two were kept under house arrest for six months, released
only after the intervention of Dr. Julius Hammer, the father of
Armand Hammer. Wolfe was expelled from the party. Mrs. Wolfe left
two years later after the party demanded that she denounce her
husband as a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   The two did not renounce communism, but instead allied
themselves with the branch of the U.S. party identified with Jay
Lovestone, its Zelig-like leader who went on to be an
anti-communist and finally an American spy. Adherents called its
ideology ``the thinking man's communism.'' Stalin considered it
heretical in part because it embraced greater internal democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1940s, Mrs. Wolfe earned a master's degree in
Spanish literature at Columbia University. She then taught for many
years in public schools and Hunter College. Though the Wolfes had
been critical of Stalin's show trials in 1938, they finally left
the Lovestone party after the Soviet Union allied with Nazi Germany
on the eve of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, Wolfe accepted an appointment at the Hoover
Institution in Palo Alto, where the couple became famous for their
vibrant dinner parties, attended by people who had known the
luminaries of the 20th century. But the Wolfes were the real stars
of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between them, they made a most interesting couple,'' said
Robert Conquest, a Hoover Institution fellow who has written
extensively about the Soviet Union. They would contradict each
other. It would increase the liveliness of the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe died in 1977 at 81. Mrs. Wolfe did not slow down,
continuing to drive until she was 96. As recently as a year ago she
sent a $200 donation to Partisan Review, and then another $100
after getting a nice thank-you letter. ``She also sent a lovely
note of appreciation,'' said Edith Kurzweil, the journal's editor.
</P>
<P>
   Many remember, and admire, her razor-sharp tongue. ``You've been
ill since the Spanish-American War,'' she once said to her husband
after he had complained about one physical ailment or another.

SPORTS COLUMN: APPLE PIE AND MOM AND A DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four decades ago, a Hall of Fame career began in
Geneva, N.Y., with a young Cuban immigrant and a coffee shop menu
that he could not read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't communicate with people the way I would've liked
to,'' Tony Perez said. ``I'd go to a restaurant and just point at
the menu. I remember one time, I ordered lunch and they brought me
apple pie a la mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's timing and expression cued his audience to laugh. Back
then, it couldn't have been so funny for Perez, or the five other
Cubans with the Cincinnati Reds' farm team in the New York-Penn
League. Three of them, Perez said, were gone by the end of their
first season, gone home, overwhelmed by the cultural differences
and quite possibly a few inhospitable townsfolk whose idea of apple
pie did not include a slice of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy those first few years,'' Perez said. ``I
couldn't even talk to the players on the field, didn't know what
they meant when they said, `Hit the cutoff man' or `Throw home.' It
wasn't like it is today, with so many players who speak English and
Spanish, who can help a young player adjust. I stayed on the team,
though, didn't give up. I wanted to be a ballplayer. It paid off _
for me, for my family. Here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   There he was, next to his fellow inductee Carlton Fisk on
Wednesday at a Manhattan news conference, after the announcement
Tuesday that he had been voted to baseball's Hall of Fame following
a nine-year wait.
</P>
<P>
   Perez always said that if ever made it, his first call would
have to be to his mother back in Central Violeta, Cuba. Teodora
Regal shouted the good news to the uncles and the many cousins when
Perez telephoned her from his home in Puerto Rico. Then she sobbed,
blessing the voters and thanking the heavens that she had lived to
88, long enough to see her 57-year-old son become the first
Cuban-born player to make the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Perez admitted his mother had made him a bit weepy, too, which
is no easy thing. One of Perez's two sons, Victor, said he could
remember only one other time during his 33 years when he had seen
his father emotionally overcome.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1977, the family in Montreal after Perez was traded there
by Cincinnati following successive World Series titles by the Big
Red Machine, which was, in itself, a devastating blow. In the
clubhouse after a game, Victor Perez watched as his parents went
off to a separate room, consoled there by other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had just received word that his father, our grandfather,
had died,'' he said. ``Then they came out and told us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing was, neither Victor nor his brother, Eduardo, had met
their paternal grandparents. Telephone conversations had been
frequent, but it wasn't until 1992 that Victor Perez, who lives and
works in New York City, made it to Cuba to meet Teodora, to
experience, first-hand, his father's roots.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Perez had never been one to regale his sons with stories of
Cuba, or his struggles from the early 1960's, when his new country
seemed as politically and socially roiled as the old one. Perez led
by action, by example. He prided himself on consistency,
dependability, on his quietly productive presence in the middle of
a family or a lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a culture shock, to be honest, when I finally met my
father's family,'' Victor Perez said. ``They treated me from the
first moment like one of them, but after all those years, it was
like I had all these new relatives. It was very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of the price Tony Perez agreed to pay for
chasing a dream, from Castro's Cuba to the major leagues. Perez
played 23 seasons, in five World Series. He won the 1967 All-Star
Game with a 15th-inning home run, and briefly got to manage the
Reds. He wondered what the point of it all was when he couldn't be
home for his father's death. When Teodora was ill last year, he
rushed to Cuba. She recovered. She told him she had a premonition
that this would be his year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how she knew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was proud for not only himself, but also for Puerto Rico's
Orlando Cepeda, who was inducted last year. These were men who
helped to knock down cultural barriers for the multitude of today's
Hispanic major league stars. And no, Tony Perez had nothing much to
say about John Rocker, beyond a subtle contention that
psychological testing would not help as much as a good, long lesson
in American history, and its culinary delights.
</P>
<P>
   That apple pie a la mode, Perez said, was his dream come true.  &QL;

ON FOOTBALL: JETS' NEW OWNER WANTS PARCELLS, AND WITH GOOD REASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What several National Football League owners said this week that
they most liked about Robert Wood Johnson IV, the man who just
spent $635 million to purchase the New York Jets, was his dogged,
almost religious conviction to acquire the team. When Johnson sets
his sights on something, it usually becomes his. And right now,
Johnson has targeted arguably one of the best coaches in sports
these days, Bill Parcells, and is willing to pay the former Jets
guru whatever it reasonably takes to pull him out of coaching
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   According to several NFL owners familiar with Johnson's
thinking, the new Jets owner is prepared to give Parcells a
financial package that would make it difficult for him to refuse
returning as coach and general manager for one more season. The
package might include the doubling of Parcells' salary, which could
make Parcells the first $5 million-a-year coach in football. He
would surpass Seattle coach Mike Holmgren, who is also the team's
general manager, as the NFL's highest-paid coach. Holmgren is
reportedly earning $4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility for Johnson, though more unlikely, is that
Johnson would give Parcells a small piece of the Jets to come back
as head coach. Such a transfer, however, would first require the
approval of 24 of the league's 31 owners.
</P>
<P>
   There is even the chance that Johnson would pay Parcells
handsomely simply to have a daily involvement in the running of the
team for at least one year. In other words, Parcells would pick the
coach, then remain on as less of an adviser and more of a general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake about it: Johnson's first choice is to have
Parcells coach the team.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL owners said that Parcells and Johnson already had at
least one telephone conversation after Johnson had been approved as
owner Tuesday. Wednesday, , Parcells, team president Steve Gutman
and Johnson met at the Jets' complex in Hempstead, N.Y., for two
hours. Parcells and Johnson are likely to meet again, sans Gutman,
at least several times in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson has found his man. It's Parcells, and knowing the way
Parcells loves money more than the average bear, it is hard to
imagine Parcells not accepting any significant offer from Johnson.
Not to mention that Parcells always does what is best for Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of teams are going up.
</P>
<P>
   The price of coaching is going up.
</P>
<P>
   The price of Tuna may be way above market price.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Parcells back out of retirement is the smartest thing
Johnson could do in a lot of ways. With all due respect to Al Groh,
or Bill Belichick, or almost anyone else, no one is better suited
to lead the Jets than Parcells. He dragged the team to an 8-8
record after a bleak start with nothing but his will after losing
quarterback Vinny Testaverde to a season-ending injury and
developing the backup thrower Ray Lucas into a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Parcells himself caused some of the turmoil the Jets
have endured. By not knowing that Belichick would leave the team,
he failed dramatically as a general manager. By not acquiring even
a decent backup quarterback, believing that Rick Mirer could do the
job when the rest of the league knew he was a bust, he failed
dramatically as a talent evaluator.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells is such a brilliant, strong and in some ways
maniacal personality, as well as a smart tactician once the games
begin, no one else in the NFL can repair the recent damage to the
Jets and then go on to lead the team to a championship. If Parcells
does not come back, the Jets will be a playoff team. If Parcells
does return, they are one of four American Conference teams in
Indianapolis, Jacksonville and Denver that could get to the Super
Bowl. For the Jets, Parcells on the sideline is like going into a
game already ahead by a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's prying Parcells off the golf course also helps
Johnson. If he is successful in bringing him back, Johnson will
look like a hero. Thus, Jets fans will fall in love with the
billionaire, and as good a person as Johnson may be, even he is
likely to be no stranger to vanity.
</P>
<P>
   When the NFL finance committee approved Johnson over Charles
Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, they knew that Johnson would be
an easier man for the league's other owners to tolerate. While it
has been portrayed in the news media that Dolan had recently
surpassed Johnson in the bid for the Jets, that wasn't the case.
Most owners and members of the finance committee have always wanted
Johnson over Dolan, fretting over Dolan's intermingled interests
between his businesses and other sports franchises. For Dolan to
win, he would have needed to beat Johnson's bid significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the money had anything to do with it,'' Dolan
said. ``They had their concerns. Whatever I did wouldn't have
mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the NFL is concerned, Johnson was the better choice
anyway. He works quietly and won't let his ego get in the way.
There are already indications that he will do whatever it takes to
make the Jets better.
</P>
<P>
   And by getting Parcells, the Jets can instantly become better,
as in Super Bowl better.

NEW LAW TIES UP CZECH BORDER POSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.Korea)  (js)

   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ A hastily prepared immigration law is
causing enormous delays on the borders of the Czech Republic, one
of Europe's most popular tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
   To the embarrassment of customs officials, many foreigners
trying to enter since Jan. 1 have waited up to eight hours at the
border. Some have been asked to produce certain documents and fill
out forms available only in Czech. Badly briefed, the guards did
not know what to require and have faulted the legislators for
passing the law at the last minute and requiring instant
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not know about any border law until New Year's Eve,'' a
guard was quoted in a newspaper, Lidove Noviny. ``How could
foreigners know?''
</P>
<P>
   The law was signed on Dec. 23. But the holidays apparently
interfered with sending out the information. The delays were caused
by requirements intended to filter ``suspicious'' foreigners. The
measure is a part of an effort to gain the Czech Republic's entry
into the European Union. Illegal immigrants trying to go to Germany
often pass through here.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, customs officials can ask any traveler to fill
out a border pass available only in Czech. In addition, foreigners
must produce two photographs, a letter of invitation and prove they
have health insurance, a place to stay and $30 a day for the length
of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, the guards were instructed to require such
documents only from citizens of so-called ``problem countries'' of
Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa, said a Foreign Ministry official.
Travelers from Western and Central Europe, North America and Japan
will generally be asked just for their passports and visas, where
applicable, the official added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, travelers from that group have been caught up for hours
at the border and at the airport as officials demand photos and
insurance cards from ``problem'' tourists. Because the government
failed to inform other countries about the law, most visitors do
not have the proper papers.
</P>
<P>
   A group from Daewoo of South Korea complained of discrimination
after they had been kept at the Prague airport for several hours on
Saturday.``Our colleagues were offended that South Korea was
qualified as a problem country,'' a spokesman for Daewoo here, Jiri
Kyncl, said. ``I personally wonder who made this division and on
what basis. I am not aware of any South Korean mafia or illegal
workers here.''
</P>
<P>
   With some embarrassment, the Interior Ministry officials
acknowledged that the law had been prepared and carried out too
hastily.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't enough time to inform the customs officials and
administration,'' a spokeswoman for the ministry, Marie Masarikova,
said. Ms. Masarikova denied that different nationalities would be
treated differently under the law.

DEFENSE CITES AN ADDICTION TO THE INTERNET IN THREAT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Texas)   (af)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A federal jury will be asked to consider whether a
Florida teen-ager who threatened to ``finish what begun'' at
Columbine High School did so because of an addiction to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old youth, Michael Ian Campbell, a high school
graduate and aspiring actor, has admitted he sent the message
through an online chat room in December to Erin Walton, who was a
Columbine sophomore when two students shot and killed 13 people and
themselves last April. Miss Walton notified Columbine officials of
the threat, and as a precaution the school was closed two days
early for the Christmas holiday break.
</P>
<P>
   Now Campell, indicted by a federal grand jury here on Monday,
faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted
of making a threat across state lines. But he has pleaded not
guilty, mounting a defense based on an untested legal theory of
Internet addiction stemming from his immersion in the virtual
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we can make this courtroom a classroom where we're
going to learn about the Internet, about the virtual, or
make-believe, world,'' his lawyer, Ellis Rubin, told reporters
outside the federal courthouse here on Tuesday, maintaining that
Campbell had made a virtual threat, not one made with a ``criminal
state of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin did not describe how much time his client had typically
spent online, and did not return a telephone call Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, free on $100,000 bail, apologized for the message,
calling it ``a stupid mistake'' and saying: ``I am horrified at
what I have done and its consequences. I did not really understand
what you in Colorado had gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, based in Miami, has achieved a certain reputation for
mounting similar unusual defenses, although few of his most
creative efforts have ever succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, he argued that a teen-ager charged with the murder of a
next-door neighbor, an 82-year-old woman, had been driven by
``television intoxication''; that defendant was convicted. And in
1991, he defended a woman charged with prostitution by arguing that
she had become a nymphomaniac because of her use of the
antidepressant drug Prozac; she eventually pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Other criminal lawyers expressed skepticism over Rubin's tactic
in the Campbell case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't pass the laugh test,'' said Victoria Toensing, a
prominent Washington lawyer. ``In a state court, he might be able
to find a situation where a judge would go off the reservation, but
it's not going to happen in a federal court. It sounds to me like
an attorney trying to get some publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Robinson, a defense lawyer here in Denver, said an
addiction defense would not serve the client nearly so well as
maintaining that he had simply been ``just talking, attempting to
impress a young woman in a chat room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a watershed legal theory,'' Robinson added, ``Internet
addiction ranks right up there with bloodletting as an established
medical cure.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said: ``This is
just another abuse excuse that will not and should not work. The
vast majority of people who are addicted to the Internet don't
issue violent threats. There is no logical connection between
addiction to the Internet, even if such a phenomenon existed, and
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Toensing and Robinson compared Rubin's tactic to the
``Twinkie defense'' used by Dan White, the former San Francisco
city supervisor convicted in the fatal shooting of Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978. His lawyer argued that
White suffered from ``diminished capacity'' at the time of the
killings, in part because of an addiction to junk food with lots of
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, whose trial is scheduled to begin on Feb. 28, is not
the only teen-ager facing charges of making threats related to
Columbine. On Monday, a federal indictment was also returned
against a Houston man, Arthur Leon Thomas. It accuses him of
sending threatening letters and electronic messages to the
Jefferson County sheriff, John Stone, the lead investigator in the
Columbine shootings; to the school, and to a woman in Broomfield,
Colo., near Denver, whom the authorities did not identify.

FOR LIMPING JAGUARS, SPIRIT IS WILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Leon Searcy pulled a knee sock onto his
left leg Wednesday, effectively concealing the long white ribbon of
tape that is holding his ankle in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best I've felt all season,'' Searcy, the Jaguars'
offensive right tackle, said. ``When you're constantly banging and
pounding on your bones and joints for 17 weeks, it takes its
toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Searcy's signal of good health will be as soothing as a warm
bath to the aching injuries of the Jaguars. And as the Jaguars
prepare to play the Miami Dolphins on Saturday in an American
Football Conference divisional playoff game, they might consider
replacing the franchise logo of a growling jaguar with a photo of
an ice pack.
</P>
<P>
   Searcy's well-being is of particular concern because he will
line up across from the Dolphins' pass-rushing specialist, left end
Trace Armstrong, who had three sacks in the Dolphins' victory over
the Seattle Seahawks last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And that could pose a problem for quarterback Mark Brunnell, who
could be expected to scramble when necessary if he were not going
to be wearing two knee braces for the first time in his career.
That is, only if he starts, which seems likely after he rested the
sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee for the
regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Brunnell said Monday that he was ``94.89 percent'' better than
he felt during last year's playoffs, when he had a bad left ankle,
and added that he would start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But in a bit of player diplomacy, Brunnell backed off that
pronouncement Tuesday, saying it was a coach's decision. Brunnell
did not talk to reporters Wednesday, but coach Tom Coughlin said
Brunnell could not start in his present state, that his confidence
needs to improve as much as anything, that he would split snaps
evenly with the backup Jay Fiedler in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin added that the Jaguars would not start Brunnell ``if he
cannot defend himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending Brunnell became an acute problem when Tony Boselli,
the All-Pro left tackle, was lost for the playoffs after he tore
the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Brunnel is a left-hander, so Boselli, the team's best player,
protected his strong side, where the quarterback is likely to roll
out, if he can move at all. Boselli will be replaced by Ben
Coleman, who struggled as a guard, but has played well at tackle.
The Jaguars are 5-1 when he plays in place of Boselli.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dolphins, particularly Armstrong, sent a ripple of
shock through the Jaguars during Miami's 20-17 victory in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right tackle for Seattle was taking the punishment,''
Searcy said. ``Trace was bullying him. I was sitting there on TV
watching in awe at what he was doing to him. He tore him a new
frame. Everything he wanted to do, he did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, Searcy, who is assuming that Brunnell will start,
was annoyed with Armstrong, who told The Miami Herald that he does
not think ``everybody has to play their best game to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little insulting to hear,'' Searcy said. ``He can't
bring his B game, because I'm going to have my A game. Trace is a
great pass rusher. You put him in a situation where he's
well-rested, and it comes down to third-down situations, his job is
to create havoc in the backfield. I know I'm going to have a very
vulnerable quarterback in the pocket and I'm going to do my best to
keep him off his heels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars, who led the league in rushing with 130.7 yards a
game and were third in rushing attempts with 516, could always turn
to its superb backfield duo of James Stewart and Fred Taylor. If
they are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart led the AFC in rushing yards with 931, a startling
number considering he started just seven games. He had finally
recovered from a torn ligament in his left knee that he sustained
last season, then he sprained his left foot Dec. 13 and missed the
next two games.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Taylor _ who as a rookie last season took over for
the injured Stewart and rushed for 1,223 yards _ had returned that
week from a strained hamstring that kept him out of six games.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget cornerback Fernando Bryant. He missed last
week's practices with a strained hamstring, although he, like
everyone except Boselli, is expected to play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea that if George Clooney won't return to the cast
of ``ER,'' there is an opportunity in private practice waiting for
him here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fact of life in the NFL,'' Coughlin said. ``There are
some teams that manage to go through the season without these kinds
of things. We've had some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   No team is immune from injuries and certainly the Dolphins
suffered a high-profile one to Dan Marino, whose bone spur in his
back put his future in question. But the Jaguars are enduring a
succession of niggling pains at the worst possible time.
</P>
<P>
   They finished the season with the best record in the National
Football League at 14-2 _ albeit without beating a team that ended
the season with a winning record. They led the league in fewest
points allowed (217) with a defense that ranked fourth in yards
allowed and that tied for the league lead in sacks with 57. And
they led the league in rushing. But the questions _ and trainers _
are lingering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boselli going down shook up things a little,'' Searcy said.
``We have to scramble around a little bit. This is a wake-up call
for the offensive line. We have to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   And hope the supply of tape and braces holds out. &QL;

BERG TO BE BENCHED TONIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The last time Aki Berg was benched, he responded
with some of the best hockey of his young career.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Kings hope pulling their 22-year-old defenseman
from tonight's game against St. Louis at Staples Center will have
the same effect after Berg's poor effort in Tuesday's 4-3 loss to
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were several Kings responsible for blowing a
winnable game, Berg played a part in three of the four Senators
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring came early in the second period when he fanned
on a pass in front of the Kings net and Shawn McEachern converted
the turnover into Ottawa's go-ahead goal. Less than three minutes
later, Berg tipped a long shot by Magnus Avardson that was
redirected over the left shoulder of goaltender Stephane Fiset.
Defensemen are taught to let opponents take shots that have little
chance of going in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to single out Aki for last night's game,'' Kings
coach Andy Murray said. ``But I want to sit him down for a game to
let him think about a few things.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this season, Berg was benched for back-to-back games due
to lackadaisical play. He missed all last year in a contract
dispute and the transition took longer than the coaching staff
expected. But Berg recovered and last month, when captain Rob Blake
was sidelined with a groin injury, he worked well on the power
play.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said Berg was not completely to blame on the Senators'
third goal. It came so early in the second period that the ice was
not completely dry and the puck stuck in the playing surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he does have a habit of trying to slap the puck a little
instead of just pushing it and that is a problem,'' Murray said.
``He wants to get a little more on the pass, but he loses control.
That's what happened on that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg's place in the lineup will be taken by veteran defenseman
Garry Galley, who has been sidelined the past 3{ weeks with a
concussion. Murray said he does not know how the defense will shake
out after tonight's game, but the club sent Frantisek Kaberle to
minor-league Long Beach for Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Murray is pleased with the play of Jaroslav Modry, who has two
goals and an assist in his last five games. Modry spent most of the
early season as a healthy scratch.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick whistles: Goaltender Jamie Storr, sidelined since
mid-December with a concussion, is hoping to play back-to-back
games this weekend for Long Beach and be cleared to return to the
Kings on Tuesday night as a backup. ``That will definitely let me
know where I stand,'' Storr said. ``Doing that will let be ready to
play right away in case I'm needed. It will be better than being
the backup and not knowing if I'm ready.'' . . . The Kings got a
scare late in Tuesday's loss when center Bryan Smolinski went down
with a knee injury and had to be helped to the dressing room.
Smolinski suffered an impingement to a nerve, which resulted in a
temporary paralysis. Feeling to the knee returned late Tuesday, and
he is expected to play. . . . Center Ian Laperriere returned to the
lineup after missing two games with a bruised left knee. One of the
team's top faceoff men, he won 15 of 17 against the Senators.

U.S. SETS NEW RULES ON SENDING SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER and JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Wednesday lifted more of
the licensing requirements on software products that are used to
keep computer data and communications secure after industry
complaints last fall that its efforts to rewrite the rules still
placed American companies at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, virtually any program sold on the retail
market to encrypt data can be sold overseas after what the Commerce
Department said Wednesday would be a ``one-time review'' to give it
an exemption from export license. But more important, for the first
time the administration said it would allow the export, without
licenses, of most types of ``source code,'' the computer code used
to create programs that encrypt data.
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions would be to nations on the State
Department's terrorist list, including Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's action is another retreat by the National Security
Agency and the FBI, which have long opposed the export of
cutting-edge encryption products, for fear they would be unable to
break coded communications sent by foreign governments and
terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology has overwhelmed the government's ability to
control many of these products, including some that can be
downloaded free from Internet sites to protect individuals using
online banking services or sending secure messages.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been a politically sensitive issue for Vice
President Al Gore, who found that the computer executives he had
assiduously courted in Silicon Valley for seven years remained
angry about the government's efforts to control encryption
products. They flooded his office with complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Department officials said that Gore's domestic policy
adviser, Dan Beier, participated in the discussions about how to
amend the rules. Some industry executives have said that their
support for Gore, including financial support, depended on how the
administration handled this issue, but Commerce Department
officials said that political concerns never came up in the
interagency meetings on altering the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules were cautiously applauded by industry groups, who
argued that regulations issued by the administration in September
were still cumbersome and put them at a disadvantage when competing
with foreign companies, especially from Germany, that have no such
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should go a way toward satisfying them, but it is not a
total end to controls,'' said Stewart Baker, formerly the general
counsel of the National Security Agency, which monitors foreign
communications from a huge network of satellites and antennas
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, now a lawyer in Washington who represents many companies
in the encryption business, said that ``the Valley is only going to
be satisfied when the director of the NSA crawls across the Bay
Bridge to apologize for controls.''
</P>
<P>
   But under the new rules, he said, ``the reality is that they can
sell practically all the products they want,'' even if there are
some paperwork requirements and licensing restrictions on
custom-made software sold to foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional leaders have vowed for years to pass
legislation that would essentially eliminate the administration's
oversight on the export of ``strong-data'' scrambling technology,
the highest levels of protection. But that has run counter to a
movement in Congress to tighten other export controls, especially
to countries like China, and the result has been a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expressing modest enthusiasm for the new rules was
Cisco Systems, one of the largest producers of ``routers'' that
form the backbone of the Internet. Under the September rules, it
was unclear whether companies could ship abroad, without license,
programs that would encrypt data that ran from one large router to
another. Under the new rules, they can.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's chief of government relations, Laura Ipsen, said that
``the technology industry's goal is a simple, equitable encryption
policy; these regulations work toward that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies were more enthusiastic. ``I think by and large
the administration made good on its promise,'' said Dan Burton,
vice president for government relations at Novell Inc., a leading
networking software company based in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant liberalization that is really going to
allow U.S. firms to export strong encryption software overseas. And
I think if you were going to characterize this you would say this
is an `inside the ballpark' home run. By that I mean you still are
operating within the framework of the assumption that they still
can control encryption exports.''
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations, which will not be officially published in
the Federal Register until Friday, will allow U.S. companies to
ship any retail encryption products around the world to commercial
concerns, individuals and other nongovernment users after a
one-time technical review by an interagency panel.
</P>
<P>
   Retail products, many of which are already widely used in the
United States to protect everything from networks to individual
e-mail programs, would be exempt from licensing requirements and
could be sold to companies, individuals and foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   And while companies said they had won significant concessions
from the administration over the last few months on what should and
should not be classified as a retail product, they said much was
riding on the final definitions.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington retains a right to license specialty products
made for other governments. ``We want to make sure there is a
review for any sale, for example, to a ministry for state
security,'' said William A. Reinsch, who heads the Commerce
Department's bureau of export administration. He said that could
include sales to companies that are partially owned by governments.
That restriction has annoyed some American concerns because many
governments hold stakes in telecommunications and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Davidson, a lawyer with the Center for Democracy and
Technology, an online civil liberties group in Washington, said the
new regulations were ``good news and bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that consumers all over the world are going
to have access to much stronger encryption,'' Davidson said. ``The
bad news is that if you want to send encryption out of the country,
you have to hire a lawyer to do it. These regulations are very
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said his group was also concerned that the new
regulations failed to exempt researchers from sharing their codes
with foreign counterparts. ``They do not clearly fix the
fundamental Constitutional flaw in the U.S. policy that says
researchers have to ask for permission before they exchange ideas
with people outside of the United States,'' he said.

HORNETS' BOBBY PHILLS DIES IN CAR CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., La., Ohio)   (bl)

<P>
   Bobby Phills, the Charlotte Hornets guard who parlayed a 10-day
contract into a nine-year National Basketball Association career
and who was once called by Michael Jordan the toughest defender he
had ever faced, was killed instantly Wednesday when the speeding
Porsche he was driving spun out of control and collided with
another vehicle moments after he left a morning practice. He was 30
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Phills' teammates were on the scene with club officials
immediately after the accident, which occurred less than a mile
from the Charlotte Coliseum. The Hornets' game scheduled for
Wednesday night against the Chicago Bulls was postponed as shock
was felt around the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The three-vehicle crash is under investigation by the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, which is looking into
whether Phills and his best friend on the Hornets, starting point
guard David Wesley, the team's , had been racing along a stretch
near the arena. Wesley's car was not involved in the accident, and
he was questioned for a ftes at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Phills lost control of his car on a hilly curve where the posted
speed limit was 45 miles an hour, Capt. L.E. Blydenburgh, the crash
investigator, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skid marks indicate he was not going in a straight line,''
he said. ``A fourth car driven by David Wesley was in close
proximity to the collision at the time it occurred and has been
identified by a witness as driving at a high rate of speed also,''
the report said. Keith Bridges, a spokesman for the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg police, said, ``Charges are to be determined,
but racing is definitely illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is expected to take at least a week. An
autopsy on Phills was to be performed at the medical examiner's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred feet of skid marks, estimated by witnesses to be
about 150 yards, were made by Phills' vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The police report said Phills was traveling eastbound on West
Tyvola Road just before 11 a.m., less than a mile away from the
Charlotte Coliseum. Veering into the coming traffic, his black 1997
Porsche with a vanity license plate that read ``SLAM'N'' absorbed
the impact on the driver's side door. The car was hit by an
Oldsmobile Cutlass Sierra driven by Robert Taylor Woolard Jr., 31.
A minivan taxi driven by Yao Agbegbon hit the rear end of Woolard's
car almost instantaneously. Woolard and Agbegbon were listed in
stable condition at Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Mills, the father of Phills' former teammate, Chris
Mills, was called soon after the accident by Baron Davis, the
Hornets' rookie point guard. He said Davis told him his vehicle was
positioned behind both Phills and Wesley at a stop light when the
two cars accelerated as the light turned green.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Paul Silas of the Hornets and team members gathered around
the scene of the accident as police used yellow tape to cordon off
the area. Cameras filmed a frozen Wesley standing a few feet from
Phills' car, in obvious shock. Phills' wife, Kendall, and their
son, Bobby Ray Phills III, 3, and daughter, Kerstie, 1, arrived
soon after the accident. He is also survived by his parents.
</P>
<P>
   It took firefighters more than two hours to pry Phills' body
from the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only was Bobby a tremendous person, but a great husband,
father and role model that everyone respected and admired,'' said
George Shinn, the Hornets' owner.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Ray Phills II was born on Dec. 20, 1969, in Baton Rouge,
La. The top 3-point shooter in the nation his senior year at
Southern University in Baton Rouge, Phills graduated with a degree
in animal science. Drafted in the second round in 1991 by the
Milwaukee Bucks, he was cut from the team that December, played in
the Continental Basketball Association, then was signed by the
Cleveland Cavaliers to a 10-day contract on March 19, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Standing a chiseled 6 feet 5 inches and 232 pounds, Phills
looked more like a National Football League linebacker or a
sculpted bodybuilder than a lithe NBA player.
</P>
<P>
   He was exceptionally strong, and while coaches and general
managers debated whether he was a shooting guard or a small
forward, Phills merely transformed himself into one of the game's
most menacing defenders. He was named to the NBA all-defensive team
after the 1995-96 season, the same season in which Jordan paid him
the ultimate compliment by calling him the toughest defender he had
ever faced.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fratello, the former Cleveland coach, remembered a young,
unproven Phills returning to the Cavaliers training camp without a
guaranteed contract in the fall of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him we would release him if we wanted, because we
already had 13 or 14 guaranteed deals and his chances of making it
were slim,'' Fratello said. ``I figured we'd give him a shot to
catch on with another team. Bobby came back the next day and said:
`I want to stay here, Coach. I'm just going to keep working.'''
</P>
<P>
   After a slew of injuries hit the Cavaliers, he became a starter
and led the team into the playoffs for the next four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   After six seasons in Cleveland, Phills was signed by the Hornets
on Aug. 19, 1997, as a free agent. Once classified in scouting
reports as a ``tweener'' and a long shot from a small school to
begin with, he signed a seven-year, $33 million contract with
Charlotte in 1997. Fourth on the team in scoring, a captain and a
leader and one of the Hornets' top reserves, he averaged 10.9
points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.7 assists a game for his career.
</P>
<P>
   Phills, active in the community, volunteered for children's
charities and related organizations. In 1998, he was one of four
finalists for the NBA's sportsmanship award. He also started the
Bobby Phills Educational Foundation, holding camps in Baton Rouge
each summer for children who were taught how to balance education
with athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby was a solid person,'' said Wayne Embry, the Cavaliers'
president.
</P>
<P>
   NBA commissioner David Stern called Phills ``one of the most
respected members of the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Sunday, every NBA team will have a moment of silence for
Phills before their home games.
</P>
<P>
   Phills was the fourth active NBA player to be killed in an
accident. The Nets' Drazen Petrovic died in 1993 and Terry Furlow
of the Jazz in 1980, both in car crashes, and the Pistons' Nick
Vanos was killed in a plane crash in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the second serious traffic this season involving
Hornets players. In October, the reserve guard Eldridge Recasner
was left with a broken shoulder and partly collapsed lung after an
accident. His teammate Derrick Coleman, driving the sport utility
vehicle in which Recasner was a passenger, was arrested on a
drunken driving charge. A female passenger was hurt in that
collision with a tractor-trailer. Recasner remains on the injured
list. &QL;

 &HT;    Rocker: 'I said a few things that are absolutely not me'
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Rocker finally had an opportunity to tell his
side of the story Wednesday. Now he must begin to deal with the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking his three-week silence, Rocker spoke in an interview
with ESPN's Peter Gammons on his controversial comments that
appeared in Sports Illustrated last month. He began trying to undo
some of the damage he did to his image when he launched a vicious
tirade against New York fans.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the public heard from Rocker, it was in a stream
of scathing comments to SI writer Jeff Pearlman calling an unnamed
teammate ``a fat monkey,'' and disparaging minorities from
Hispanics and blacks to gays and Asians, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker issued an apology in a written statement through his
agents Dec. 22, but hadn't spoken publicly since. Baseball fans,
civic leaders, minorities and even his teammates may have cringed
at the thought of what else he might say, but Rocker just hopes
they were listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have been definitely grossly misrepresented,''
Rocker said. ``And that's really the hardest thing, despite the
fact the comments really offended a lot of people. That certainly
wasn't my intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ironically, Rocker followed the Braves' lead by trying to
separate himself from his own comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said things that (don't) cross my mind on a consistent
basis. It doesn't cross my mind, period,'' Rocker said. ``In a time
of thought and remembrance, I shot my mouth off and said a few
things that's absolutely not me.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what his reaction would be to reading someone else
making similar comments, Rocker said: ``I would think this guy is a
complete jerk. Who in the hell does he think he is mouthing off
like this? What kind of experiences does he have to talk from?''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker appeared uncomfortable upon hearing Gammons read back
some of his comments from the article. Rocker said they were aimed
at the people who mistreated him at Shea Stadium and described
incidents in which he was spit on, had beer spilled on him and a
battery thrown at his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a segment of comments made in the process of
remembering some pretty harsh things that were done to you, like
seeing the likes of you beaten with a baseball bat,'' Rocker said.
``Looking back, I probably should have distinguished those comments
a little better. ... I just lost my cool. I (was going to) use this
time to retaliate.''
</P>
<P>
   According to family friend Steve Rodgers, Rocker spent a
restless Tuesday night in Macon before speaking with Gammons for 40
minutes Wednesday morning at a friend's house. Later in the
afternoon, Rocker met with Macon Mayor Jack Ellis to work some
hometown damage control. Rocker declined to meet with any media
after his interview with Gammons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good conversation, an open and honest discussion,''
Ellis, who is black, told Macon TV station WMAZ. ``I came away
convinced he is truly sorry for what he said and the people he hurt
with his remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought Rocker was a racist, Ellis said: ``No,
I don't. I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. ...
After talking with him, I truly believe he mispoke. He's truly
sorry for saying those words.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said ``one comment'' doesn't make him a racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Rocker said when asked if he was a racist.
``If I were a racist, A, would I want a black guy to come into my
house? B, would I invite him to my house? I've done that three
times over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was referring to, among others, Braves teammate Andruw
Jones living with him at his family's home in Macon when they
played together in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who underwent a psychological evaluation last week as
ordered by baseball commissioner Bud Selig, is still waiting to
hear his fate from Major League Baseball, whether it be suspension
or fine, or both, and possibly racial sensitivity training. The
Braves will then decide their course of action.
</P>
<P>
   How Rocker will be received by his teammates is the most
intriguing question. It was his reference to a teammate as a fat
monkey which may have caused the most stir. Rocker explained the
comment as clubhouse humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a black guy. It was a Latin player who I consider
to be a good friend. ... In the past I've said it to his face and
he'll fire with this, that or the other and we laugh about it,''
Rocker said. ``I let a reporter in on an aspect of clubhouse humor
and he took it literally. The people that know me best, the Braves
management, the Braves players, they know I'm not like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said teammate and fellow reliever Rudy Seanez, who is of
Mexican descent, called him after the story came out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `Where the heck did this come from?''' Rocker said.
``I said `Yeah, I got a little out of hand.' ... I think they know
me well enough to know I'm not really like this and it's been a
gross misrepresentation of the way I really am.''

BUSH AND MCCAIN TIPTOE THROUGH DIXIE MINEFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain both
walked gingerly through racial minefields Wednesday as Bush was
pressed anew to state his feelings about the presence of the
Confederate flag atop South Carolina's Statehouse and McCain sought
to clarify his position on that politically delicate issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was repeatedly asked about the flag both at a news
conference Wednesday morning in West Columbia, S.C., and at another
one here Wednesday afternoon, once again said that any decision
about the flag should be made by South Carolinians, and resolutely
left his answer at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view it as a local issue,'' Bush said in West Columbia,
sounding a little exasperated. ``I've spoken to this issue every
time I've come to your state and I'm not going to say anything
more. The people of South Carolina can solve the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same news conference, Bush, who has aggressively
presented himself as a Republican eager to reach out and include
more minorities in the party, was asked about a Republican state
senator in South Carolina who recently made disparaging comments
about the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker, Arthur Ravenel, said the NAACP, which has fought
to have the Confederate flag removed, should be called the National
Association of Retarded People. Bush was also asked if Ravenel
should be forced to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be up to the senator to do that,'' Bush said, after
first branding Ravenel's remarks ``very unfortunate.'' Bush seemed
annoyed with the topic and eager to move past it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain exhibited little more interest in dwelling on the
subject. Campaigning in New Hampshire, the usually loquacious
candidate responded to seemingly conflicting remarks about his
position on the Confederate flag over the last few days by reading
aloud from a statement his campaign distributed earlier this week
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand both sides,'' McCain read aloud. ``Some view it
as a symbol of slavery, others view it as a symbol of heritage.
Personally, I see the battle flag as a symbol of heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   The last word appropriated the language used frequently by
defenders of the flag and seemed to contradict emphatically
McCain's statements in a television interview on Sunday that the
flag was a symbol ``of racism and slavery'' and that he found it
``offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Wednesday that people were overanalyzing his
remarks. ``This is getting rather Talmudic,'' he said. ``We're
parsing words.''
</P>
<P>
   If both Bush and McCain seemed to be trying to straddle or
defuse the issue, it was little wonder. In South Carolina, which
holds a pivotal Republican primary on Feb. 19, many of the
staunchest, most reliable Republican voters support the presence of
the Confederate flag, and outright opposition to the position could
be politically fatal.
</P>
<P>
   But outright support could come back to haunt a Republican
nominee in a general election among voters nationwide.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Bush's case, it might undermine his appeal to swing voters in
the center of the political spectrum and his campaign slogan of
compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush frequently visits minority neighborhoods and
churches and makes public appearances with Hispanic and black
leaders, as he did Wednesday afternoon at a social services agency
in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   He talked with such leaders about the need for the government to
encourage religious and charitable organizations to do more social
work, and the need for Republicans to show that they care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know oftentimes people with the word Republican by their
name are labeled, and I'd like to break the label,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But only hours earlier, he was answering questions from
reporters about why, despite all his oratory of inclusion, it was
almost impossible to find a black person among the hundreds of
supporters who turned out to hear his speech in West Columbia
Wednesday morning or the thousands who attended an oyster roast on
Tuesday night at a former plantation in Mount Pleasant, S.C., now a
tourist site that both Republicans and Democrats have used for
political events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows how much work the Republican Party has to do to
make sure our message is explained clearly and people can hear
it,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every time Bush goes to South Carolina, he is asked to go
beyond his statement that South Carolinians should settle their
disagreements about the flag, and every time, Bush simply
reiterates his position. Bush is a proponent of state and local
control on a variety of fronts.
</P>
<P>
   After the Republican debate on Monday in Grand Rapids, Mich.,
Bush said he would not choose to fly the flag in his own state of
Texas because of the flag's symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in Wilmington Wednesday afternoon what he meant by its
symbolism, he said, ``What that means is some people have _ people
have strong feelings about that. Some people feel one way about it.
Some people feel the other way about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked if not denouncing the flag might give voters the
impression that he was unwilling to lead on racial matters. ``I
don't think it reflects my heart at all,'' he said. ``It reflects
my understanding that the people of South Carolina can make up
their own minds on that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Republican field, Steve Forbes lashed out at
the tax plans that his rivals have been fighting over for the past
few days, saying their proposals did not come close to the deep tax
cuts and tax code overhaul that he had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Iowa, Forbes asserted that his plan would provide
$648 billion in cuts over five years, while Bush's proposal would
cut $483 billion and McCain's $237 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He urged voters to ``shop and compare,'' adding, ``I think they
will see that our plan will save them the most time and money.''

THE LATE SHOW WITH HILLARY AND DAVID  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For more than a month, David Letterman has begged _
or ``badgered'' as he put it _ Hillary Rodham Clinton to appear on
his show.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, the first lady and candidate for senator
from New York has resisted, sending her spokesman to put off
Letterman and his executive producer, to the growing and public
irritation of the host of ``The Late Show With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Mrs. Clinton finally sat down on the CBS set at
the Ed Sullivan Theater in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And 20 breezy minutes later, after she left to cheers from the
audience and a hug and a kiss from Letterman _ not to mention a
gift of a tractor-mower _ it was difficult to see why she had ever
demurred in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you nervous?'' Letterman inquired softly as Mrs. Clinton
sat down in her chair for the taping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a little,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, too,'' Letterman said, apparently in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the host and the first lady traded chatter, jokes
and, inevitably, Top 10 Lists. Letterman may have made something of
a career of making jokes at the expense of Mrs. Clinton and her
husband, but that would have been hard to tell on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he poked cordially through her political and family
life, asking her about life in Chappaqua, N.Y., her views of Alan
Greenspan, the state of relations between the Clintons' dog and cat
(they fight like _ well, you can guess). Most of all, though,
Letterman seemed concerned about what President Clinton thought of
Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does your husband know you're here?'' Letterman inquired.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Mrs. Clinton responded. Letterman than recounted meeting
Clinton some years ago and sensing that the president might have
less than fond feelings for him. ``Your husband was a little
stand-offish,'' he said. ``I had the sense that I might remind him
of a boob.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was that at all,'' Mrs. Clinton responded.
``I think it was just that he was curious why you have never made a
joke about him.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some of what might have seemed to the uninformed
viewer to be challenging moments for Mrs. Clinton. Letterman
presented her with a pop quiz about New York arcana, asking whether
she could name the state bird (the red-breasted blue bird), the
state tree (the sugar maple) and which Great Lakes bounded on New
York (Erie and Ontario). She answered all the questions correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's staff members said the quiz had been a surprise.
Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, allowed that Mrs. Clinton
might, in fact, have been given a sneak peek at the questions
before she went on.
</P>
<P>
   When Letterman asked about how her move to Chappaqua went, she
responded, ``The only real problem that we had is when the
satellite truck ran over the Welcome Wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Letterman leaned across his desk. ``Somebody has been writing
material for you, haven't they?''

CONSULTING FIRM TO INVEST IN INTERTRUST TECHNOLOGIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The InterTrust Technologies Corp., a start-up
based in Santa Clara, Calif., will announce on Thursday formation
of an alliance that puts it one step closer to its goal of becoming
the standard for managing the security of digital online content
like documents, music, videos and software.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers, the giant accounting and business
consulting firm, plans to use InterTrust's technology to develop
software and systems for its corporate customers to do transactions
with businesses and consumers while protecting and managing their
digital content, executives for both companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting firm will spend $25 million to develop
applications, train employees and license the InterTrust technology
and make an equity investment of an undisclosed amount in
InterTrust, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big play for us,'' said John R. Stubbs, the
partner in charge of the global content management initiative at
PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``We think that new business models can be
exploited with InterTrust technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Shear, InterTrust's chief executive, said more such
alliances were in the works. InterTrust's technology has already
been adopted by two media heavyweights, Universal Music Group and
Bertelsmann AG, as well as by a host of other companies. But an
analyst said the PricewaterhouseCoopers alliance was a major coup.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers counts among its clients a majority of
the world's 5,000 largest concerns, including those in media,
financial services, retail sales, health care management and
government.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the Internet is expected to evolve into the
world's major distribution space for products ranging from videos
and recorded music to medical records and contracts. As this trend
unfolds, the demand to protect ownership of copyrights, keep
documents private and manage complex payment systems is expected to
grow exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   But the same technology that protects information can also be
used to exploit data, a fact that makes privacy advocates uneasy.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, for example, will also use InterTrust
technology to start a service called DigiHub, which will collect
and manage vast amounts of information about the people who use
content distributed by the firm's clients. The service, marketed as
a way to analyze market trends and optimize business operations,
will be tailored for specific businesses or industries, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Leigh, a vice president at Raymond James, predicted that
the DigiHub service would serve as a model for other big consulting
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have the profiles of what people like, they have
better value to their clients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet DigiHub is also likely to raise privacy concerns since the
information contains names and credit card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have individual information on everyone who uses the
system, much like Visa does,'' Stubbs said.
</P>

   While acknowledging that privacy is ``a huge, huge issue,'' he
added that tracking use information is a key part of doing business
on the Internet. He also asserted that as trusted auditors of
businesses around the globe, PriceWaterhouseCoopers is the best
choice for managing such information.
</P>
<P>
   InterTrust's digital commerce system, known as the MetaTrust
Utility, packages content in coded files known as DigiBoxes, which
also contain the rules of the content's use. To open a DigiBox
file, a user must install software that contains the user's credit
card information and automatically deducts payments according to
the attached rules.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Rosenoer, global strategic ventures leader at PWC,
says, for example, that the technology enables a transaction such
as downloading an InterTrust protected album to provide additional
marketing opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play two tracks for free, then get charged for the
rest,'' he said. ``Say I want to download it to a Rio (portable
music player); then there might be a extra $5 charge. If I don't
accept, I might get an offer for tickets to a performance at a
discount. If I pay with American Express, there might be special
additional offers I can take advantage of. If I send this to my
friend and they like it, I might get a bonus track.''
</P>
<P>
   Each step of the way, the consumer's behavior patterns can be _
and often will be _ monitored and recorded.
</P>
<P>
   He cites another example of how applications built on InterTrust
technology could be used for business-to-business e-commerce: When
products are imported, they have to be paid for, often with a draft
on the buyer's bank, customs authorities notified and taxes paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payments can be made efficiently, inventory is handled more
efficiently, costs go down significantly and tax authorities are
assured of payment,'' he said. ``You really optimize that whole
process when you start doing this across the Internet.'' &QL;

PHONE CALLS SAID TO LINK WOMAN TO ALGERIAN WITH EXPLOSIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Seeking to sketch out a widespread terrorist
plot, federal prosecutors here said Wednesday that a woman arrested
after illegally crossing the Canadian border was linked by a flurry
of telephone calls to an Algerian man charged in Seattle with
trying to smuggle in a car packed with explosives and timing
devices.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined by the prosecutors, the link between the woman,
Lucia Garofalo, and the Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, rested on a
single five-minute call from a cell phone carried by Ms. Garofalo
to a cell phone in Queens, New York, registered to a man named Raja
Aslam. Ms. Garofalo had the number written on a scrap of paper
found on her, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   There were then at least six phone calls from a conventional
telephone in Aslam's name to a third cell phone in New York.
Prosecutors said that according to telephone records, that cell
phone was used to place 23 calls to a number held under an alias
that was used by Abdel Ghani, a Brooklyn man arrested on Dec. 30 on
charges of being an accomplice of Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his Queens apartment, Aslam, a taxi driver
originally from Pakistan, denied any knowledge of Ms. Garofalo,
Ressam, Ghani or any terrorists. He said he had been questioned by
FBI agents for four hours on Tuesday. Eventually, after they asked
detailed questions about his bank and phone records, among other
things, he said, they told him not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman for the New York office, Joseph Valiquette,
acknowledged Wednesday night that Aslam had not been charged with
any crime.
</P>
<P>
   The phone calls, along with more detailed information from a
``foreign government'' _ believed to be Canada _ that tied Ms.
Garofalo more closely to Said Atmani, a former roommate of Ressam
in Montreal, proved sufficient for a federal magistrate judge,
Jerome Niedermeier, to deny Garofalo bail on Wednesday. But the
details did not include a description of what might have been
discussed in the phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, FBI and Immigration and Naturalization Service
agents arrested a third man in the spreading investigation. An INS
spokesman, Mark Thorn, identified the man as Rachid Haouari, one of
the three men first detained with Ghani in a Dec. 30 Brooklyn raid,
and said he was being held on immigration charges. It was not clear
whether Haouari was believed to have knowledge of a terrorist plot.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, Abdelwaheb Hamdoche, was taken into custody on Jan.
1 at Kennedy Airport in New York as he was preparing to board a
flight for Paris. He is being held as a material witness in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors and investigators in at least three cities _
Burlington, New York and Seattle _ are trying to unravel what they
believe to be a terrorist bomb plot carried out by Algerian Islamic
militants affiliated with an organization known as the Armed
Islamic Group, which committed widespread atrocities in the civil
war in Algeria. They suspect that there are more members of the
group in the United States but have not yet developed a clear
knowledge of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   French and Canadian investigators say that Atmani, who they say
was a document forger for the Armed Islamic Group, had been running
a ring of mostly Algerian terrorists in Montreal who stole laptop
computers and cell phones from cars to finance their activities.
The Canadian authorities deported him to Bosnia, which he had
listed as his country of origin when he entered the country
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garofalo was indicted last Thursday on seven felony counts
of alien smuggling and misuse of identification documents. She was
arrested on Dec. 14 trying to cross the border from Canada at a
remote point with an illegal Algerian immigrant, Bnouabide Chamchi.
</P>
<P>
   Aslam, in an interview in the two-bedroom apartment in Long
Island City, N.Y., that he shares with two roommates, speculated
that the telephone connection might have developed from illegal
immigration attempts. A former roommate, Malik Shaheen Ahmed, he
explained, had gone to Canada in December in hopes of gaining
asylum, and thus legal status. Within a week, however, he had
changed his mind and tried to come back to the United States. But
he was detained by American authorities as he tried to cross the
border and sent back to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Aslam said that Ahmed called him last month asking for help in
coming back to New York. He said Ahmed told him that he was going
to pay a group $1,000 to smuggle him in. Aslam said that he
understood that Ahmed had made it back to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hard-working man with no links to terrorists,'' Aslam
said. ``I'm very upset. I don't like people who blow up buildings.
I'm here for a good life. I'm cooperating with the FBI like a good
American citizen.''

BOEING NEAR PACT ON BUYING HUGHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing may be about to go where no company has gone
before in the space business.
</P>
<P>
   In a bold move that analysts said Wednesday will finally
establish the aerospace giant as the major player it wants to be in
the space business of the 21st Century, Boeing is reported to be
near an agreement to buy Hughes Space and Communications Co. for
$3.75 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which could be announced within days, was first
reported by Bloomberg News. The Wall Street Journal and New York
Times quoted unnamed executives close to the matter as saying an
ageement is near.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespersons for Boeing and Hughes refused to comment on the
reports.
</P>
<P>
   With Hughes in the fold, Boeing would topple Lockheed Martin as
the world's leading space company, several analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing will have come from next to nothing to being the top
space company in the world,'' said Paul Nisbet of JSR Research in
Newport, R.I. ``And they will have done all that in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, Boeing spent $3 billion for the space business
of Rockwell, and followed that move a few months later with the $15
billion acquisition of defense giant McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Those acquisitions made Boeing the emerging leader in satellite
launch services, but what the company has lacked is a big time
satellite-making business.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is the missing piece that Boeing has needed to complete
its space business strategy, said Marco Caceres, senior space
analyst for the Teal Group, a market research firm in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific fit because Boeing right now is not a major
manufacturer of satellites,'' he said. ``That really is the big gap
in terms of Boeing being a complete space player.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes Space and Communications, with projected 1999 sales of
around $2.3 billion, is part of Hughes Electronics Corp., which is
owned by General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite manufacturing part of Hughes is based in El
Segundo, Calif., near the Los Angeles International Airport. The
business, with about 8,000 employees, is just up the road from
Boeing's space division headquarters in Seal Beach. Last month
Boeing had about 37,000 employees in California, most of them
working in its space division.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes Space and Communications is part of Hughes Electronics,
which General Motors has wanted to sell so Hughes can focus on its
services business. That includes the company's DirecTV unit, the
largest U.S. satellite television service.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes Electronics badly needs an infusion of cash so it can
fund DireTV and its other services-based businesses, analysts said.
The company also is planning what it calls ``Spaceway,'' a system
for highspeed internet connection. It needs about $1.4 billion to
build and launch Spaceway in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hughes needs the cash,'' said Caceres. ``Boeing's would come
in real handy.''
</P>
<P>
   But one analyst said Boeing is paying too much for the Hughes
unit if the reported $3.75 billion figure is true.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very big price,'' said Cai von Rumohr of S.G. Cowen &AMP;
Co., who valued the satellite manufacturing operations at $2
billion to $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Nisbet said Boeing is making a strategic move, and the
Hughes unit is worth much more to Boeing than revenue figures would
suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strategic buyer such as Boeing would pay more than a
financial buyer because it's a very good fit,'' he said. Boeing, he
said, had about $2.6 billion in cash reserves at the end of the
third quarter, and that has probably grown to nearly $4 billion as
Boeing reduced its airplane inventory in recent months. The company
delivered a record 620 planes in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing also has tremendous borrowing power,'' Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would grow Boeing's $7 billion space and
communications division by more than 30 percent, said analysts, who
have speculated for more than a year that Boeing would eventually
move to acquire the satellite-making arm of Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been rumored for so long you forget it hasn't actually
happened yet,'' said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck
Investment Partners, a Los Angeles based firm that advises
aerospace companies.
</P>
<P>
   He said Boeing has adopted a Microsoft-type strategy of making
key investments to ensure it will be well positioned in new
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This next century will be dominated by space the way the last
century was dominated by aerospace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has enjoyed a close working relationship with Hughes
Space and Communications. Boeing's Delta 2 rocket, which the
company acquired in the merger with McDonnell Douglas, have lofted
many commercial and military satellites built by Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is a key Boeing customer for Sea launch, a moveable ocean
launch platform. It also bought some of the roughly 30 commercial
launch slots Boeing sold for a Delta 4 rocket now in development.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies also are working on a new generation of spy
satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office. Boeing beat out
Lockheed Martin for the $5 billion contract.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing already has the capacity to make military satellites as a
result of its acquisition of Rockwell's space business. Rockwell
built the military's global positioning satellite system.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: DOES IT MATTER WHO OWNS WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the map really being redrawn, or have the countries just
changed colors? That's the question that comes to mind after yet
another largest-ever media merger, AOL's $165 billion acquisition
of Time Warner. Does it make a difference that all the entities
once owned separately by AOL and Time Warner will soon be owned by
them jointly? Put that way, the answer seems to be no. It isn't
hard to see the logic in this deal, nor is it hard to sense the
enormous forces that pulled these companies together. With such a
high degree of consolidation in the media and Internet sectors,
it's possible to argue that a little more merging isn't going to do
much harm.
</P>
<P>
   But the AOL-Time Warner merger isn't just a little more
consolidation. I don't know how to measure the physics of a deal
like this, but it feels as though this merger is less the sum of
adding two companies together than the product of multiplying them.
It is hard to stipulate the unknown, which is one of the
attractions, and one of the worries, of this deal. Steve Case, the
CEO of AOL, and Gerald Levin, the CEO of Time Warner, have tried to
forestall the anxiety this merger causes by asserting that it is a
social good, by promising to guarantee open access to cable
subscribers, and by reminding us that even corporations this
enormous actually have people in them.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with these reassurances is that neither Case nor
Levin can control the forces that brought them together in the
first place. What drove this merger was the power unleashed by the
enormous market valuation of Internet companies. What also drove it
was the clear sense that the only way to survive at that level of
competition was to unite every possible spectrum of electronic
distribution and every possible source of content _ that sad word _
under a single banner. Synergy in this case is just another word
for vertical integration, for controlling creativity, copyright and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The major problem this deal poses is neither customer access nor
access to customers. It is the customers' inveterate habit of
treating brands like CNN, Time magazine and Netscape as if they
still identified independent companies. Much of the trust the media
earned, journalistically speaking, is based on a time when that
habit still reflected reality. Brand value has been a marketing
cliche for years. But in a deal like this, the hidden value of a
treasured brand _ and, I suspect, its real value _ is the fact that
we have such a hard time remembering that it no longer stands on
its own. We behave as if nothing had changed when, in fact,
everything has changed. The layers of potential conflict in this
new world of news gathering are enormous, and it will take the
diligence of a scholar to remember who owns whom and where the
ethical lines must be drawn.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another, subtler risk in the potential synergy this
kind of merger represents. The residual gravity of such an enormous
corporation _ its ethos, its habits _ will take a toll on
creativity, in content or business operations, all the way down the
line. Call it an efficiency tax, the edge that vanishes when
everything is tailored for the pipeline, so to speak. No matter how
you spin it, this merger, like other, similar mergers in the past
few years, represents a move toward uniformity and away from
diversity, toward the globalization of a consumerist, mass culture
that is best purveyed by globalized mass corporations.

LIVE DINOSAUR ON DISPLAY AT STATE CAPITOL

FIRST LADY ON LATE SHOW: TV RULES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was perfect, nothing short of perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary and Dave, neighbors and friends, candidate and comedian,
politician and antipolitician, enjoying a few laughs, reading a few
lists, exchanging one-liners and a few teasing moments. Nothing
tough, nothing rough. Just fun.
</P>
<P>
   Could there be a more perfect example of campaign politics, year
2000? The virtual interview, handled with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``She couldn't pay for this,'' said one of the two dozen
reporters who sat through a screening of the taping of Hillary
Rodham Clinton's much-heralded 20 minutes on ``Late Show With David
Letterman'' on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The press screening came complete with graciously provided
pizza, Coke, bottled water and Dunkin' Donuts (honest), gratis from
the Letterman people, who may have felt a little guilty because the
press corps wasn't allowed into a screening room during the taping.
Reporters had to wait to see a dubbed tape on a small television
set in an 11th-floor conference room after Mrs. Clinton had left.
Letterman rules, not Hillary rules.
</P>
<P>
   Other reporters, the ones with cameras and microphones and a few
with notebooks, crowded around the stage door on West 53rd Street
to see Mrs. Clinton leave and wave to the crowd across the street
that was also waiting to see her leave the studio and wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is prettier than on television,'' said Mark Alexander, 30,
a disc jockey visiting from Washington. He said he had heard on
Dave's show Tuesday night that she would be on Wednesday night. He
also heard it from Barbara Walters, who chatted about it on ``The
View'' on ABC. In fact, ``You couldn't go a block without hearing
about it,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, about 7 Wednesday night, Mrs. Clinton thrilled
the shouting crowd by acknowledging them for 30 seconds before
climbing into her car. ``Did I hear that right, did she say,
`Great, had a wonderful time?''' one Hillary watcher asked another.
Probably.
</P>
<P>
   By now, those who care know what Mrs. Clinton said to Letterman
and vice versa. It sort of doesn't matter. What does matter is that
she showed up. Plus she didn't mess up, appeared calm if a bit
programmed, wasn't thrown for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   That is what counts in politics now, and to get serious for a
moment, just a moment, is this the politics we want? Mrs. Clinton
on Letterman (and, a few weeks ago, on Rosie O'Donnell's program).
Vice President Al Gore on Letterman. Donald Trump on ``The Tonight
Show With Jay Leno.'' And on and on.
</P>
<P>
   America is seeing the ultimate in the fusion of not just
entertainment and news, but entertainment, news and politics. Truth
be told, the candidates have no choice. They have to play. The
public demands it.
</P>
<P>
   We have gone from an appearance on the old, stodgy ``Meet the
Press'' as political validation to softballs from Larry King to
David Letterman, a comedian who hides his smarts and retreats
behind his Top 10 lists ( Wednesday night's Top 10 list was
questions dumb guys would ask the first lady. No. 1: Have you ever
met my Dad, George Bush?
</P>
<P>
   That's fine. Letterman chooses to be a funny man, not a
political analyst. The question for us all to ask is why a
candidate is compelled to get into the celebrity game, why Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani has to joke with Letterman, as he did a few
years ago, about kicking posteriors (not the word he used). Why,
for that matter, do the Tom Brokaws, Peter Jennings and Ted Koppels
feel they have to make the talk show scene? Why would Walter
Cronkite turn up for a cameo on Letterman last night before Mrs.
Clinton's appearance, warning him, ``Try not to be a jackass, will
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Rhetorical questions. Because to succeed politically and
sometimes journalistically these days, we have made it a necessity
to enter the popular culture. To say no is to appear grim and out
of it. Nor can a public figure afford to offend the Lettermans and
Lenos, because they so affect the collective public psyche,
somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Letterman's amiable executive producer, Rob Burnett,
briefed the press. He was admirably forthcoming, more so than some
dissembling political press secretaries. But he was briefing us
about a bit of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder people are confused about the importance of celebrity,
mistaking it for accomplishment. No wonder we elect actors and
people who could be actors, and Donald Trump actually gets himself
taken seriously as a political figure in some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, no wonder a columnist for The New York Times was at
the Letterman stage door last night. She did not, she would like to
emphasize, eat a slice of pizza or a doughnut.

KSWISS REPORTS EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SUZIE ST. JOHN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares of K-Swiss Inc. dropped 24.3 percent after
the company based in Westlake Village north of Los Angeles
announced it expected to report fourth-quarter net earnings at 10
percent to 27 percent below analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Board chairman and President Steven Nichols said the decline can
be attributed to orders canceled by footwear and sporting goods
retailers that have been experiencing financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
   K-Swiss said it expects fourth-quarter shares to be in the range
of 40 cents to 50 cents. Analysts surveyed by First Call had
predicted a profit of 55 cents per share. Revenues for the fourth
quarter ending Dec. 31, 1999, are expected to be in the range of
$49 million to $50 million. For the same period in 1998, K-Swiss
posted net earnings of 32 cents per diluted share and $40 million
in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch analyst Brenda Gall said in a report to her
clients issued late Wednesday that the most notable companies to
which the shortfall can be attributed are Just For Feet and The
Sports Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``K-Swiss' problems are not necessarily within their control,''
said John Shanley, an analyst with First Security Van Kasper. ``The
main (issue) is the Just For Feet bankruptcy filing. They had a lot
of items on back order with K-Swiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Final results will be released Feb. 10 for the fourth quarter
and year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Shares closed Wednesday at $13.25, down $4.25. The volume was
seven times the normal 30-day average with 1.4 million shares
trading hands.
</P>
<P>
   K-Swiss also announced its order backlog through June 2000 was
34.7 percent smaller than at the same time last year. Orders
totaled $105,746,000 compared with $140,463,000 for the same period
in 1999. The backlog consists of a 26 percent decrease in first
quarter 2000 futures orders to $61.7 million and a 22 percent
decrease in second quarter 2000 futures orders to $44 million.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Wednesday's announcement, Merrill Lynch lowered its
2000 sales estimates to $215 million from $233 million.
</P>
<P>
   K-Swiss Inc. designs and markets athletic footwear for
high-performance sports use and fitness activities. It offers
footwear for children's activities.

KREMLIN RELEASES VIDEO IT CLAIMS LINKS CHECHENS TO TERROR
BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 9th graf to remove `hexagen') 
(bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Kremlin on Wednesday offered what it called proof
that militants in Chechnya masterminded terrorist bombings last
fall at several Russian apartment houses: a video tour of a Chechen
bomb factory, replete with thumping music.
</P>
<P>
   The film of the factory, which officials said contained
explosives identical to those used in the bombings, appeared to
offer circumstantial evidence at best that the militants were
behind the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   But the secretary of the Russian government's security council,
Sergei Ivanov, said Russian forces are seeking two individuals in
Grozny and in rebel-held southern Chechnya who they believe are
tied to the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged in the bombings, which destroyed a
Russian barracks in Dagestan and vast apartment blocks in Moscow
and the southwest Russian town of Volgodonsk. More than 300
civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebel leaders have denied any role in the bombings. The
most cynical Russians have suggested that the government itself
staged the blasts to fan nationalistic political support of the
Kremlin, a charge Ivanov on Wednesday called crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said Wednesday's release of the video was meant in part
to put such rumors to rest. ``This film proves the indisputable
link of the explosions to Chechnya,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The video was shot by the Federal Security Service, the
successor agency to the Soviet KGB. It depicts sites in
Urus-Martan, a town about 10 miles southwest of the Chechen
capital, Grozny, in which the Kremlin says bombs were made and
slave laborers and condemned prisoners were kept penned in cells.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scenes on the film are shots of containers said to be
filled with explosives; mixing vats, and bomb components such as
alarm clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said the sites held ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive
ingredient used in the apartment-house bombings, and a small amount
of another explosive compound found in traces of the terrorist
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the vigorous actions of our army, the militants
didn't manage to take everything out of these bases,'' he said.
``They left behind explosives that were identical to the ones used
in the explosions'' in Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same ingredients, he said, were also used in car
bombings in 1998 in Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, in which
13 people died and more than 100 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   He also charged that the rebels had executed 700 civilians who
refused to assist them and 300 hostages who were being held for
ransom. There was no way to corroborate those figures.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both Russian and Chechen propagandists have been
hurling wildly inflated accusations throughout the war, as well as
gross underestimations of their own casualties and battlefield
mistakes, so it is difficult to separate the war's truth from its
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, each side has complained that the other side
massacred civilians and waged chemical warfare. The latter charge
apparently stemmed from the bombing _ accidental or otherwise _ of
some chlorine tanks near Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's video could contain compelling evidence of Chechen
terrorist activity. Or it could simply be an element of the
Kremlin's effort to bolster support for the war at a time when
Russian troops are taking their heaviest losses yet, and when the
once-pliant media are growing restive.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov allowed Wednesday that the Kremlin is locked in an
``information war'' with the Chechen militants, a war that, he
said, was ``at least as fierce as combat in the field.''

BUSH ENDORSED BY 2 MORE SENATORS; MCCAIN CRACK BECOMES SUBJECT OF

   SUPPORT FROM ASHCROFT
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was endorsed Wednesday by two
prominent senators, bringing to 33 the number of Republican
senators who have decided to back Bush as the Republican
presidential nominee instead of John McCain, their colleague in
that chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers were Sens. John Ashcroft of Missouri, a social
conservative who had briefly flirted with a run at the Republican
presidential nomination, and Connie Mack of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, who appeared in West Columbia, S.C., with Bush, said
that it was good to join a ``winning team'' and that he was as
optimistic about America's future as Bush was. ``We're far too
young to die,'' he said, referring to the American empire. ``It's
time again to fly. And let this mighty eagle soar again.''

   WHOSE LAUGH?
</P>
<P>
   One day last September, Sen. John McCain was bantering with
reporters on his campaign bus about something that had slipped his
mind, and he joked that at 63 he was becoming old and senile. ``The
nice thing about Alzheimer's,'' he cracked, ``is you get to hide
your own Easter eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the New Hampshire affiliate of the National Right to
Life Committee, which opposes McCain's presidential candidacy
because he wants to change campaign finance laws, picked up on the
joke and began running a 30-second radio spot accusing the senator
of being insensitive to the elderly. ``Four million Americans
suffer from Alzheimer's disease,'' the ad begins.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the McCain campaign here said New Hampshire
voters would have no trouble recognizing the remark as a joke.

   THE PRESIDENT ON THE TRAIL
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton came to the aid of a Democratic congresswoman
Tuesday night at a $1,000-a-person fund-raiser in Houston. But the
visit was more of a reward to a loyal ally than a rescue of a
candidate in distress.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate, Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, was one of the
president's most outspoken defenders during the House impeachment
hearings in 1998. When the case moved to the Senate, she listened
to the trial day after day from the back of the Senate chamber, and
during breaks in the proceedings disparaged the case to reporters
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson-Lee is not exactly running scared in her re-election
bid. She won nearly 90 percent of the vote in 1998, a reflection of
the Democratic hold on her district, and she is expected to coast
to re-election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening Clinton attended a fund-raiser for the
Texas Legislative Victory Fund. Texas is expected to gain
congressional seats after the 2000 Census, and control of the
legislature will determine how those seats are apportioned.
Democrats narrowly control the state House and Republicans narrowly
control the state Senate.

ADVERTISING: REVAMPED PITCH FOR COKE WILL PAVE WAY FOR HIGHER

<P>
   It would be an exaggeration to assert that a new campaign for
the flagship soft drink sold by Coca-Cola Co. is a make-or-break
effort. After all, the beverage, known as Coca-Cola Classic in
North America and Coca-Cola elsewhere, is the world's best-selling
soda and most recognized brand.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the television, print and Internet campaign, the first
revamping of the venerable product's pitch in almost seven years,
is being introduced at a crucial time for the company. Coca-Cola is
facing what could be its toughest marketing battle in recent memory
as it seeks to persuade American customers to pay more for soft
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and its principal rival, the Pepsi-Cola unit of
PepsiCo, have begun to increase prices for the concentrate they
sell to bottlers, which will most likely end an era of continuous
bargains on cans and bottles of soda in supermarkets, drugstores
and mass merchandise outlets. Higher prices, even if they mean
lower volume, are intended to make the retail business more
profitable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under that model, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola will probably spend
more to try to stimulate demand for their brands. But they risk
making shoppers balk at paying more for carbonated sugared water,
particularly when more alternatives _ teas, fruit drinks, sports
beverages, even water _ are more available than ever.
</P>
<P>
   So the Coke Classic campaign, scheduled to blitz American
consumers starting Monday, is more focused on product qualities and
benefits than its predecessor, which carried the theme ``Always
Coca-Cola.'' That reorientation is underscored by the new theme _
plainly and simply ``Coca-Cola. Enjoy'' _ which is celebrated in
the lyrics of a sprightly jingle in at least 19 musical genres from
``urban/Latino/rap'' to ``country/traditional.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads ``leverage what's unique about Coke, the flavor
composition, the spice and aromatics, the good memories, the feel
of the bottle,'' said Charles Frenette, who until Friday is the
chief marketing officer of Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, ``and how
it adds a little bit of magic, a little sparkle, to the little
moments of everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We happen to be a cola, but we're Coca-Cola,'' Frenette said,
referring to the year-old ``Joy of cola'' campaign for Pepsi-Cola.
``It's about fun and good times, refreshment through renewal, not
just quenching a parched throat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole notion is about making Coke more useful, talking
about what Coke does for its user,'' he continued. ``And we think
people ascribe value to usefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   Frenette, who is being sent to Europe by the company's
designated new chairman and chief executive, Douglas Daft, to
become president of its struggling operations there, joined with
Ian Rowden, the company's vice president and advertising director,
to offer a preview of the campaign in meetings with reporters
Tuesday in New York. The meetings preceded the presentation of the
campaign to Coca-Cola bottlers in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the new jingle and the content of the ads are an effort
to entertain the consumer and attract attention,'' said John
Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. ``But at
the same time, the prevalence of the bubbles and the fizzing energy
try to convey something to the consumer about the attributes of the
product.''
</P>
<P>
   In emphasizing the ``Cokeness,'' as it were, of Coca-Cola, the
campaign makes a harder sell than its diffused predecessor, though
the hawking is swaddled in soft surroundings. The low-key nature of
the ads is embodied in the catchy jingle, far less bombastic than
its Pepsi counterpart, which is complemented in commercials by
humor, special effects, attractive young casts and even a soupcon
of sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not `Enjoy Coca-Cola' but `Coca-Cola. Enjoy,''' Rowden
said. ``It's not directive; it's not prescriptive. It's an
invitation, allowing people to view life through the optimistic
lens we provide.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the campaign is Proustian, offering remembrances of
Cokes past, though the trappings are contemporary in keeping with a
corporate belief that, as quoted by Frenette, ``the genius behind
Coca-Cola is the fact it's renewed for each generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Several spots are nostalgic, centered on memories of consumers
in their teens and 20s of a going-away party, frolicking under a
waterfall, romping in the snow and a night out with friends. There
are familiar characters like the polar bears and the thirsty summer
sun, joining newcomers like a race of pink aliens that thrive on
Coke Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The jingle lyrics evoke the famous slogan ``It's the real
thing.'' And updated versions of the classic contoured Coke bottle
_ augmented by a redesigned ``bell glass'' and traditional red
coolers _ play as large a role in every ad as ``Is that your final
answer?'' plays on every episode of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty impressed with the campaign,'' said Gary A.
Hemphill, vice president at Beverage Marketing Corp., a research,
data and consulting company. ``It's well thought out, striving to
make Coca-Cola more relevant and useful rather than building
awareness, which the brand already has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time for a change,'' he added. `` `Always' had run its
course. And Coca-Cola needs to move the needle, though it's a
pretty large needle given their size and scope. By playing on the
mystique of the brand'' _ a concept Frenette also referred to,
using the term ``gestalt'' _ ``the campaign makes Coke appear
special. And that may be a pretty strong approach when concentrate
prices are rising.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To create the ``Enjoy'' campaign, Coca-Cola is turning first to
a shortened list of agencies that have worked on the brand in
various countries. The initial batch of commercials and print ads
for worldwide consumption is being produced by Edge Creative, which
had been the lead creative agency for Coca-Cola Classic, and Leo
Burnett Co. unit of the Leo Group.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett is contributing the winter commercial, a funny spot
about a parrot that mimics the sound of a Coca-Cola bottle opening,
a lavish commercial centered on children's first taste of Coke, and
a spot in which a large crowd at a rock concert turns into
effervescent bubbles. The Edge contributions include the
commercials about the aliens, the waterfall and the party.
</P>
<P>
   Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, which has specialized in Coke ads with sports
themes, is developing global spots devoted to the Summer Olympics,
football and soccer, Rowden said. Four other agencies are working
on local and regional ads that could be seen more widely, he added:
D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications, part of MacManus
Group; Doner; McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, a division of
the McCann-Erickson World Group, owned by Interpublic Group of
Cos.; and Publicis, part of Publicis SA.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plans to overhaul the Web site (www.cocacola.com)
for Coca-Cola, effective Monday, in its first redesign since it was
introduced in 1995. The revamping, by the interactive shop
Agency.com, will replace the current staid, bland graphics with
more interactive features like links to commercials and jingles
that can be downloaded, screen savers and e-commerce (as in
``enjoy'' or ``electronic''). For instance, products like toy polar
bears will be available for purchase, Rowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether consumers enjoy, dislike or ignore the ``Enjoy''
campaign, it is likely to be around for a while, said Emanuel
Goldman, a global consumer-products analyst for Merrill Lynch,
adding that Coca-Cola ``will push extra hard this year, but it's
not just this year; this is longer term.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR)
</P>
<P>
   DOWN THROUGH THE DECADES WITH COKE SLOGANS
</P>
<P>
   For many years, signs and vending machines have urged consumers
to ``Enjoy Coca-Cola.'' But the new campaign theme being introduced
Monday, ``Coca-Cola. Enjoy,'' is the first time the word has been
officially included in the brand's main slogan. Here is a look back
at other slogans, from the archives of Coca-Cola Co.:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1929 ``The pause that refreshes.''
</P>
<P>
   1936 ``It's the refreshing thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   1942 ``It's the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   1944 ``Global high sign.''
</P>
<P>
   1959 ``Be really refreshed.''
</P>
<P>
   1963 ``Things go better with Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   1969 ``It's the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   1971 ``I'd like to buy the world a Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   1976 ``Coke adds life.''
</P>
<P>
   1982 ``Coke is it.''
</P>
<P>
   1986 ``Red, white and you.''
</P>
<P>
   1989 ``Can't beat the feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   1990 ``Can't beat the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   1993 ``Always Coca-Cola.'' &QL;

LIVE DINOSAUR ON DISPLAY AT STATE CAPITOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Generations from now, pa leontologists will look back
in awe and envy at the events of January 2000, when journalists
slogging through the muck on West Washington Street stumbled upon a
living, breathing speci men from a category of prehis toric beings
long thought to be extinct.
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was immediately identi fied as a fully preserved exam ple of
Crackpotus Fanatisaurus, a small but vigorous subgroup of the genus
and species Numbskullus Politisaurus, which thrived for a time in
the area of the Arizona State Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters on the scene dubbed the discovery, ``State Rep. Karen
Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   The origin of this particular class of creature was said to have
been the area described as ``east Mesa.''
</P>
<P>
   Individuals from that geo graphic location were known to have
learned to walk upright and make use of simple tools, but few at
the time believed they had achieved a level of mental acuity that
would have allowed them to formulate ef fective language skills.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Johnson spoke, this theory was proved true.
</P>
<P>
   She announced this week that she planned to introduce in the
state Legislature a bill requir ing public schools to set aside
time to present ``scientific evi dence'' that disputes the most
accepted theories of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Though her bill doesn't men tion it specifically, Johnson told a
local talk-show host that she'd like to see religious ``creation
ism'' taught in schools.
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Johnson told one re porter, ``If you come from a lit tle
bit of slime out in a pool, then what's so great about life?''
</P>
<P>
   Before judging her too harshly, please take into consid eration
who is speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson apparently is unfa miliar with the universally ac cepted
theory that, as a politician, her origins actually can be traced to
an enormous bit of slime.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions to this swamp-like political legacy have been
discovered in all parts of the world, thought the fossil fields are
particularly rich in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, for instance, the education lobbyist for then-Gov.
Evan Mecham, a former state representative named Jim Coo per, told
a committee at the state House, ``If a student wants to say the
world is flat, the teacher doesn't have the right to try to prove
otherwise. . . . The schools don't have any busi ness telling
people what to be lieve.''
</P>
<P>
   During that same era, there was a female member of the
Legislature whose last name also happened to be Johnson. Her first
name was Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to vigorously op posing things like the holiday
named in honor of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Rep. Leslie
Johnson once said, ``I am sick of more government pro grams for the
poor. I think the poor are doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Johnson also intro duced a law outlawing what she called
``sexual devices.'' The bill failed to pass, but it did lead to the
production and sale of an extremely popular bumper sticker that
read:
</P>
<P>
   ``When dildos are outlawed, only outlaws will have dildos.''
</P>
<P>
   Given such a heritage, some might suggest that as backward as
Rep. Karen Johnson appears to be, she is more evolved than her
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson would disagree.
</P>
<P>
   She does not believe in evolu tion and, unlike the scientists
she opposes, she has proof posi tive.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars must rely on fossils, radioisotopic dating, compara
tive anatomy, embryology, bio chemistry and other sciences to
support their conclusions about evolution.
</P>
<P>
   All Johnson must do to refute them is open her mouth. &QL;

DEADLINE LIFTED FOR RETURN OF RESCUED CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Fla.)   (Eds.: Includes changes in 2nd, 4th and 5th graphs and inserts
graphs about relatives' lawyer, the administration and members of
Congress)  
(jw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday that
only federal courts had the authority to decide whether a
6-year-old boy should be reunited with his father in Cuba but said
immigration officials had lifted a Friday deadline for his return
to allow his relatives to appeal in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to lawyers for the boy's relatives in Miami, Reno
said a Florida state court had no jurisdiction in the case of the
boy, Elian Gonzalez. The child was rescued at sea clinging to an
inner tube in November after his mother drowned.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Reno emphatically reaffirmed her belief that the
law required that Elian should be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is considering going to court this week
to ask a federal judge to enforce the immigration ruling in hope of
speedily resolving a difficult, emotional political and diplomatic
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has adopted a dual approach to
dealing with the case. On one hand, officials want to show that
their ruling giving Elian's father the right to make the decision
for the boy is the product of well-established law that sets a
priority on family unification and that they are willing to have it
tested in federal court. At the same time, the administration is
moving to end the stalemate quickly, possibly seeking a court order
that could lead to federal marshals' being sent to fetch Elian from
the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Reno said that a separate lawsuit filed in
Florida state court by the relatives to gain custody of Elian had
no bearing on the case, which she said could only be decided in
federal court. Judge Rosa Rodriguez of the Miami-Dade Circuit Court
ruled Monday that Elian must remain in the United States until a
March 6 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Reno brushed aside that ruling Wednesday, saying that the state
court order had ``no force or effect'' on the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's decision in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of who may speak for a 6-year-old child in
applying for admission or asylum is a matter of federal immigration
law,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials and legal analysts said they
believed that Reno had the authority to decide as she did because
the immigration issues under federal jurisdiction took precedence
over the custody matter before the Florida court.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the Florida relatives, said in a
telephone interview that the family would soon take up Reno's
invitation to file a challenge to the immigration ruling in federal
court. But he said the relatives would also maintain efforts to
have a state court award them legal custody of Elian. ``We are not
removing this case from the state court,'' he said. ``We will seek
protection for Elian's civil rights in federal court as a separate
action.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for the Miami relatives will ask the court to
reinstate an asylum petition on behalf of Elian and argue that
immigration officials wrongly decided that boy's father was in a
position to make a decision in the child's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   No clear end appears in sight in the stalemate over Elian's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have been hoping that Elian's
relatives will not dig in their heels and refuse to allow the boy
to return to Cuba. But since last week's ruling by the immigration
service, hundreds of Cuban-Americans have staged protests in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Wednesday's action in lifting the deadline
was part of the effort to demonstrate that the decision to rule in
favor of the father was a product of the law. One official said
that the deep fear behind all the legal maneuvering was that the
situation would deteriorate to a stage where the federal government
would have to use marshals to assume physical custody of the boy.
``We are still hopeful that we can resolve this matter soon,'' a
senior official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been sensitive from the beginning to the
political implications of the case. While reluctant to offend
Cuban-American voters, senior officials have also been eager to end
the situation to prevent any worsening of relations with Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, several members of Congress, Democrats and
Republicans, sent a letter to Reno urging her to respect the role
of the Florida courts. The signers included Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., and Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Eig said Wednesday that the family would abide by any court
decision and fully understood that it would not be in the best
interests of the child to have any confrontation with the federal
authorities in which Elian would be forcibly taken from them. But
he left open the possibility that the relatives might feel that a
state court ruling in their favor on custody might trump the
federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised that Reno would not respect a state court
ruling on what is essentially a state matter,'' Eig said, adding it
was common for federal courts to look to state courts to determine
a person's status in making immigration rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Reno made it clear Wednesday that she believed otherwise. She
also offered a long rebuttal to the lawyers' contention that
immigration service guidelines mandated that Elian should be given
a full hearing.

NO DEAL YET FOR SALE OF THE DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talks over the possible purchase of the Devils by the YankeeNets
appear to be moving forward, with the newly merged baseball and
basketball teams tentatively agreeing to pay $175 million for the
hockey team, people involved in the negotiations said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal is not final, and either side could still change
its mind. John McMullen, the owner of the Devils, even denied
Wednesday that a tentative accord had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Others involved in the discussions insisted, however, that a
nonbinding agreement was signed last month; it essentially compels
the YankeeNets and McMullen to negotiate toward a final contract in
good faith, although each side could walk away from a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The document started a period during which the YankeeNets may
examine the hockey team's finances, with an eye toward finding
liabilities or lawsuits that could affect the sale price, which
stands to be one of the highest for a National Hockey League team.
</P>
<P>
   But McMullen insisted, in strong terms, that there was no deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not selling anything,'' he said by telephone from Florida,
adding that there was ``absolutely no truth'' to the existence of
such a tentative contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made up my mind,'' he said. ``There's no agreement.
It's not so.''
</P>
<P>
   He said YankeeNets officials had made him offers. ``They're
talking to me, that's all,'' McMullen said. ``They'd love to buy
me. I'm the best team in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for and board member of the
YankeeNets, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But people involved in the talks insisted that both sides had
signed the nonbinding contract and that the negotiations were far
more advanced than McMullen acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal comes to fruition, the Devils will make a sensible
fit with the YankeeNets, which wants to relocate the Nets from
Continental Arena in the Meadowlands to an arena that would be
built in downtown Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the Devils would provide a second tenant for the proposed
$290 million arena, making it much more likely to be profitable and
therefore easier to finance. The Nets' lease in the Meadowlands
expires in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   It might be worth it for the YankeeNets to pay $175 million _
$40 million above Forbes magazine's recent estimate of the Devils'
value _ to fill a new arena in Newark with two teams, guaranteeing
more than 80 regular-season games a year.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman has said that state aid for infrastructure
at a Newark arena, estimated to be worth as much as $75 million,
would hinge on the housing of two teams.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen continues to lobby state officials to build a privately
financed arena for the Devils in Hoboken, N.J., in a proposed
venture with Cablevision. But he has been thwarted by the
governor's refusal to grant him crucial air rights over state-owned
New Jersey Transit railroad tracks.

BROADWAY ACTOR FILES SUIT IN WRONGFUL ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A leading actor in the Broadway musical ``Ragtime''
who was mistakenly arrested last summer filed a lawsuit against the
Police Department on Wednesday that demands changes in arrest
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The actor, Alton Fitzgerald White, 35, who will finish his run
as Coalhouse Walker Jr. when ``Ragtime'' closes on Sunday, was
arrested July 16 in the vestibule of his apartment building in
Harlem by officers who said they had received a call about Hispanic
men in T-shirts who were carrying guns.
</P>
<P>
   White was handcuffed, and taken to the 33rd Precinct station
house, where he was strip-searched, held for four hours and
initially questioned without being read his rights, the suit said.
He was released without being charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Civil Liberties Union, which is representing White,
contends in the lawsuit that White's arrest was part of a broad
pattern by the Police Department ``to arrest thousands of New
Yorkers every year without legal justification.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, cited
recent news reports that in 1998 local district attorneys refused
to prosecute 18,000 cases in which the police had arrested New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   White, reached by phone between scenes during the first act of
Wednesday's matinee performance of ``Ragtime,'' said he hoped his
case would focus attention on the pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a victim in the sense that it happened to me,'' he said,
``but it's broader than that. In the grand scheme of things, it's
reality, and it's a reality that needs to be no more.''
</P>
<P>
   A police official, George Grasso, deputy commissioner for legal
matters, sharply criticized the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear-cut example of police officers putting their
lives on the line and acting well within the scope of their duties
to protect the lives of Mr. White and his neighbors,'' Grasso said
in a written statement. ``It is, indeed, a shame that Mr. White
refuses to understand this concept.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said they found a kilogram of cocaine in the lobby of
the building July 16 and arrested five men in addition to White.
Two were charged with criminal drug possession.
</P>
<P>
   The other men who were arrested but not charged filed a separate
civil rights lawsuit Wednesday. Each of the three, Ronald Jackson,
Christopher Montgomery and Marcus McCollum, was held for about five
hours before being released.
</P>
<P>
   All four men in the lawsuits are black. Both suits accuse the
police of singling out members of minorities in New York for
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Montgomery had just arrived in New York, their suit
said. Jackson, 28, was going to work as the student activities
coordinator at Columbia University, while Montgomery, 24, was
entering Columbia's business school, the suit said. McCollum, 29,
was employed as a publicist in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Montgomery were excited about coming to the city,
said their lawyer, Lewis Steele, and ``on the very first day, the
police treat them like the lowest of criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seeking compensatory and punitive damages, both
lawsuits seek a declaration by a judge that the police engaged in
illegal arrest practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeking systemic change,'' said Norman Siegel, executive
director of the civil liberties union, ``and an end to police
practices that are poisoning police-community relations in New York
City.''

ROCKER CLAIMS NO EVIL INTENT

<P>
   Atlanta Braves reliever John Rocker insisted Wednesday that he
was not a racist and that the published portrayal of his comments
``grossly misrepresented'' the person he is. But in his first
interview since his inflammatory comments ran in Sports Illustrated
last month, he often sounded defensive, and rather than deflate the
controversy he created, he may have fueled it further.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a racist, would I want a black guy living in my
house?'' Rocker asked rhetorically, speaking in an interview with
ESPN. ``I would invite him to come to my house? I did that three
times over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I want to do is offend people and ostracize
myself. I like being around people and like being accepted by
people, and if I had ever felt any of these comments would
ostracize myself and take me back and put me on a pedestal and
segregated, I certainly never would've said it because that wasn't
my intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was asked what he would have thought if he had read
comments like his attributed to another person. ``I would've
thought I was a complete jerk,'' he said. ``Like, `Who the heck
does this guy think he is, mouthing off like this, and what kind of
experience does he have to talk from?'''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker tried to provide a context for his remarks, mentioning
how harshly he had been treated while he played in Shea Stadium
against the New York Mets last season, how he had been spat upon,
and how someone had dumped a beer on him at Yankee Stadium during
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker did not deny making the comments that were attributed to
him, but implied that the article did not correctly reflect his
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig has ordered Rocker to undergo a
psychological evaluation.

SURGE OF INVESTORS DOUBLES ASSETS OF N.Y. COLLEGE SAVINGS PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some, it was the lure of the tax deduction. For others, it
was the chance to save for the college education of a son, daughter
or grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the motivation, a flood of new checks in 1999 sent
the assets in New York's College Savings Program to $374 million,
more than double the total a year ago, just months after it was
started.
</P>
<P>
   The number of accounts jumped during the past year to 83,143,
from about 43,000. The average account was up, too, to about
$4,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did expect a good response, but it's really been quite
overwhelming,'' said state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who oversees
the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The college savings plan allows individuals to put aside money
for themselves, relatives or friends in tax-sheltered accounts to
be used for tuition at accredited colleges or graduate or
professional schools.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan's rules, contributions of up to $5,000 per
taxpayer each year are not subject to state and local taxes but are
subject to federal taxes. Income earned is also exempt from state
and local taxes, and federal taxes on earnings are deferred until
the money is withdrawn, at which time it is taxed at the student's
rate. On contributions over $5,000, only the interest is exempt
from local and state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The rates of return on the accounts varied last year depending
on the age of the beneficiaries. The plan is structured so that
accounts for young children are mostly invested in the stock
market, while those for older children and adults have much smaller
investments in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the plan is at the limit (currently 45 percent) on
how much money can be invested in equities. He and Gov. George
Pataki are pressing for legislation to lift those limits.

ASSEMBLY DEMOCRATS SHIFT STANCE ON FUND-RAISER BAN
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a turnabout, Democratic leaders of the state
Assembly Wednesday called for a ban on political fund-raisers in
the Albany area while the Legislature was in session. The proposal
is part of a campaign finance bill that includes a perennially
unsuccessful proposal to give candidates taxpayer money to help
finance their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Just six months ago, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver,
D-Manhattan, said he did not see a problem with Albany
fund-raisers. At the time, he was expressing opposition to a
similar proposal put forward by Gov. George Pataki introduced in
June. That bill was not taken up by either the Assembly or the
Republican-led Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have long held fund-raisers in Albany during the
session to attract lobbyists' donations. Silver's endorsement of
the ban comes at a time when lobbyists have been under more
legislative and public scrutiny. Silver was widely criticized last
month for refusing to go along with a Senate bill to restrict
lawmakers from accepting most meals and gifts from lobbyists.
Senate members adopted the restrictions on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lynch, a spokeswoman for Silver, said his proposed ban on
fund-raisers was a separate issue from lobbying reform and grew out
of his commitment to campaign finance overhaul. ``It was just an
evolution of the issue,'' she said. ``As we go into the new
millennium, he feels it should be part of a serious campaign
finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legislative experts, though, say the proposed ban is an
attempt by Democrats to win public support for a campaign finance
bill that has been proposed every year for two decades. Senate
leaders and the governor remain opposed to any measure that would
allow public money to be spent on political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, whose district is in the
Albany area, raised questions about the Assembly's commitment on
lobbying reform, given its refusal to go along with the Senate's
effort last month to ban lobbyists' gifts. He urged Assembly
members to ban fund-raisers on their own if they were to be taken
seriously. ``The silence out of the Assembly has been deafening,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have repeatedly pledged to undertake reforms in
campaign financing and in lobbying, have passed bills that were not
taken up by the other chamber, and then have accused each other of
not taking those issues seriously. And Pataki, after broaching
campaign finance reform for the first time in June, notably did not
mention it last week in his annual address to the Legislature. His
office did not return calls Wednesday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lynch rejected the idea that Assembly leaders had proposed
the ban on Albany fund-raisers as a political maneuver. ``If they
don't like our bill, fine, pass their own,'' she said of the Senate
members. ``Lobby reform and campaign finance reform are two
separate issues.''

ANALYSIS: MEDIA POWER GROWS FOR A FEW, BUT IS THAT GOOD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1983, Ben H. Bagdikian, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
newspaperman, wrote in his book ``The Media Monopoly'' (Beacon
Press) that a mere 50 companies controlled most of what Americans
read in books, magazines and newspapers and watched on television
and at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   For the book's sixth edition, due in March, that number has
shrunk to six.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every edition has been considered by some to be alarmist,''
Bagdikian said Monday from his home in Berkeley, Calif., ``and
every edition ends up being too conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the public debate over the power of Big Media
seems to have grown quieter since the 1980s, even as the industry
has become increasingly concentrated. Critics cite the power of the
media companies themselves to shape public debate on the issue,
largely by ignoring it.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say that Wall Street is not likely to stop the
trend since it, along with top media executives, profits handsomely
from the corporate deals. And politicians in Washington are also
unlikely to act, for fear of alienating large media owners and
losing large campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is also filled with ambiguities that may have
sapped many people's sense of outrage. For in addition to increased
media concentration, the last two decades have also heralded an
unprecedented proliferation of new information sources, from dozens
of cable networks to the seemingly unlimited resources of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And while some critics bemoan the fact that Big Media will snuff
out new voices, others spent much of last year worrying that small,
independent purveyors of gossip on the Internet and in tabloids
were setting the agenda for mainstream news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Is big always necessarily bad when it comes to media? To
Bagdikian and other critics, the answer is yes. But it can also be
argued that giants have the resources to create new voices and
preserve others. Many of the best news and information sites on the
Web are taking heavy losses but are subsidized by large media
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine many companies other than Gannett Co., the
giant newspaper chain, spending the millions of dollars it took to
establish USA Today, now the largest newspaper in the country. New
York 1, the local 24-hours cable news channel in New York City that
is widely seen as a welcome new source of municipal coverage,
required a large investment from its owner, Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is also The New York Post, where losses have been
estimated at $20 million a year and it was considered close to
death until Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corp.,
stepped in and bought it for a second time in 1993, thus preserving
a conservative editorial voice in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that the bigger companies become, the more they
will succeed in imposing their commercial agenda on the public,
drowning out independent voices and placing the interests of the
corporate parent over the journalism they practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner is going to think twice about criticizing AOL if
it is owned by Time Warner,'' said Ralph Nader, the consumer
advocate, who is extremely critical of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are many examples of big media companies trimming
their journalism to suit their corporate needs. A few years ago,
the News Corp. agreed to drop broadcasts of BBC World Service
Television to China on Star TV, its Asian satellite network after
criticism from the Chinese government. The company's publishing arm
later paid a substantial sum to the daughter of Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping for a biography of her father.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the debate over a landmark telecommunications
bill in 1995, CNN, which is owned by Time Warner _ in turn, the
second-largest cable television operation in the country _ refused
to run an advertisement paid for by long-distance phone companies
contending that cable TV rates would rise if the bill was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the reason we know about these and other such
embarrassing episodes is that they were pounced upon by
competitors, often owned by rival conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   And, on numerous occasions, publications have written critically
about their corporate cousins. People magazine, owned by Time
Warner, published an article highly critical of American Family
Enterprises, the sweepstakes company, now bankrupt, that was 50
percent owned by Time Warner. And after Time Warner and Turner
Broadcasting announced their merger in 1995, Time magazine wrote a
story that referred to Gerald Levin as ``the unsteady father'' and
Ted Turner as ``the unruly son.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it is impossible to know how many articles
have not been pursued because journalists felt it could be career
limiting to challenge their corporate parent.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc., said
editorial independence was related less to the size of the company
than it was to whether the owners and editors were committed to
editorial integrity. ``If a CEO is determined to have editors who
don't cover him, or cover him as a house organ, then you are going
to have bad journalism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes magazine is privately owned,'' he added, ``but it still
has never done a serious article on Malcom Forbes, or on Steve, who
is running for president. It is not about business or
concentration. It is about the mindset of the CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached Wednesday night, Forbes executive editor Lewis D'Vorkin
said he was not certain how much coverage the Forbes family had
received. But he said that a tribute to Malcom Forbes was featured
on the magazine's cover after his death in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that corporate interest will always skew the
judgment of corporate officers. And even when it does not, they
say, it is dangerous to have ever-larger media conglomerates run by
small groups of people who may or may not believe in fostering
honest journalism.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL has a track record of dubious ethics,'' said Jeff Cohen,
founder of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, a liberal-leaning
media watch group in Manhattan. He cited a series of incidents in
recent years, including America Online's use of controversial
accounting methods and its banishing of some members from the
online service because of comments they had made in chat groups.
</P>
<P>
   When AOL was simply the largest of several online services
offering access to the Internet, issues of censorship and privacy
were mitigated by the fact that a user could simply switch to
another service. But by virtue of its many cable systems that hold
local monopolies, the future AOL Time Warner, as the proposed new
company will be known, may be the only way to receive broadband
access to the Internet in many areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
   To critics, that means the commercialization of the Internet
will rapidly increase. ``It doesn't take an intricate
deconstruction of what Steve Case and Gerald Levin said,''
Bagdikian said, referring to Monday's announcement by the chairmen
of AOL and Time Warner. ``What they were really looking forward to
was creating the biggest shopping mall in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But how much power do Case and Levin really have to shape what
consumers see and hear? As the conglomerates grow larger and
larger, some argue that it becomes more difficult for top
executives to wield influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief executive officer hardly controls what goes on in
the trenches,'' said James Rosse, who retired in October as chief
executive of Freedom Communications, which owns The Orange County
Register in California along with 25 other daily newspapers, 8
television stations and more than a dozen magazines. ``I played an
important leadership role in shaping the size and direction of the
company. But I did not play any direct role in shaping the product
itself. Nor should I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people who recall a golden age 30 or 40 years ago, when
most newspapers and television stations were owned by small or
family-owned companies, may be blinded by nostalgia. While many
family-owned newspapers practiced exemplary journalism, many were
also beholden to local advertisers like car dealers, supermarket
chains and department stores. Reporters were sometimes barred from
investigating local institutions in which the owner-publisher had
an interest.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper chains, which bought up many of these independent
papers in the 1970s and 1980s, are often criticized for putting
profits above journalism. But the distance of the new parent
companies from local interests also created opportunities for
strong local reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The same can also be said today on a global scale. For example,
Time Warner is now facing a $27 billion libel suit in Indonesia
filed by former President Suharto. Though large media companies
have also been known to cave in when their financial interests are
threatened by foreign politicians, as News Corp. did in China, they
also have the resources needed to stand up to such threats _ if
they so choose.
</P>
<P>
   Much as critics like Bagdikian and Nader would like the
government to take steps to curb the growth of media conglomerates,
they say that the prospect of any action by Washington is thin.
Indeed, the relaxation of regulations by Congress touched off the
latest wave of media and telecommunications takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat to the media giants, short of a revival of a
``progressive movement'' in this country, Nader said, are the
products of the conglomerates themselves: ``That they will just
bore people to tears, that they will be so humdrum and bureaucratic
that they will collapse under their own weight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't want a society to rely on that,'' he said.

MONITOR APPOINTED TO OVERSEE THE IBF
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A U.S. District Court judge appointed a monitor
Wednesday to oversee the International Boxing Federation, whose top
leaders have been indicted on racketeering and bribery charges in a
rankings-for-pay scandal. The move marked the first time that a
federal court has intervened to oversee the affairs of a private
sports organization.
</P>
<P>
   In appointing the monitor and granting a preliminary injunction
removing those who had been indicted, as well as barring the
organization's remaining officials from engaging in racketeering
behavior, Judge John W. Bissell granted a civil remedy sought by
Robert J. Cleary, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, pending the
outcome of the criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Four IBF officials, including its founder and president, Robert
W. Lee Sr., have been charged in a 39-count indictment of extorting
$338,000 from a total of 30 fighters and managers in exchange for
rankings that would qualify them for lucrative fight purses and
broadcast proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   While the appointment falls short of creating the equivalent of
a boxing czar with powers to reform the sport generally, the
judge's action marked a significant new use of the provisions of
the 1970 Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,
according to legal experts. That law has normally been applied to
entities believed to be in the grip of organized crime, whether
they are unions, as in the case of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, or a business such as New York's Fulton Fish Market.
</P>
<P>
   Bissell appointed a criminal defense lawyer, Joseph Hayden Jr.,
to be the monitor for the East Orange, N.J., organization, which is
the only one among the three major boxing sanctioning groups whose
headquarters are in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The order by Bissell stopped short of removing the
organization's executive committee and much of its staff as Cleary
had initially requested. Even so, it gave the court-appointed
monitor broad powers to examine all actions by the existing staff
members and officers and to remove those who he determined were not
obeying the law and acting in the best interest of the IBF and
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee and two others among the indicted officials who
have been arrested have voluntarily stepped down and turned the
IBF's day-to-day operations over to an executive committee of the
board, Bissell underscored the requirement that they have nothing
to do with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   He directed that the monitor ``ensure the divorce of the
defendants from the IBF,'' and to make sure that they did not
exercise any control of the executive committee in ``a clandestine
and undisclosed fashion''.
</P>
<P>
   The husband of U.S. District Judge Katharine Hayden, Hayden is
the founder and first president of the N.J. Association of Criminal
Defense lawyers and was not believed to have any particular
expertise in boxing. He could not be reached for comment on his
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Linda P. Torres, the lawyer for the IBF and its current
executive committee, said that the IBF, which had argued that the
monitor was not necessary, had no plans to appeal the judge's
decision. She said that the IBF had already distanced itself from
the defendants, and that the executive committee now welcomed the
monitor's presence to show that they are acting properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can live with everything in this order,'' she said. ``The
government attorneys wanted a takeover of the IBF, but this is not
a takeover. This is a true monitor.''

STATES SPLIT ON WHETHER FLIGHT FROM POLICE IS CAUSE FOR SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SCOTUS-POLICE) 
(mk) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ It was an October afternoon in 1989, and Richard
Tucker was sitting on the stoop of a tenement on Rutherford Avenue
in downtown Trenton. A police car approached. Tucker fled, running
practically into the arms of a second police car that had been
alerted by the first about a fleeing man.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he was captured, Tucker tossed a clear bag into a
cellar opening. It contained crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's decision to run would become, in 1994, the basis of New
Jersey's judicial ruling that flight at the sight of a law
enforcement officer was not valid grounds for seizure under the
Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable search.
</P>
<P>
   Flight alone, the court said in a ruling that puts New Jersey at
odds with Wednesday's Supreme Court decision in Illinois vs.
Wardlow, was no basis for stopping someone unless there was more
evidence to support the police decision to give chase. Tucker went
free.
</P>
<P>
   But a Connecticut court looked at similar circumstances _ a
sudden flight, seizure, search and the finding of illegal drugs _
and ruled the opposite way. In the case of Connecticut vs. Maia,
the state trial court held in 1997 that when Eric Maia ran from
approaching police officers _ he hid in an apartment house _ he
gave the officers enough cause to stop and search him.
</P>
<P>
   They found marijuana, and charged Maia with possession with
intent to distribute, the same charge with which Tucker was
originally convicted in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Maia's appeal failed in the Connecticut Appellate Court; the
state Supreme Court, with the notable dissent of Judge Robert
Berdon, Connecticut's famous legal maverick, declined to review it.
Maia went to jail.
</P>
<P>
   That two should disagree on such a fundamental matter of
law is unusual, said George Thomas, a professor of law at Rutgers
Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you won't find very many states departing from the
federal model on matters like his,'' Thomas said. ``It wouldn't
surprise me if there were more than half a dozen states in the
country that went their own way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported Wednesday that besides New Jersey,
courts in Alaska, California, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada
and Utah had held that the police could not generally question
people simply because they fled at the sight of a badge. But, in
addition to Connecticut, courts in Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota,
North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin have handed down decisions in
line with Wednesday's Supreme Court ruling that flight may
constitute a probable cause for questioning and searching a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   New York had its own famous arrest-after-flight case under Judge
Harold Baer Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York, who in 1995 suppressed as evidence 80 pounds
of cocaine and heroin found in the car of Carol Bayless on the
ground that the police had decided to search the car only after men
who were seen loading it fled as the police approached.
</P>
<P>
   Baer's decision provoked a political ruckus that became an issue
in the subsequent city elections and even drew criticism from
President Clinton, who had appointed him in 1994. The judge
reversed himself in 1997, admitted the drugs into evidence and then
took himself off the case. Ms. Bayless, now 46, was later convicted
and sentenced to four and a half years in prison in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these cases, the issue the court had to decide was
whether evidence found after the suspects had been stopped for
fleeing was admissible. All three defendants argued that since
running away did not provide probable cause for arrest and search,
the drugs could not be used in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   (Maia further maintained that because he ran into a house and
closed the door _ although it was not his house _ he had a
reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment.)
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court, at least, agreed. ``Flight must be
accompanied by some circumstance present and unexplained that, in
conjunction with the flight, reasonably justifies an inference that
it was done with a consciousness of guilt and pursuant to an effort
to avoid an accusation based on that guilt,'' the court ruled
unanimously, with one justice abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Connecticut Appellate Court saw the same facts
differently. ``Reasonable and articulable suspicion is an objective
standard that focuses not on the mind of the police officer, but on
whether a reasonable person having the information available to and
known by the police would have had that level of suspicion,'' the
majority wrote.

MAYOR AND FIRST LADY TALK ABOUT SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With huffs and puffs and language that seemed more suited to
nuclear arms negotiations than a contest for the U.S. Senate, aides
to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and to Hillary Rodham Clinton opened
talks Wednesday on ways to limit the use of largely unregulated
soft-money contributions for their campaigns. The talks faltered by
dusk.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely at this point that either Giuliani or Mrs.
Clinton would agree to any measures that would curtail spending on
what both sides expect to be the most expensive Senate race in New
York history. But at the very least, the exchanges _ a telephone
conversation between the two campaign managers, followed by faxed
letters _ allowed Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton to reprise complaints
about each other's fund-raising practices while claiming to seize
the ethical high ground.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion began after Mrs. Clinton said to reporters in
Syracuse last month that she would be willing to consider a
bilateral ban on the soft money and on expenditures on behalf of
the candidates by independent committees. Mrs. Clinton has come
under attack for her aggressive efforts to raise soft money through
a network of committees across the nation, and several Republicans
have suggested that she floated the idea to gain some political
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, called
Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, on Tuesday to begin
talks about the proposal. Teitelbaum called him back Wednesday.
They talked for five minutes. Within 30 minutes, Teitelbaum
responded with a letter saying that Giuliani was open to such
discussions but only if Mrs. Clinton took steps to create a ``level
playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Teitelbaum called on Mrs. Clinton to reimburse
the Democratic National Committee for advertisements it financed on
Mrs. Clinton's behalf that ran upstate last year, as well as an
up-to-date accounting of soft money raised on her behalf. Soft
money given to political parties is intended for ``party building''
activities, not campaigns, but it is used for advertising on
issues.

H&AMP;R BLOCK TO TURN TAX OUTLETS INTO FINANCIAL SERVICES CENTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ H&AMP;R Block Inc. outlined broad plans Wednesday
for transforming its network of seasonal tax offices into
year-round financial services centers for middle-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kicking off what we call the new H&AMP;R Block,'' said Frank
L. Salizzoni, Block's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans, which are going into effect now, include:
</P>
<P>
   - Opening 94 year-round Block Financial Centers throughout the
United States. People may go to these centers for financial
planning, investment services, home mortgages, online trading and
other services, as well as for tax help.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy of the new centers formerly were offices of Olde
Financial Corp., which Block bought last year.
</P>
<P>
   - Offering many of those same tax preparation, mortgage and
brokerage services online to home computer users through an
expanded Web site at www.hrblock.com.
</P>
<P>
   - Introducing a Refund Rewards program, in which Block will load
taxpayers' refunds onto special buying cards. Taxpayers can use the
cards to get cash from automated teller machines or buy everything
from cars to consumer goods to airline tickets at discounts from
participating companies.
</P>
<P>
   Block's financial software publishing arm also is incorporating
new features in this year's products to help people filing at home
get refunds faster and use the new cards if they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Salizzoni, Chairman Henry Bloch and other top company executives
were in New York on Wednesday to discuss the changes with market
analysts and to ring the opening bell on the New York Stock
Exchange, where Block shares later closed at 47, down .
</P>
<P>
   Salizzoni and Mark Ernst, Block's chief operating officer, said
the changes were a natural extension of a drive that began long ago
to diversify the company's operations and produce a more dependable
yearlong stream of revenue and profits than tax work provides.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many of the new services unveiled Wednesday will prompt
changes at Block's 9,000 traditional U.S. tax preparation offices,
Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is offering free electronic filing to customers at
most of those offices, and preparers there will be ready to refer
clients to Block's other financial service offerings if the clients
ask, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many clients probably will ask, Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on historical experience, ``many people are more focused
on financial matters during tax season than any other time of the
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And based on market research Block did in preparation for the
plans announced Wednesday, many middle-income taxpayers seem
inclined to look to H&AMP;R Block as a potential source of financial
advice more often than more established Wall Street names that are
perceived to prefer wealthier clients, Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that gives us an advantage that no one else has,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Block historically reports its greatest revenue and most of its
profit in its fourth quarter, which ends in April, because peak tax
seasons in the United States, Canada, Australia and other countries
where Block operates generally don't start until January.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its diversification drive, Block also has bought
several regional accounting firms over the last two years and woven
them into a new business and accounting services subsidiary that is
the nation's sixth-largest accounting firm.

FARMERS INSURANCE TO EMPLOY 500 AT CUSTOMER CARE CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ Farmers Insurance Group, the nation's
third-largest home and auto insurer, plans to open a Customer Care
Center in Olathe this year and double its 500-member Kansas City
area work force.
</P>
<P>
   The center, under construction in Olathe's Technology Park, will
add to the area's reputation as a call center hub. It is one of two
centers that Farmers is opening to provide nationwide claims
service around the clock, said Vince Donofrio, the company's
support services director.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers' other new national claims center is being built near
Oklahoma City and also will employ about 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Both centers are designed to be models of a new, streamlined
claims process for Farmers customers in more than 40 states, said
Frank Soldano, vice president for strategic initiatives at the
company's headquarters in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Each center will be a 24-hour-a-day, year-round operation where
claims representatives will be able almost immediately to begin
processing reports of damaged property and authorizing home or auto
repairs, Soldano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process should be seamless,'' he said. ``Our care centers
go beyond a typical call center. They represent a focal point for
customer service and management.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials estimate the 500 specialized and mostly
clerical workers needed in Olathe probably would earn an average of
$32,000, with benefits, a year.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers plans to recruit all but about 50 of the 500 additional
Kansas City area workers from the local work force, Donofrio said.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming construction continues on schedule, hiring will begin
this spring. The center is to open in this year's third quarter and
will be fully staffed by April 2001, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers and executives of Karbank &AMP; Co., Technology Park's
developers, signed a 10-year lease Wednesday in Los Angeles for the
80,000 square feet in Olathe that the insurance company will
occupy. Details of the lease agreement weren't available.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers will be eligible for more than $2 million in state
economic development incentives that are related to training
workers in higher-tech jobs as well as some other tax benefits that
cannot be calculated yet, said Kansas Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer, who
also is the state's commerce and housing secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company presumably will benefit from a 10-year,
50 percent Olathe tax abatement for which all Technology Park
tenants will qualify, said Kevin Hammeke, the city's financial
services director.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the area's most recent job expansions have involved
communications centers.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be surprising, said Jill McCarthy, business
development director the Kansas City Area Development Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more than 40 companies having substantial call center
operations here already, we have both a highly trained work force
and an infrastructure to attract more companies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers picked the Kansas City and Oklahoma City areas from a
short list of first 10 and then five other cities examined in a
nationwide search, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Central location, top-quality work forces and the relatively low
cost of living weighed heavily in both cities' favor, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City's case, it also helped that ``we've had a lot of
good experiences here,'' said Joe Moss, Farmers' executive director
for Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the state office that Moss leads, Farmers has
both a Kansas City Service Center and a National Catastrophe
Center, all in Overland Park, with a total work force of about 500
people.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas civic and political hailed Farmers' announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another example of a well-respected business taking
advantage of the outstanding benefits Kansas has to offer,'' Kansas
Gov. Bill Graves said.

FEDERAL JUDGE IN NEW YORK REFUSES TO RETURN CHILDREN TO FRANCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan refused Wednesday to
order the return of two children to France, saying that their
mother had been abused by their father in Paris and that forcing
them to return would expose them to a grave risk of psychological
harm.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Denny Chin of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan came in a bitterly contested dispute in which the
governments of France and the United States had both urged that the
judge return the children under the 1980 Hague Convention, an
international treaty that in almost all cases encourages the prompt
return of abducted children in international custody disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute also raised child welfare issues that in some ways
resembled those surrounding Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban
boy whose status has sparked an international debate.
</P>
<P>
   In the French case, Chin said although he had confidence that
France's courts could adequately protect the children _ 8-year-old
Marie-Eline Blondin, and her brother, Francois, 4 _ from physical
harm if they were returned, uprooting them from their new life in
the United States would be too risky psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Marthe Dubois, who moved in with relatives in
Woodbridge, N.J., admitted forging travel documents so she could
take the children out of France in August 1997. She said that she
wanted to escape seven years of repeated beatings by her boyfriend,
Felix Blondin, the children's father.
</P>
<P>
   Blondin denied the allegations, and French officials have
indicated they might seek to extradite Ms. Dubois to face charges
in France if Chin did not return the children under the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But Chin, who wrote that he was troubled by what he called
France's veiled threats to extradite if he did not issue a
favorable ruling, said the case fit a narrow exception in the Hague
treaty. The exception says children may remain if returning them
would pose a ``grave risk'' of psychological or physical harm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubois' lawyer, Leonard F. Joy, said his client was
gratified by the ruling. He said it was ``faithful'' to the treaty
``and most important, is in the best interests of the children it
was designed to protect.''
</P>
<P>
   Blondin's lawyers, who said they had not yet been able to reach
their client in Paris, said an appeal would be considered.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers, Sanford J. Hausler, said the ruling could
lead to greater trauma for the children if Ms. Dubois was now
extradited.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, which represented the
views of the government, had no comment.

<P>
   After little more than a year as Barnesandnoble.com's chief
executive, Jonathan Bulkeley announced his departure from the No. 2
online bookseller Wednesday, saying that he wanted to devote more
time to his own Internet investments and his growing family.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Bulkeley, 39, effective in February, came
after discussions between him and Leonard Riggio, the chairman and
chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc., which owns the bookstore in
a partnership with Bertelsmann, the media conglomerate..
</P>
<P>
   The company announced that Riggio's brother, Stephen Riggio,
would step in as the acting chief executive until a replacement is
found.
</P>
<P>
   Bulkeley is one of a handful of senior executives who have left
the online bookseller after little more than a year at the growing
company, which was started in 1997. The other executives have
included a chief operating officer, a chief financial officer, a
technology officer and a director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Bulkeley stressed that he wanted to
focus his time on investments that he maintains in other Internet
start-up companies, like QXL.com, a leading European Web auctioneer
that he presides over as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about everyone else,'' he said of the other
executive departures. ``I'm not fleeing. I'm going to do other
stuff that I really enjoy. My wife is having another baby and this
will be No. 4. And I've been on the Internet for eight years and
I'm ready to be a chairman and a board member and a father.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Leonard Riggio said that he had been discussing
Bulkeley's departure for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a decision that we both came to,'' Riggio said,
adding that the resignation ``was really no surprise; there's been
no acrimony in our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior book publishing executive said that it was clear before
the Christmas holidays that there were tensions between the chief
executive and the parent company, which had exerted increasing
control over the infant bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hearing rumors that this marriage was not made in
heaven and was about to end up in court,'' the executive said. ``I
think that the word from Barnes &AMP; Noble was that they were very
unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulkeley's resignation came a week after the company reported
that its sales had tripled in its most recent quarter to $81.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Barnesandnoble.com shares fell by 62.5 cents, to
$15.4375, well below the high of $26.625 they reached after the
company's initial public offering last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't worry about these stock prices,'' Riggio said. ``And
I certainly can't hold these managers or even myself responsible.
You do your best, but with these companies you've got to manage
them well and the stock price ought to follow. So, I'm not happy
with the stock price at Barnesandnoble.com, but I don't think it's
a function of the way Jonathan had managed the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble and Bertelsmann each own about 41 percent of the
online bookseller. Bertelsmann's chief executive, Thomas
Middelhoff, issued a statement Wednesday expressing confidence in
Riggio's ability to lead the company and the decision to appoint
his brother temporarily as the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message, he reaffirmed that statement: ``I really
believe this. You'll see what will happen very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggio said that the company is searching for a chief executive
but did not specify a timetable, denying rumors within the book
industry that the company was considering a top publishing
executive for the position.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on the qualifications the company had in
mind for a new leader. &QL;

GRAND JURY INVESTIGATING PAYMENTS TO HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD RICHMAN AND MARK MORRIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An investigation into improper payments to
high school basketball players during summer-league competition
surged ahead Wednesday when a shoe company executive and local
businessman testified before a federal grand jury in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours before that testimony, and two floors above the
grand jury room in the federal courthouse, prosecutors interviewed
one of the key basketball players in the case, Andre Williams of
Oklahoma State University.
</P>
<P>
   And in Los Angeles, the lawyer for a sports agent whose name has
appeared in the case acknowledged that his client also has been
subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is exploring whether improper payments endangered
players' college eligibility and economically harmed federally
funded universities.
</P>
<P>
   About midafternoon, Don Crenshaw, Nike Inc.'s manager of high
school basketball, appeared before the grand jury for about an
hour. Through his lawyer, J.R. Hobbs, Crenshaw declined to comment
about his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nike is fully cooperating with the investigation,'' Hobbs
said. ``Nike is not a target of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw directs Nike's high school basketball programs
nationwide, organizing tournaments, camps and corporate funding for
traveling summer teams.
</P>
<P>
   Three Kansas City basketball players who have been suspended by
their collegiate programs _ JaRon Rush, Kareem Rush and Williams _
all played on a Nike-sponsored summer team while in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Each has reportedly acknowledged receiving improper payments or
benefits before they went to college.
</P>
<P>
   The coach of the summer team, Kansas City's Myron Piggie, also
was a paid Nike consultant. Piggie says he has done nothing
improper.
</P>
<P>
   After Crenshaw's testimony, the grand jury heard for about 10
minutes from Tom Grant, a Kansas City businessman who paid the prep
school tuition for Williams and JaRon Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Grant, the chief executive officer of LabOne Inc.,
declined to comment about his testimony. John Osgood, his lawyer,
however, said Grant has cooperated with the probe by giving
investigators information about the support his charitable
foundation provided to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just filling in some details about this whole
unfortunate episode,'' Osgood said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant also provided financial support to the summer teams on
which the three Kansas City players competed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, one of those players, Williams, emerged from
his 90-minute meeting with prosecutors, saying he was weary with
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, to say the least,'' Williams said. ``I'm
going back to school (Thursday). I'm ready to get back on the court
and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a freshman who attended Schlagle High School in Kansas
City, Kan., has been indefinitely suspended by Oklahoma State for
accepting impermissible benefits. Grant, who provided the tuition
for Williams to attend an East Coast prep school last year, said
last week the NCAA has made a preliminary decision to suspend
Williams for a year because of the tuition payments. The NCAA,
according to Grant, said Williams must repay the $20,000 in tuition
before his eligibility is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' attorney, Tulsa-based Mark Zannotti, instructed
Williams not to answer a reporter's questions about the
investigation. Zannotti, however, said that Williams' case, aside
from the grand jury probe, could set an NCAA precedent, but
wouldn't detail why.
</P>
<P>
   That precedent could be the suspension of a player because of
prep school tuition payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this case is going to be a precedent, (NCAA officials)
are going through all the channels to set a decision that sets a
correct precedent,'' Zannotti said. ``We appreciate the NCAA's
willingness to keep a dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Rush, who is serving a nine-game suspension from the
University of Missouri team, spent about three hours in the U.S.
attorney's office earlier this week. The NCAA, which imposed the
suspension, has stated that Kareem Rush must pay $1,800 to a
charity before his college eligibility expires.
</P>
<P>
   That supposedly is the amount he received in excess of
permissible benefits while playing summer basketball while he was
in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the lawyer for Los Angeles sports agent Jerome
Stanley confirmed that a subpoena had been issued for his client to
appear before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, David Bass, would not say when Stanley would appear,
but contended that because the subpoena had been dropped off at his
office, and not given personally to Stanley, the document had not
yet been officially served.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, JaRon Rush acknowledged to reporters that he
had accepted money from a sports agent, confirming earlier accounts
from his grandmother that he had taken $200 from Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Bass reiterated Wednesday that Stanley still contends he never
gave money to JaRon Rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more to add,'' Bass said. ``JaRon's public
statements do not change the facts. What we said is the truth, and
we have no idea why he (JaRon) would say that.''

PATAKI BUDGET WOULD SLOW NEW YORK CITY'S GAINS FOR SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The budget that Gov. George E. Pataki proposed
calls for a modest increase in state aid to schools, but it would
worsen a disparity that has for years led the New York City school
system to receive less state aid per pupil than other districts.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's budget seeks to increase overall state spending for
education by $355 million, or 2.8 percent, for the coming school
year. But the city would receive only $102 million of the total
increase, or 29 percent, even though it has 37 percent of the
state's students.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the imbalance is that while Pataki's plan
calls for increasing the main form of state aid to school
districts, including New York City's, he is seeking to eliminate a
handful of programs that primarily benefit the city school system
and other urban districts.
</P>
<P>
   Those cuts are mainly directed at two programs: one that raises
the salaries of teachers in urban school districts and another that
provides such districts money to undertake minor maintenance
projects in aging school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the state gave the city roughly $95 million to provide
those programs this year. But most if not all of that money is
likely to be restored in negotiations with the Legislature, as it
has been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's budget also calls for other changes in school aid for
the city. It would scale back an agreement that the governor and
legislative leaders reached in 1997 that called for gradually
expanding pre-kindergarten classes and reducing classroom size over
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's budget calls for providing an additional $20
million for these programs in the coming year, bringing the amount
spent on them to $195 million. But Democrats and even some of the
governor's fellow Republicans say the 1997 agreement calls for
spending about $170 million more than what the governor has
proposed for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's budget stirred some protests, with critics saying
that it would do nothing to change the state's longstanding
practice of providing city students with less than their fair share
of aid, compared to students in other districts.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rebell, the executive director for the Campaign for
Fiscal Equality, a group that in a lawsuit had charged that the
state discriminated against poor urban districts like the city's,
said Pataki's budget represents more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget fails to take into account student wealth and
need,'' Rebell said. ``Rather than targeting more funds for
high-need districts, it leaves the current funding formula intact,
which is nothing more than a political manipulation of state
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's aides said that Pataki has tried to move the
city's share of state education financing closer to parity for the
last five years. More than that, though, the governor's budget
would provide the city with nearly 38 percent of the main form of
financing that the state provides to schools, they said. That
financing is known as formula aid and is distributed to all
districts for general operations. The aides also noted that New
York City has received a 35 percent increase in education money
over the last six years compared with 25 percent on average for the
rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's budget would also bring mixed results to school
districts on Long Island and in Westchester County. While some
districts would see overall increases, others would lose money. On
Long Island, slightly more than half of the school districts would
see decreases under the governor's proposals. In Westchester, the
school districts overall would receive $2.8 million additional,
barely 1 percent above current financing levels.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also used his budget to renew his battle with the
Board of Regents, the body charged with setting educational policy
in the state. Pataki has in the past called for abolishing the
board, whose members are chosen by the governor's Democratic rivals
in the Legislature. But this time, Pataki made a proposal in his
budget to give the governor the authority to make nominations to
the 16-member board, and those nominees would have to be approved
by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also proposed giving the governor power to name the
commissioner of education, without the approval of the Legislature.
The commissioner is now selected by the Regents. The governor is
also seeking to switch $250,000 of the financing for charter
schools from the Department of Education to an agency essentially
under his control. In 1998, Pataki pushed a bill through the
Legislature authorizing the creation of charter schools.

CONSERVATIVE FIDELITY FUND MANAGER RESIGNS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Vanderheiden, who managed several top-performing Fidelity
funds in the shadow of Peter Lynch during the 1980s but had
recently seen his track record suffer as his more conservative,
value-investing style fell out of favor, announced Wednesday that
he was quitting effective Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderheiden, 54, is manager of the $29 billion Fidelity Advisor
Growth Opportunities Fund and the $7 billion Fidelity Destiny I
fund, making him one of the most prominent managers at Fidelity
Investments in Boston, a unit of the FMR Corp.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the decision to leave was entirely his own and that
he would spend one day a week working as a part-time mentor for
analysts and managers at Fidelity. Otherwise, he said he planned to
spend time with his family, hiking and climbing mountains, and
managing his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderheiden's biggest fund, Advisor Growth Opportunities, will
pass to Bettina Doulton, who had been manager of two large Fidelity
funds, Puritan and Equity-Income II. The Destiny I fund will be
managed by Karen Firestone, who will continue to run Fidelity's
Large Cap Stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said those changes, particularly at the Destiny I fund,
could lead to a more aggressive, growth-oriented investing style.
Under Ms. Doulton, the Puritan fund ranked in the top 39 percent of
its peers for the three years ended in November, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago research firm, while Equity-Income II
ranked in the top fifth. Ms. Firestone, who took over Large Cap
Stock in April 1998, led it to a 30.2 percent return last year,
compared with 21 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say these other managers will be a little
more growth oriented than where George is now,'' said Robert C.
Pozen, who oversees all of Fidelity's funds.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderheiden's oldest fund, Destiny I, has returned 19.3 percent
annually since he took it over in December 1980, according to
Morningstar _ far ahead of the S&AMP;P's 16.8 percent annual return
over the same time. That makes Vanderheiden one of only a handful
of diversified fund managers to beat the index over such a long
period.
</P>
<P>
   But his funds have not done well lately and have lagged well
behind the S&AMP;P 500 last year as investors favored technology,
Internet and growth stocks. ``There's no question he's had a rotten
record'' lately, said Scott Cooley, a Morningstar analyst. ``But
I'd take that long-term record. It's unbelievably good.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lowell, editor of Fidelity Investor, an independent
newsletter that tracks Fidelity, said, ``Right through early 1995,
his career was stellar.'' But he said Vanderheiden had suffered by
not joining the ``momentum'' stock bandwagon. ``Hanging up his
spurs today probably signals that he is exhausted from banging his
head against that momentum wall,'' Lowell said &UR;  &LR; Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderheiden said he thought a value revival might be just
around the corner, noting that the end of other investing crazes _
the run-up in the Japanese stock market during the 1980s, the
biotechnology craze of 1991 and the rise of the Nifty 50 in 1972 _
all fizzled around the start of a new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've found over a lot of years is that a lot of these
manias seem to end at the end of the year,'' he said.

JETS' NEW OWNER DROPS IN FOR A CHAT WITH PARCELLS AND GUTMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also see FBN-COLUMN-JETS) 
(bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The New York Jets' new owner, Robert Wood
Johnson IV, took a look late Wednesday at part of what he bought
for $635 million.
</P>
<P>
   But he apparently did not get into the nitty-gritty of whether
Bill Parcells would return as head coach, or who would coach the
team next season if Parcells does not return. But Johnson has
reportedly told friends and associates that he wants Parcells and
is willing to pay for him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, associates of Johnson say he wanted to meet Parcells and
Gutman in a relaxed atmosphere before getting into a serious
discussion of the team's future _ especially Parcells'.
</P>
<P>
   No coach is likely to be named until at least Tuesday; that is
when the full ownership of the National Football League meets in
New York and is expected to formally approve Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson arrived at the Jets' training complex and spent about
two hours meeting Parcells and team president Steve Gutman.
</P>
<P>
   Al Groh, the linebackers coach and the apparent heir to the
coaching post if Parcells decides not to return, said he did not
meet Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in to work out, really, that's the reason I was here,''
Groh said. ``We never got a chance to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh said he had taken a brief vacation while speculation
swirled about who would be the next coach after last week's
stunning developments: Parcells stepped down after the Jets' final
game, named Bill Belichick as his replacement _ as his contract
called for _ then watched as Belichick quit the next day. In the
interim, the New England Patriots had asked to interview Belichick
for their coach's job.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has protested the validity of his Jets contract, and
he and his lawyer will meet Gutman on Thursday at the league
counsel's office in Times Square to argue whether the contract is
valid. If the Jets win, most people expect the Patriots to try to
make a deal for Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Groh would not comment about his status. One possibility, if
Parcells returns, would see Groh elevated to an assistant head
coach's post, be prepared to take over when Parcells finally does
step down.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Groh left, Johnson got into his car, too, without
stopping to comment. One of the several former policemen who work
as security officers for the Jets told a person inside the training
complex that three reporters and three photographers were waiting
at the main entrance. Johnson then was ushered into a car through a
previously locked rear gate and was driven away.
</P>
<P>
   But he was seen by some employees through the course of his
visit. One of them was Jim Pons, the Jets' director of football
video and a one-time member of the rock groups, the Turtles and the
Mothers of Invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was meeting my date's dad,'' said Pons.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the Jets' support staff hope to be retained by
Johnson. Several go back to the 1960s; a core of workers joined the
Jets in 1970s. They all were known to the late Leon Hess, the
paternal former owner who was almost always absent but whose rare
visits to a team practice turned into special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, the Jets merely said that Johnson met for
about two hours with Parcells and Gutman. It was described as a
get-acquainted meeting. Johnson also toured the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his hunger for Parcells, it is apparently Johnson's wish
to wait until early next week before formally announcing a new
coach. Johnson is reluctant to meet the news media or say anything
about the coaching situation until he is the owner, officially.
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows that if he can get Parcells to return, the
move would put an exclamation point on his ownership, and give him
immediate credibility in a field in which he is a novice.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a friend of Belichick's said he is prepared to sit
out a year if necessary. Also, the friend said, there were other
options for Belichick besides the Patriots _ such as the vacant
head coaching positions with the New Orleans Saints and the Dallas
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Belichick goes, he will probably take with him the
club's defensive assistant, Eric Mangini. Mangini worked on
ball-control drills, helped Belichick tutor the defensive backs and
also worked on film studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a tribute to Bill Belichick that a lot of his
former players have called him at home to see what is going on, and
to wish him well,'' the friend said. &QL;
