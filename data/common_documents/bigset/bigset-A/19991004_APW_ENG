<HEADLINE> Bush Aims To Change Local Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Building on his pledge to strip federal  
money from poor performing schools, George W. Bush said Monday that 
he would redefine the role of the federal government in education 
to ``essentially pass power back from Washington, D.C., to local 
jurisdictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate said he would encourage  
local governments to develop strong systems to ensure that schools 
are held accountable if their students are not learning. 
</P>
<P>
	He planned to detail his plan in New York City on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	In the first installment of his education package, Bush last  
month outlined plans to take federal funds from the worst-scoring 
schools and transfer the approximately $1,500 per pupil in federal 
funds to parents for use toward educational alternatives, such as 
private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we spend federal money and find children in failed  
schools, I will free the parents from failures, so that their 
children are not left behind,'' he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Touring upstate New York for the first time as a candidate, the  
Republican presidential front-runner said he was heartened by an 
outpouring of support, which began with a $250,000 boost to his $56 
million campaign treasury at a fund-raising breakfast in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush raised about $200,000 more at a $1,000-a-plate luncheon in  
Rochester, where he also visited a center for troubled teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for our young to hear that drugs will destroy  
you,'' he told the youngsters. ``It's important to make right 
choices in order to be able to access the American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush scheduled a third fund-raising event in Syracuse later in  
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent independent polls have shown Bush running close to Vice  
President Al Gore in New York and trailing former New Jersey 
Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've got a good chance here. It's a tough state, I'm  
under no illusions,'' he said. ``There's no question it's going to 
be a tough campaign here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Gov. George Pataki accompanied Bush throughout the day.  
The Texas governor deflected questions about Pataki's chances of 
making the GOP ticket as the vice presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little premature for someone who hasn't earned his  
party's nomination to be speculating on the vice presidency,'' Bush 
said. ``I've got a lot of work to do. George Pataki is a good 
friend. He has done a great job as the governor of New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said his goal for the country heading into the next century  
is ``prosperity with a purpose,'' possible by cutting taxes, 
reducing regulations and embracing free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must be prosperous to keep the peace,'' he said, promising  
to rebuild the military. ``This is still a world of madmen and 
missiles and terror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Prosperity isn't a given. Prosperity doesn't just happen,''  
Bush told about 200 supporters at the Buffalo breakfast. He charged 
that members of the current administration talk as if they invented 
prosperity. But they ``no more invented prosperity than they 
invented the Internet,'' he said in a swipe at Vice President Al 
Gore, who has said he helped create the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Clinton drove President Bush, the Texas governor's father,  
from office in 1992 in part by stressing the nation's economic 
downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also said he would encourage people to get involved in  
mentoring and drug programs as a step toward welfare reform, later 
elaborating on the theme during a stop at Mount Olive Baptist 
Church in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government can hand out money but it cannot put hope in  
their hearts or a sense of purpose in their lives,'' he said. 
``This is found in churches, synagogues and charities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In head-to-head matchups, a Zogby International poll released  
Monday showed Gore and Bush in a dead heat. Bradley had a slight 
lead over Bush.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Teacher Drug-Testing Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let Knox County,  
Tenn., school officials require drug testing of everyone offered a 
teaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away a teachers group's  
argument that such tests are unconstitutional if officials do not 
suspect the tested individual of using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug-testing program adopted in 1994 by the Knox County  
Board of Education requires everyone offered a job considered 
``safety sensitive'' to undergo urinalysis drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs considered safety sensitive include teachers, principals  
and assistant principals, teacher aides, school secretaries and bus 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy was challenged in federal court by the Knox County  
Education Association, an organization of teachers, principals and 
other professional school employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out the suspicionless testing requirement  
after finding that there was no documented evidence of a drug abuse 
problem among teachers and that teaching is not heavily regulated 
for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling last  
year. The appeals court said that even without evidence of a drug 
problem among teachers, drug testing is justified by the ``unique 
role'' teachers play in school children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers and principals are ``front-line observers in providing  
for a safe school environment,'' the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	In past rulings, the Supreme Court has said the government can  
allow drug testing of customs agents and railroad employees 
involved in serious accidents. The justices also have let public 
schools require student athletes to undergo drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1997, the justices ruled that states cannot force  
political candidates to take drug tests merely to demonstrate the 
government's commitment to the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the teachers group's lawyers said  
the drug testing at issue was so broad that taking cough syrup 
could lead to a positive result. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspicionless drug testing must be shown to be ``an effective  
and credible means of addressing a real and urgent need, rather 
than merely a symbolic step,'' the appeal contended. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board's lawyers urged the court to reject the appeal,  
saying evidence of drug use by teachers is not necessary to justify 
a drug-testing plan. Teachers must stay alert to ensure student 
safety, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Knox County Education Association vs. Knox County  
Board of Education, 98-1799.

<HEADLINE>  Indian Kashmir Has Voting Disrupted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANANTNAG, India (AP) -- Making good their threat to disrupt polls  
in Kashmir, separatist militants triggered four explosions during 
voting today, injuring 18 security force personnel and two polling 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine police officers were injured when rebels fired a rocket at  
a polling center in Pulwama, 20 miles south of the regional 
capital, Srinagar, an hour before polls opened this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Frightened residents did not venture out of their homes until  
several hours later, and then only a trickle came to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more explosions in nearby areas injured nine other police  
and two polling agents who were supervising voting. Another 
explosion near a polling booth damaged it, but injured no one. 
</P>
<P>
	The monthlong general elections ended for most of the country on  
Sunday, and major exit polls declared that the coalition of Prime 
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee would return to power with a stable 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	But the vote had been postponed in Anantnag because the local  
candidate of Vajpayee's party was assassinated a week before the 
original Sept. 18 polling day. 
</P>
<P>
	Separatist militants have successfully called general strikes  
and poll boycotts on each day that Kashmir has been scheduled to 
vote for a new Indian national parliament. The rebels say elections 
do not give them the right of self determination that is their key 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of separatist groups have been fighting for a decade for  
Kashmir's independence or merger with neighboring Pakistan. More 
than 25,000 people have been killed since the fighting began in 
1989 in India's only Muslim majority region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thousands of people have shed their blood for the freedom  
struggle. We don't want their sacrifice to go in vain so I didn't 
vote,'' said Ghulam Ahmad Tantaray, 60, a farmer harvesting his 
rice crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting also took place today in nine constituencies in the  
eastern state of Bihar, in areas where flooding had postponed the 
scheduled balloting, or vote rigging had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	Repolling or delayed voting is also scheduled in some states on  
Tuesday, Wednesday and Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen candidates were seeking local or national office in the  
Anantnag district and 994 polling booths were set up to serve 
800,000 eligible voters. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the polls were empty, with election workers sitting  
idly as the violence and the boycott call kept most voters indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers, reservists and special police patrolled the deserted  
roads, stood guard at empty crossroads in the towns and set up 
machine-gun positions in rice fields, where the crops harvested on 
Sunday lay piled in the paddies.

<HEADLINE> Hatch: McCain Bill Would Hurt GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch said Monday that a  
campaign finance reform effort by fellow Republican senator and 
rival presidential candidate John McCain would starve the GOP of 
money for elections. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill by McCain that is pending in Congress would ban the  
unlimited ``soft money'' contributions that corporations and other 
organizations make to political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the money we use to get out the vote,'' Hatch, of Utah,  
told about 40 people at the Commonwealth Club of California. 
``Literally, it would be the disarmament -- the unilateral 
disarmament -- of the Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed the bill would allow traditionally liberal interests  
such as labor unions and environmental groups to send unlimited 
sums of money to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the bill would ban union, corporate and individual  
``soft money'' donations to political parties. Independent 
expenditures by unions or corporations for such things as political 
advertisements would be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no consensus on which party would suffer more under the  
bill by McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. McCain says 
it would hurt Democratic fund-raising efforts at least as much as 
the GOP's, because both parties get roughly the same proportion of 
corporate contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch also argued that the bill would restrict ``legitimate''  
First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he asked listeners to envision a president  
``who really doesn't owe anybody anything,'' because he hasn't been 
influenced by campaign donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch has raised more than $1 million this year, but the figure  
is dwarfed by the more than $56 million collected by GOP 
presidential front-runner George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch also said he would support efforts to limit the influence  
of political donations by requiring daily disclosure on the 
Internet of all such contributions.

<HEADLINE> Astros Have More Time at Astrodome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The building that brought the world AstroTurf  
will have at least one more baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as the Houston Astros earned themselves one more game  
at the Astrodome with a 9-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on 
Sunday, the team and the fans still said goodbye to the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros finished their 35th and final season inside the dome  
in front of Nolan Ryan and other team greats by clinching their 
third straight NL Central title and a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll play either the Cincinnati Reds or the New York Mets for  
the first two games of a best-of-5 series, and then return to the 
Dome for Game 3 on Friday and a fourth game later, if necessary. 
The Mets were scheduled to play the Reds today at Cinergy Field to 
determine the NL wild-card winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's crucial game was sandwiched between celebrations  
honoring the more than three decades of indoor Astros baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Astros manager Larry Dierker, an 18-year-old rising prospect  
with Houston when the stadium opened, threw out the ceremonial 
first pitch to thunderous applause from 52,033 fans. Sunday's 
attendance made it five straight with 50,000 fans or more, a club 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Immediately afterward, I don't think it hits you. But as the  
evening progresses, I think it rose on you,'' Dierker said. ``I 
wouldn't be surprised if I don't shed a tear before the night is 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Country singer Charley Pride delivered a low-key rendition of  
``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' and then the Astros turned to the 
business of keeping their season -- and baseball in the Astrodome -- 
alive for another day. The Astros coasted to the victory, but there 
was still suspense in the last inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Powell withstood hundreds of flashbulbs through two batters  
as he tried to get the final out. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans rose to their feet as Mark Grudzielanek stepped to the  
plate, but he singled to score Dave Hansen and make it 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
	With the count 3-2, Powell struck out Raul Mondesi, closing the  
last regular-season game at the Astrodome under a shower of red, 
white and blue confetti. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was teary-eyed when it was over because I loved this  
place,'' said Michelle Christopher, who said she has been to dozens 
of Astros games and even the bizarre bloodless bullfights held at 
the Astrodome on Feb. 4, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the crowd stayed for postgame ceremonies, which Craig  
Biggio started early with a tradition from the world of auto 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Biggio, a large cigar clenched in his teeth, and winning pitcher  
Mike Hampton rode a victory lap atop a Harley-Davidson. Soon, the 
entire sweat-drenched team ran a victory lap on foot and traded 
high-fives with fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This being the last regular season game here made it all  
pretty sweet. The fans were awesome,'' Biggio said. ``The people 
here in the Dome deserve this one too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Astros announcer Gene Elston introduced the opening day  
roster from 1965, the year the Astrodome opened, and then some 
three dozen former and present Astros players voted by fans to the 
all-time Astros team took the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, a Hall of Famer who pitched his fifth career no-hitter in  
the Astrodome, drew the biggest applause as he was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the squad was Mike Scott, who on Sept. 25, 1986, pitched  
the only no-hitter ever to decide a division title. Powered by 
Scott's pitching, the Astros captured the NL West with a 2-0 
victory over the San Francisco Giants on that date. 
</P>
<P>
	Fan favorite Jose Cruz, now a first base coach for the Astros,  
drew what sounded like boos as fans greeted him with ``Cruuuz.'' 
Current stars Biggio and Jeff Bagwell also were announced as part 
of the all-time team. 
</P>
<P>
	To close the night, country star Willie Nelson sang, ``Turn Out  
the Lights, the Party's Over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the famed exploding scoreboard has been gone for 11 years  
-- removed to make way for 10,000 extra seats at the request of the 
since-departed NFL Houston Oilers -- the massive ``Diamond Vision'' 
TV screens played a facsimile of the original scoreboard's salute 
to home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive bull snorted fire from his nostrils and the cowboy  
shot his six-gun one last time.

<HEADLINE>  Johnson Seeks End to Playoff Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Great pitching, little support. Randy Johnson's  
postseason experiences are a lot like his season with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	His major league-record five consecutive playoff losses, like  
his 17-9 record this year, hardly reflect how well he has pitched. 
So Johnson sees no need to defend himself as he prepares to pitch 
in Arizona's opener Tuesday night against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the postseason, I've pitched pretty well,''  
Johnson said Monday. ``It's not like I've been a total flop. People 
just look at the numbers and they want wins, and that's all I want. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than probably anybody in the clubhouse on the day I  
pitch, that's all I want to do is win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until New York beat Cincinnati 5-0 in the wild card playoff game  
Monday night, the Diamondbacks didn't know whether they'd be facing 
the Mets or Houston. Arizona won seven of nine against New York, 
but Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter downplayed the 
regular-season record. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're as talented a club as there is in our league,''  
Showalter said. ``They've got great depth. It's a well put-together 
club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson pitched against the Mets once, a 10-1 victory that  
capped a three-game sweep in New York May 30, part of a slump that 
led to the firing of three of manager Bobby Valentine's coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is 2-5 in postseason play with a 3.10 ERA. Last year,  
when he was traded to Houston from Seattle in midseason, he was 
looked upon as the pennant-clincher for the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was 0-2 against San Diego in the first round. In the  
series opener, he gave up two runs in eight innings but lost 2-1 to 
the Padres' Kevin Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot is riding on that first game,'' Johnson said. ``I can  
only go out and pitch as good as I can pitch. I've lost some close 
games. I feel I pitched extremely well last year in Game 1 and we 
lost. Did I choke? I don't think I did. I tip my hat to Kevin 
Brown. He pitched better than I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One more loss would give Johnson sole possession of a postseason  
record he surely doesn't want. Right now, his five straight losses 
ties the mark set by Joe Bush from 1914-23 and tied by Doyle 
Alexander from 1972-87. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is as ready as he could be to try to end that streak. He  
is coming off a season in which he struck out a career-best 364, 
fourth-most in baseball history. He pitched a career-high 271 2-3 
innings and led the NL with a 2.48 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm coming off the best year of my career and I want to  
take that into the postseason and be extremely focused,'' Johnson 
said. ``Much like the regular season, I'll lay it all on the 
line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter remembers Johnson's playoff successes well. With  
Seattle, Johnson beat Showalter's New York Yankees twice, once as a 
starter and once as a reliever, in the first round of the 1995 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot better having him on your side,'' Showalter said,  
``but it's not a prerequisite for success. Randy has been a losing 
pitcher sometimes this year, and just about all of them 
undeservingly. This time of year you're facing some real good 
competition.''

<HEADLINE>  Johnson Seeks End to Playoff Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Great pitching, little support. Randy Johnson's  
postseason experiences are a lot like his season with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	His major league-record five consecutive playoff losses, like  
his 17-9 record this year, hardly reflect how well he has pitched. 
So Johnson sees no need to defend himself as he prepares to pitch 
in Arizona's opener Tuesday night against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the postseason, I've pitched pretty well,''  
Johnson said Monday. ``It's not like I've been a total flop. People 
just look at the numbers and they want wins, and that's all I want. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than probably anybody in the clubhouse on the day I  
pitch, that's all I want to do is win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until New York beat Cincinnati 5-0 in the wild card playoff game  
Monday night, the Diamondbacks didn't know whether they'd be facing 
the Mets or Houston. Arizona won seven of nine against New York, 
but Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter downplayed the 
regular-season record. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're as talented a club as there is in our league,''  
Showalter said. ``They've got great depth. It's a well put-together 
club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson pitched against the Mets once, a 10-1 victory that  
capped a three-game sweep in New York May 30, part of a slump that 
led to the firing of three of manager Bobby Valentine's coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is 2-5 in postseason play with a 3.10 ERA. Last year,  
when he was traded to Houston from Seattle in midseason, he was 
looked upon as the pennant-clincher for the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was 0-2 against San Diego in the first round. In the  
series opener, he gave up two runs in eight innings but lost 2-1 to 
the Padres' Kevin Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot is riding on that first game,'' Johnson said. ``I can  
only go out and pitch as good as I can pitch. I've lost some close 
games. I feel I pitched extremely well last year in Game 1 and we 
lost. Did I choke? I don't think I did. I tip my hat to Kevin 
Brown. He pitched better than I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One more loss would give Johnson sole possession of a postseason  
record he surely doesn't want. Right now, his five straight losses 
ties the mark set by Joe Bush from 1914-23 and tied by Doyle 
Alexander from 1972-87. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is as ready as he could be to try to end that streak. He  
is coming off a season in which he struck out a career-best 364, 
fourth-most in baseball history. He pitched a career-high 271 2-3 
innings and led the NL with a 2.48 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm coming off the best year of my career and I want to  
take that into the postseason and be extremely focused,'' Johnson 
said. ``Much like the regular season, I'll lay it all on the 
line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter remembers Johnson's playoff successes well. With  
Seattle, Johnson beat Showalter's New York Yankees twice, once as a 
starter and once as a reliever, in the first round of the 1995 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot better having him on your side,'' Showalter said,  
``but it's not a prerequisite for success. Randy has been a losing 
pitcher sometimes this year, and just about all of them 
undeservingly. This time of year you're facing some real good 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks have to avoid the kind of offensive slumps that  
often have plagued them with Johnson on the mound. In one 
incredible four-game stretch when Johnson was at his best, Arizona 
failed to score a single run. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to win this series, we're going to have to get  
guys in from third base with less than two outs,'' Matt Williams 
said. ``We're going to have to limit our mistakes as much as we 
can, take advantage of the mistakes the other team makes and we're 
going to have to pitch well.''

<HEADLINE> Overall Auto Sales Up, Ford Slides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Consumers snapped up cars, trucks, minivans and  
sport utility vehicles at a blistering pace last month, pushing the 
auto industry one step closer to a record year for sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers sold about 1.4 million cars and light trucks in the  
United States last month, an increase of about 9.5 percent over 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	With a good economy and high customer rebates, industry analysts  
expect 1999 to easily break the record for yearly sales of 16.1 
million set in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. was the exception; Ford sales were off 2 percent  
last month. The No. 2 automaker said Monday that sales of its Ford, 
Lincoln and Mercury cars were down 5 percent, mostly because of 
fewer sales to rental and business fleets. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three car models -- the Ford Mustang, the Ford Crown  
Victoria and the Mercury Grand Marquis -- posted year-to-year sales 
increases. While the Lincoln LS sedan and Navigator sport utility 
vehicle sold well, other Lincoln models had steep declines, leading 
to a 6.5 percent drop for the brand. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucks sales were off less than 1 percent, a decline the company  
said was due in part to switching some production from Ranger 
pickups to new models of the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle. 
For the year, Ford's sales are up 5 percent, excluding Jaguar and 
Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Richard Hilgert of Fahnestock &AMP; Co. said Ford also  
picked up several truck buyers in 1998 who might have otherwise 
bought from General Motors Corp. At the time, GM was still 
recovering from a strike that shut down most production, and was 
beginning production on new truck models. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilgert also said there was a good reason behind Ford's decline  
in car sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall mix of what was sold will be beneficial,'' he  
said. ``When you reduce fleet sales, you increase the share of 
profitable retail customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the month, Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler saw sales increase 4  
percent. GM said its sales were up 8.5 percent, with a 30 percent 
gain in light truck sales offsetting a 7 percent decline in 
passenger cars. DaimlerChrysler AG said sales at its Chrysler 
division were up 7 percent, with a 5 percent gain in cars and an 
8.5 percent gain in trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an even better September for foreign makes: Asian  
automakers were up 20 percent, and European brands were up 36 
percent. BMW said Monday its sales set new highs for the month and 
year so far, up 20 percent for September and 19 percent for the 
year.

<HEADLINE> High Court Looks at Campaign Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a campaign-finance dispute of potentially  
enormous importance for the 2000 elections and beyond, the Supreme 
Court is taking a new look at the strict limits imposed after the 
Watergate scandal on contributions in federal elections. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing arguments today, the justices must decide the  
constitutionality of Missouri's contribution limits for its state 
races. Lurking in the background is what the court might say about 
limits in other states and in federal campaigns. A ruling is 
expected by late June. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Missouri limits were struck down as free-speech  
violations, the court's decision -- if grounded in the 
Constitution's First Amendment -- likely would affect campaign 
finance outside Missouri as well. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision that significantly altered campaign-finance law by  
striking down or vastly increasing the limits conceivably could 
cause serious confusion for the 2000 election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	In a landmark 1976 decision, in a case called Buckley vs. Valeo,  
the court said free-speech rights trump any attempt to limit an 
individual candidate's spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But that decision drew a distinction between expenditures, which  
cannot be capped, and contributions, for which it upheld a $1,000 
limit for federal elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The court back then was ruling on a federal law enacted after  
the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s. At issue in the Missouri 
case is a 1994 law that imposed the same $1,000 limits on 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been unclear since the court granted review to an appeal  
filed by Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon last January just what 
the justices want to focus on. They chose not to tackle a related 
case that challenged the 1976 decision more directly. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court struck down Missouri's restrictions last  
year, ruling that limits that might have made sense in 1976 have 
been too eroded by inflation to withstand a new challenge. The 8th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also said Missouri had not proved 
larger donations had corrupted state elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The Missouri limits had been adjusted to $1,075 but the appeals  
court's ruling left the state with no limits on contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices have received plenty of unsolicited advice from  
friend-of-the-court briefs urging a broad range of action, from 
striking down all contribution limits to imposing new strict limits 
on spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the court has come under growing criticism in scholarly  
journals for ever equating campaign spending with political speech. 
</P>
<P>
	James Bopp, representing a coalition of conservative groups such  
as the National Right to Life PAC and the National Rifle 
Association Political Victory Fund, called for removing all 
contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri officials must prove ``that corruption exists or that  
the electorate has a reasonable perception of ... corruption,'' 
Bopp said. ``They can do neither.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the spectrum, Derek Cressman of the U.S.  
Public Interest Research Group said, ``It's time for the court to 
reconsider Buckley and recognize that the First Amendment was not 
intended to give a few fat cats the right to drown out the voices 
of ordinary Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 98-963.

<HEADLINE> Man Suggests His Own Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- A drifter who murdered a third-grade boy in  
a beach restroom told jurors Monday he would kill again if given 
the chance and recommended they sentence him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole purpose in life is to help destroy your society,''  
Brandon H. Wilson told the jury. The 21-year old man spoke against 
the advice of his lawyer as jurors decide between life in prison 
without parole and execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Cecchi was killed on Nov. 14 during a family reunion at  
Oceanside Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson admitted he crept up behind the 9-year-old boy in the  
restroom, slashed his throat and stabbed him five times in the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	In a calm, deliberate voice, Wilson told jurors he felt no  
remorse. ``I would do it again in a second if I had the chance,'' 
he said as the boy's mother, Sharon Cecchi, gasped from her 
front-row courtroom seat. ``Execute me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense had argued that Wilson, from St. Croix Falls, Wis.,  
is a delusional manic-depressive who believed God chose him as ``an 
agent for destruction of mankind.'' Wilson said he was inspired to 
act after using LSD. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution cited Wilson's videotaped confession two days  
after the slaying in which he made no mention of hearing God but 
said he killed for the thrill of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors deliberated less than six hours last week before  
rejecting Wilson's insanity claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, the jury also heard tearful recollections of the boy by  
his mother, an uncle and the boy's teacher. Matthew wanted to be an 
engineer, cartoonist or architect, liked to play baseball and ride 
his bike, and wrote stories about aliens, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two jurors cried when teacher Deborah Peck described trying to  
explain the boy's death to his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Third-graders always ask why and that was a question I had no  
answer for,'' she said.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A high school assistant principal was shot  
in the thigh Monday while confronting a 17-year-old student 
suspected of carrying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	William Burke, 61, was hospitalized but was not badly hurt in  
the shooting at John Bartram High School in southwest Philadelphia, 
a racially mixed, blue-collar part of town. 
</P>
<P>
	Metal detectors had been delivered recently to the 3,100-student  
school but were not yet in operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said that a teacher suspected the student had a gun and  
called Burke. Burke told the boy to leave class and go into the 
hallway, where the two began struggling, police said. A gun in the 
boy's pocket went off, Police Commissioner John Timoney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The student fled and was caught by police a block away. The  
student, whose name was not released because he is a minor, was 
charged with simple and aggravated assault, possession of an 
instrument of cime and related offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen city schools are scheduled to begin using detectors in  
the next few weeks.

<HEADLINE>  Russians, Chechens Clash in Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian soldiers and Chechen fighters  
clashed in one village, and several Chechen towns were hit by 
airstrikes and artillery fire as the conflict spread deeper into 
the rebellious territory, military officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian forces entered Chechnya last week and have been  
advancing into the renegade republic to establish a security zone. 
At least four regions in eastern Chechnya were hit by rocket fire 
and two regions in central Chechnya were bombed over the past 24 
hours, the territory's deputy prime minister, Kazbek Makhashev, 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will destroy militants with all means at our disposal,''  
said Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, a senior Russian commander in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	In a clash Sunday in the northeastern village of Dubovskaya, two  
Russian soldiers were killed and eight were wounded, Russian 
officials said. The Chechens also claimed to have captured three 
Russian soldiers, Chechen military sources told the Interfax news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Russian troop strength building, the Chechen fighters  
have been fortifying strongholds in an attempt to hold back the 
Russians, who have much greater fire power. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia says its aim is to establish a security cordon along the  
borders of Chechnya, though the military buildup has raised fears 
that there could be a repeat of the 1994-96 war in Chechnya that 
left tens of thousands dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chechnya will not give up a single square meter of land,''  
Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov told a news conference Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore order to Chechnya  
since winning election as president in 1997, said the Russian 
military action made it virtually impossible to disarm militants. 
</P>
<P>
	``When an ax hangs over Chechnya, I cannot disarm people,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military claims it is targeting only suspected  
guerrilla bases and support facilities. But Maskhadov said more 
than 400 civilians have been killed and more than 1,000 have been 
injured in the air raids. He also said the territory's feeble 
economy has been further damaged, with hospitals, brick plants, oil 
refineries and an oil pipeline all hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have moved into Chechnya with caution, unlike five  
years ago, when they stormed into the territory in an attempt to 
crush the Chechen separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have taken up positions outside two villages in  
eastern Chechnya, and are negotiating with village elders, said 
military spokesman Lt. Col. Andre Matveenko. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chechen elders are trying to prevent an attack on the  
villages, Kargalinskaya and Borozdonovskaya, but the Russians want 
all suspected rebels to surrender and then they plan to make a 
house-to-house search. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees continued to stream out of Chechnya, with the total  
approaching 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin today announced the  
establishment of a government commission to deal with the refugee 
problem. Putin made the announcement after meeting with President 
Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin, but gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Chechen refugees headed west, overwhelming the  
impoverished republic of Ingushetia, which had only 300,000 
residents prior to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other international  
aid groups have been pitching in to provide food and shelter for 
the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia began its raids on Chechnya after Muslim militants  
invaded neighboring Dagestan in August and September, seeking to 
create an Islamic state in southern Russia. The militants have also 
been blamed for bombings in Russia last month that killed about 300 
people.

<HEADLINE> Bills Lead Dolphins 13-9 at Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Linebacker John Holecek forced Dan Marino to fumble  
and Gabe Northern returned it 59 yards for the game's first 
touchdown, giving the Buffalo Bills a 13-9 lead over the Miami 
Dolphins at halftime Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	After forcing Buffalo to punt from its own end zone, the  
Dolphins took over at the Bills' 40-yard line. But on third-and-4, 
Holecek hit Marino from the blind side, the first time he was 
sacked this season, forcing the fumble. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern scooped it up, broke one tackle, then rambled untouched  
for the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino was 14-of-25 for 181 yards in the half and Olindo Mare  
kicked three field goals, including one on the final play of the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, running the Dolphins 2-minute offense, connected with  
Oronde Gadsden for a 36-yard gain. He hit four of his next five 
passes to set up Mare's third field goal, a 26-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadsden caught three passes for 46 yards, and O.J. McDuffie  
added four receptions in the half for 46 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo got on the scoreboard first, driving 51 yards to the  
Miami 9 to set up a 26-yard field goal by Steve Christie. Though 
the Dolphins punted on their first two possessions, they used a 
turnover, the first of the game, to even the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie fumbled a snap, and safety Shawn  
Wooden recovered it on the Bills' 41. Miami drove 28 yards, most of 
which came on the ensuing play when Marino hit fullback Rob Konrad 
for a 25-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Mare's 30-yard field goal tied the game.  
</P>
<P>
	After a seven play, 35-yard drive, Mare hit a 44-yarder to give  
the Dolphins their first lead of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie was 3-of-7 for 71 yards in the first quarter, but missed  
on all five passes in the second quarter. He added a 17-yard 
scramble. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills entered the game with a 2-1 record. The Dolphins were  
2-0.

<P>
	``It's a sparkling jewel once again,'' said Bob Russo, chairman  
of the restoration committee and general manager of Madison Square 
Garden, whose parent company Cablevision has a 25-year lease on the 
building and owns Radio City Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	The $70 million, seven-month restoration project was to be  
unveiled tonight at a benefit for the Lustgarten Foundation for 
Pancreatic Cancer. The event, which was to feature Billy Crystal, 
Ann-Margret, Sting, Tony Bennett, Ann Miller and Raquel Welch, will 
be aired on NBC on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first major renovation of the building since it opened  
Dec. 27, 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers replaced all six miles of the faded neon lights on the  
hall's famous marquee, rewired 1,500 chandeliers and re-insulated 
walls to improve the acoustics. All 5,901 seats were reupholstered. 
</P>
<P>
	Once considered the largest indoor theater and most modern  
structure of its time, the hall aged badly. Burnt out ceiling 
lights went unchanged, antiques were placed in storage rather than 
repaired, carpets and seats became shabby. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, the once grand lady of performance halls -- in debt  
and losing audiences with its tired formula of family movies and a 
stage show -- was nearly demolished. Saved by the wrecking ball 
after the city declared it an architectural landmark in 1979, a new 
management team was brought in and the hall slowly rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, nearly 2 million people visited Radio City.  
</P>
<P>
	The most Herculean effort in the restoration came in restoring  
the hall's artwork, which includes the 60-by-40 foot ``Fountain of 
Youth'' mural painted by Ezra Winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Russo said, the work got darker as layers of  
smoke and grime built up. It was made worse when someone decided to 
coat the artwork with polyurethane, sealing in the dirt and turning 
the painting yellow. 
</P>
<P>
	Art experts, using Q-tips, tiny scalpels and cotton squares  
restored the mural that graces the staircase leading to the 
mezzanine. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Collins, dance captain of the hall's signature Rockettes,  
said the sight of the restored theater moved her to tears. ``When I 
saw the theater, I felt like crying; especially when I thought of 
what almost was.''

<HEADLINE> Rider a No-Show for Hawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Isaiah Rider got off to shaky start with his new  
team Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider added to his extensive resume of malfeasance when he  
failed to show up for a mandatory media gathering with the Atlanta 
Hawks, casting doubt on whether he would be on time for the first 
practice of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed but I'm not surprised,'' said Hawks general  
manager Pete Babcock, who knew he was taking a serious risk when he 
traded Steve Smith to Portland as part of a four-player deal that 
included Rider. 
</P>
<P>
	Babcock spent the weekend trying to track down Rider, who lives  
in Oakland, Calif. Finally, about 2 p.m. Monday, someone from agent 
Arn Tellem's office called to say Rider had missed a couple of 
flights and would attempt to catch one in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went into this with our eyes wide open,'' Babcock said.  
``He has a track record of these sort of things happening. We hope 
by the end of the season they will happening less frequently or not 
at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider will be fined, but Babcock wouldn't reveal the amount. The  
player was expected to miss a team dinner Monday night and the 
two-hour bus ride to Chattanooga, Tenn., where training camp begins 
with a Tuesday morning practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unacceptable, but I'm not making a bigger issue or a  
smaller issue out of it than I would with any other player,'' 
Babcock said. ``He'll suffer the consequences for his actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tellem's office said Monday he was traveling and unavailable.  
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Rider has averaged 18 points per game during his  
six-year career, showing the ability to dominate at the offensive 
end and thrive in an up-tempo offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks decided he was just the kind of player they needed to  
improve their speed, quickness and creativity after ranking as the 
second worst offensive team in the NBA last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of the Rider's background provided serious cause  
for concern. He showed up late for his first pro practice with 
Minnesota in 1993 and has run afoul of either the law or the NBA 
every year since. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider has feuded with coaches. He has missed flights and  
practices. He has been suspended by the league and convicted in 
court of various offenses, including marijuana possession, assault 
and illegal possession of cellular phones. He even spent four days 
in jail for probation violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before Babcock learned that Rider was not showing up,  
Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens talked optimistically about his 
relationship with the player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I concern myself with what happens from today on,'' Wilkens  
said. ``I'm not going to get caught up in last year or the year 
before. We had a talk and I told him what I expect and the 
parameters here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, Wilkens learned that Rider already had run  
afoul of those parameters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to wait and see,'' Wilkens said. ``I have no  
comment on this. I'm finding out at the same time you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider was acquired from the Blazers along with fellow shooting  
guard Jim Jackson, who did show up for the media gathering and 
plans to compete with his wayward teammate for a starting role. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the circumstances,'' Jackson said. ``That's  
something J.R. (Rider's nickname) and management will have to work 
out. I'm here and I'm ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After getting swept by the New York Knicks in the second round  
of the playoffs, the Hawks underwent a major shakeup during the 
offseason. They could have as many as seven new players, which made 
Rider's absence even more disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say I'm disappointed,'' said guard Bimbo  
Coles, another new Hawk. ``The thing that worries me is we need to 
work on our chemistry and come together as a team. We need everyone 
here and he's a big part of our team.''

<HEADLINE> Cox Is Key To Braves Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves have won eight straight  
division titles during the 1990s. Yet, manager Bobby Cox has been 
recognized only once for his contribution to that unprecedented 
postseason run. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox remains in the shadows for the most part, recognized  
primarily for the tirades that caused him to get ejected from 10 
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	His only NL Manager of the Year award came in 1991, when he  
turned around what had been a last-place team and took it to the 
seventh game of the World Series. Since then, Cox has been viewed 
as a push-button manager who does nothing more than fill out the 
lineup card. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, that perception changed. The Braves lost five  
players to season-ending ailments and injuries, including top 
hitter Andres Galarraga, closer Kerry Ligtenberg and All-Star 
catcher Javy Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	With Cox patching things together, the Braves won a major  
league-best 103 games and another NL East title. They will open the 
division playoffs Tuesday against Central champion Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	New York earned the wild card with a 5-0 victory over Cincinnati  
on Monday night. The Mets will meet West champ Arizona in the other 
division series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack McKeon has done a great job,'' pitcher Kevin Millwood  
said, referring to the Reds manager. ``But as far as I'm concerned, 
nobody in baseball has done as good a job as Bobby Cox has done 
with this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox refuses to campaign for the Manager of the Year award.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't thing about personal goals,'' he said. ``Don't get me  
wrong, I'd be honored to get it. But it's not something I think 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the Braves were criticized for being too  
businesslike, not showing enough emotion. This season, that 
Cox-inspired mentality served them well. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't really say his managing style brings attention to  
itself,'' said pitcher Terry Mulholland, acquired in a midseason 
trade. ``To be honest, there's not a whole lot of style to this 
team. When they win, they don't make a big deal about it. That's 
why they're such consistent winners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As one player after another went down, Cox never changed his  
demeanor. He might have been troubled on the inside, but he never 
let that come across to his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby didn't panic,'' pitcher Kevin Millwood said. ``We just  
went about our business the way we always have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In every meeting, Cox stressed that the Braves still had enough  
healthy players to get back to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times, you can look at somebody and tell they're just  
saying that,'' Millwood said. ``When he says that, you can tell 
that's the way he feels. He really means it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves says it's unfair to dismiss Cox's managerial skills  
just because he usually has a roster filled with star players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think those kind of managers deserve credit,'' MVP candidate  
Chipper Jones said. ``The more talent you have, the more egos you 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox's major rules are simple: Show up on time and be ready to  
play. He also frowns on music and cells phones in the clubhouse, 
and doesn't allow his players to wear earrings. 
</P>
<P>
	But, at age 58, he's also demonstrated a willingness to bend  
with the times. Cox reached a compromise after the Braves signed 
free agent Brian Jordan: give up the earring but keep the goatee, 
leading to an epidemic of facial hair in a clubhouse once filled 
with smooth faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has certain rules he asks you to follow,'' Jordan said.  
``It's not that hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox also has forged a sense of trust with his players, rarely  
saying a discouraging word in public but maintaining a grip behind 
the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's as much a friend and a comrade as he is a manager,''  
Jones said. ``Players like to have a relationship with their 
manager where they can talk openly, joke around. But when you get 
on the field, you've got to respect him as a manager. Bobby has a 
way of walking that fine line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a good thing others will talk about Cox's importance to the  
Braves. He is noticeably uncomfortable when discussing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, I'm just doing my job,'' he said. ``I let everything  
else fall where it may.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Braves settled on their 25-man roster Monday, deciding  
to keep three catchers and only nine pitchers. Little-used catcher 
Jorge Fabregas made the cut while .317 hitter Randall Simon and LHP 
Bruce Chen were left off. Both Simon and Chen will travel with the 
team and Cox said he could alter his roster if the Braves advance 
to the NL championship series. ... Some 10,000 tickets remained for 
each of Tuesday and Wednesday's games at Turner Field, virtually 
assuring neither will be a sellout.

<HEADLINE> Sheppard's Remains To Be Exhumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Two years ago, the body of Dr. Sam Sheppard was  
exhumed in the long battle to determine who killed his wife in 
1954, a crime that stunned the nation and helped inspire ``The 
Fugitive'' television series and movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Now authorities have arrived for her remains.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors trying to show that Sheppard was the killer planned  
to exhume his wife's body today to examine her and get a ``clean 
DNA profile.'' They also plan to exhume the fetus she was carrying 
when she died. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhumations are being done as part of the state's effort to  
defend itself against a lawsuit by the couple's son, Sam Reese 
Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard contends his father was wrongfully imprisoned for his  
mother's death. The doctor was imprisoned for 10 years before being 
acquitted at a retrial. He died in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Sheppard is suing the state to have his father  
declared innocent, a stronger legal statement than the ``not 
guilty'' verdict at his second criminal trial. Sheppard could 
collect an estimated $2 million if he wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard, 52, has criticized the exhumation as a stalling tactic  
by prosecutors to delay the trial, scheduled to begin Jan. 31, but 
decided against mounting a legal challenge to the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	He had his father's body exhumed in 1997 to collect DNA samples.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sheppard was beaten to death in her second-floor bedroom at  
the family's home on Lake Erie. Her husband, who had been napping 
on the first floor, maintained that a bushy-haired intruder killed 
his wife and then knocked him unconscious when he heard her screams 
and ran to help. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Sheppard and his lawyers contend DNA and other  
evidence point to a family window-washer, Richard Eberling, as the 
killer. Eberling died last year in prison, where he was serving a 
life sentence for an unrelated murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend DNA samples used by Sheppard's investigators  
are contaminated. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William Mason has said 
the exhumation is ``to get a clean DNA profile of Marilyn 
Sheppard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for the examination is to check the accuracy of  
testimony that helped acquit Sheppard at his second trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sheppard's wounds will be examined to try and determine  
whether the killer was right-handed or left-handed, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sheppard was right-handed but forensic scientist Paul Leland  
Kirk, a defense witness at the second trial, said blood spatter 
evidence indicated the killer was left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	A forensic dentist also will examine Mrs. Sheppard's teeth, two  
of which were broken during the attack. Kirk concluded that Mrs. 
Sheppard bit her attacker -- who then pulled the teeth out when he 
jerked his hand away. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard had no bite wounds after the murder.  
</P>
<P>
	The fetus, which was removed from Mrs. Sheppard's body and is in  
a family crypt in suburban Cleveland, will be tested to confirm 
that the doctor is the father. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities discovered early in their investigation of the  
Sheppard case that the doctor had extramarital affairs, which he at 
first denied and later admitted. There were unconfirmed rumors that 
Mrs. Sheppard also had affairs and was impregnated by another man.

<HEADLINE> Sprawl Limits Please Sierra Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spurred by people fed up with clogged highways  
and dirty air, many states are coming up with innovative programs 
to ease urban sprawl, a national environmental group said Monday. 
Maryland, Rhode Island, Vermont and Oregon got high marks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Sierra Club found that some of the most densely  
populated areas, among them New York and Pennsylvania, still lag. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was only the latest in string of recent surveys on the  
loss of open space in urban areas and was distributed as Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt urged Congress to move more aggressively to 
allocate $900 million for buying parkland and open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress historically has come up with only about a third of the  
$900 million that federal law provides. Numerous bills in both the 
House and Senate would guarantee the full $900 million from revenue 
collected from offshore oil and gas drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want more parks and recreation areas, more wildlife  
habitat, ... and they want to set aside more buffer lands to combat 
urban sprawl,'' said Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Interior Department budget for the fiscal year that began  
last Friday, Congress came up with less than $200 million for state 
and federal land purchases under the conservation program. That's a 
little more than a third of the Clinton administration's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sierra Club report, called ``Solving Sprawl,'' ranked the  
states in four categories where governments tried to keep residents 
living closer to their jobs to avoid the pollution and gridlock of 
extended suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying land around cities, improving mass transit, limiting  
development of green spaces and revitalizing urban centers were the 
subjects graded. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the states have acted to protect farms, and 20 have  
easement programs to prevent development of agricultural land, the 
Sierra Club said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland rated tops for protecting open space, with $140 million  
earmarked to buy rural land in the next five years. Under programs 
implemented since 1969, the state already protected 300,000 acres 
of farmland and other undeveloped areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven states have approved statewide growth-management plans,  
the Sierra Club said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon, which in 1973 required communities to map out  
development within clearly drawn boundaries, was rated first in 
land-use planning. Oregon also created an elected, regional 
planning commission in 1978 to coordinate development around 
Portland. The state once lost 30,000 acres of farmland a year, but 
the figure has fallen to 2,000 acres a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one states spent more than half their federal  
transportation money on new roads, which the Sierra Club criticized 
as a magnet for sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rhode Island ranked first in transportation planning by  
expanding its rail, ferry and bus systems. Last year, voters 
approved bonds to build 50 miles of new bike paths. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist shifted appropriations from an  
elevated freeway called Park East Freeway and redeveloped vacant 
land in the proposed road's path. 
</P>
<P>
	``Widening roads to solve traffic congestion is like loosening  
your belt to solve a weight problem,'' Norquist said. ``Big roads 
fill with traffic to the point of gridlock, and when you widen 
them, they fill with more traffic congestion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the goals for reducing sprawl include redeveloping urban  
areas. Twenty-eight states have so-called ``brown fields'' programs 
to clean up abandoned and often polluted industrial sites. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same vein, Vermont was praised for a trust fund that  
helped 10,000 people find affordable housing since 1987. The state 
also has a 25-year-old law regulating construction of large stores 
such as Wal-Mart and K-Mart that supporters credit with maintaining 
the character of smaller stores in quaint downtowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``These states are leading the way,'' said Carl Pope, Sierra  
Club's executive director. ``Unfortunately, too many other states 
are dropping the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A highway advocacy group denounced the report for encouraging  
policies that would restrict growth, increase housing prices and 
result in apartment-style housing. The Road Information Program in 
Washington wants a blend of more roads, more efficient mass transit 
and better traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sierra Club has identified the right problem but has  
proposed the wrong solutions,'' said William Wilkins, executive 
director of TRIP. ``They are trying to control growth through 
policies that ... will result in loss of freedom for individuals to 
make decisions for themselves about where to live and work and how 
to travel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another critic, Charles Ruma, president of the National  
Association of Home Builders, said: ``As in previous reports, the 
Sierra Club failed to acknowledge the significant underlying forces 
driving growth in suburban America -- a rapidly increasing 
population and consumer preferences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report came a year after the group criticized urban areas  
for poor development planning. The worst areas, the organization 
says, remain in historically urban states such as New York and 
Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Camp Full of New Faces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- With only six returning players, the Houston  
Rockets' training camp might seem more like a meet-and-greet than a 
catch-and-shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	After showing up for physicals Monday morning, the new group of  
Rockets made their debuts at media day in Houston, then departed 
for Austin, Texas. Camp starts there Tuesday, with two practices a 
day through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's trade of disgruntled forward Scottie Pippen to the  
Portland Trail Blazers for six players -- Stacey Augmon, Ed Gray, 
Walt Williams, Carlos Rogers, Kelvin Cato and Brian Shaw -- swelled 
the roster to 18 players with contracts plus Charles Barkley, who 
signed a one-year deal Monday. Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Also joining the mix are offseason additions Shandon Anderson  
and Steve Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	While Shaw, Gray and veteran Eddie Johnson, who is expected to  
retire, were cut Monday, there are still 16 players left to compete 
for 12 roster spots -- most of whom haven't played together yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be very competitive training camp, which  
I think is healthy, but I don't want to get into just competing,'' 
coach Rudy Tomjanovich. ``There is a fine line of just competing 
and forgetting about what we're trying to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have too many players, and we have to work on that.  
But we did the work of trying to put a team we like together and we 
are more than satisfied with what we have. Now it's time to get 
away, get secluded and get to know each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some players won't be around for long. Augmon and Rogers are  
long shots to make the team, while Thomas Hamilton, Matt Bullard, 
Don MacLean and Matt Maloney will have to fight for spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The main reason for moving camp to Austin is so the players will  
spend more time with each other and build chemistry, rather than 
going their own ways as they did when camp was held in the Houston 
area, Tomjanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be for the best, because everybody will be  
learning something new. It's not going to happen overnight,'' 
rookie guard Francis said. ``It's going to take a long time for 
everybody to get to know each other's talents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich will teach his players a retooled offense that still  
exploits the strength of Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon on the low 
post, while using some of the team's newly-acquired speed -- Francis 
and Anderson -- to work the outside and drive to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an advantage to have guys that can run and guys that can  
post up. Any team that can play both styles, that wins 
championships,'' said Olajuwon, who has won two. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley was more succinct about the team's shift toward speed:  
``If we can't be uptempo this year, we're never going to be 
uptempo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA game in general should speed up anyway, thanks to a rule  
change inspired in part by Barkley's penchant for slowly backing 
his way to the basket. This season, a player can only back the ball 
in for five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``They only thing the rule change did is now you're all going to  
remember me when I'm dead. Every time the referee blows the whistle 
on one of those plays, you'll all say `That's the Barkley rule,''' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich also said he is looking forward to experimenting  
with Williams and Cato, each of whom offers specific talents. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had the fourth-best shooting percentage (43) in the NBA  
last season from 3-point range. Though Cato is considered a 
long-term project, the Rockets envision him as a backup for 
Olajuwon this year and a possible successor later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing with Charles and playing with Hakeem is going to be  
great,'' Cato said. ``My main thing is hoping they like me as much 
as I idolized them as I grew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for eventually replacing Olajuwon, Cato said, ``We'll get to  
that when we get to that. He's still got three or four more good 
years.''

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Teacher Drug-Testing Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Everyone offered a public school teaching job  
in one Tennessee county can be required to take a drug test, 
following the Supreme Court's rejection of a challenge by teachers 
who say the tests violate their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices' action Monday set no legal precedent but likely  
will add fuel to the national debate over school drug testing and 
could encourage other districts to enact similar policies. The 
teachers' appeal was one of hundreds turned down by the court as it 
opened its 1999-2000 term. 
</P>
<P>
	``If our children are not important enough and their safety and  
educational progress are not important enough to justify this 
limited drug testing, I don't know what would be,'' said Richard T. 
Beeler, attorney for the Knox County Board of Education, which 
adopted the drug-testing program in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers contended the tests amount to an unreasonable  
search under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment if officials do 
not suspect the tested individual of using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Their lawyer, Robert H. Chanin, noted the court's rejection of  
the teachers' appeal was not a ruling but added, ``I expect there 
will be some school districts who misconstrue what the action of 
the court is and take this as a green light to go forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Underwood, the National School Boards Association's  
general counsel, said she did not know of other school districts 
with a similar teacher drug testing policy, although she said most 
districts require testing of bus drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knox County policy requires everyone offered a job  
considered ``safety sensitive'' to undergo urinalysis drug testing. 
Jobs considered safety sensitive include teachers, principals and 
assistant principals, teacher aides, school secretaries and bus 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy was challenged in federal court by the Knox County  
Education Association, an organization of teachers, principals and 
other professional school employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out the suspicionless testing requirement  
after finding there was no documented evidence of a drug abuse 
problem among teachers and that teaching is not heavily regulated 
for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling in  
September 1998. The appeals court said even without evidence of a 
drug problem among teachers, drug testing is justified by the 
``unique role'' teachers play in school children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers and principals are ``front-line observers in providing  
for a safe school environment,'' the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knox County schools' director of human resources, Betty Sue  
Sparks, said 1,064 people have been tested since last November. 
Fewer than 10 tested positive for drug use, and none of them were 
hired, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 6th Circuit court reinstated the county's testing  
program, ``We've had lots of phone calls from other systems within 
the 6th Circuit interested in looking at it,'' Sparks said. 
</P>
<P>
	In past rulings, the Supreme Court has said the government can  
require drug testing of customs agents and railroad employees 
involved in serious accidents. The justices also have let public 
schools require student athletes to undergo drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1997, the justices ruled that states cannot force  
political candidates to take drug tests merely to demonstrate the 
government's commitment to the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knox County teachers' appeal said the drug testing policy  
was so broad that taking cough syrup could lead to a positive 
result. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspicionless drug testing must be shown to be ``an effective  
and credible means of addressing a real and urgent need, rather 
than merely a symbolic step,'' the appeal contended. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board's lawyers argued that evidence of drug use by  
teachers is not necessary to justify a drug-testing plan. Teachers 
must stay alert to ensure student safety, they said.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Waiting for NCAA Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Missouri coach Quin Snyder will have to wait another day, and  
maybe longer, before finding out if he broke NCAA rules while 
pursuing his first two recruits for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	The university had expected to hear from the NCAA on Monday  
whether the men's basketball program had violated recruiting rules. 
But no such ruling was issued from the college sports governing 
organization, and NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said there was no 
specific time set for one. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the university's sports information department Monday  
were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri athletic director Mike Alden notified the NCAA last  
Friday that the university may have violated recruiting rules by 
allowing the mothers of Detroit basketball prospects Rickey 
Paulding and Arthur Johnson to join their sons on a chartered plane 
to Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Both mothers paid the university between $200 and $300 each for  
their tickets prior to flying from Detroit to Columbia Regional 
Airport Sept. 17 and returning Sept. 19, Alden said. He said the 
university believed the NCAA rules allow a prospect to be 
accompanied on a noncommercial flight if the extra party paid fair 
market value for the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	While not commenting specifically on Missouri's case, NCAA  
officials said last week that the school's interpretation was 
wrong. Jankowski said the rules are quite clear regarding 
transportation of prospective recruits and their relatives and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	A school can use commercial flights or noncommercial flights --  
the school's own plane, charter or private planes -- to bring 
prospects to campus for official visits, Jankowski said. But 
relatives, friends and legal guardians can accompany prospects only 
on commercial flights. 
</P>
<P>
	On those flights, the prospect's fare is paid by the school.  
Anyone accompanying the prospect must pay his or her own way. 
</P>
<P>
	But Missouri compliance director Mary Ann Austin argued the  
rules are not that clear cut. There is no NCAA bylaw that clearly 
states parents can't accompany prospects on a chartered flight, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said elements of four NCAA bylaws, not a single rule,  
``outline the intent that this arrangement is not permissible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paulding and Johnson, both seniors, orally committed to Missouri  
last week. But they could be declared ineligible, at least 
temporarily, before the Nov. 7 signing day. If Missouri did violate 
NCAA rules while recruiting the pair, they may not be able to play 
for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulding, a 6-foot-4 guard, averaged 25.6 points, 11.2 rebounds,  
4.0 assists and 3.0 blocked shots last season at Detroit 
Renaissance High. He said having his mother on the visit made it 
easier to choose a college. Paulding also visited Ohio State, Miami 
and Michigan State, but his mother made only the trip to Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a 6-9 forward, averaged 16.4 points last season at  
Detroit Pershing High. He only visited Miami before choosing 
Missouri. Both players made an unofficial visit together to 
Missouri in August. But the trip to Columbia over Parents Weekend 
in September solidified their choices.

<HEADLINE> NYC Art Exhibit Attracts Thousands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In show business, a little controversy often  
turns out to be very good for business. Apparently, that's true for 
museums, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Just ask John Dumicich, who forked over $150 to become a member  
of The Brooklyn Museum of Art on Sunday, a day after the debut of 
an exhibit that has touched off a firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
	``At my corner breakfast place, we were talking about editorials  
on the exhibit. Then another man joined in the conversation,'' he 
said. ``It's bringing people together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the exhibit's paintings, ``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' has  
been at the center of the simmering dispute. It depicts a Madonna 
and features a clump of elephant dung and cutouts from pornographic 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is withholding the city's October payment  
of the museum's $7 million annual subsidy on the grounds that it 
cannot charge admission in a city-owned building. The museum has 
sued to get the funding restored, claiming the mayor is violating 
the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who is raising money for a likely Republican bid for  
the U.S. Senate next year, hit the national talk show circuit to 
defend his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum -- which usually gets little notice from either  
tourists or the media -- has been basking in all the attention. 
Lines snaked around the museum all weekend as people tried to get a 
glimpse of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 9,200 people viewed the exhibit -- aptly titled  
``Sensation'' -- on Saturday, its first day. It was the largest 
opening in the museum's 175-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 showed up Sunday, waiting in line for up to 90  
minutes and paying $9.75 for a ticket. The museum's gift shop ran 
out of black T-shirts printed with the word ``SENSATION'' and did a 
steady business signing up new members. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman who braved the crowds, Rachel Fedde, said the exhibit  
``was really well put-together, impressive, great, beautiful.'' But 
she added that the Virgin Mary ``was not remarkable one way or 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal John O'Connor, in his Sunday sermon at St. Patrick's  
Cathedral, called anti-Catholicism ``one of the few things left in 
the country in which there seems to be very little uproar when 
attacks are forthcoming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in Brooklyn, black  
activist Rev. Dr. Herbert Daughtry said racism is at the center of 
the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Europeans always see Africans negatively,'' he told his  
congregation. ``It's not the feces, but the face. It's not the 
picture, it's the pigmentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters had demonstrated outside the museum on both sides of  
the issue, but their numbers on Sunday had dwindled to two. One 
held a sign that read: ``Father, forgive them, for they know not 
what they do.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Acquires Triple Crown Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Horse racing's Triple Crown switched TV networks  
on Monday, and pro basketball might be responsible for the change. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC will televise the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont  
Stakes for five years, beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC, led by commentator Jim McKay, has televised the Derby since  
1975 and covered all three races since 1987. The network has a year 
left on its contract. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC reportedly paid $51.5 million for the Triple Crown package,  
with ABC bidding $35 million. CBS, which provided the first 
national telecast of the Derby in 1952 and added the Preakness and 
Belmont in 1960, offered a reported $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we went out to solicit bids and interest, we did it with  
a view to promoting racing,'' said Thomas Meeker, president of 
Triple Crown Productions. ``NBC is the network of opportunity for 
us to promote our sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the network already has the NBA and regularly  
programmed playoff games opposite ABC's telecasts of the Triple 
Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, instead of providing alternative programming, the NBA  
playoff games can provide an attractive lead-in for the races and 
perhaps deliver a younger audience, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the NBA has posed a problem for thoroughbred  
racing,'' Meeker said. ``Not having that competition will enhance 
our ability to attract new viewers to our sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Ebersol, chairman of the network's sports division, said  
with the NBA as a lead-in instead of competition, Triple Crown 
ratings could increase 15-20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said NBC also will cover the prep races leading to the  
Kentucky Derby, either on its cable channels or other cable 
systems. The network also will televise the Breeders' Cup through 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``It offers all kinds of packaging possibilities,'' Ebersol  
said.

<HEADLINE> Report: UAL Eyes Air Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines reportedly is preparing a  
counterbid to an offer backed by rival American Airlines for 
control of Canada's largest air carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	United's parent, UAL Corp. based in suburban Elk Grove Village,  
and German airline Lufthansa are preparing a bid to buy 35 percent 
or more of the outstanding shares of Air Canada, the Chicago 
Tribune reported in Sunday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid, which could come as early as today, could block the  
merger of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines proposed by 
Toronto-based investment firm Onex Corp. That combination is being 
backed by American Airlines and its parent, AMR Corp. AMR owns 25 
percent of Canadian Airlines and would own 15 percent of the new 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL spokesman Matthew Triaca on Sunday said the company would  
not comment on the report. United Airlines is the world's largest 
air carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada spokeswoman Nicole Couture-Simard said the Tribune  
report is based on speculation and ``we are not commenting on 
speculation. We're not denying, we are simply not commenting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Lufthansa said he had no comment on the report  
but that the airline has ``never ruled out entering into even 
closer relationships for strategic purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Onex has offered $1.2 billion in cash and stock and would assume  
$2.7 billion in debt to take over the Canadian carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada has rebuffed the offer as an American plot to take  
over the Canadian airline industry. Canadian Airlines has not 
responded to the offer and may be waiting for Air Canada to sweeten 
a bid to buy the smaller carrier's international routes, its most 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune reported that UAL Chairman Jim Goodwin last week  
briefed United's pilots on the plan under which UAL and Lufthansa 
reportedly will each buy 10 percent of Air Canada's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	A Canadian bank, reportedly the Bank of Montreal, would buy up  
to 15 percent of the airline's shares, according to the Tribune. 
The Bank of Montreal owns Chicago's Harris Bank. Harris is the 
stock transfer agent for UAL. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL is 55 percent owned by three employee groups, with the  
airline's pilots owning the biggest stake. The arrangement obliges 
the airline to consult with the pilots and the machinists in any 
major undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
	A bidding war for a share of Air Canada would be a battle not  
only between United and American, but between two airline 
alliances: the United/Lufthansa-dominated Star Alliance, of which 
Air Canada is a member, and the American-dominated OneWorld 
Alliance, to which Canadian Airlines belongs. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL receives about $200 million annually as a result of Air  
Canada's membership in the Star Alliance, while Lufthansa receives 
about $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	American, meanwhile, receives about $120 million from Canadian  
because of its membership in the OneWorld Alliance. Canadian has 
said it will shut down next spring unless it has an infusion of 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	If Onex wins its bid to merge the two carriers, it has pledged  
that the new carrier will join American's OneWorld Alliance.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was unchanged against the yen at midday  
Tuesday, after having risen earlier amid renewed worries over the 
Japanese economy. Tokyo stock prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 106.11 yen, even with its level late Monday in  
Tokyo but below its level of 106.30 yen late Monday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark Nikkei-225 Stock Average rose 55.61 points, or  
0.31 percent, to 17,819.32 at the end of morning trading. The 
average closed up 51.15 points, or 0.29 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar moved off gains earlier against  
the yen made after traders digested a central bank survey on 
business confidence released the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Bank of Japan's closely watched ``tankan'' survey  
showed a steep rise in business confidence, it also indicated a 
drop in business investment plans for the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar began rising overseas as investors saw the decline in  
capital spending as a sign that Japan's economic growth may be 
slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy has been struggling to emerge from its deepest  
downturn in a half century. But recent bright signs, including two 
straight quarters of economic growth, have caused the yen to surge 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 114.22 yen in midday  
trading, up 0.40 yen from its level of 113.82 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices moved higher following a rally  
in U.S. stocks. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average 
advanced 128.23 points, or 1.25 percent, to close Monday's session 
at 10,401.23. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices were also boosted on the formation Monday of a new  
three-party ruling political coalition consisting of the Liberal 
Democratic, Liberal and New Komeito parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``The successful creation of the coalition underscores the  
leadership of Prime Minister (Keizo) Obuchi,'' said Hideyuki Nakai, 
a senior investment manager at Nippon Global Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It also lowers the risk of short-term political instability  
and increases the likelihood of new economic stimulus measures,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi was to formally launch his new Cabinet later Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 3.50 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,512.48. The 
TOPIX closed up 0.90 points, or 0.06 percent, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.6100 percent from Monday's finish of 1.6050 percent. Its price 
fell 0.05 point to 100.78.

<HEADLINE> Abu-Jamal Loses Supreme Court Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mumia Abu-Jamal, the former Black Panther  
and radio journalist sentenced to death for killing a police 
officer, lost a Supreme Court appeal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Without commenting, the court refused to review Abu-Jamal's  
arguments that he was denied a fair trial in the 1981 killing of 
Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings about the justice system has  
attracted worldwide attention. Thousands of supporters have staged 
demonstrations in Philadelphia to demand a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I am distressed at the thought that 18 years have passed  
since that night I will never forget, I am pleased that yet another 
hurdle has been cleared on the path toward justice,'' Maureen 
Faulkner, widow of the slain officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Tom Ridge will sign a new execution warrant for Abu-Jamal  
within 30 days, following state policy in capital cases, spokesman 
Tim Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal is not likely to be executed soon. He still can  
challenge his state court conviction in federal courts, a process 
that someday could lead back to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's attorney, Leonard Weinglass, said he would appeal to  
U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a setback, but it is a missed opportunity,''  
Weinglass said. ``The court could have ended the case quickly. Now 
we will have to go the long route.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld Abu-Jamal's conviction and  
death sentence, saying it found no merit in various arguments his 
lawyers raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal was convicted of shooting Faulkner to death after the  
police officer stopped Abu-Jamal's brother for driving the wrong 
way down a city street. Abu-Jamal, found wounded at the scene, 
maintained his innocence and contended he was framed. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal raised three legal arguments, none focusing on  
Abu-Jamal's claim of innocence. But his lawyers did tell the 
justices about ``an array of evidence powerfully supporting his 
longstanding insistence that he is victim of a monumental 
injustice.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not Surprised by Uninsured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Monday no one should be  
surprised by an increase in the number of Americans who lack health 
insurance. ``What has happened is exactly what we said would 
happen,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president said things will get better over the next two  
years as ``significant numbers of children'' receive coverage under 
a program enacted by Congress in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in one of the biggest defeats of his presidency, failed  
to persuade Congress in 1994 to enact the universal health 
insurance plan written by his wife, Hillary. ``The first lady and I 
and all the rest of us were right in 1994,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told you in 1994 that if this were voted down, the  
insurance companies would continue to drop people, or employers 
would, because of the system we had,'' the president said. He spoke 
in the Cabinet Room after remarks about efforts to win ratification 
of a global nuclear test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	He also addressed a new Census Bureau report that 44.3 million  
Americans, one in six, had no health insurance coverage in 1998. 
The survey found that the number of people without coverage grew by 
nearly a million, but overall population growth kept the rate about 
steady -- 16.3 percent in 1998, compared with 16.1 percent in 1997. 
In 1996, 15.6 percent lacked coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Campbell, author of the Census report, said health care  
coverage among children did not change significantly from 1997 to 
1998, with 11.1 million, or 15.4 percent, of the under-18 
population uninsured. Children ages 12 to 17 were slightly more 
likely to be without health care coverage than those under 12 -- 
16.0 percent, compared with 15.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he expected congressional passage this year  
of legislation by Sens. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., and Edward M. Kennedy, 
D-Mass., that will allow people with disabilities to go into the 
work force and keep their federal health insurance. He said 
lawmakers also should enact his proposal to allow Americans as 
young as 55 to buy Medicare health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said he was glad that Vice President Al Gore and  
former Sen. Bill Bradley, competitors for the Democratic 
presidential nomination, were discussing competing health care 
proposals. ``I hope that we will continue to see this debated,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Grahame Makes History in NHL Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Boston Bruins goaltender John Grahame became part  
of NHL history when he made his debut in a 4-0 loss to the Toronto 
Maple Leafs on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Grahame and his father Ron became the first father-son  
combination to play goal for the same NHL team. Ron Grahame played 
114 games over four seasons with Boston, the Los Angeles Kings and 
Quebec Nordiques from 1977-78 to 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other known father-son goaltender duos in the NHL are  
father Dennis Riggin and son Pat, and Sam LoPresti and son Pete. 
However, they never played for the same team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good feeling. It's nice to be part of an exclusive  
tradition like that,'' said John Grahame, who stopped 30 of 34 
shots. ``It's a good thing for the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Grahame played the past two seasons with  
Providence, leading the American Hockey League with 37 wins last 
season. He won 15 more games in the playoffs as the Bruins captured 
the Calder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Grahame wasn't expected to play in Boston this season, but a  
contract squabble with Vezina Trophy finalist Byron Dafoe has 
resulted in the Bruins being forced to go with Robbie Tallas and 
Grahame. Tallas gave up three goals on 20 shots in a 3-1 loss to 
Carolina on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kid played well, he just didn't get a lot of help,''  
Boston coach Pat Burns said of Grahame. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Grahame was traded from Boston to Los Angeles in 1979 for a  
first-round draft pick that turned out to be current Bruins 
defenseman Ray Bourque. Ron Grahame, who was on hand for his son's 
NHL debut in Toronto, is currently the athletic director at the 
University of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs went right after Grahame in the opening minutes.  
Mats Sundin scored at the 2:00 mark on his third consecutive chance 
against the Denver native. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't sure what to expect so I just prepared for the worst  
and that's what came at me,'' Grahame said. ``I tried to play well, 
but there were some awful bounces and some tough luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grahame did make the save of the game at 13:30 of the first  
period when he snared a blast from Jonas Hoglund with his glove. 
Replays showed Grahame made the stop just as the puck was crossing 
the plane of the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be a bit lucky, I guess,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Back To School in Flood Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- It is another landmark in North  
Carolina's long, painful attempt to return to normal after 
Hurricane Floyd: Schools are opening their doors again. 
</P>
<P>
	Volunteers worked through the weekend to get classrooms in  
hard-hit Edgecombe County ready for this morning. Floyd's 
floodwaters damaged many schools and destroyed two, including one 
in Princeville. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the schools to be shining like a new dime. These kids  
have gone through a lot and we want them coming in knowing that 
everything is OK and that the world is still going around,'' county 
spokeswoman Diane LeFiles said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 550 children will attend other schools for the next week  
or so while temporary trailers are readied. County schools were 
closed Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tarboro, fewer than 200 people were left at the shelter at  
Tarboro High School, which also was readied for students today. It 
is the only shelter still open in the region east of Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the cleanup resumed Sunday for residents flooded out  
of their homes nearly three weeks ago in Princeville, which was 
engulfed by the Tar River on Sept. 17. At one point, brown, 
swirling water stood 20 feet deep near the town hall. The water 
destroyed half of the town's 800 homes and wiped out 33 businesses 
and three churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, the Tar River crested Sunday about 8 feet above flood  
stage after a second round of heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in the past few days have the town's 1,900 residents been  
able to return to view the damage. There is uncertainty about the 
future of a town built by freed slaves after the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's going to happen in Princeville? What is going to happen  
in Princeville?'' asked Dennis Westry, peering into the windows of 
his sister's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel in the next 18 months there will be a lot of changes.  
It really depends on how much money is coming in,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Princeville resident Jacquetta Hawkins picked through piles of  
clothes in her grandmother's house, most stained with mud and rust 
from metal hangers. She tossed most of the items onto the growing 
pile of trash, alongside ruined dressers, wallboard and mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hawkins held up a tiny outfit that had been on a plastic  
hanger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh this one's really cute,'' she said. ``Maybe we can clean it  
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the damage, Samuel Wilkins remained positive Sunday as  
he stopped by to check on his mother's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see the whole town come back,'' he said. ``I  
really hope they don't do away with this little town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a mall in Greenville was turned into a makeshift  
television studio Sunday as broadcasters aired a statewide 
telethon. The six-hour effort raised $2.2 million in promised 
donations for flood victims, said Mike Weeks, president of the 
North Carolina Association of Broadcasters.

<HEADLINE> AMD Unveils 700 Megahertz Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has  
unveiled an even speedier version of its new Athlon computer chip 
in a bid to stay one step ahead of archrival and industry leader 
Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD said its 700 megahertz chip will operate a computer far  
better than Intel's most advanced chip on the market, the 600 
megahertz chip Intel offers for its Pentium III. 
</P>
<P>
	The chips, which are typically sold in 1,000-unit batches to  
computer makers, will sell for $849 each. AMD said IBM and Compaq 
Computer Corp. already had committed to selling the new Athlon chip 
in its speediest computers, while retailer Best Buy said it would 
immediately offer the chip through its made-to-order 
computer-selling program. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some analysts say AMD is unlikely to overtake Intel  
because that larger company typically responds to new challenges by 
slashing the prices of its older chips to spur sales. AMD in the 
past also has had production problems.

<HEADLINE> Now the Real Season Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The jokes started in spring training: They had already clinched  
playoff spots and could start printing postseason tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves never  
presumed they would make it this far. Everyone else in baseball 
did, though. 
</P>
<P>
	So now, the real season starts.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we're the world champs,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said  
Monday. ``I think that's the way people look at us. We've done well 
over the last few years. Again, that doesn't mean that we assume 
we're going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Rangers will see. They draw the unenviable task of  
beginning the best-of-5 AL playoffs on Tuesday night at Yankee 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Yankees had a sense of invincibility last year,'' Rangers  
third baseman Todd Zeile said. ``They were the best team in the 
history of the game. They are still a good club, but we are 
confident playing against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Turner Field, the Braves once again begin the quest for a  
second World Series championship in the '90s. Greg Maddux will 
throw the first pitch of this year's playoffs on Tuesday afternoon 
against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about going to the playoffs, you talk about  
having the hot hand at the right time,'' Braves pitcher Tom Glavine 
said. ``And I think this team definitely has that right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros wound up against Atlanta once New York beat  
Cincinnati 5-0 in Monday night's one-game playoff for the wild 
card. Houston was just 1-6 against the Braves this season, and was 
swept by Atlanta in the 1997 first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know how we've fared against the Braves,'' closer Billy  
Wagner said. ``Their reputation seems to beat us before we get out 
there. We seem to try to do too much against them. This season we 
didn't get the job done against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Jacobs Field, Cleveland will renew its bid for its first  
Series title since 1948. The Indians face a rough start, drawing 
ace Pedro Martinez and the Boston Red Sox in Game 1 Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to beat Pedro, man,'' Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel  
said. ``We have to show we can beat him. We beat him before and we 
have to do that again. The No. 1 game is always important to win. 
It doesn't mean anything if we go the full five games or seven 
games. It is just the first step. You want the first step, but it 
is more important to take the last step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Diamondbacks also are in the playoffs, making it in  
just their second season. Randy Johnson will start Game 1 at 11:09 
p.m. EDT Tuesday at Bank One Ballpark against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're as talented a club as there is in our league,''  
Arizona manager Buck Showalter said of the Mets. ``They've got 
great depth. It's a well put-together club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is 2-5 lifetime with a 3.10 ERA in the playoffs and has  
lost five straight decisions, tying the postseason record shared by 
Doyle Alexander and Joe Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the postseason, I've pitched pretty well,''  
Johnson said. ``It's not like I've been a total flop. People just 
look at the numbers and they want wins, and that's all I want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets and Yankees are in the postseason for the first time  
ever. The Mets are making their first playoff appearance since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get over to Arizona and see what's going on,'' said Mets  
manager Bobby Valentine, in the playoffs for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	For many of the teams, these matchups are all-too-familiar.  
</P>
<P>
	The Indians eliminated Boston in the first round in 1995 and  
again in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in the postseason, and we know what they can do,''  
Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra said. ``They definitely have a 
lot of veterans, and they've been in the postseason before. They 
know how to win. We played them last year and they knocked us out. 
Hopefully, we can turn it around this year. We know we've got a 
good series on our hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers also hope for a bit of role reversal. The Yankees  
chased them in the first round in 1996 and 1998, and both times 
went on to win the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, New York held the AL's top-hitting team to one run  
and a .141 average in a three-game sweep. Orlando ``El Duque'' 
Hernandez will start the opener against Texas' Aaron Sele. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we'd have to face the Yankees some time,'' said Rafael  
Palmeiro, who rejoined Texas this season. ``It doesn't matter if it 
is the first or second round. The road to the World Series goes 
through New York, so we might as well do it now.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Urged To Pass FAA Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airport delays could turn into gridlock if  
Congress does not move quickly to overhaul air traffic control 
systems, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could see this system come to a chokepoint,'' Slater said  
of the rapidly expanding airline industry that in a decade is 
expected to carry 1 billion passengers a year, up 50 percent from 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate began debate Monday on long-stalled legislation to  
fund Federal Aviation Administration modernization, safety and 
operating programs. Slater and FAA Administrator Jane Garvey were 
on Capitol Hill to lobby for language in the bill that would make 
the air traffic control system operate more like a business. 
</P>
<P>
	Garvey said the Senate had made a good starting point with an  
amendment proposed by Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and John D. 
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., that would create a chief operating officer 
post and an oversight board for the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Garvey and Slater said the administration ultimately wants to  
change financing so that all air traffic control revenues are used 
for the system. Also being considered is replacement of the current 
excise tax on passengers with user fees paid by airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate FAA bill, which would fund some $45 billion in  
programs over four years, is expected to have widespread support, 
as did a five-year, $59 billion measure the House passed in June. 
</P>
<P>
	But a similar Senate bill that passed last year by 92-1 never  
became law because the House and Senate could not iron out 
differences, particularly over the issue of increasing flights out 
of some of the nation's busiest airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., has  
pushed hard for lifting the ceilings on flights out of Chicago's 
O'Hare, New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy and Washington's Reagan 
National. He contends this is one way to increase competition and 
improve service to smaller communities that have suffered under 
airline deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Gorton-Rockefeller amendment would eliminate slot rules  
at O'Hare in 2003 and at the New York airports in 2007, with new 
slots -- a takeoff or landing -- going to new entrants or services to 
smaller communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington would get 24 new slots, 12 for service outside a  
1,250-mile ``perimeter rule'' established in 1986 to protect Dulles 
and Baltimore-Washington, the region's two long-haul airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from the three regions have launched strenuous  
campaigns against the flight increases, saying they pose 
environmental and safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., said he was elected in  
part because of his opposition to additional flights out of O'Hare. 
More flights into congested airports would be ``a grave mistake 
that could jeopardize the safety of our flying public in the United 
States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A final compromise on the legislation has also been slowed by  
provisions in the House bill, championed by House Transportation 
Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., that would bar Congress from 
using funds from the Aviation Trust Fund for non-aviation purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund, which takes in about $10 billion a year in  
airport user taxes, is now used for general budget programs as well 
as airport projects.

<HEADLINE> Payton Talks of Upcoming Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- All-Star point guard Gary Payton has the Seattle  
SuperSonics season figured out. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no pressure, since everyone ranks the Sonics near the  
bottom of their division. 
</P>
<P>
	Power forward Vin Baker, disgraced last year as Seattle ended  
the season 25-25 and missed the playoffs, is the go-to man. ``I'm 
not worried about Vin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, guard Vernon Maxwell and others will bring ``attitude''  
back to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can win, off of attitude, 35-40 games,'' Payton told  
reporters on Monday at the team's media day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics will make the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, we're going to be in the playoffs so I'm not worried  
about that,'' Payton declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonics' training camp opens Tuesday, with the preseason opener  
against the Portland Trail Blazers on Oct. 12 and the season opener 
Nov. 2 against the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics are eager to put the lockout-shortened 1999 season  
behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a relief,'' to start again, said Baker, who began last  
season out of shape and missed much of it due to injuries. Despite 
all that, the Sonics re-signed him in August to a seven-year, $87 
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had to live with last year all summer long, and finally  
I'm getting my opportunity to get back on track,'' the four-time 
All-Star said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to show everyone (last year) was an aberration and  
I'm going to be back on top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't relate anything to last year, other than we learned  
some things that we needed to rectify,'' general manager Wally 
Walker said. ``We got older and slower and we couldn't compete well 
enough with the athletic teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Management gave the team a major makeover in the offseason,  
bringing back only Payton and Baker among their top players. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said he expected this year's team to pick up the tempo.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got a good mix; a versatile group and a bunch of  
guys who complement one another. But the fact is you never know 
until you get going,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Pacific Division and the Western Conference are both  
filled with good teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone in our conference that has an off-night is going to be  
in big trouble,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Paul Westphal said he was looking forward to ``have the  
season start with a normal NBA,'' with time to prepare and a full 
season of 82 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he doesn't have his starters set, except for Baker,  
Payton and forward Horace Grant, who was acquired from Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton said he liked the position of underdog.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't put a halo over people and say we expect to win 60  
games,'' he said. ``These guys got to get the feel. I like these 
guys. I think these guys got a lot of attitude to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said there might be personality clashes but ``as long as we  
be a family on this court and win basketball games, that's what I'm 
happy about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, who carried the team last season, also said he wants  
that to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to come and play every night, that's all I'm going  
to do,'' he said. ``I'm not a shooter. Vin is going to be the 
man.''

<HEADLINE> Wannstedt Easing Into Coach Roles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- He's the Dolphins assistant head coach, but Dave  
Wannstedt might better be labeled as Mr. Everything. 
</P>
<P>
	During a typical day -- sometimes a typical hour -- Wannstedt  
roams from meeting room to meeting room, practice field to practice 
field, offense to defense, even working with the special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	His is a job that lacks definition. He helps out wherever Jimmy  
Johnson, his longtime friend, needs him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first two games, Wannstedt sat in the coaches' box for  
the first half, evaluating the game plan he helped install. Then he 
spent the second half on the sideline, working with the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt says the transition has been easy.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a lot smoother than what I imagined or what anybody  
would have imagined,'' Wannstedt said. ``The situation was unique 
because, since Jimmy's been with the Dolphins, we would talk 
weekly, so I really felt like I had a feel for the organization. I 
felt like I had a good handle on the team, its strengths and 
weaknesses, and where we had to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson hired Wannstedt in January after quitting, then coming  
back to the Dolphins in the span of 24 hours, when his mother died 
and the strain of an emotional season had taken its toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga asked Johnson what it would take  
for him to stay, and Johnson suggested hiring Wannstedt to relieve 
some of his burden as coach and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt had been fired by the Chicago Bears following a 4-12  
finish in 1998. Wannstedt and Johnson, who coached together for 13 
years prior to this season, were reunited for the first time since 
1992, when they won a Super Bowl with the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't develop relationships like this from reading about  
them in a book or by watching a videotape on it,'' Wannstedt said. 
``There's been a lot of blood, sweat and tears that have gone into 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The duo coached through probation years at Oklahoma State and  
through undefeated and championship seasons at the University of 
Miami. They moved to the NFL and went from 1-15 to the Super Bowl 
three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	The success led to Wannstedt getting the Bears' job. It's all  
but assumed he'll get the same chance with the Dolphins once 
Johnson steps aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you face adversity in any relationship, people  
have a tendency to drift apart or strengthen,'' Wannstedt said. 
``For whatever reason, I don't know why, ours has remained in tact 
and strengthened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To hear players tell it, Wannstedt's presence has solidified the  
Dolphins, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always thought that one of Dave's biggest gifts is  
teaching,'' said defensive end Trace Armstrong, whom played for 
Wannstedt in Chicago. ``He relates well to players one-on-one. A 
lot of coaches can tell you where to line up or tell you what you 
did wrong. But the very good coaches are able to teach the position 
or teach a technique and get a guy to understand it and I think 
that's Dave's strong suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt concedes he tends to work more with the defense, but  
that should be expected -- he primarily has spent his entire career 
as either a defensive coordinator or a defensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where he's comfortable,'' linebacker Robert Jones said.  
``You can never have too many guys, especially when you have one 
with the knowledge that Coach Wannstedt has. That's a plus for us 
all the way around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a plus for Johnson, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dave's still going in a lot of different areas, and he's  
really making an outstanding contribution,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The full weight of the contribution might not truly be known

<HEADLINE>  Japan Nuclear Probe Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKAIMURA, Japan (AP) -- Government inspectors began searching  
the offices of 20 nuclear facilities around the country Monday as 
it intensified the probe into practices that ignited Japan's worst 
nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also said the operating procedures of all nuclear  
power companies will be examined after discovering that the company 
that ran the uranium-processing plant did not follow 
government-mandated procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Science and Technology Agency inspected the site of  
Thursday's accident and questioned officials of JCO Co., the 
private company that ran the plant in Tokaimura, 70 miles northeast 
of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The three workers responsible for the accident were using  
bucket-like containers to mix the uranium, the national Asahi 
newspaper reported Monday. They were also on the assignment for the 
first time and skipped some steps to get the job done as quickly as 
possible, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokaimura accident sent the three workers to the hospital --  
two suffering potentially lethal doses of radiation. Forty-six 
other people were also exposed to radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi asked for tighter emergency safety  
checks at all facilities handling nuclear fuel. He also requested a 
study on the ``proper moral discipline'' of employees at nuclear 
fuel plants. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Tokyo insisted its nuclear facilities were far safer  
than those in other nations because of Japan's high technology and 
its meticulous workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials have often scoffed at the idea that an  
accident like the ones at Chernobyl in the Ukraine or Three Mile 
Island in the United States could ever happen here. 
</P>
<P>
	But revelations that corner-cutting led to Thursday's accident  
have dampened that sense of infallibility. Workers put in too much 
uranium, setting off an uncontrolled atomic reaction that continued 
for hours, spurting radioactivity into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	JCO, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., has  
admitted that it had for years deviated from government-approved 
procedures by having its own illegal manual. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was not required to be prepared for possible atomic  
reactions because the uranium-processing plant was in principle not 
supposed to set any off, Japanese media reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The atomic reaction, called fission, set off by the accident is  
similar to what happens in a nuclear reactor and is the principle 
behind the atomic bomb. Processing uranium, if done properly, does 
not entail an atomic reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	By using the bucket-like containers instead of more  
sophisticated equipment, the mixing could be shortened from three 
hours to just 30 minutes, the Asahi said, citing a hospitalized 
worker's statement to police. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's reaction to the accident also is under  
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters called in to help injured workers were never warned  
of a potential release of radioactivity and went in without 
protective gear. Firefighters were among those exposed to 
radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	The speed of JCO's warning to town officials was also being  
examined. According to information provided by the company and 
Tokaimura municipal officials, nearly two hours elapsed between the 
accident and any notice to residents that something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media reports said JCO knew within the first 10 minutes  
that an atomic reaction had begun. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokaimura, meanwhile, schools filled once again with children  
and shops opened for business Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But signs of the accident remained. Two Greenpeace activists  
were testing for radiation outside the hobbled uranium reprocessing 
plant. The plant operator, meanwhile, held counseling services for 
worried residents and farmers in the area feared returning to their 
fields.

<HEADLINE> Suspects Implicated in 6th Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAYNESVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Two suspects in the massacre of five  
family members last week in western North Carolina are believed to 
have been involved in an earlier killing more than 100 miles away, 
a sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Chad McKinley Watt, 22, was found Saturday under a  
log in Alexander County near the boyhood home of Charles Wesley 
Roache, 25, who is being held without bond for five counts of 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Roache and a second man wanted in connection with the  
family slayings are suspected in the Watt slaying as well, 
Alexander County Sheriff Ray Warren said Sunday. The other suspect, 
identified today as Christopher Wayne Lippard, 20, was still at 
large today. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe Roache and Lippard shot Watt before they  
killed the Earl Phillips family Thursday night while ditching a 
stolen truck and trying to take two of the family's vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Watt died of a shotgun wound to the head, investigators said. A  
shotgun was also believed to have been used in the Phillips 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren said investigators believe Watt, Lippard and Roache  
gathered at a convenience store sometime Tuesday, then left in 
Watt's vehicle. A fight broke out after the vehicle broke down, and 
Roache shot and killed Watt, Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed in the Alexander County case, but  
Warren said he plans to discuss possible charges against Roache 
with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives began searching for the body Friday after Roache was  
questioned in the Phillips case. 
</P>
<P>
	Haywood County Sheriff Tom Alexander said at a news conference  
today that Lippard apparently headed east after the slayings. He 
was in custody on an alcohol-related charge in Hickory for a few 
hours Friday, but was released before authorities linked to the 
family slayings, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral was scheduled for today for Earl Phillips, 72, and his  
wife, Cora, 73. A second service was planned for the couple's son 
Eddie, 40; daughter-in-law, Mitzi, 44; and 14-year-old 
granddaughter, Katie. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 people attended a visitation service Sunday  
evening in Waynesville. 
</P>
<P>
	Roache was captured at gunpoint early Friday by Jim Fowler, a  
neighbor of the Phillipses who found Roache hiding under a camper 
top. 
</P>
<P>
	``I held him in the ditch until the law got here,'' he said. ``I  
was more angry than anything. ... I didn't want him to get away.''

<HEADLINE> Former Spanish Bank Chief Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Mariano Rubio, the governor of Spain's  
central bank who was forced to resign over allegations he used 
insider information, died Monday at age 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubio died in a Madrid hospital. Doctors said colon cancer  
caused his death. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, Rubio took over as governor of Spain's central bank  
under the Socialist government of then-Prime Minister Felipe 
Gonzalez. He was forced to resign in 1992 because of allegations 
that he used insider information in business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent nearly a month in prison, was formally charged in the  
case but was never brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubio is survived by his wife, Uruguayan author Carmen de  
Posadas. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Web Privacy Protection Big Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Companies are producing new software and new  
technologies at an unprecedented rate to protect the privacy of 
consumers on the Internet, but profits remain elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	These new tools help people online preserve their anonymity,  
keep credit-card numbers safe and warn them about Web sites that 
may sell their personal secrets to others. 
</P>
<P>
	Novell Inc., the $1 billion computer networking giant, planned  
to introduce its latest Web privacy tool, called ``Digital Me,'' at 
an Internet trade show in New York today. 
</P>
<P>
	A Novell executive, Mike Sheridan, told Congress this year that  
the technology will let consumers cloak themselves behind different 
profiles to control what information Internet sites collect. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Enonymous Inc. released its clever, free software  
program, which warns consumers about each Web site's privacy 
promises whenever they're asked to surrender their name, e-mail 
address and other personal information. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, a small Internet startup based in San Diego, said  
it reviewed and rated the privacy guarantees of the 10,000 most 
popular Web sites, including those by Amazon.com Inc., America 
Online Inc. and Microsoft Corp. The tool means consumers won't need 
to study the fine print on promises, which can be hard to find and 
filled with legal jargon. 
</P>
<P>
	``For consumers who don't want to go through and read a privacy  
statement, this is a really great thing for them,'' said Michelle 
Slack, an analyst for Jupiter Communications, a New York research 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The software displays warnings for those sites with weak  
guarantees. Enonymous promised to update its ratings regularly and 
review new policies at Web sites other than the top 10,000 where 
its customers spend time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to be adversarial with Web sites,'' said David  
Taylor, the company's chief executive officer. ``We want them to 
realize it's good for business to have a good privacy policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and federal regulators have so far resisted calls for  
new national privacy laws protecting Internet users. They say these 
new products -- with names like Anonymizer, Privacy Bank, Freedom 
and Privaseek's Persona -- are laudable responses to consumer fears 
about shopping on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey this year by the Pew Research Center for the People and  
the Press found that 54 percent of people expressed some anxiety 
about computers and technology being used to invade their privacy. 
Women and the elderly worried most. 
</P>
<P>
	But profits, or the lack thereof, remain the main hurdle for  
companies selling privacy products. Many Web sites earn money 
selling targeted advertising or information about its customers 
from lists of visitors -- the same behaviors that privacy tools try 
to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's astonishingly difficult to make money out of privacy,''  
said Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy 
advocate. He cited ``an enormous economic incentive to extract 
information rather than protect it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't want to pay for privacy,'' Catlett said. ``It's  
like paying for clean air or clean drinking water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were making money, something would probably be  
wrong,'' joked Marc Rotenberg of the Washington-based Electronic 
Privacy Information Center. ``It will be interesting to see how 
these firms focusing on privacy are making it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enonymous said it plans to earn money acting as an  
``infomediary,'' a growing category of companies that shield the 
identities of their customers but pass to marketing companies and 
Web sites the demographic information its customers choose to 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies can then relay ads and information to specific  
types of consumers -- based on age, gender or interests -- without 
knowing their real-world identities because Enonymous acts as a 
trusted go-between. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at privacy specifically, nobody's made any money  
yet,'' allowed Abner Germanow, an Internet analyst for 
International Data Corp. ``Nobody's made tens of millions or 
hundreds of millions. But if you look at how Enonymous is planning 
on making its money, there are lots of very profitable companies 
that do similar things.''

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Said Plotting Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's opposition, which is  
seeking the ouster of Slobodan Milosevic, said Monday the Yugoslav 
president's government was willing to provoke bloodshed to stay in 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition leader Vuk Draskovic, meanwhile, said a traffic  
collision Sunday that injured him and killed four others was ``an 
obvious assassination attempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let those who did this think hard about what will happen to  
them,'' Draskovic told the private Studio B TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Draskovic was traveling in a convoy of three cars when a truck  
swerved, hitting two cars in the convoy and causing one of them to 
explode. Draskovic's car went off the road, and he suffered 
scratches and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver reportedly fled the scene of the accident, 25 miles  
southwest of Belgrade, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a clear sign that the regime is afraid of Draskovic,''  
said his associate, Borivoje Borovic. He said police were holding a 
suspect who might be the truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Government and police officials could not be reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alliance for Change, a rival group to Draskovic's Serbian  
Renewal Movement, said Milosevic's neo-communist allies were trying 
to provoke violence during protests to trigger a state of 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	But a state of emergency would not ``stop the people's  
rebellion'' in Serbia, said Vladan Batic, the alliance's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Monday, tens of thousands of Serbs took part in  
anti-Milosevic protests throughout Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, riot police prevented several thousand opposition  
supporters from marching toward the Serb Orthodox Church 
headquarters. Chanting ``Red Bandits,'' the angry demonstrators 
turned back and marched in central Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eastern Serbian town of Bor, the local branch of  
Draskovic's party joined the demonstrations. Draskovic and his 
party previously had refused to take part, saying demonstrations 
could lead to civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands have protested throughout Serbia since Sept.  
21, blaming Milosevic for the country's deep economic and social 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Batic said he ``wouldn't rule out'' that Milosevic's regime had  
tried to assassinate Draskovic. 
</P>
<P>
	Draskovic's close aide and brother-in-law, Veselin Boskovic, was  
killed, along with chief security adviser Zvonko Osmajlic and two 
bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
	Draskovic appeared Monday at a commemoration ceremony in the  
Belgrade City Hall. Tearful, he asked Belgraders to attend funerals 
on Tuesday and Wednesday for his four associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to rumors that police were targeting Draskovic, his party  
said an official who recently left Milosevic's ranks was 
``kidnapped'' last week. The official, who had worked for the 
secret police, had started working recently for Boskovic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parallel with beating up citizens who are peacefully  
protesting against the regime, the police are starting an even more 
sinister phase of spreading fear,'' the statement said. ``We think 
people will begin to disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, police arrested four opposition activists in central  
Serbia on Monday, and ordered an opposition leader to appear in 
court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vuk Obradovic was summoned after Milosevic's top aid, Deputy  
Premier Milovan Bojic, filed a lawsuit accusing Obradovic of 
ridiculing him during a rally. 
</P>
<P>
	A defiant Obradovic declared during Monday's rally that the  
regime was ``in paranoid fear.''

<HEADLINE> Ohio Senator Opposes Marijuana Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *With AM-Governor-Drugs    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Ohio senator introduced legislation Monday  
to overturn a referendum in which District of Columbia voters 
overwhelmingly approved legalization of marijuana for medical uses. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how well-intentioned the motive behind the initiative,  
Republican Sen. George Voinovich said, ``it would be unconscionable 
for the United States Congress not to exercise its constitutional 
duty and prevent the district from going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Illegal drug use is wrong,'' he said. ``The district  
government and the United States government should never condone 
it, regardless of the professed purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution gives to the District of Columbia limited  
self-government with most of the powers of the states but to 
Congress the power to override them. Voinovich heads a Senate 
subcommittee with authority over matters involving the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, by more than a 2-to-1 margin, Washington voters  
supported an initiative that created an exception to the 
prohibition on drug possession. The exception allowed physicians to 
recommend use of marijuana to ease symptoms of a serious illness 
such as AIDS or to reduce side effects of treatments such as 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone without prescriptions caught with marijuana would still  
be subject to the former punishments: six months in jail and a 
$1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Voinovich said the medical marijuana initiative ``would present  
an enforcement nightmare to police ... and would serve as a de 
facto legalization of marijuana in D.C., increasing its prevalence 
and the number of addicts citywide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar measure already was introduced in the House.  
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Anthony Williams has asked Congress ``to respect the will  
of the electorate'' and let the referendum stand. Congress ordered 
the district not to implement the referendum result in its budget 
for the new fiscal year, one of the attacks on home rule that 
prompted President Clinton to veto the bill.

<HEADLINE> AOL Offers New User Interface </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online is introducing an interactive  
calendar and expanding a digital photo service in anticipation of a 
world where people are not tied to their computers for Internet 
access. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said they designed the new AOL 5.0 user  
interface with wireless phones, hand-held organizers and other 
portable devices in mind. The software is scheduled for release in 
New York today. 
</P>
<P>
	The calendar feature, for instance, will let subscribers keep  
track of appointments and birthdays and exchange their kids' soccer 
schedules with one another. 
</P>
<P>
	But computer-based calendars are often impractical to use  
because they require people to be at a computer to find out where 
they need to be. AOL hopes to get around that restriction by making 
its system adaptable for portable devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst with the Internet research firm  
Jupiter Communications, said portable devices represent a largely 
untapped market and companies that enter it first have the 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's scrambling to figure out how users will interact in  
these devices,'' she said. ``It's becoming hypercompetitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 18 million subscribers using its flagship service  
worldwide, AOL is the largest Internet service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	The AOL 5.0 interface could help the company meet its stated  
goal of offering ``AOL Anywhere.'' The company also hopes the new 
features will encourage subscribers to stay online longer and allow 
AOL to boost rates for online ads. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the calendar, AOL will expand to the rest of the  
nation a digital photo service it runs with Eastman Kodak Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``You've Got Pictures'' service, tested in a few cities this  
past summer, allows photofinishers to send electronic copies of 
pictures to AOL accounts. From those accounts, consumers can 
arrange photos in online albums, send them as e-mail to friends and 
family, or order reprints and enlargements. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new interface, subscribers will be able to view  
pictures using portable devices as well, making them as mobile as 
photo albums. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL 5.0 will also recognize how computers connect to AOL so that  
those using higher-speed connections could get more video clips and 
other items that do not work as well at regular speeds. Such 
broadband access is only beginning to enter the home market. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, fearing it could be denied parts of the broadband market,  
is currently lobbying regulators to force AT&AMP;T and other cable 
providers to sell it access to high-speed cable data networks at 
wholesale prices. AOL already has deals with a satellite TV firm 
and phone companies to offer non-cable broadband services.

<HEADLINE>  Suns' Training Camp Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Even for a generally placid organization like the  
Phoenix Suns, enthusiasm was high on the eve of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	An offseason that added muscle inside and will pair Jason Kidd  
and Penny Hardaway in the same backcourt, had players and the front 
office beaming at the annual media day Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about what I see in the attitude of the guys  
coming in early, working on their game in the month of September,'' 
coach Danny Ainge said. ``I've never seen that in my seven years in 
Phoenix. So I think the players sense that there's something 
special going on here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practices start Tuesday on the Northern Arizona University  
campus and run through Oct. 12, when the team will return to 
Phoenix for the first exhibition game the next night. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen players made the trip to Flagstaff, but the spotlight  
is on Hardaway, acquired from Orlando on Aug. 5, center Oliver 
Miller, journeyman forwards Rodney Rogers and Corie Blount, and 
rookie swingman Shawn Marion. 
</P>
<P>
	All combine to make the Suns stronger, more athletic or both.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're more athletic than we've been in a long time,''  
Ainge said. ``I think we have more beef than we've had, and I think 
those guys are very skilled as well. They're good basketball 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The upgrade begins in the backcourt, where the 6-foot-7 Hardaway  
and 6-4 Kidd create instant matchup problems for other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, almost svelte at 6-9 and 318 pounds, apparently has his  
weight problem behind him and might be ready to reach the potential 
that convinced the Suns to draft him 22nd overall in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a role,'' he said. ``I'm just supposed to go lead  
the young guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several scouts considered Marion the best athlete in this year's  
draft, while Rogers and Blount bring toughness to a team that seems 
to be in the market for exactly that quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're both two good players around the basket,'' forward  
Clifford Robinson said. ``They do a real good job rebounding. 
Corey's a really good defender and Rodney's an exceptional scorer, 
so I think it's going to help our game in general just to be a 
little tougher around the basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rex Chapman is the only player on the roster who has been with  
the Suns three seasons. Kidd arrived in December 1996, and Robinson 
is starting his third campaign in the uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is the only other player who has spent more than a season  
with Phoenix, and he spent five years away after the Suns exposed 
him to the 1994 expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Gugliotta, whose 17-point average led the Suns in scoring  
last season, said the new arrivals were welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players are lucky when they have management like this that  
goes out and puts together a real nice team,'' Gugliotta said. 
``Now it's up to us as players to jell as fast as we can and go out 
and win games.''

and Penny Hardaway in the same backcourt, had players and the front 
office beaming at the annual media day Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about what I see in the attitude of the guys  
coming in early, working on their game in the month of September,'' 
coach Danny Ainge said. ``I've never seen that in my seven years in 
Phoenix. So I think the players sense that there's something 
special going on here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practices start Tuesday on the Northern Arizona University  
campus and run through Oct. 12, when the team will return to 
Phoenix for the first exhibition game the next night. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen players made the trip to Flagstaff, but the spotlight  
is on Hardaway, acquired from Orlando on Aug. 5, center Oliver 
Miller, journeyman forwards Rodney Rogers and Corie Blount, and 
rookie swingman Shawn Marion. 
</P>
<P>
	All combine to make the Suns stronger, more athletic or both.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're more athletic than we've been in a long time,''  
Ainge said. ``I think we have more beef than we've had, and I think 
those guys are very skilled as well. They're good basketball 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The upgrade begins in the backcourt, where the 6-foot-7 Hardaway  
and 6-4 Kidd create instant matchup problems for other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, almost svelte at 6-9 and 318 pounds, apparently has his  
weight problem behind him and might be ready to reach the potential 
that convinced the Suns to draft him 22nd overall in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a role,'' he said. ``I'm just supposed to go lead  
the young guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several scouts considered Marion the best athlete in this year's  
draft, while Rogers and Blount bring toughness to a team that seems 
to be in the market for exactly that quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're both two good players around the basket,'' forward  
Clifford Robinson said. ``They do a real good job rebounding. 
Corey's a really good defender and Rodney's an exceptional scorer, 
so I think it's going to help our game in general just to be a 
little tougher around the basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rex Chapman is the only player on the roster who has been with  
the Suns three seasons. Kidd arrived in December 1996, and Robinson 
is starting his third campaign in the uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is the only other player who has spent more than a season  
with Phoenix, and he spent five years away after the Suns exposed 
him to the 1994 expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Gugliotta, whose 17-point average led the Suns in scoring  
last season, said the new arrivals were welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players are lucky when they have management like this that  
goes out and puts together a real nice team,'' Gugliotta said. 
``Now it's up to us as players to jell as fast as we can and go out 
and win games.''

<HEADLINE> American Consumer Is Rare Breed / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The American consumer is a rare economic  
species, one worth studying and perhaps emulating by Third World 
countries as the global economy continues to develop. 
</P>
<P>
	Confidence, optimism and ambition are among America's most  
obvious characteristics. Somehow, things get better in America 
because people think they'll get better and then do something about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Professor George Katona, an immigrant who pioneered the  
study of consumers at the University of Michigan, once remarked 
that confidence and optimism differentiated Americans from 
Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	It was three decades ago when he made the observation in an  
interview. American-style optimism has obviously spread more 
broadly since then, but the U.S. consumer still retains unique 
traits. 
</P>
<P>
	That much was confirmed by the results of two surveys released  
this week, one from the Michigan university where Katona began his 
inquiries, the other from The Conference Board and others. 
</P>
<P>
	First the Michigan survey, directed by Richard T. Curtin, who  
continues the work begun by Katona. It begins: 
</P>
<P>
	``Confidence rose in September despite the recent hikes in  
interest rates and the widely held view among consumers that 
additional rate increases will occur during the year ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the environment that preceded the rise in confidence:  
</P>
<P>
	Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, had his hand on  
the trigger, ready to raise interest rates again. The stock market 
was terrorized about the threat of inflation. Economists warned 
that the near-record expansion was getting weary from age. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps even more pertinent, the same economists were expressing  
the view that the jobless rate, at a 30-year low, was defying the 
economic gods, and that it or consumer prices would soon rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers stood firm. A record number judged the economy  
favorably and three-quarters of them expected the jobless rate to 
remain at its current low throughout the year ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Curtin announced, ``the rise in interest rates had little  
impact on the near-record levels of favorable buying attitudes 
toward vehicles and other large purchases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Curtin: Even during the 1960s economic expansion, which  
still holds the longevity record, consumers began to lower 
expectations around the expansion's midpoint, nearly five years 
before it ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``In sharp contrast,'' he continued, ``rather than tempering  
their views after eight years of expansion, 1999 consumers became 
increasingly convinced the expansion would last another five 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody can say consumers are right or wrong; the future will  
answer that. In fact, when you consider that consumers continue to 
spend more than they earn, a mass hallucination may be at work. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, however, consumers have been right, the experts wrong.  
In some way, perhaps because they work to create their vision, they 
appear more erudite than those who pity them as irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board survey examined the opinions of residents  
around the world on the subject of corporate social responsibility. 
Among other things, this is what the survey found: 
</P>
<P>
	Americans demand a broader role for companies. ``Only 11 percent  
think companies should only focus on making a profit, paying taxes, 
employing people and obeying all laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What also should they focus on?  
</P>
<P>
	``Three times as many think they should also work to exceed  
lawful requirements, set higher ethical standards and help build a 
better society for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That attitude is pronounced among Americans (and North  
Americans), several times more likely to be expressed by them than 
by people in Kazakhstan, China, Nigeria and India. 
</P>
<P>
	Extrapolating, U.S. consumers, regardless of their good fortune,  
aren't easily satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	They want more for and from themselves and their companies,  
expect more, believe they can get more and are confident that if 
they continue to work, and they intend to, their confidence will be 
rewarded.

<HEADLINE> Hachette May Buy George Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hachette Filipacchi Magazines hopes to buy the  
Kennedy family's stake in George magazine, the political and 
lifestyle publication founded by John F. Kennedy Jr., who died in a 
July plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``No final agreement has been reached as yet but hopefully an  
agreement will be completed relatively soon,'' HFM spokesman Keith 
Estabrook said Monday. He declined to provide details about the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published Monday in The New York Times, the  
president and chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, 
Jack Kliger, said Hachette planned to purchase the Kennedy family's 
stake in George over the next two weeks and invest $10 million in 
the magazine over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Estabrook said Kliger was unavailable for comment. Calls to the  
Kennedy family were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hachette Filipacchi Magazines and the Kennedy family each own  
half of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been concerns after Kennedy's death in a July 16  
airplane crash about whether the four-year-old magazine could 
survive without him. In addition to being its founder, Kennedy was 
the editor. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kliger told the Times he ``came to believe there was a  
product based on John's vision that could exist without John if we 
could find a way to continue its distinct voice, but also if we 
could fix business issues like marketing and pricing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Hachette announced it would cut George to 10 issues  
a year next year from 12 but would guarantee advertisers a larger 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	It also recently cut the yearly subscription price to $9.97 from  
$17.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with the February 2000 issue, advertisers are being  
promised circulation of 450,000 per issue, up 12.5 percent from the 
current 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The new circulation guarantee is higher than the nearly 405,153  
which the Audit Bureau of Circulations says George achieved in the 
first six months of this year. That was down 3.4 percent from 
419,214 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertising pages have tumbled, falling 32 percent to 264 pages  
in the January-August period from 390 pages a year earlier, 
according to figures from Publishers Information Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Hachette publishes 28 consumer magazines including Car and  
Driver, Elle, Mirabella, Premiere and Woman's Day.

<HEADLINE> Clippers' Taylor Vows To Play Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Maurice Taylor promised Monday that the Los  
Angeles Clippers will get what they pay for, but said he definitely 
won't sign another contract with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be the same Maurice Taylor I was the first two  
seasons,'' the third-year forward said at the team's media day. 
``I'm just going to go out and play as hard as I can and do what I 
can to make the team win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For that, the Clippers are required to pay him $1.367 million  
this season. But Taylor, encouraged by agent David Falk, is seeking 
a six-year extension worth the NBA-maximum $70.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling refused to extend such an  
offer, leaving Taylor, who averaged a team-high 16.8 points with 
5.3 rebounds last season, as something of a lame-duck go-to-guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really wasn't any negotiation,'' Taylor said of  
Sterling's hard-line approach to the business of basketball. ``I 
don't think they showed me any loyalty. There's no way I'm going to 
re-sign here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers, who open training camp Tuesday at Los Angeles  
Southwest College, expect a big season from Taylor, even though 
Falk has vigorously encouraged a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	If Taylor isn't moved, the team could lose him without  
compensation next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's hurting me or him,'' Taylor said in  
reference to Sterling's decision. ``It's business. But I do feel 
sorry for the fans. I love the fans in L.A. I love everything about 
L.A. I love my teammates, and I feel like the fans are really 
getting cheated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clippers coach Chris Ford said he doesn't think the team will  
receive anything less than Taylor's best effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a great statement that he came here in great  
shape,'' Ford, beginning his second season with the Clippers, said 
of Taylor. ``I fully expect him to have a big year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers' other marquee media attraction, rookie forward  
Lamar Odom, was philosophical about the possibility of playing with 
Taylor for only one season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored to be on the same team with Mo, but this is the  
real world,'' Odom said. ``I'm just looking forward to be a part of 
this organization and a part of this league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting my whole life for this opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Leyland Says Goodbye To Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- When Todd Helton sprinted down the third-base line  
and slid safely into home, Jim Leyland bounded from the dugout to 
join a mob of jubilant Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	In their last game of the season Sunday, the Rockies overcame a  
ninth-inning deficit and rewarded their 54-year-old manager with 
the 1,067th victory of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The hugs, handshakes and 9-8 victory weren't quite enough to  
make Leyland reconsider his decision to walk away from Colorado 
with two years remaining on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have absolutely no second thoughts whatsoever,'' Leyland  
said. ``I'm very comfortable with my decision. I know that in the 
near future, they're going to have their third manager here, and I 
want to wish them the best in their selection process. I hope they 
get the right guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies thought they had the right guy when they signed  
Leyland to a three-year, $6 million contract last winter, but the 
result was the first last-place finish in franchise's seven-year 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's 72-90 record was the second-worst since the Rockies  
joined the National League in 1995. They went 67-95 that season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little embarrassed at the type of year we had,'' Leyland  
said. ``I don't really apologize to anybody but the fans. I gave it 
my best. It just wasn't good enough, but I do apologize to the fans 
because they were loyal and they stayed with us throughout the 
whole time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants, who finished 86-76, looked like they would spoil  
Leyland's farewell at Coors Field, taking leads of 2-0, 5-2, 7-4 
and 8-7. The Rockies came back each time, winning the game on Dante 
Bichette's RBI single and Edgard Clemente's sacrifice fly in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Bichette gave a fist pump after his run-scoring hit, and Helton  
was mobbed near home after he beat Armando Rios' strong throw from 
right field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won this one for Jim,'' Bichette said. ``I know it has been  
a disappointing year, but he's had a great career. We wanted to 
send him out with a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland was active throughout the game, pacing in the dugout and  
jogging out to dispute calls by second base umpire Hunter 
Wendelstedt in the fifth and first base umpire Steve Rippley in the 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument with Wendelstedt was animated, but Leyland went  
back to the dugout almost immediately after hearing Rippley's 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those games where you're still managing hard,''  
Leyland said. ``You're trying to win it. I wanted that game real 
bad. I'm not going to lie about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Leyland smiled and shook hands with Giants  
manager Dusty Baker and all four umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just said, `Good luck, man. I'll miss ya,''' Baker said.  
``I'll see him down the road. I'm sad for us to lose this game, but 
you've got to be happy for him to win his last game, so it's a 
double-edged sword of emotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, who won a World Series title with the Florida Marlins  
in 1997, is 1,067-1,127 in 14 years with Pittsburgh, Florida and 
Colorado. He told his players in September that he lacks the 
passion required for the daily rigors of managing. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to return to Pittsburgh and has expressed interest in  
remaining with the Rockies in some capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough, but I'm a big boy and I enjoyed it, and it was a  
great way to go out,'' Leyland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Detroit manager Buddy Bell reportedly is the early  
favorite to replace Leyland. Other candidates include New York 
Yankees third-base coach Willie Randolph and Cleveland hitting 
coach Charlie Manuel. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Giants have not won a season finale under Baker since  
the strike-shortened 1994 season. ... The Rockies set NL 
single-season records for total bases (2,696) and extra-base hits 
(567). The respective records had been held by the 1930 Chicago 
Cubs and 1930 St. Louis Cardinals. Colorado also had a team-record 
1,644 hits, the most in the NL since Philadelphia in 1930. ... San 
Francisco OF Marvin Benard scored 100 runs for the first time in 
his career and finished the season with seven straight hits. ... 
Bichette recorded his 1,000th career RBI.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Up in T-Bill Auction / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $8.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.730 percent, up from 4.720 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.870 percent, up from 4.810 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Aug. 30 when the  
bills sold for 4.875 percent. The six-month rate was the highest 
since Sept. 20 when the rate was 4.890. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.869 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,880.40 and 5.076 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,753.80. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 5.24 
percent last week from 5.23 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> 'Double Jeopardy' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy'' held onto the top spot at  
North American theaters over the weekend, taking in $17.2 million 
and fending off three new movies, according to industry estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The revenge drama starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones has  
earned $47.4 million in two weeks and had only a 26 percent drop in 
ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three Kings'' was No. 2, earning $16.3 million for the  
weekend. The Gulf War action thriller stars George Clooney, Ice 
Cube and Mark Wahlberg as American soldiers seeking a cache of 
Iraqi gold who get entangled with local rebels. Industry experts 
said it had the best chance of unseating ``Double Jeopardy,'' 
</P>
<P>
	``American Beauty'' the dark and funny depiction of suburban  
angst from Dreamworks, climbed to third place, earning $8.1 million 
despite showing in only 706 theaters. It averaged $11,473 per 
screen, by far the best among the top 10 films. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, explores  
issues ranging from infidelity to homophobia to mid-life crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Audiences seem to want hard-to-peg films with complicated  
themes, said film analyst Robert Bucksbaum of Reel Source Inc. 
``American Beauty'' fits that bill. Dreamworks' Jim Tharp said the 
studio is considering upping the number of theaters showing it to 
1,200 or 1,300 this week, based on the strong showing. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new films did middling business during the weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Joan Hart's film debut, ``Drive Me Crazy,'' opened at  
No. 6, just below powerhouse supernatural thriller ``The Sixth 
Sense,'' in its ninth week. ``The Sixth Sense'' earned an estimated 
$7.2 million, and ``Crazy'' $7.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muppet movie ``Elmo In Grouchland'' came in at No. 8 with  
$3.3 million, about what studio executives expected for a movie 
aimed at the under-10 set. And ``Mystery, Alaska,'' about a hopeful 
hockey team from the boondocks, started at No. 9 with $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucksbaum called the showing by ``The Sixth Sense'' phenomenal  
and said the top five films will probably stay around into the 
Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $17.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Three Kings,'' $16.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``American Beauty,'' $8.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Blue Streak,'' $8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $7.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Drive Me Crazy,'' $7.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``For Love of the Game,'' $3.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Elmo In Grouchland,'' $3.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Mystery, Alaska,'' $3.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Stigmata,'' $2.3 million.

<HEADLINE> Heinz Combining Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- H.J. Heinz Co. plans to combine its U.S. food,  
pet food and food-service businesses under the same division to 
improve distribution and attempt to gain increased bargaining power 
with retail chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The headquarters of the Star-Kist tuna and Heinz pet food brands  
will move from Newport, Ky. to Pittsburgh to the new Heinz Sales 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	William Johnson, Heinz's chief executive officer, said at a news  
conference Monday that he expects 80 to 100 people to make the move 
from Newport, where Star-Kist employs 425. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 100 to 150 people will be hired for Heinz's new  
headquarters for U.S. operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will market flagship products such as  
ketchup, pickles, tuna and Ore-Ida potatoes alongside beans, Bagel 
Bites and Pounce Hairball Treatment for cats. Heinz also has a new 
line of frozen foods under the Boston Market name. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz said it combined operations for faster distribution and  
development of new foods and to get bargaining power with grocery 
chains such as Albertson's, Super Valu and Kroger. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Star-Kist has been the 36th-largest supplier at  
Super Valu, and Heinz's frozen food business is 28th. But the 
combined Heinz food business would rank third at Super Valu and 
among the top five at all retail customers, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grocery and food industries are jockeying with one other for  
clout, leading to industrywide consolidation, Johnson said, though 
he declined to say whether Heinz would be one of those merging. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is consolidation to be done, we want to come at it  
from a position of strength, not one of individual weakness,'' 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Moran, now Heinz's vice president for U.S. retail sales,  
will be president of the new division. He joined the company 18 
months ago after working at Clorox and Procter &AMP; Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
	The move replaces a ``fragmented collection of business  
fiefdoms,'' Johnson said. He expects that it will save $25 million 
a year in combined personnel, computer, financial and other 
operations at the new Pittsburgh campus. 
</P>
<P>
	The combining businesses account for $5 billion of Heinz's $9  
billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz closed $44 Monday, up 37 1/2 cents on the New York Stock  
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Guards Accused of Arranging Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Four guards at one of the nation's  
toughest prisons went on trial Monday for allegedly setting up a 
prison-cell rape to punish an inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged incident took place at the notorious Corcoran State  
Prison, where eight other officers are accused of setting up 
gladiator-style battles among inmates for the guards' 
entertainment. They will be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is above the law,'' prosecutor Vernon Pierson told the  
jury as the four guards sat expressionless. 
</P>
<P>
	The guards are accused of putting Eddie Dillard, a 118-pound  
first-time offender, in the cell of Wayne Jerome Robertson, a 
6-foot-3, 230-pound sexual predator known as the ``Booty Bandit,'' 
to punish Dillard for kicking a female guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, a lifer, admitted to a grand jury that he sodomized  
Dillard and threatened to kill him if he put up a fight during the 
three days in 1993 when guards left the smaller man in the cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard, in prison for assault with a deadly weapon, had just  
been transferred from another prison, in part because he had kicked 
a female guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said the guards knew Robertson was Dillard's  
enemy -- Dillard had said so, in prison paperwork, because of a 
fight the two had at another prison. Prison policy forbids putting 
such inmates in the same cell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dillard should have never been put in the cell with me,  
period,'' Robertson testified to a grand jury. ``I mean, my 
background is no secret. ... The Corrections Department used me as 
a pawn to get to inmate Dillard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal trial in state court is the first in nearly a  
decade for guards at Corcoran, a maximum-security prison in the San 
Joaquin Valley. The prison was the nation's most deadly from 1989 
to 1995, when 43 inmates were wounded and seven shot to death by 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Two state investigations into abuses at Corcoran and alleged  
cover-ups by prison officials ended without criminal charges in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights groups claimed the investigations were shams,  
citing the $1 million in campaign donations the guards' union gave 
to Gov. Pete Wilson and Attorney General Dan Lungren. The union and 
both politicians denied they blocked the probes. 
</P>
<P>
	A special grand jury last year finally indicted the four guards  
-- Sgts. Robert Decker, 41, and Dale Brakebill, 34, and Officers 
Anthony Sylva, 36, and Joe Sanchez, 38 -- on charges of aiding and 
abetting the rape after a former prison guard broke ranks and 
supported Dillard's account. 
</P>
<P>
	The former guard, Roscoe ``Bonecrusher'' Pondexter, has admitted  
brutalizing inmates. ``It's never easy to break the code of 
silence. It took me five years,'' Pondexter told the Los Angeles 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of an FBI investigation, eight other guards face  
federal charges of staging gladiator-style fights by putting rival 
gang members in the exercise yard at the same time.

<HEADLINE> Group Sues Over Columbine Tiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Friends and relatives of victims in the Columbine  
High School massacre have sued the school district for refusing to 
display hallway tiles they made with religious symbols. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rutherford Institute, a conservative legal group, on Monday  
filed a federal lawsuit against the district on behalf of several 
people who want a court order forcing the school to display the 
tiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The premise is that this is a violation of our clients' First  
Amendment free speech rights,'' said Jim Rouse, an attorney with 
the Virginia-based institute which also represented Paula Jones in 
her sexual harassment case against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	School district spokeswoman Marilyn Saltzman declined comment,  
saying officials had not yet seen the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs were among those who were invited to paint  
commemorative 4-by-4-inch tiles that later were placed above 
lockers at the school before it reopened this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims school officials initially said the tiles  
could not depict religious symbols, then changed their minds and 
allowed them, only to change their minds again and remove the tiles 
with religious material. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs are Diedra and Donald Fleming, whose daughter,  
Kelly, was killed; Lisa Maurer, a friend of slain student Daniel 
Rohrbaugh; and Rohrbaugh's father, mother, stepfather and 
step-sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the April 20 massacre, disputes also have arisen over  
whether trees for the two gunmen should be included in a memorial 
garden for the victims, and whether one of the slain students said 
she believed in God just before being killed.

<HEADLINE> UC Davis RB Has Leg Amputated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIS, Calif. (AP) -- He was in the intensive care unit, his  
dislocated right knee not getting any better after nine days in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in a horrifying turn of events, UC Davis running back Sam  
Paneno got the word from his doctors: His leg would have to be 
amputated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them, `Go for it, just cut it off,''' Paneno said. ``I  
was actually a little bit excited. I had been in ICU and nothing 
was helping. This seemed like the final solution to my problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His problems began during a game against Western Oregon on Sept.  
11. This was the best game of his career, but it was also his last. 
</P>
<P>
	The sophomore had run for 114 yards on 26 carries and two  
touchdowns. Paneno was tackled on the first play of overtime in a 
game his Aggies would win 40-33. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know what happened,'' Paneno said. ``I've  
looked at it on film and I still can't tell. All I know is I was 
rushing and the next minute I was hurting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Jeff Hogan was the first to get to Paneno. Hogan said  
Paneno's injury was probably the worst he had seen in 19 years in 
sports medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan and team doctor David Cosco popped Paneno's knee into  
place and an ambulance took him to the hospital in Salem, Ore. The 
damage was extensive. He had a crushed an artery, blocking blood 
flow to the lower leg that caused nerve and tissue damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine days and several operations later, doctors told him they  
would have to cut off his lower leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Fred Mueller, a sports medicine researcher at the University  
of North Carolina, said such injuries are rare. Mueller tracks 
sports injuries and says better equipment and new rules account for 
the drop. In the last five years, there have been seven 
catastrophic disabilities among the 75,000 college football players 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Paneno is taking the loss of his leg as if it's just another  
football injury. The 22-year-old player credits his faith for his 
outlook. He still plans on surfing and beating his rock-climbing 
record of 9,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone says I'll eventually feel the loss,'' he said. ``But  
as far as I'm concerned, everything happens for a reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Biggs, coach at UC Davis the last 22 years, is inspired by  
Paneno's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just days ago this young man had to deal with his leg being  
cut off,'' he said. ``It's remarkable, but knowing him, not too 
surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biggs recruited Paneno out of high school, but lost him to the  
University of Hawaii. Paneno later transferred to Davis, on the 
outskirts of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Paneno plans to take off the rest of this school quarter to get  
used to his prosthetic leg. He expects to return to school in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	His amputation has led to an outpouring of support from across  
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just really appreciated it,'' he said. ``I was surprised  
by the volume of the response, it's so overwhelming. I can't 
believe the attention, the love. It's so great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paneno can receive notes in a Web site set up by a Division II  
Football e-mail group. Some 200 messages of encouragement have been 
sent so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the messages echo the sentiments of John Fitzgerald, a  
star offensive guard from the University of Central Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a player, I can't even comprehend what you must be going  
through, but I know that as a competitor, you won't quit,'' he 
said. ``If your spirit is anything like the tradition of the 
Aggies, you will prosper and be a stronger person when it is said 
and done.''

</P>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Raymond Alf, a teacher who inspired  
students with his unusual teaching styles and founded the Raymond 
M. Alf Museum of Paleontology, died Monday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Alf taught math and biology at Webb Schools, where he was known  
to swing from pipes to demonstrate evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Alf, who began at Webb as a tutor in 1929, led hundreds of  
students on field trips around the western United States to collect 
fossils. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1940s, after Alf and his student had accumulated  
about 20,000 pieces -- pig skulls to alligator jaws and dinosaur 
tracks -- he began pushing for a museum. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 years later the museum bearing his name was opened on  
the Webb campus and has since drawn scores of professional 
paleontologists and educated a legion of students.

	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Walter Bergman, a civil rights  
activist and a founder of the Michigan chapter of the ACLU and the 
Michigan Federation of Teachers, died Wednesday. He was 100. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the Freedom Riders, Bergman was among those attacked  
on Mother's Day, 1961, by Ku Klux Klan members and other vigilantes 
in Anniston, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergman was knocked to the floor, pounded with fists and stomped  
on his head, neck and shoulders. Doctors believe a stroke he 
suffered months later stemmed from the beating. He was 61 at the 
time and spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the government  
on behalf of Bergman after it was learned the FBI was aware of -- 
but did not stop -- the planned attack on the Freedom Riders. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergman, a professor at Wayne State and the University of  
Michigan, devoted himself to activism after retiring from an 
academic career in the early 1960s.

chief executive officer of Alltel Corp., died Thursday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Case was 14 when he started as a line crew member in 1934 with  
the company, then known as Hudson Underground Telephone Co. He 
worked his way up to general manager and to president of the 
company known as Western Reserve Telephone Co. 
</P>
<P>
	After making several acquisitions, Case founded Mid-Continent  
Telephone Co., which merged in 1983 with Allied Telephone Co. to 
form Alltel Corp. He was chairman and chief executive until he

operations for improving the speech of patients who lost their 
voice boxes to cancer, died Sept. 21. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Conley, an otolaryngologist, also developed operations for  
rehabilitating the larynx, grafting facial nerves and 
reconstruction after the loss of the jaw to cancer. He developed 
the idea of single-stage rehabilitation after extensive head and 
neck surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He pioneered reconstruction methods for the cheek and face as an  
Army surgeon in World War II, and developed further innovations in 
the 1960s and early 1970s. In the early 1990s, he founded the John 
Conley Foundation for Ethics and Philosophy in Medicine. 
</P>

	CROWN POINT, Ind. (AP) -- Former Bishop Norbert Gaughan, who  
fought the Vatican's move to scale back his duties as bishop of the 
Roman Catholic Diocese of Gary after suffering a series of strokes, 
died Friday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaughan was installed as the second bishop of the Gary Diocese  
in July 1984. He moved the center of diocesan operations from the 
main cathedral in beleaguered Gary to a new $1.3 million ``pastoral 
center'' in nearby suburban Merrillville. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaughan suffered a stroke in April 1989, followed by a severe  
second stroke in February 1992 that kept him from his duties for 
three months. Pope John Paul II appointed Bishop Dale Melczek, then 
auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Detroit, to handle the 
diocese's administrative duties. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1993, Gaughan traveled to Rome to appeal to the pope

</P>
<P>
	He became head of BBC Scotland in 1975 and held the post three

salesman who helped establish Sony Corp, died Sunday of pneumonia. 
He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Morita co-founded Sony in a bombed-out department store after  
World War II. He was the last of a generation of Japanese 
industrialists that included carmaker Soichiro Honda and 
electronics rival Konosuke Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Morita's guidance, Sony was instrumental in changing  
Japan's image from a maker of slipshod products to a world leader 
in high-quality automobiles and electronics. In the process, his 
company became a multibillion dollar conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Morita retired as Sony's chairman in 1994. A year earlier he had  
suffered a stroke that left him weakened and in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	He caused a stir in 1989 by co-authoring ``The Japan That Can  
Say 'No''' with current Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara. In it, Morita 
criticized U.S. corporate culture as overindulgent.

<HEADLINE> Mattel Shares Plunge 28 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- A profit warning by Mattel Inc. is  
raising speculation about whether Jill E. Barad will remain at the 
helm of the company that's home to the Barbie and Hot Wheels toys. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel stock plummeted nearly 30 percent Monday after Barad  
announced that the company's children's software subsidiary, The 
Learning Company, will lose $50 million to $100 million in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That could put pressure on Mattel's board to replace the  
embattled Barad with new management. Some institutional investors 
already were pressing quietly for a change, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally like Jill Barad, but I suspect there is some  
pressure from institutional shareholders for change,'' said Erik 
Gustafson, a portfolio manager at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham Inc., which 
holds nearly 5 million Mattel shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been continual suggestion by outside commentators,  
including institutional investors, that the board consider a new 
management team,'' he said. ``I suspect this exacerbates that and 
makes the call for change even louder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barad, who is forsaking a seat on Microsoft's board to focus on  
Mattel, has the ``full support'' of the company's board of 
directors, spokesman Glenn Bozarth said. She was not available for 
interviews, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel was expected to provide more detail on the loss when  
third quarter results are released Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's drop in the share price was the most dramatic in a long  
slide for Mattel stock. Shares have lost 74 percent of their value 
since hitting a 10-year peak of $46 3/4 in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Barad, 48, was named chairwoman and chief executive officer in  
1997 after building the Barbie brand from a $200 million-per-year 
line into an industry giant with annual sales of $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's slide has raised questions of whether Barad could  
handle the top job, said Jim Silver, editor of The Toy Book, an 
industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody knows for sure, but obviously you would  
have to guess the board is watching things closely,'' Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Learning Company isn't the only problem that Barad faces.  
Hasbro, the No. 2 U.S. toymaker, has gained on Mattel ground with 
mega-hits like Furby, Pokemon dolls and ``Star Wars'' action 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's president and chief operating officer left earlier this  
year. And it was announced Monday that Mattel Media President David 
Haddad was quitting to head eParties, an online party supply 
company launched by Internet incubator eCompanies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mattel has lacked hit product power, and has been facing  
internal management turmoil for quite some time,'' Jill Krutick, an 
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, wrote in a message to clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Krutick cut her earnings estimate for all of 1999 by nearly  
half, from $1.35 per share to 76 cents a share. Estimates for 2000 
earnings from $1.75 per share to $1. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel blamed the disappointing profits on a range of problems,  
including higher-than-expected returns of The Learning Company 
merchandise, a lost licensing deal, bad debts and termination of 
agreements with some distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's core businesses remain sound, Barad said in a brief  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, The Learning Company performance masks the  
underlying vitality of our core U.S. business,'' Barad said. ``This 
strength was most evident in over-the-counter sales improvements 
for Barbie, Fisher-Price and our Wheels brands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for those brands exceeded Mattel's capacity to ship by  
more than $100 million, she said. Excess orders will be filled 
early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter results will be released Oct. 21, the company  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel acquired The Learning Company earlier this year for $3.8  
billion in stock as part of an effort to tap the growing market for 
sophisticated, interactive toys. The Learning Company's software 
titles include Carmen Sandiego, American Greetings, The Print Shop, 
Riven and Myst. 
</P>
<P>
	A third-quarter loss is especially disturbing because investors  
were expecting positive results that would show Mattel was managing 
the acquisition and resolving its other problems, said Gustafson. 
</P>
<P>
	``A major miss,'' he said. ``We thought the company was healing  
and in better shape, and that business was good. In some of their 
core product lines, it was good. But this complete, devastating 
miss at The Learning Company has just caught all of us by 
surprise.''

<HEADLINE> JFK Administration Reunites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The last time so many former members of John F.  
Kennedy's administration were under one roof was the 35th 
president's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	In a class reunion of sorts, dozens gathered Sunday to celebrate  
the 20th anniversary of the library and museum built in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very moving experience,'' said Theodore Sorensen, 71,  
former special counsel to Kennedy. ``This was a very special 
group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A panel discussion featuring Sorensen, former assistant attorney  
general Burke Marshall and historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. focused 
on their former boss' achievements, from avoiding nuclear disaster 
to fostering loyalty and honesty in his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Decrying ``the new cynicism about American politics,''  
Schlesinger recalled Kennedy's ability to inspire both a nation and 
a young group of staffers he called on for help in running the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a youthful time, a youthful administration, a young  
president,'' said Stewart Udall, 79, former Secretary of the 
Interior. ``At a time when there's so much gridlock and stupidity 
in Washington, it might be productive for the younger generation to 
recreate and understand what happened (during Kennedy's tenure).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forum, part of a monthlong series of events to commemorate  
the 20th anniversary of the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum, was 
attended by more than 40 members of the administration and hundreds 
of members of the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration was to resume today, with Kennedy's daughter,  
Caroline Kennedy, co-sponsoring a forum on citizenship and 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Daly, executive director of the library and former staff  
assistant to Kennedy, said the reunion was meant to be a festive 
occasion to celebrate the president's legacy and give the public 
``a sense of what it was like then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the faces have changed a bit,'' he said. ``But it was  
very gratifying.''

<HEADLINE> Dutch Police Fight Internet Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch police opened their fight  
against Internet crime Monday, naming 15 ``cybercops'' who will 
target on-line offenses ranging from pedophilia to credit card 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will patrol the country's Internet sites in search of  
on-line crime, using new computer surveillance equipment and 
old-fashioned police techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will go after all crime committed on the Internet and  
that could range from child pornography to credit card fraud, or 
the sale of illegal medicine and software,'' said police spokesman 
Albert Folgerts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet officers will be able to tap phone lines and with a  
court order will even be permitted to crack into computer systems 
to find incriminating evidence -- the virtual equivalent of a search 
warrant.

<HEADLINE> Search On for 3-Year-Old in Colo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- About 40 people were searching on  
Monday for a 3-year-old boy who had disappeared two days earlier 
while hiking with family and friends. Fear for his safety was 
growing by the hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaryd Atadero of Littleton was walking in between two groups of  
relatives and friends in Poudre Canyon on Saturday afternoon when 
he vanished. The boy's parents were not on the hike. 
</P>
<P>
	The terrain is so rocky that search dogs have to wear pads on  
their feet, said Larimer County sheriff's deputy Cindy Gordon. 
Divers have searched the Poudre River several times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time is essential,'' Ms. Gordon said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jaryd was wearing clothes warm enough to get him through the  
freezing temperatures of Saturday and Sunday nights. Higher 
temperatures, with lows in the low 40s, were forecast for Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, an Air Force helicopter crashed as it was carrying  
rescuers on the search for Jaryd. Five people on board suffered 
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	A private company provided a search helicopter Monday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> IBM, AT&AMP;T Offer Cos. Web Packages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM and AT&AMP;T are pooling their huge marketing  
resources to try to attract small- and mid-sized companies seeking 
to exploit the promise of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest computer company and the No. 1 U.S.  
telecommunications provider plan to sell a combined package of 
package of products and services to help businesses set up Web 
sites for handling transactions, sales and communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual alliance underscores the huge potential market in  
business customers trying to cut costs and boost sales by using the 
Internet. While large corporations are far along in developing 
Internet presences, many smaller companies are just getting 
started. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM plans to sell computers and software for running the Web  
sites while AT&AMP;T will provide Internet connections to customers. 
The price for the package starts at $35,000, said a source familiar 
with the alliance, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies would not comment ahead of an announcement  
Wednesday on the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	The offering will be jointly sold by IBM's and AT&AMP;T. While IBM  
has a huge sales force, targeting many thousands of small- and 
mid-sized businesses requires the far-flung resources of 
third-party distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies will pool their immense marketing resources to  
promote the products. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance comes as the battle rages to attract business  
customers drawn to the Web's potential. A recent study by Giga 
Information Group estimates that corporations around the world will 
save up to $1.25 trillion -- close to France's entire gross domestic 
product -- by doing business over the Internet by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Those savings range from reducing the amount of people it takes  
to process a sales request to making it easier and less expensive 
to order office supplies online.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Bidding War for Sprint Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A bidding war has erupted for the Sprint Corp.,  
with two companies reportedly offering as much as $100 billion for 
the nation's third-largest long-distance telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's board members met Sunday to compare a $93 billion offer  
from MCI Worldcom Inc. with a $100 billion offer from BellSouth 
Corp., sources familiar with the issue told The New York Times, USA 
Today and The Wall Street Journal. MCI's offer is a stock swap and 
BellSouth's a combination of cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks were said to be continuing.  
</P>
<P>
	Such a deal would be the largest takeover ever, eclipsing last  
year's $82.5 billion merger agreement between the Exxon Corp. and 
the Mobil Corp. The effect might not be immediately apparent to 
consumer because telephone rates are already competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquiring Sprint could yield billions in cost savings for MCI  
Worldcom or BellSouth by eliminating overlapping operations and 
expanding product lines. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI Worldcom is the No. 2 long-distance carrier. BellSouth is  
the dominant provider of local phone service in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications companies have scrambled to consolidate for  
greater reach, increased financial clout and the ability to offer 
local, long-distance, wireless and Internet access services. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint has an extensive long-distance network and a collection  
of local telephone operations around the nation. It also has a 
national wireless network and one of the major networks through 
which other companies provide Internet access to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint-MCI Worldcom would be a competitor with the AT&AMP;T Corp.,  
which would remain the nation's largest long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal is subject to approval by antitrust regulators. No Bell  
company has yet received approval to offer long-distance service in 
its local-service region.

<HEADLINE> Ginsburg Back on Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seventeen days after undergoing surgery for  
colon cancer, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was on the 
bench today as the nation's highest court opened its 1999-2000 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg, looking slightly thinner and paler than usual, smiled  
broadly as she took her place at the end of the bench. Before 
taking her seat, she smiled at her husband, Martin, and two grown 
children, James and Jane, who were in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	She asked 12 questions of lawyers arguing the first of two cases  
heard by the court today. 
</P>
<P>
	Issuing a flurry of orders on opening day, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Turned away arguments that Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former radio  
reporter sentenced to death for the 1981 killing of a Philadelphia 
policeman, was denied a fair trial. However, there is little 
likelihood he will be executed soon. 
</P>
<P>
	--Let Knox County, Tenn., school officials require drug testing  
of everyone offered a teaching job. Without comment the court 
rejected a teachers group's argument that such tests are 
unconstitutional if officials do not suspect the tested individual 
of using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Turned away challenges to Arizona's program allowing up to $500  
in tax credits for contributions for scholarships at religious and 
other private schools. Justices refused to review a state court 
decision that the credits do not violate the Constitution's 
requirement for separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	--Left standing a ruling that participation by Michael Montalvo,  
a Colonial Heights, Va., 12-year-old with AIDS, in a 
rough-and-tumble karate school would pose too much of a threat to 
the health and safety of other students. 
</P>
<P>
	As is court custom, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist made no  
mention of Ginsburg's recent illness as he declared the new term 
open. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of Ginsburg's colon was removed during her surgery on Sept.  
17, but last week court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said doctors found 
that the cancer had not spread to any lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg, 66, fell ill this summer while teaching in Crete, and  
initially was treated for acute diverticulitis, a gastric disorder. 
Arberg said last week that the severe abdominal inflammation for 
which Ginsburg was first treated was unrelated to the colon cancer, 
but it led doctors to discover the tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	The justice went home from Washington Hospital Center last  
Tuesday. While she was in the hospital, she participated in the 
court's consideration of a number of cases granted review in 
advance of today's term opening. 
</P>
<P>
	Also sitting in the courtroom's guest section today was retired  
Justice Byron R. White, the only living retired justice.

<HEADLINE> Bradley: Clinton Health Plan Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seizing upon the day's headlines, Democratic  
presidential candidate Bill Bradley scored the Clinton-Gore 
administration a failure in helping Americans secure health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore's proposal to expand the Children's  
Health Insurance Program to extend coverage to nearly every child 
``simply modifies the programs whose success rates are clearly in 
question,'' Bradley said Monday in a statement from his New Jersey 
campaign headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The former senator from New Jersey was reacting to a Census  
Bureau report finding that the number of Americans without health 
insurance increased by nearly 1 million -- to 44.3 million -- last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye on Gore's child-focused health plan that builds on  
the Clinton administration's agenda, Bradley said: ``It's clear 
that the current federal programs for children, Medicaid and the 
Children's Health Insurance, are not achieving their goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to stop nibbling around the edges and live up to the  
challenge of providing affordable health care to everyone in 
America,'' Bradley continued. 
</P>
<P>
	His statement reflected a new dynamic in the tightened  
Bradley-Gore race for the Democratic nomination: the eagerness of 
each side to draw direct and sharp contrasts with the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has proposed $65 billion in government subsidies and tax  
breaks to help individuals pay for health insurance. He estimates 
his plan would extend insurance coverage to at least 95 percent of 
the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane countered that Bradley's proposal --  
projected over 10 years -- would blow almost as much of the federal 
budget surplus as ``the Republicans' risky tax scheme'' and would 
also ``imperil Medicare and Social Security.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese, Gold Funds Gain in 3rd Q / Mutual Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Third-quarter mutual fund performance was down  
virtually across the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, the only two fund sectors to see the kind of  
double-digit growth investors have come to expect in the 1990s were 
categories that have been pummeled through much of the decade -- 
funds related to Japan and gold, according to Lipper Inc., a New 
York firm that tracks mutual fund performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire mutual fund industry got caught in the overall market  
downdraft that saw the Dow Jones industrial average shed 1,000 
points, or 9 percent, during the final weeks of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a typical September, which has historically been a  
difficult time for stocks, and that took a lot of spark out of the 
mutual fund market,'' said Robert Walsh, a portfolio manager with 
King Investment Advisors in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said three factors contributed to the third quarter  
downturn: fears that the Federal Reserve Board would raise interest 
rates for a third time this year to keep inflation at bay; concerns 
that Y2K computer bugs could hurt companies' ability to do 
business; and the dollar's recent slide against foreign currencies, 
especially the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider some of the dismal performance figures: Diversified  
United States stock funds, whose portfolios include stocks from 
similar-sized companies but from a number of different industries, 
were down on average 5.37 percent; and sector funds, whose 
portfolios include stocks from the same industries, fell an average 
of 3.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Within those categories, certain popular niches stood out for  
their dismal performances. For example, diversified funds that 
track the performance of the S&AMP;P 500 index fell an average of 6.35 
percent. And funds that focus on financial services stocks fell 
12.68 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The science and technology fund group, which rose an average of  
7.02 percent, was the only sector to record the kind of 
performances mutual fund investors have grown accustomed to in the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Japanese and gold oriented funds rose 22.78 percent  
and 19.21 percent, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese funds clearly benefited from the dollar's decline  
against the yen. As the dollar plunged to 3 1/2-year lows against the 
yen and Japan's economy recovered from recession, many foreign 
investors pulled their money out of U.S. funds and put it into 
Japanese funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific region funds rode the Japanese wave to an average 8.35  
percent third quarter gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin American funds stumbled, however, losing an average of  
10.25 percent on fears that economies in that region aren't 
developing the types of cutting edge technologies, such as the 
Internet, analysts said. Other emerging markets funds fell 6.73 
percent on average on similar concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	International gold stocks got an unexpected boost late last  
month when a group of European central banks decided to put a cap 
on their sales of gold bullion. The announcement triggered the 
biggest one day price increase for gold in 13 years, and pushed the 
price of South African gold stocks up an average of 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	World prices for the metal have been falling for two decades  
since peaking at $875 an ounce in January 1980 -- a time when the 
U.S. inflation rate was in double figures, oil prices were rising 
rapidly and Soviet troops were entering Afghanistan. Gold has 
historically been a haven for investors in times of turmoil, but 
less so in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Athletics Encouraged by Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- It lasted for just one day in August. Yet  
it provided what the Oakland Athletics hope was a glimpse into 
their future. 
</P>
<P>
	The A's, picked by many observers to finish last in the AL West,  
flirted with the playoffs and put together their first winning 
season since 1992 while improving by 13 games over last season -- 
the biggest increase in victories in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	It all came together on Aug. 22, when the A's defeated Toronto  
4-3 and took advantage of a loss by the Boston Red Sox to move into 
sole possession of the top spot in the chase for the AL wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they fell into a tie with Boston the next day, and within  
a week were trailing the Red Sox for good, the A's showed that a 
young, low-budget team can compete for a postseason spot. 
</P>
<P>
	With a $22.8 million opening-day payroll that ranked among the  
five lowest in the majors, and with a team sprinkled with rookies 
and second-year players, Oakland had the best home record in the AL 
(52-29) and posted the league's third-best ERA (4.69). 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a successful season, a big step in the right  
direction,'' manager Art Howe said. ``I think these guys have had 
about as much enjoyment in this season as they've had in any 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those enjoying it the most was Randy Velarde, traded from  
the Anaheim Angels to the A's along with pitcher Omar Olivares on 
July 29. Instead of selling off players before the trade deadline, 
as they had in recent seasons, the A's obtained several players as 
part of their playoff push. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Velarde and Olivares, the A's got Kevin Appier  
from Kansas City and -- as part of the trade that sent Kenny Rogers 
and Billy Taylor to the New York Mets -- got Jason Isringhausen, who 
converted all eight of his save chances for Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming over here rekindled my spirit and made me excited to  
play every day,'' Velarde said. ``To come over to a team that was 
in contention and be a part of that was inspiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Velarde was one of several A's to put together a stellar season.  
He hit .317 and became the sixth major league player with 200 hits 
in a season in which he played for two clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Giambi hit .315, had 33 homers and drove in 123 runs, one  
short of the Oakland record set by Jose Canseco in 1988. John Jaha, 
signed as a free agent last winter when other teams rejected him 
because of foot problems, made the All-Star team while hitting 35 
homers and driving in 111 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Stairs led the team with 38 homers and had 102 RBIs. Ben  
Grieve overcame a deep slump in the first half of the season to hit 
28 homers and drive in 86 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	On the mound, Gil Heredia went 13-8 and was the only pitcher to  
throw 200 innings for the A's. Tim Hudson, who started the season 
in the Double-A minors, went 11-2 with a 3.23 ERA while outdueling 
Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen had a 2.13 ERA in 20 appearances and made himself a  
top candidate to become the closer the A's have been searching for 
since the departure of Dennis Eckersley. 
</P>
<P>
	While the A's improved significantly on the field, the situation  
deteriorated off the field. A deal was finally worked out to sell 
the team to local buyers who promised to keep the club in Oakland, 
but major league owners tabled that deal and left the franchise's 
future in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
	And while attendance improved to 1.4 million fans from 1.2  
million the previous season, the A's still had one of the worst 
home attendance marks in the majors. Even when the team was in the 
playoff race, a three-game series against Minnesota drew fewer than 
23,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The A's hope the growth of players such as Grieve, Hudson and  
shortstop Miguel Tejada will continue the turnaround next year, but 
Howe knows a few offseason moves could be the key to success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to need some veterans to come in next season to  
keep this going,'' he said. ``And we're going to need the right 
guys.''

<HEADLINE> House Approves Rail Accident Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Victims of Amtrak accidents and their families  
would receive more coordinated help under a bill the House passed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rail Passenger Disaster Family Assistance Act would require  
rail companies to come up with a written plan of action for dealing 
with accidents. Attorneys would be prohibited from soliciting the 
victims' families for 45 days following an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, introduced by Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., was passed  
by voice vote with little debate. The Senate has not yet acted. 
</P>
<P>
	It would require the National Transportation Safety Board to  
assign a person to help the families of passengers involved in an 
accident. That person would serve as a contact person in the 
federal government and act as a liaison between the families and 
the rail carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would require the board to designate a nonprofit  
organization to provide counseling and other support to the 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Rail companies also would be required to provide as complete a  
passenger list as possible to the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Amtrak is the only rail passenger service that would  
be affected by the legislation. The bill would apply only to 
accidents within the United States involving interstate, intercity 
rail carriers or intrastate high-speed rail carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	It would not apply to accidents involving tourist, historic or  
excursion rail carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Petri, R-Wis., said the bill was modeled on a system  
of family support enacted after the crash of TWA Flight 800. That 
jetliner, en route to Paris, exploded off the coast of Long Island 
shortly after takeoff from New York on July 17, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Japan Sees Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In a mixed signal about Japan's prospects for  
economic recovery, the central bank reported today a steep rise in 
business confidence but a drop in business investment plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In its closely-watched quarterly ``tankan'' survey, the Bank of  
Japan said sentiment among large manufacturers had brightened over 
the last survey to a figure of minus 22 from minus 37, it's biggest 
improvement since November 1987. The result exceeded analysts' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The tankan measures the percentage of firms seeing business  
conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen. 
The bank surveyed 9,275 companies in September for the latest 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Large manufacturers are also optimistic that conditions will  
improve by the next survey. They see sentiment advancing to a 
figure of minus 16 by December. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentiment also improved in all categories of company surveyed,  
from big nonmanufacturers to small manufacturers. And all see 
further improvement by December. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tankan also showed that business investment continues to  
taper off in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The worse-than-expected capital spending figures for this fiscal  
year could yet spoil Japan's nascent economic recovery, traders in 
financial markets said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the central bank survey, large corporation capital  
spending index for this fiscal year is seen falling to minus 9.4 
from minus 5.8 in the last quarter. It's the lowest figure since 
September 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was released on the heels of two straight quarters of  
growth in Japan's economy and a drop in the jobless rate from a 
record high. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's gross domestic product -- the measure of all goods and  
services produced within its borders -- expanded 2 percent for the 
first quarter of the year after more than a year of recession. It 
followed that up with a gain of 0.2 percent in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the government announced that the unemployment rate  
fell to 4.7 percent in August from a record high of 4.9 percent the 
previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy has been struggling to emerge from its deepest  
downturn in a half century. Some analysts still urged caution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tankan numbers show an improvement that exceeds  
expectations, but I'm skeptical that this can continue,'' said 
Yoshio Shukuwa, a market economist at Sanwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still worries about this economic recovery --  
specifically, the rising yen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks got a small lift from the report. The benchmark 225-issue  
Nikkei Stock Average closed up 51.15 points, or 0.29 percent, to 
17,763.71. On Friday, the index climbed 107.10 points, or 0.61 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Japanese yen gave up early gains against the dollar on  
news of the drop in business investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar wound up at 106.11 yen on the Tokyo foreign  
exchange market today, up 0.17 yen from late Friday and also above 
its late Friday level of 104.96 yen in New York. The greenback 
traded from 104.42 yen to 106.22 yen during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	While down for the day, the yen still is near the 3 1/2-year high  
reached last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities fear that if the yen becomes too strong, the  
country's budding economic recovery could be endangered as profits 
at big exporters suffer. A stronger yen makes Japanese products 
more expensive in overseas markets.

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Offense Hits Bad Patch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jerome Bettis isn't campaigning to get the  
ball more, even though the Pittsburgh Steelers' offense keeps 
getting less and less yardage when Kordell Stewart has it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it is,'' Bettis said Monday, a day after a  
second straight touchdown-less Sunday afternoon. ``All I know is, 
we're not playing Steelers football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question is what kind of football that would be. Four games  
into the season, Bettis doesn't have a 100-yard game -- and the 
Steelers' starting offense doesn't have a touchdown in two home 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Much like the NFL revived instant replay this season, the  
Steelers' slow-go offense is a replay of December. Throw out the 
opening night 43-0 rout of expansion Cleveland, and Stewart has led 
two touchdown drives in seven games, six of them losses. 
</P>
<P>
	It gets worse.  
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers had never lost more than three consecutive home  
games since moving into Three Rivers Stadium 1970, but now have 
lost four in a row -- their longest streak since they played in Pitt 
Stadium in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers' offense hasn't been so bad since the Nixon  
administration -- not Richard Nixon, but Mike Nixon, who was 2-12 in 
his only season as coach in 1965. The Steelers didn't score more 
than 22 points in a game that season. 
</P>
<P>
	They've changed offensive coordinators, systems and their  
philosophy this season. But what the Steelers haven't changed are 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
	They have lost seven of nine dating to last season, a span in  
which their offense -- throwing out the Cleveland game -- has scored 
74 points. That's barely a touchdown a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the blame is falling upon Stewart, but he's not getting  
much help from receivers who can't get open and an offensive line 
that can't protect him. Even All-Pro center Dermontti Dawson had a 
rare bad game in last week's 29-10 loss to Seattle, and that was 
before Stewart was sacked four times against Jacksonville, twice 
for safeties. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second week in a row the Steelers' offensive starters  
have been outscored by the opposing defense. Seattle did it last 
week as Merton Hanks returned an interception for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	And while he's not getting much help, these numbers don't lie:  
in his last eight games, Stewart has two touchdown passes and 12 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have time to throw the ball, and when he does,  
we're not getting open,'' receiver Hines Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers' defense has yielded one touchdown in two games,  
yet wound up a loser both times. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're playing a good team like Jacksonville, you've got  
to make plays, and we're not making them,'' said Bettis, who has 
232 rushing yards in four games -- or 126 fewer than last season. 
``When we need a big play, we can't make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart hasn't been the same quarterback since the Steelers let  
Yancey Thigpen leave after the 1997 season, when Stewart threw for 
21 touchdowns and ran for 11. But don't look for any quarterback 
change, now or any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a lack of production that would get quarterbacks around  
the NFL benched, Stewart is in the first season of a $27 million 
contract extension that paid him an $8.1 million signing bonus. The 
Steelers don't often throw that kind of money around, certainly not 
for a player who winds up sitting the bench behind 37-year-old Mike 
Tomczak. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem that needs fixing: Stewart and his receivers aren't  
reading defenses the same way. Offensive coordinator Kevin 
Gilbride's system calls for receivers to adjust their routes to the 
defense, and for the quarterback to make the same adjustments. 
That's why several passes have landed incomplete without a receiver 
in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defenses are going to continue to try to do everything they  
can to confuse him until he figures out this game.'' said Jaguars 
safety Carnell Lake, Stewart's teammate a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, at least until Stewart and the rest of the Steelers figure  
out Gilbride's offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of everybody having confidence in what  
we're doing, starting with myself,'' said Stewart, who is 
next-to-last in the AFC passer ratings, trailing only the 
now-benched Scott Mitchell of Baltimore. ``We're just trying to get 
something going, because nothing's happening right now.''

<HEADLINE> Gay Cop Sues NYPD for Rights Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A New York City police officer claims in a $5  
million civil lawsuit that she was harassed by fellow officers and 
superiors after her wedding to another female officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Bryant, 34, said that prior to the ceremony, no one  
bothered her. But that changed after the June 24, 1997, ceremony in 
Central Park -- a story that made several newspapers, including one 
with photos on the front page of the New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, she claimed, graphic sexual pictures with her face  
pasted on them were hung in her Bronx precinct house, other 
officers refused to ride on patrol with her and she was assigned to 
stereotypical ``female'' duties such as cleaning the precinct. She 
claims one co-worker assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
	Her suit named as defendants police Commissioner Howard Safir,  
Officer John Hoy, Lt. Mark Berman and Lt. Steve Musiak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone turned their backs on me,'' Bryant said. She said she  
went to her supervisors and tried to fix the situation within the 
department without success. She did not specify the steps she took. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokeswoman Marilyn Mode said the department does not  
comment on pending litigation. But she added that Safir has been 
extremely supportive of gay rights within the department. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gay Officers Action League is supporting Bryant in her  
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant still works as a police officer in Brooklyn.

<HEADLINE> HMO Sued for Misleading Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A lawsuit filed Monday against Humana Inc.  
accuses the health maintenance organization of misleading members 
about how it makes coverage decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, seeking class-action status, alleges that Humana  
didn't tell customers that cost -- not medical need -- is the main 
factor behind the health plan's decisions on what medical care it 
approves for members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Humana used undisclosed criteria that were unrelated to  
patients' medical needs,'' said Joseph Sellers, a partner in the 
law firm of Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &AMP; Toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville, Ky.-based Humana paid cash bonuses to claim  
reviewers and had financial arrangements with doctors ``that were 
clearly designed to reduce the number of patient claims that would 
be approved,'' the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana officials said they could not comment on the specific  
allegations because they did not have a copy of the suit. But the 
company said it planned a vigorous defense. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said it supports a process whereby independent  
physicians determine whether a requested health service is 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana, one of the nation's largest managed health care  
companies, has about 6.1 million members in 15 states and Puerto 
Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed in federal district court in Miami on behalf  
of two Riviera Beach, Fla. police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is the first of many that several powerful lawyers,  
including some who gained high profiles in litigation against 
tobacco companies and Microsoft Corp., plan to file in coming weeks 
to challenge coverage decisions of HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Seller's Washington D.C. firm filed the lawsuit along with the  
firm of Boies &AMP; Schiller of Armonk, N.Y. David Boies of Boies &AMP; 
Schiller, is a leading attorney working for the Justice 
Department's antitrust case against Microsoft.

<HEADLINE> Umps Try To Put Union Back Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Trying to head off a deepening rift, supporters  
of umpires' union boss Richie Phillips met for five hours Monday 
with dissidents seeking his ouster, marking the first time they 
gathered since 22 umpires lost their jobs in a failed 
mass-resignation ploy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've started a dialogue to try and get this union back  
together again,'' said NL umpire Jerry Crawford, the union 
president. ``It was an open and frank meeting. I think the process 
of healing has started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But AL umps Tim McClelland, Rick Reed and Larry Young, the three  
representatives of the anti-Phillips faction who attended the 
meeting, left without making any comment. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, yelling could be heard coming from the meeting  
room, but Crawford insisted it had nothing to do with a 
disagreement over Phillips, who did not attend. About 47 umps 
attended the meeting, including nearly all the fired umps. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no yelling at Rick, Tim or Larry,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked to elaborate, Crawford smiled, ``I think one guy didn't  
like a restaurant that the other guy suggested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of 14 umpires, calling itself the Major League Umpires  
Independent Organizing Committee, hase begun collecting signatures 
to decertify the current union and start a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 days ago, the dissidents claimed they have the support  
of more than 40 of the 93 major league umpires, enough to force the 
National Labor Relations Board to hold an election by secret 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford said supporters of Phillips, who came up with the  
mass-resignation strategy, are taking the dissidents very 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our contract is over Dec. 31 and this union, in order to do  
anything, is going to have to get together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday's agenda was an update from lawyer Pat Campbell  
on the umpires' grievance to restore the 22 umpires' jobs. When the 
hearing begins, probably later this month, owners will ask 
arbitrator Alan Symonette to dismiss the case. 
</P>
<P>
	If umpires don't win the grievance, Campbell said, ``this union  
will have to regroup and demand that the 22 jobs be part of any new 
collective bargaining agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 59. I can afford to retire,'' said NL ump Terry Tata, one  
of the 22. ``I feel for the younger guys. You always want to go off 
the stage when the curtain is down, not while it's still up.''

<HEADLINE> Prison Escapee Suspected in Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VARNER, Ark. (AP) -- A convicted killer who taunted his victim's  
family at his trial last month escaped from prison and is a suspect 
in a new slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth D. Williams, sentenced to life without parole for the  
abduction-slaying of a college cheerleader, was discovered missing 
from the maximum security Cummins Unit about 6 p.m. Sunday, 
according to prison spokeswoman Dina Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tyler said the last sure sighting of Williams inside the  
prison was believed to have several hours earlier. That was before 
a man was found shot to death about six miles from the prison and 
his pickup truck stolen, state police spokesman Bill Sadler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was convicted Sept. 14 of capital murder and sentenced  
to life in prison without parole for the slaying of Dominique Hurd, 
19, of Fort Worth, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The cheerleader at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff was  
abducted along with a friend, Peter Robertson, outside a restaurant 
Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The man forced them to drive to an automatic teller machine and  
withdraw money, then to drive to a rural area, where he shot them 
and took their car. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson crawled to a road and waved down drivers. Ms. Hurd  
died early the next morning at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	After jurors decided on a recommendation of life without parole,  
instead of execution, Williams turned and gloated to the victim's 
relatives in the courtroom at Pine Bluff. 
</P>
<P>
	``You thought I was going to die, didn't you?'' Williams said to  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the body of Cecil Boren, 57, was discovered in some  
bushes near his home, dead of an apparent gunshot wound, Sadler 
said. Investigators believe Boren may have been surprised inside 
his home by an intruder, and taken outside and slain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boren's pickup truck was missing, and investigators believed  
Williams should be considered a suspect in the slaying, he said.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today, led by  
telecommunications and transportation issues, as news of big 
corporate mergers gave interest-rate weary investors something to 
be excited about. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 128.23 
at 10,401.23. Broader stock measures also moved higher. The Nasdaq 
composite index was up 59.14 at 2,795.99. Telecommunications issues 
helped carry the market higher after BellSouth joined a bidding war 
with MCI WorldCom for Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. long-distance carrier. 
Sprint and MCI gained while BellSouth slid.

	Fed Expected To Stand Pat on Rates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the economy still racing along, the  
Federal Reserve might be expected to be preparing to raise interest 
rates for a third time this year to cool things off. But most 
economists are betting that the central bank will leave rates 
unchanged when policy-makers meet tomorrow. They base that view on 
what Fed officials have had to say in recent weeks and also on 
economic indicators showing that while economic growth has been 
strong, keeping unemployment at a 29-year low, inflation has 
remained benign as well. Lawrence Chimerine, economist at the 
Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think tank, says: ``They 
have moved pre-emptively twice this year. They can't keep 
pre-empting when the traditional indicators of an increase in 
inflation are not there.''

	Bidding War Erupts for Sprint Corp.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A bidding war has erupted for the Sprint Corp.,  
with two companies reportedly offering as much as $100 billion for 
the nation's third-largest long-distance telephone company. 
Sprint's board members met yesterday to compare offers from MCI 
WorldCom Inc., the No. 2 long-distance company, and a higher, 
last-minute bid from BellSouth Corp., the Atlanta-based Baby Bell, 
according to two people familiar with the negotiations. Sprint's 
board was scheduled to meet today to vote on MCI WorldCom's offer 
of about $63 a share. BellSouth is trying to trump that deal with a 
$72-a-share bid, according to the sources, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity.

	Overall Auto Sales Up, Ford Slides  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- In the midst of one of the strongest years ever  
for U.S. auto sales, Ford Motor Co. took a breather last month as 
its sales declined 2 percent. Automakers sold about 1.4 million 
cars and light trucks in the United States last month, an increase 
of about 9.5 percent over last year. Analysts expect 1999 to break 
the record sales for the year. Ford said that sales of its Ford, 
Lincoln and Mercury cars were down 5 percent last month, mostly 
because of fewer sales to rental and business fleets. For the 
month, Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler saw sales increase 4 percent. 
GM said its sales were up 8.5 percent, and DaimlerChrysler AG said 
sales at its Chrysler division were up 7 percent. Ford shares were 
at 51 5/16, up 11/16.

	Mattel Stocks Plunge 29 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Mattel Inc. warned investors today  
that third-quarter profits will drop sharply due to a big loss at 
The Learning Company, the software maker acquired earlier this year 
to take Mattel beyond Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars into the 
world of high-tech interactive toys. The news pushed Mattel shares 
down more than 28 percent and prompted some speculation that the 
company's chairwoman and chief executive officer, Jill E. Barad, 
could soon be out of a job. Mattel, already struggling with a soft 
international toy market and an inability to produce a blockbuster 
hit in recent years, said it expected The Learning Company to lose 
$50 million to $100 million, pushing earnings for the world's 
largest toymaker into the range of 30 cents to 40 cents per share. 
Mattel stock fell 5 points, or more than 29 percent, to 11 7/8 today.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp., irked by a slumping stock price,  
reportedly may create separate ``tracking'' stocks to reflect the 
value of different businesses such as the company's cable and 
wireless operations. Any such plan would likely have to wait until 
after AT&AMP;T completes its acquisition of the cable TV company 
MediaOne Group, expected sometime next year, The Wall Street 
Journal said today. The debate over tracking stocks follows a 
recent 25 percent slide in AT&AMP;T's share price that some executives 
blame on confusion over how to value such a wide array of 
businesses, especially after the company's sudden foray into cable 
television. AT&AMP;T shares were at 43 3/4, up 2.

	Walgreen Co. Earnings Jump  
</P>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Walgreen Co. reported a 5.2 percent rise  
in fourth quarter earnings today, thanks in part to strong pharmacy 
sales. The largest U.S. drugstore chain said said earnings reached 
$161 million, or 16 cents a share, compared to $152 million in the 
same quarter a year ago. Sales rose 18.7 percent for the quarter to 
$4.6 billion, with prescriptions accounting for 20 percent of the 
increase. Sales for the fiscal year were up 16.5 percent from last 
year, while annual net income rose to $624.1 million from $510.8 
million.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service plans to provide free

allows users to link only to the UPS Web site. The service, which 
uses the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser and connection 
software from AT&AMP;T, will be unveiled Wednesday at the Fall Internet 
World show in New York and will be distributed to interested 
companies early next year.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Clear Channel Communications Inc. is buying AMFM  
Inc. for $16.8 billion in stock, creating a company that will 
dominate the airwaves with 830 radio stations across the nation. 
The combined company, which will keep the Clear Channel name, will 
operate radio stations in the 20 largest U.S. markets except 
Seattle, feeding every taste from country rock to 24-hour sports 
talk. To head off antitrust cries from regulators and consumer 
groups, executives plan to sell 125 radio stations worth about $4.2

hopefully an agreement will be completed relatively soon,'' HFM

	PARIS (AP) -- Thousands of bosses gathered today in Paris to  
protest the French government's proposals for a shortened 35-hour 
workweek. They held their rally a day before lawmakers open debate 
on how to implement the controversial measure. About 25,000 
employers crowded into a noisy exposition hall, waving signs saying 
``For The Freedom Of Business.'' Across town, the Communist-backed 
union, the General Workers Confederation, drew some 25,000 people 
to its rally to press lawmakers not to leave companies too much 
leeway in interpreting the plan.

<HEADLINE> Justice Ginsburg Back to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,  
recovering from surgery for colon cancer, took the bench with her 
colleagues Monday as the nation's highest court opened its 
1999-2000 term. 
</P>
<P>
	The justice looked slightly thinner and paler than usual, but  
she smiled broadly as she took her place on the end of the bench. 
Her husband, Martin, and two grown children, James and Jane, were 
in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	As is court custom, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist made no  
mention of Ginsburg's recent illness as he declared the new term 
open. She asked 12 questions of lawyers arguing the first of two 
cases heard by the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Monday, Ginsburg spoke during an award ceremony in the  
court building. 
</P>
<P>
	``No words can convey how pleased I am to be here with you  
today,'' she told the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The 66-year-old justice had part of her colon removed 17 days  
ago. Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg last week said doctors found 
that the cancer had not spread to any lymph nodes.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Denies Olympic Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympic officials said Monday  
that reports the 2000 Games were facing a $140 million sponsorship 
shortfall were incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
	The report of the sponsorship shortfall came after International  
Olympic Committee vice-president Dick Pound, who negotiates key 
television and sponsorship deals, addressed the IOC executive board 
in Athens over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who was arguing for the scaling back of the  
commercialization of the Games, criticized the Sydney Organizing 
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) for setting its sponsorship 
revenue targets too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you push the envelope too far, you end up denigrating  
Olympic marketing,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	A SOCOG spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said reports  
of a shortfall were ``absolute nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret that we still have to raise $140 million in  
sponsorship revenue, but it's also no secret that there's still a 
year to go before the Olympics,'' he said. ``So any suggestion that 
there is a $140 million shortfall for the Games or a black hole is 
just rubbish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Olympics minister Michael Knight said the  
shortfall was now down to about $78 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the meeting Dick Pound said SOCOG sponsorship and revenue  
raising efforts were a great success and should be hailed as 
such,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also said the IOC executive board would consider imposing  
a cap on marketing revenues and reducing the share of funds going 
to organizing committees and national Olympic committees.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Tech Cracks AP Top 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Virginia Tech finds itself in elite territory for the first time  
in school history -- the Hokies cracked the top 5 in The Associated 
Press' Top 25 college football poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a 31-7 win over state-rival Virginia at  
Charlottesville, Virginia Tech (4-0) jumped three spots to No. 5 in 
this week's AP poll, while Florida State and Penn State remained 
1-2 for the third straight week. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this season, the Hokies' highest ranking was No. 10 -- for  
one week late in 1995 and in the final poll in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine teams in last week's Top 25 lost on Saturday, including  
Florida and Texas A&AMP;M. The Gators (4-1), who lost to Alabama 40-39 
in overtime, fell from No. 3 to No. 8, while the Aggies (3-1) were 
beaten 21-19 by Texas Tech and tumbled from No. 5 to No. 13. The 
Crimson Tide (4-1) jumped from No. 21 to No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (5-0), a 51-23 winner over Duke, collected 64  
first-place votes and 1,744 points from the 70 sports writers and 
broadcasters on the AP panel. Penn State (5-0), idle Saturday, was 
next with five first-place votes and 1,672 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan (5-0), a 38-12 winner over Purdue, moved up a spot to  
No. 3 with 1,606 points; Nebraska (5-0) improved two spots to No. 4 
(1,537 points) after a 38-14 win over Oklahoma State; and the 
Hokies rounded out the first five, receiving one first-place vote 
and 1,427 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (3-1) was No. 6, followed by No. 7 Georgia Tech, No. 8  
Florida, No. 9 Kansas State and No. 10 Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (5-0) was No. 11, followed by No. 12 Alabama, No.  
13 Texas A&AMP;M, No. 14 Mississippi State, No. 15 Marshall, No. 16 
East Carolina, No. 17 Purdue, No. 18 Syracuse, No. 19 Miami and No. 
20 Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State fell nine places to No. 21 after a 42-17 loss to  
Wisconsin, followed by No. 22 Southern California, No. 23 Texas, 
No. 24 BYU and No. 25 Minnesota, making its first Top 25 appearance 
since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	In the USA Today/ ESPN coaches' poll, the top five were Florida  
State, Penn State, Michigan, Nebraska and Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen teams in Division I-A have perfect records, and 12 are  
in this week's poll. Boston College (4-0) didn't make the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas State (4-0) moved up four spots after a 35-17 win over  
Texas, while the Longhorns tumbled eight places. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (5-0) moved up three spots to No. 11, and  
entertains Michigan Saturday in a battle of Big Ten unbeatens. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue fell six places after losing at Michigan, while Wisconsin  
returned to the rankings after a week's absence. Also rejoining the 
Top 25 were Southern Cal and BYU. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas, Oklahoma, Virginia and Oregon fell out of the Top 25  
after losses.

<HEADLINE> Mets, Reds To Battle for Wild Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The New York Mets arrived first, the  
adrenaline of their ninth-inning win left up in the sky while they 
circled the airport for 35 minutes because of a storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before sunrise, the Cincinnati Reds would show up,  
fresh-scrubbed from a numbing game played in standing water after a 
rain delay that took up most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Long days, but not lost days. They still had one more to play.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mets and Reds came through when they had to Sunday, setting  
up the sixth one-game playoff in major league history today to 
decide the NL wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like there's any home-field advantage in a  
situation like that,'' said Pete Harnisch, who pitched the Reds to 
a bone-chilling 7-1 victory in Milwaukee. ``Both teams are playing 
on emotion and intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of season that just comes down to one game. That's  
exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not entirely surprising. Both teams wasted chances to wrap  
up a playoff spot in the last two weeks, setting themselves up for 
a long day Sunday followed by a one-game showdown tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can't wait to go,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said as he  
grabbed his hotel key then headed for the elevator shortly before 1 
a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	There were times in the last two weeks that neither team thought  
it would get this far. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets opened a four-game lead on the Reds with only a dozen  
left, leaving Cincinnati just one misstep away from elimination. 
What followed was a horrendous slide -- seven consecutive losses -- 
that let the Reds pull ahead by 2 1/2 games last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Things seemed so rosy for the Reds that they brought champagne  
to Milwaukee for a three-game series over the weekend. The corks 
never left the bottles -- the Reds lost the first two while the Mets 
beat Pittsburgh twice, leaving them tied heading into Sunday's 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Astros clinched the NL Central with a win, leaving  
it to New York and Cincinnati to decide the wild card. The Mets had 
the first starting time and waited until the last minute before 
beating the Pirates 2-1 on Brad Clontz's run-scoring wild pitch in 
the bottom of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets swarmed their home field when Clontz's pitch to Mike  
Piazza skipped to the backstop with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's kind of indicative of the season we've had,''  
Piazza said. ``Everyone had us buried six feet under.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up in Milwaukee, the Reds and Brewers felt like they were under  
six feet of water. A steady, heavy rain pushed back the starting 
time by five hours and 47 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us watched the football game, some of us watched the  
Mets,'' manager Jack McKeon said. ``Some guys took batting 
practice. Nobody was nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Reds waited, the Mets got on a plane and headed for  
Cincinnati, hoping to clinch en route with a Brewers' victory. They 
got score updates as they circled the airport waiting out a storm, 
and knew by the time they landed that there would have to be one 
more game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's game had just ended when the Mets reached their  
hotel. Downtown streets were wet and deserted, and the players 
quickly filed off the bus and headed for their rooms. A few stopped 
to order pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was surreal given what had happened in the last 12  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of weird because everybody counted us dead a couple  
of days ago and nobody gave us a chance,'' closer John Franco said. 
``We did what we needed to do and we got some help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's good for baseball. It's a compliment to the Reds  
and to us. People counted us out and they counted Cincinnati out 
all year, waiting for them to die. There's no quit in them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds had a surreal night of their own, playing in front of a  
few hundred fans on a soaked field in temperatures that turned 
their breaths to mist. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, there was no celebrating in the clubhouse,  
just a sense of relief that there was one more regular-season game 
to be played. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to take the momentum out of this clubhouse and  
put it in the plane with us and take it back to Cincinnati,'' first 
baseman Sean Casey said. ``We've got guys who are hurting and we've 
got guys who aren't playing their best ball. It was pure guts 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The playoff originally was scheduled for 2:05 p.m., but was  
pushed back to 7:05 p.m. because the Reds would be returning at 
such an early hour. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Al Leiter (12-12) will start against Cincinnati's  
Steve Parris (11-3). If the Reds win, they'll start the first round 
in Atlanta against a team that won eight of nine from them this 
season. If the Mets win, they'll fly to Arizona for the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds won five of their nine games against the Mets this  
season, but New York went 4-2 in Cincinnati. The main difference 
between them at this point is that the Reds managed to stay more 
consistent down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he felt that the Mets had gotten a reprieve, reliever  
Chuck McElroy said, ``In a way, but the Reds are still hot right 
now. They may have lost two of three in Milwaukee, but they're 
still a hot team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a wet team. And a tired team.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mets could certainly identify.

<HEADLINE> Pele's Son Faces Murder Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The son of Brazilian soccer legend Pele  
goes on trial Tuesday for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have accused Pele's son, Edson Cholbi do Nascimento,  
27, and Marcilio Jose Marinho de Melo, 24, of killing a 
motorcyclist by smashing into him when racing their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Simoes Neto, a 50-year-old retiree, was thrown from his  
motorcycle and killed in October, 1992 in Santos, a port town 48 
miles southeast of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the Justice Tribunal of Sao Paulo state ruled that  
Nascimento and Melo should be charged with murder, and not, as was 
expected, with involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Nascimento's attorney, Marlon Wander Machado, nor Pele's  
office were available for comment on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento, a reserve goalkeeper for eight years on the Santos  
Team -- Pele's former club -- announced his retirement from 
professional soccer in late June. He then joined his father's 
company, Pele Sports and Marketing.

<HEADLINE> Accused Murderer Said Fit for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Ind. (AP) -- A man accused of taking revenge on his  
wife by fathering her child and then killing the infant was deemed 
fit for trial on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Shanabarger, 30, was evaluated by two state-appointed  
psychologists and a judge ruled that he was mentally able to stand 
trial for the murder, Prosecutor Lance Hamner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger told police he planned the crime to exact punishment  
on his wife, who had refused to cut short a cruise after his father 
died in October 1996, before they were married. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the boy's funeral, Shanabarger told his wife that he  
smothered 7-month-old Tyler in his crib on June 19, investigators 
said. A coroner had ruled the boy died from Sudden Infant Death 
Syndrome. Shanabarger later allegedly confessed to police. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Goodyear Tire worker has pleaded innocent. He has  
been jailed without bond pending a trial scheduled to begin Nov. 
30.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Rose Works on New Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Malik Rose hopes to take over where Sean  
Elliott left off -- at least for the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Rose, in his fourth year, has spent much of his  
time with the San Antonio Spurs playing backup power forward behind 
Tim Duncan. With Elliott out indefinitely after a kidney 
transplant, Rose is working on moving into the starting small 
forward position. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter who gets the spot, it's only there until Sean comes  
back, so I just want to baby-sit it for a little while,'' Rose said 
at Spurs training camp Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott received a kidney from his brother in transplant surgery  
Aug. 16. He plans to return to for the Spurs, perhaps as soon as 
later this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a comeback after a kidney transplant would be unprecedented  
in professional sports, but doctors have not ruled it out. The 
31-year-old Elliott suffered from focal glomerulosclerosis, a 
condition that prevents the kidneys from properly filtering waste 
from the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Spurs defeated New York in the NBA Finals, Rose spent  
the offseason working on his perimeter game, losing weight and 
getting pointers from Elliott, coach Gregg Popovich and others on 
the keys to playing small forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm playing pretty well in the position, being as  
though it's new to me,'' Rose said. ``I had a lot of help as far as 
getting tutored at that position, and I think it's showing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich said he hasn't decided who will start in place of  
Elliott. Initially, it may be determined by opponent matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs also have new arrivals Chucky Brown and Samaki Walker  
and returning veteran Jaren Jackson under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, a former Dallas Maverick who signed with the Spurs in  
August, said he believes he can make the switch from power forward 
to small forward if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident that I can do that,'' Walker said. ``It's going  
to take a lot of hard work and drills and just coming out here and 
competing. I think I can definitely make the transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Elie played forward in Houston but said he feels more  
comfortable as a guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I heard Sean was down, I said I'm not playing the  
three-spot,'' Elie said. ``I'm going to play probably spot minutes. 
... It depends on the matchups. If the team needs me to be there 
I'll definitely do that. Whatever it takes to win.''

<HEADLINE> Front-Runners Turn to Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the lore of faltering front-runners, Vice  
President Al Gore is rewriting the chapter on change, to a new look 
so early in the campaign that by the time they start voting 
Democrats may not remember the flaws that forced the overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore still has to demonstrate that it is more than a new label --  
and that his confrontational tactics against rival Bill Bradley 
will work where the aloof style of a leader who did not even 
mention the challenger by name had not. 
</P>
<P>
	When presidential campaign favorites have stumbled, it has been  
in the early primaries, and the standard response has been to turn 
to the offense, as Gore has now, four months before the first 
contests of 2000. They've sometimes turned to different advisers, 
which Gore did even earlier in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The classic case of a leader who lost was that of the late Sen.  
Edmund S. Muskie, towering favorite for the 1972 Democratic 
nomination before the race really began. Then a flawed game plan, a 
stubborn streak, and an attempt to stay in the center of the 
Democratic road all combined to undo him. 
</P>
<P>
	Muskie tried to run a national campaign from the start, against  
rivals who concentrated on the early primary states. He won the New 
Hampshire primary, but not by a landslide, colliding with a problem 
chronic to front-runners, the expectations game. 
</P>
<P>
	In that game, Muskie went away the angry loser, his campaign  
unraveling in the real primary defeats that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the candidate and his organization didn't change; they kept  
doing what they'd been doing. Muskie's campaign headquarters was at 
1972 K Street -- three blocks from the offices Gore is closing in 
his campaign shakeup. The Gore headquarters is being shifted to 
Nashville, Tenn., and its staff pruned in the process, to cut the 
costs that left his campaign with less cash on hand than Bradley's 
as of Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Muskie headquarters, at its peak, cost more each month than Sen.  
George McGovern, the eventual nominee, was spending on his entire 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley travels light. A former senator can. That is more  
difficult for a vice president, who travels with the trappings, 
entourage and security of the office, all of which may intrude as 
Gore tries to hold what he says will be direct, open meetings with 
voters in place of planned events. 
</P>
<P>
	Front-running candidates get extra scrutiny and extra shots from  
the rest of the field. In the Republican campaign, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush so far has withstood both. 
</P>
<P>
	Against a single rival, Gore has had more trouble, and Bradley  
has been gaining. So Gore said he now feels like the underdog and 
will campaign that way, which is what Bradley says, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore camp wants to raise the threshold of campaign success  
for Bradley, to heighten expectations about the challenger now. 
</P>
<P>
	In prior campaigns, the leaders moved to shake things up only  
after they were losers. ``All the front-runner talk, that's over,'' 
former Vice President Walter F. Mondale said after Sen. Gary Hart 
upset him in New Hampshire in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	So was the cautious approach. He took the offensive, rallied his  
reserves in the party establishment -- an asset Gore has, too -- and 
won the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, front-running Republican Bob Dole withstood three early  
primary defeats, then started winning, buoyed by the support of the 
party regulars who had helped make him the favorite in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowded, early primary schedule worked to his advantage. It  
is even more crowded, and earlier, in this campaign, another 
potential asset for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	As vice president, George Bush stumbled at the start in the 1988  
campaign, running an embarrassing third in Iowa, where Dole won. 
Bush hardened his campaign line against Dole in New Hampshire, 
where the GOP hierarchy was on his side, reclaiming the lead, the 
nomination, and eventually the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's fling as front-runner in 1992 was  
interrupted by his past, with campaign controversies about an 
affair and his draft avoidance dragging down his standing in the 
polls he'd led. Clinton lost the New Hampshire primary he'd once 
been favored to win, but talked his way past the defeat by claiming 
to be ``The Comeback Kid,'' for faring better than the polls 
forecast.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Dollar Mostly Up; Gold Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. dollar rose against most other major  
currencies in European trading today. Gold also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro slipped to $1.0698 at the end of the European trading  
day from $1.0705 Friday and the British pound fell to $1.6538 from 
$1.6558. The dollar also rose to 106.41 Japanese yen from 105.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in afternoon trading in New York, the dollar gave up some  
of its gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro regained its lost ground and was quoted at $1.0708 in  
New York this afternoon, where the pound was at $1.6557 and the 
dollar bought 106.10 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Against other currencies in European trading, the dollar bought  
1.4880 Swiss francs, down from 1.4898 Friday, and 1.4714 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.4690. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth: 1.8280 German marks, up from 1.8270; 
6.1327 French francs, up from 6.1293; 2.0595 Dutch guilders, up 
from 2.0593; and 1,809.94 Italian lire, up from 1,805.92.

	Gold closed in London at $314.00 bid per troy ounce, up from  
$303.00 on Friday. In Zurich the bid price was $313.50, up from 
$305.00.

<HEADLINE> Newpapers Seek More Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American Society of Newspaper Editors set  
guidelines to bring the number of minority newspaper employees in 
line with the general minority population figures by 2025. 
</P>
<P>
	At the group's recent fall board meeting, ASNE approved  
benchmarks at three-year intervals designed to monitor the number 
of minorities working in newsrooms and increase the number of 
minority supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``These benchmarks are designed to show us where we are and how  
much further we have to go by 2025,'' said N. Christian Anderson 
III, publisher of The Orange County Register and ASNE president. 
</P>
<P>
	Minorities constitute about 28 percent of the population but  
only about 11 percent of reporters, copy editors, photographers, 
graphic artists and supervisors at daily U.S. newspapers, according 
to a 1999 ASNE survey. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, the society approved an intention of making newspaper  
staffs match the nation's racial composition by 2000. ASNE adopted 
the new 2025 target date after deciding the original date was 
unattainable.

<HEADLINE> Gold Rises; Soybeans Also Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices pushed higher Monday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid speculation that a government 
report due Friday will show lower-than-expected crop levels. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, gold futures rose $12.70 to $318 per ounce on  
the New York Mercantile Exchange, though still below last week's 
price rally that produced prices as high as $329 Tuesday. Platinum 
and palladium also rallied on gold's increase. 
</P>
<P>
	March world sugar fell 7 points to 6.84 cents a pound on the  
Board of Trade of the City of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices rallied to end higher, despite reports  
that rain throughout the Midwest did little to slow the harvest. 
Some buyers are positioning themselves for Friday's U.S. 
Agriculture Department report. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices also rose on ideas that the market had been  
technically oversold. Corn futures prices fell to 11-week lows amid 
continued harvesting and speculation that the U.S. Agriculture 
Department will report increased production Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.68 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 3/4 cents to $2.04 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
1 1/4 cents to $1.12 a bushel; and November soybeans rose 2 1/4 cents to 
$4.83 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, live cattle and feeder cattle rose, and lean hogs and  
frozen pork bellies fell in trading Monday on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose 0.40 cent to $69.17 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose 0.15 cent to 82 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs fell 0.17 cent to 50.20 cents a pound; and February 
frozen pork bellies fell 1.83 cents to 63.77 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	The gold gains are a continuation of an up-move in the market,  
analyst Fred Bogart of Republic Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gold is in a bullish phase,'' he said. ``It was in a bull  
market last week, even though it went down. The market is much more 
volatile these days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some said gold prices are by last week's announcement that  
several key European banks will limit gold sales and lending. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar buying is being affected by questions about how much the  
Russian government will buy once the autumn beet harvest ends. That 
country's beet harvest appears to be better than first predicted 
and weather has turned more favorable after a June drought.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Retirement Fund May Be Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Banking officials said Monday they have been  
unable to find evidence of a retirement account that Mexicans who 
worked in the United States say could hold as much as $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure adds another roadblock in the path of the former  
workers, who claim they have been cheated of money they paid weekly 
into the retirement fund during the bracero program, which ran from 
1942 to 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	``The documentation has been searched for exhaustively, but we  
don't have a way of confirming the existence of the fund in this 
bank,'' said Alejandro Romero, an attorney for the National Rural 
Credit Bank, known as Banrural. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, the governments of Mexico and the United  
States created the bracero program which granted Mexicans temporary 
U.S. visas to work the land and man the railroads. About 2.6 
million Mexicans participated from 1942 until 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement by the US and Mexico, each worker had 10  
percent deducted from his paycheck by the Farm Security 
Administration. It was sent to Banco Nacional de Credito Agricola, 
a predecessor of Banrural, or another bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Bracero advocates say that with interest, the fund could hold up  
to $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen former braceros had gathered at the bank Monday to hear  
the promised report. 
</P>
<P>
	Romero said those with claims can come forward individually and  
provide with documents that prove they are entitled to money. 
</P>
<P>
	Bracero representatives said that unfairly places the burden of  
proof on people who have waited generations to receive the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here in Mexico things seem to get lost, especially when the  
heat is on,'' said Ventura Gutierrez, general coordinator of Union 
Without Borders, a U.S.-based group representing former braceros 
trying to claim the benefits. ``If we have to go to Washington 
we'll go to Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez said he plans to meet this week with congressmen in  
Mexico to press for a remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	If that does not work, he said he will investigate the National  
Archives for documents proving the existence of the fund and the 
amount of money paid into it. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they want to do use the old divide and conquer tactic by  
placing the burden on affected individuals to prove they have right 
to the money,'' Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez earlier said he estimated that only about 2 percent of  
braceros were able to collect the money owed them from the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 million braceros have died, while approximately 20,000  
ex-braceros or their survivors have been located. 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel Angel Gonzalez, an attorney for the Foreign Relations  
Secretariat, said initial research there indicates that while the 
bracero program lasted until 1964, the savings fund existed only 
until 1950.

<HEADLINE> Mustang Ranch May Now Have Horses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP)-- Nearly two months after padlocking the infamous  
Mustang Ranch brothel, the federal government is considering a plan 
to reopen it as a tourist attraction and research center for wild 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
	The property was forfeited to the federal government this summer  
after guilty verdicts against the brothel's parent companies and 
manager in a federal fraud and racketeering trial. The women who 
worked there were evicted and the brothel was locked up. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Bureau of Land Management is exploring a plan to convert  
the main pink stucco ranch building into an interpretive center for 
its Wild Horse and Burro Adoption Center, which has outgrown its 
Palomino Valley facility 15 miles northeast of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an idea that's easy to make jokes about, but it's one  
that also makes sense,'' said John Singlaub, manager of the BLM's 
Carson district office. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau is charged with managing the West's estimated 44,000  
wild horses, about half of which are located in Nevada. It captures 
some of the animals and puts them up for adoption to ease 
overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The interpretive center could include historical exhibits, a  
wild horse research center and an equestrian center, said Bob 
Abbey, BLM director in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The 104-room bordello, located on a sprawling 440-acre ranch  
just east of Reno, first made headlines in 1955, when it was opened 
by Joe Conforte during a time when prostitution was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, the Mustang Ranch became the state's first legal  
brothel and led to the movement that resulted in legalized 
prostitution in 12 of Nevada's 17 counties.

<HEADLINE> Mac, Sosa End Another Big Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Once again, Mark McGwire cemented his  
reputation as the modern-day Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit No. 65 to finish two ahead of Sammy Sosa in the  
sequel of the home run derby Sunday as the St. Louis Cardinals 
closed out another disappointing season with a 9-5 victory over the 
Chicago Cubs. The game was called after 4 1/2 innings, following two 
rain delays. 
</P>
<P>
	In a charge reminiscent of his 70-homer season in 1998, McGwire  
homered six times in the final seven games to zoom past Sosa, who 
led 59-54 on Sept. 9. He also moved past Ted Williams and Willie 
McCovey into 10th place on the career list with 522 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has said countless times this season that it's not easy  
to hit home runs. He just makes it look that way, averaging more 
than 61 -- which used to be the magic home run number -- the last 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``To hit 65 blows me away, and it blows me away what I did last  
year,'' McGwire said. ``But when you come prepared every day and 
give it all every day, you never know what can happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire connected in the first inning off Steve Trachsel (8-18),  
who gave up No. 62 last year. He became the first NL player since 
Dale Murphy in 1984-85 to win successive home run titles, and this 
was his fourth crown overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa emerged from a long silence to hit No. 63, a three-run shot  
in the third off Larry Luebbers. Sosa finished with only two in the 
last 11 games and his final homer was his first in 18 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't at all disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Probably, people will be looking forward to us doing this  
every year,'' Sosa said. ``You don't see a player hitting 60 home 
runs every year. I have to say I feel lucky doing it two years in a 
row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa did tie for the major league strikeout lead, however, at  
171 with Cleveland's Jim Thome. 
</P>
<P>
	There were two rain delays and the shortened game cost each  
player perhaps two more at-bats. The first delay, which came with 
Sosa at the plate and the bases loaded in the fifth, lasted only 16 
minutes. The second delay lasted one hour and 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire connected in the first inning on a 2-2 fastball from  
Trachsel. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive, estimated at 461 feet, was McGwire's fourth straight  
homer to straightaway center, and a kid wearing a McGwire jersey 
wound up with the ball following a scramble. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also homered in the first inning Saturday and outhomered  
Sosa 2-1 in the final series although he also walked five times -- 
twice on Sunday. He also led the league with 147 RBIs, matching his 
career high he set last year, and became the first player in 
history to finish with more RBIs than hits (145) in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to say about that,'' McGwire said.  
</P>
<P>
	The closest before this year was Jay Buhner of Seattle, who had  
121 RBIs and 126 hits in 1995. McGwire had been second-closest with 
147 RBIs and 152 hits last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Tatis had a two-run single and Thomas Howard also drove  
in a run in a three-run fourth that put St. Louis ahead 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Trachsel, who had been 4-1 in September and was coming off a  
complete game, lasted only 3 1-3 innings. He gave up eight runs, 
six earned, on eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to pitch when the guys don't want to be out on the  
field,'' Trachsel said. ``It looked obvious that guys were thinking 
about getting home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luebbers (3-3) gave up five runs on six hits in four innings,  
and Rick Ankiel worked the fifth for his first career save. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Sosa hit 30 homers on the road, one fewer than his club  
record last year. ... A closing sellout of 47,998 gave the 
Cardinals a total attendance of 3,230,356, breaking the record of 
3,194,092 they set last year. They accomplished it in only 79 home 
dates, due to two rainouts. ... Tatis was 9-for-13 with the bases 
loaded with 13 RBIs, including a two-run single in the fourth. ... 
Willie McGee, who's likely to retire, finished the year in a 
1-for-19 slump. ... The Cubs' Mark Grace was the hits leader of the 
1990s with 1,754. The hits leaders of every other decade are in the 
Hall of Fame. ... Trachsel's 18 losses are the most by a Cubs 
pitcher since Bill Bonham lost 22 in 1974. ... Cardinals manager 
Tony La Russa is likely to sign a contract extension in the next 
few days, even though he's 319-328 in four seasons with the 
Cardinals.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Open With Lame-Duck Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Bird left for Florida as the lame-duck  
coach of the Indiana Pacers, promising to push his players toward 
the championship that eluded them in the lockout-shortened 1999 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter what I'm going to do,'' said Bird, who has  
announced he has no plans to coach after his current contract 
expires at the end of the upcoming season. ``It just matters how my 
team plays this year, how we stay together, and how we compete 
every night. It has absolutely nothing to do with me. These guys 
will be playing whether I'm here or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that does matter to Bird is that he'll have a full  
training camp and exhibition season -- along with time for practice 
-- during the upcoming season. That wasn't the situation last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird has the nucleus back from the team that won the Central  
Division and he's eager to have the additional time for preseason 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year I really didn't care that much. With all the young  
guys we have, we'll try to give them the opportunity to play in the 
games and see how they do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana reached the Eastern Conference finals for the fourth  
time in six seasons. However, the dream of making its first trip to 
the NBA finals came up short when Indiana was upset by the New York 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope the players will be in the right frame of mind and  
go to work,'' said Bird, who plans to hold 11 practice sessions 
this week before the Pacers leave the Disney Institute in Orlando 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a strange season. We really didn't have a great  
training camp. It didn't seem like we were playing well on a 
consistent basis. We really didn't have time to prepare in 
practice,'' he said. ``This year we have no excuses. We need to go 
into camp in the right frame of mind and come out of camp ready to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preseason forecasts last season tabbed Indiana as a championship  
favorite, a role Bird believed they had the talent to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I wanted to put as much pressure on them as I could,  
work them hard, keep them focused. We played well the first two 
series and (against) New York we didn't play well at all. We just 
didn't have players step up and play to their capabilities,'' Bird 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't win the whole thing, it's very disappointing.  
Last year was a great opportunity for us to go out, make it to the 
finals, give ourselves an opportunity for a championship. We came 
up short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird has his starting lineup intact. All five members are over  
30 and have been in the league 11 or more seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a year older,'' Bird said. ``Whatever happened last year  
is gone and you've got to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big change this season is the trade to Toronto of Antonio  
Davis, who provided crucial minutes at power forward and backup 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losing Antonio Davis, a guy who played two positions, is going  
to hurt us,'' Bird said. ``I think we have enough to keep it 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers acquired Jonathan Bender, an 18-year-old high school  
star from Mississippi who was the fifth overall pick in the draft, 
from the Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bender is probably not going to play much,'' Bird said of the  
6-foot-11 rookie. ``It's a learning experience for him. He has a 
lot of talent, he's young. For the future, I can see the move they 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest battle for a starting job is likely to be at small  
forward, where 36-year-old Chris Mullin will be challenged by a 
group that includes former first-round draft picks Al Harrington 
and Austin Croshere, and this year's 21st overall, Jeff Foster, 
acquired from Golden State in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty loaded at the small forward position. The last  
two years we've been with Chris the whole time. You can't count him 
out,'' Bird said. ``If he comes out of camp the best small forward, 
he'll start. If not, someone else will.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Expected To Stand Pat on Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the nation's economy purrs smoothly with no  
immediate inflation dangers at hand, the Federal Reserve is 
expected, for now, to forgo a third interest rate increase, private 
economists believe. 
</P>
<P>
	They aren't ruling out the possibility of higher rates before  
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts are taking this view because inflation has  
remained well-behaved despite strong economic growth and an 
unemployment rate remaining at a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	A rate increase is ``a no-go -- primarily because there's not a  
sufficient amount of data suggesting continued inflationary 
pressures,'' said Richard Yamarone, senior economist with Argus 
Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Open Market Committee, which comprises Fed board  
members in Washington and the presidents of the Fed's 12 regional 
banks, planned to meet privately today to review interest rate 
policy. Financial markets eagerly awaited a midafternoon 
announcement of their decision. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another reason economists believe the central bank won't  
raise interest rates today. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan usually gives investors  
a solid sign of an impending interest rate increase. But he and 
other Fed officials haven't done that, striking instead a more 
dovish tone. That indicates they've seen few signs of inflation 
even with rapid economic growth, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've heard from people on the Fed, including Chairman  
Greenspan, doesn't point to an interest rate increase,'' said Tim 
O'Neill, chief economist for the Bank of Montreal and Harris Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street appeared to take the view Monday that the Fed will  
hold the line for the time being. The Dow Jones industrial average 
closed up 128.23 points at 10,401.23. But even with the rebound, 
stocks are down almost 1,000 points from their record close of 
11,299.76 on Aug. 23, just before the last Fed rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the economy slowed in the second quarter to an anemic  
1.6 percent annual rate, many economists said that was just a 
temporary lull. They are looking for the economy to grow at around 
a 4 percent rate in both the third and fourth quarters, far above 
the 3 percent rate many Fed policy-makers believe is prudent with 
today's tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that, many economists believe the Fed may raise rates this  
year by a quarter of a point when it meets on Nov. 16, depending on 
what a fresh round of economic data released between now and then -- 
including two employment reports and several inflation reports -- 
says about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed still thinks rates need to go up a notch,'' said  
Cynthia Latta, senior economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. ``But 
they won't do it Tuesday. They will wait until November.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One more quarter-point rate increase would move the short-term  
rates the Fed controls back to where they were before the central 
bank cut rates in three quarter-point moves last fall to keep 
financial turmoil in Asia and Russia from derailing the U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 30, the Fed nudged up the federal funds rate -- the  
interest that banks charge each other -- by a quarter of a point, 
the first time in two years. It raised the funds rate again, by the 
same amount, to 5.25 percent, on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks quickly responded to each of those increases by boosting  
prime lending rates by a quarter of a point. That benchmark rate 
for millions of consumer and business loans now stands at 8.25 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists were split on whether the Fed will keep its policy  
directive, which signals the future course of interest rates, at 
neutral or switch it to one leaning toward raising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed had been expected to leave rates alone at both their  
Nov. 16 and Dec. 21 meetings because of anxiety about the Year 2000 
computer date change. But more and more analysts now believe that 
Y2K won't stop the Fed from acting because they have grown more 
confident that banks have made computer upgrades needed to handle 
any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Y2K has gone so smoothly -- domestically -- it's not a  
constraint on the Fed anymore,'' said Ken Mayland, an economist 
with KeyCorp.

<HEADLINE> Times Square Prepares for New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When you're Jeffrey Straus, every second counts.  
</P>
<P>
	The Countdown Entertainment president will be marking the party  
of the century by helping drop a 1,070-pound crystal ball at Times 
Square at exactly 12:00:00 on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny -- everybody makes a big deal about the ball  
dropping on time,'' says Straus, laughing. ``But New Year's 2000 is 
coming even if we're late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, New Year's 2000 is coming to Times Square every hour  
on the hour from time zones around the world -- from the South 
Pacific to Western Samoa -- beginning at 6 a.m. on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to endless verses of ``Auld Lang Syne'' in a variety  
of languages, each hour will be marked with a video and musical 
presentation appropriate to the time zone. The round-the-clock 
party at the ``Crossroads of the World'' will peak with the big 
celebration at midnight EST. 
</P>
<P>
	All of it will be beamed onto a half-dozen giant screens around  
Times Square for the crowd, and around the world via 15 cameras on 
the Internet for those hanging out at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The $7 million party will run for 25 hours, finally winding up  
at 7 a.m. on Jan. 1 -- about the time the first hangovers of the 
year should be kicking in. 
</P>
<P>
	The once-in-a-lifetime event, expected to draw 1.5 million live  
guests and 1 billion television viewers, will feature more than 
1,000 performers in a variety of roles -- musicians, puppeteers, 
dancers, actors. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be live video feeds from around the world pumped into  
Times Square. Forty-five networks will do the opposite, beaming 
live feeds out of Times Square throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Straus, who head the marketing company that represents the ball  
and the building on which it sits, says he and his staff are ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started preparing for this three years ago,'' he says.  
``We're going to celebrate with the entire world. London, Paris, 
Beijing -- when the millennium begins, we'll be with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some anticipated highlights: an enormous puppet of Father Time  
will dance with a Baby Time creature. A 22-foot-long elephant 
puppet will appear at 3 p.m. for New Year's in India. Gymnasts in 
scuba gear will cavort. There will be music, fireworks and 2 tons 
of confetti. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all much more high tech than the first bash in midtown  
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration dates to 1904, when the owners of One Times  
Square sponsored a rooftop party to ring in the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, New York Times publisher Adolph S. Ochs  
conjured up the now-de rigueur ball dropping from the same 
building. With the exception of two years during World War II, a 
brightly lit ball has descended annually before hundreds of 
thousands of celebrants. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's ball is an import -- a Waterford crystal design that  
was carefully brought in from Ireland. It took 40 craftsmen and 
designers to create the ``Star of Hope'' piece. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a lot of symbolism to the design -- stars marking the  
seven continents, for example -- but most viewers won't pick up on 
its subtleties as it travels down a 77-foot flagpole. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball features 504 triangular pieces of crystal, 600  
multi-colored light bulbs, 96 strobe lights and 92 rotating pyramid 
mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 party also comes with its own unique problems.  
</P>
<P>
	The most obvious: no dress rehearsal, almost unheard of for an  
event of this magnitude. Last year's party was the closest that 
organizers came to a dry run, which brings up an annual problem: 
the weather. Forces far beyond the organizers' control could play 
havoc with the events. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping for warm,'' says Straus -- an unlikely forecast  
for Manhattan in late December. Dry might be enough, though a 
little snow could act to the spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers were confident that security would not be an issue;  
last year, police made just 23 arrests from among some 500,000 
revelers. One thing will again be barred from Times Square: 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Straus isn't really worried about dropping the ball a few  
seconds late. All the events will run off a signal sent by the 
atomic clock in Boulder, Colo. The hourly celebrations are timed to 
the millisecond. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident,'' he says. ``Three years ago, this was just  
an idea. Every day brings us closer to the reality.''

<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- While Arizona's Damian Miller plays on a  
division champion, you won't see his name or signature on the 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller broke ranks with the players' association during the  
1994-95 strike, participating with replacement players during 
spring training in February-March 1995. However, he insists he 
wasn't a replacement player because he never joined them in actual 
spring training games. 
</P>
<P>
	The players' association has refused membership to all players  
who it views as replacements. As a result, he doesn't receive 
licensing money from the union, which usually amounts to 
$50,000-$100,000 annually.

<HEADLINE> Report Cites Pacific Bell Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Pacific Bell is to blame for computer crashes  
that have hit state agencies since the company was hired by 
California for $1 billion to transport data across high-speed 
telephone lines, the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem ``has been a lot worse than anything we expect from  
Y2K,'' said Elias Cortez, the state's chief information officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The malfunctions began shortly after Jan. 1, when the company  
began providing telecommunications for the state's data network, 
the report said. The company has a seven-year contract to do the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer glitches have hit the state Department of Motor  
Vehicles the hardest, leading to poor service and driver's license 
applicants being turned away, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	A state program that provides supplemental nutrition to poor  
families said computer outages were one reason for a severe drop in 
program participation. 
</P>
<P>
	The crashes are due to equipment failures and software problems,  
according to International Network Services, a consulting firm 
hired by the state to investigate the problem. Hundreds of hours 
have been lost to intermittent outages. 
</P>
<P>
	The report attributed service disruptions and slow restoration  
times to ``inconsistent or inadequate processes and procedures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't provide the quality of service that (the state)  
expected of us or that we expected of ourselves,'' said Doug 
Michelman, a Pacific Bell vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Ann Champion, Pacific Bell's president of business  
communications services, said the company has installed backup 
systems at its own expense and there have been no major outages in 
recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> Denver QB Suffers Blurred Vision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- With insults raining down from Mile High Stadium's  
notoriously boisterous South Stands, Dale Carter's knees buckled 
and he immediately put his hands to his face. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver cornerback was the victim of an unidentified flying  
metal object Sunday after the Broncos lost 21-13 to the New York 
Jets to fall to 0-4. The attack left Carter with blurred vision 
Monday morning, but tests showed the orbital bone beneath his left 
eye wasn't broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been potentially a catastrophic injury,''  
Broncos trainer Steve Antonopulos said. ``Another inch and he could 
have been blinded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe broke the orbital bone in 1995  
and missed the team's final three games. That injury happened when 
teammate Mark Schlereth inadvertently hit Sharpe in the face during 
a play. 
</P>
<P>
	There was nothing accidental about Carter's injury as a fan  
threw an object from about 20 feet above the field as the Broncos 
made their way toward the locker room. The object found its way 
through Carter's facemask. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not have one individual do something like that and make  
it sound like it's all our fans,'' Denver coach Mike Shanahan said. 
``I would like to think we've got a lot of classy fans and a couple 
people got carried away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter has been an easy target for fans and the media,  
struggling since signing a four-year, $22.8 million contract in the 
offseason. He was whistled for two interference penalties that led 
to a New York touchdown Sunday, and he was beaten for a touchdown 
by Keyshawn Johnson in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's pressing a little bit,'' Shanahan said. ``When you press,  
sometimes you make some mistakes you normally don't make.''

<HEADLINE> Detroit's Ross Fined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Detroit Lions coach Bobby Ross was fined $10,000  
on Monday for criticizing the officiating in his team's 31-21 loss 
to Kansas City on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross is the second coach to be fined for violating the league's  
ban on public criticism of officials. Tony Dungy of Tampa Bay was 
fined $10,000 for his remarks after the Bucs' 17-13 loss to the 
Giants in the opening week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross said he was surprised by the fine and plans to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the type who just gives away $10,000 on a whim. That  
was my salary for a year for about the first five years I was 
coaching,'' he said. ``It's the first time I've ever been fined by 
the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the loss to Kansas City, Ross complained about one  
pass interference call against wide receiver Brian Stablein and 
another against cornerback J.B. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the call against Stablein, Ross said: ``I don't know where  
that one came from. That's out of left field over there in the 
baseball stadium. I mean it's just bad. It's a bad call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later added: ``It was a terrible call, just an absolute  
terrible call because you can't see anything. You don't see 
anything on the play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About the call on Brown, he said: ``I question that one, too.''  
</P>
<P>
	The penalty against Stablein stalled a drive, pushing the Lions  
from the Kansas City 34 back to the 50. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty against Brown contributed 14 yards to a 57-yard  
drive that set up the Chiefs' 51-yard field goal with 1 second left 
in the first half.

<HEADLINE> Utah Wins 'Greatest' Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In the early 1960s, Tom Korologos needed a  
headline in a hurry for an advertising tabloid on skiing. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I put down, `The greatest snow on earth,''' said Korologos,  
then an editor for the Salt Lake Tribune and now a Washington 
lobbyist. ``The next thing I knew, the state tourist council 
grabbed it and ran with it. The phrase stuck, and then it appeared 
on license plates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus had copyrighted  
the phrase ``the greatest show on earth'' in 1872 and objected to 
Utah's similar-sounding claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The world-famous circus unsuccessfully tried to block Utah from  
obtaining its own trademark in 1988, then took its case to the 
federal courts in 1996 after Congress enacted the Federal Trademark 
Dilution Act. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to take up Ringling  
Bros.' appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's finally over,'' said Spencer Kinard, assistant director  
for the Utah Travel Council, who argues ``the greatest snow on 
earth'' is a fact, not a ripoff. ``We never stopped using it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ringling Bros. was disappointed. Julie Strauss, vice president  
and corporate counsel for Ringling Bros.' modern owner, Feld 
Entertainment, said, ```The greatest show on earth' is one of our 
most important corporate assets. We vigorously protect this 
trademark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had Ringling Bros. prevailed, Utah would have had to drop  
bragging rights from advertising copy, travel guides and maps and 
possibly even recall license plates. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinard says Ringling Bros. was particularly concerned about a  
door being opened for such claims as the greatest bar on earth or 
greatest car on earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one time they said, `We will go to the ends of the earth to  
stop you from using this phrase,''' said Ralph Finlayson, assistant 
Utah attorney general who defended Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Ringling's case against Utah backfired when its own consumer  
survey failed to prove that consumers were confused by the similar 
slogans, a federal appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, moreover, had enlisted meteorologist Jerry Brown to lend a  
scientific basis to its claim. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 inches of snow blanket Utah's northern mountains  
annually. And thanks to the combined effects of the desert and the 
Great Salt Lake, winter storms dispersing dry, powdery snow often 
linger for days over Wasatch Mountain resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Korologus, 66, says there is no question Utah has the world's  
finest powder snow. He was surprised to hear Ringling Bros. took 
its case to the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never won a case at the Supreme Court before,'' he quipped.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Halt ``Greatest Snow'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to stop Utah  
from bragging about ``the greatest snow on earth,'' a phrase the 
Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus says illegally dilutes 
its ``Greatest Show on Earth'' trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court, without comment, rejected an appeal  
filed by lawyers for the world-famous circus. The justices let 
stand rulings that threw out a 1996 lawsuit aimed at getting Utah 
to stop using the trademarked phrase to promote its winter sports 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
	P.T. Barnum's circus held the ``Greatest Show'' trademark since  
1872, long before it merged with the Ringling Circus in 1919. Utah 
has used the ``greatest snow'' trademark since the 1960s, but that 
practice was challenged by the circus after Congress enacted the 
Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Until that law was passed, federal trademark law protected only  
against trademark infringements. The 1995 law protects owners of 
``famous'' trademarks ``against another person's commercial use ... 
of a mark or trade name if such use ... causes dilution of the 
distinctive quality of the mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The act defines dilution as the lessening of the capacity of a  
famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services, 
regardless of any competition between the two trademark owners or 
the likelihood of public confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Alexandria, Va., and the 4th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals threw out the circus' lawsuit before it reached a 
jury, ruling that no trademark dilution had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Proof of dilution requires a showing of ``actual economic harm  
to the famous mark's economic value by lessening its former selling 
power,'' the appeals court ruled last March, adding that the circus 
had not offered such proof. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the circus said the  
4th Circuit court's ruling conflicts with other federal appeals 
courts' interpretation of the 1995 federal law. But Utah's lawyers 
said no such conflict exists. 
</P>
<P>
	The circus' appeal was supported in a friend-of-the-court brief  
submitted by companies holding famous trademarks, including Revlon, 
John Deere, Listerine, Harley-Davidson, Newsweek, Tide, Disney and 
Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief said the 4th Circuit court's ruling wrongly makes it  
harder to stop dilution than it is to stop infringement of a 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Combined Shows  
vs. Utah Division of Travel Development, 98-2004.

<HEADLINE> Can Anything Save Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After the New York Jets got their first win at the expense of  
Mike Shanahan's winless Denver Broncos, Bill Parcells ran around 
the field at Mile High Stadium looking for Shanahan. When he 
finally found him, Parcells pulled the Denver coach aside and 
whispered in his ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Ah yes, advice from the coach who's 1-3 to the one who's 0-4.  
</P>
<P>
	It was long overdue.  
</P>
<P>
	In March 1988 at the NFL meetings in Phoenix, Al Davis, who had  
just hired Shanahan to coach his Raiders, introduced his then 
35-year-old coach to his good friend Parcells, who graciously 
welcomed the new member of the NFL's coaching fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you need help,'' Parcells said as they shook hands,  
``just call me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who knows if Shanahan ever called? His tenure with the Raiders  
lasted just 16 games because he didn't follow Davis' coaching 
instructions, and when he went to Denver, he managed two Super Bowl 
victories without Parcells' help, beating the Jets in the AFC title 
game last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But he won't win a third Super Bowl this season -- only the 1995  
Chargers have ever started 0-4 and made it to the playoffs. That's 
not something the Broncos are likely to repeat, particularly if 
Terrell Davis' knee injury as is serious as first believed. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this was expected two months ago, when the Broncos  
opened camp confident they could become the first team ever to win 
three straight Super Bowls. Rod Smith even wore `3' instead of `80' 
in training camp, and the party line was that Bubby Brister, 4-0 in 
place of John Elway last season, could replace Elway without a 
problem, particularly with the NFL as watered-down as it proved to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	How wrong everyone was.  
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, people forgot how good Elway was, even with his  
numbers declining as Davis took over the offensive load. They also 
forgot his leadership skills. 
</P>
<P>
	For another, they forgot how important Steve Atwater's  
leadership was to the defense, even as his speed and ability to 
covers receivers declined. Atwater returned to Mile High Stadium 
with the Jets Sunday and made the tackle that stopped Denver's last 
serious drive in New York's 21-13 win. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, everything that was supposed to be positive for Denver  
has turned negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Carter, for example, was signed during the offseason to  
solidify the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, as he was in Kansas City, has been spotty, great on one  
play, awful on the next. His pass interference penalty set up the 
go-ahead touchdown in Sunday's game, and his influence on his 
teammates can be as negative as Atwater's was positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after Brister was spotty in exhibition games, Shanahan  
decided to go to Griese, the second-year man who threw just three 
passes as a rookie. Griese doesn't have the arm of either Elway or 
Brister, allowing teams to stack defenses to stop Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Griese was finally lifted for Brister after throwing  
three interceptions, including one on which Davis was injured 
making the tackle. Brister threw two more interceptions in 
desperation time, but at least he looked like he had been there 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan's postgame comments were the usual coachspeak -- the  
stuff about being unable to convert in the red zone and having too 
many turnovers. Parcells' were just as predictable -- about winning 
ugly and not committing the dumb penalties that have hurt the team 
since Vinny Testaverde was injured in the opening half of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's probably too bad that Parcells whispered to Shanahan  
without anyone listening in. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe he was giving him some important advice he promised 11  
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Shanahan probably wasn't listening.  
</P>
<P>
	He's got problems even Parcells can't solve.

<HEADLINE> Lou Dobbs To Work With NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lou Dobbs, who gained a following as CNN's  
financial news anchor, then quit amid reports of a dispute with 
management, has joined NBC but will largely stay on the radio for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs appeared on NBC's ``Today'' show today, saying he would  
put out a financial newsletter with NBC and be host of a radio 
program for the network. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're together going to create a newsletter on markets,  
finance, and the political economy, if you will, (and) provide some 
monthly insight for folks who are watching these somewhat turbulent 
markets,'' Dobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's for investors who are looking for a little more insight  
or perspective than they might get day to day. We're looking 
forward to it,'' Dobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also sets up a potential future television relationship  
between Dobbs and NBC once his three-year no-compete clause with 
CNN expires, The New York Times reported today. The clause prevents 
him from taking a job with any other television entity. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Times said he is able to sidestep the clause for now by  
appearing on NBC and its cable financial news outlet, CNBC, as a 
guest to promote his newsletter and radio program. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by host Matt Lauer ``are we OK here,'' because of the  
no-compete clause, Dobbs replied, ``Of course we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs left CNN in June, saying he planned to launch Space.com, a  
Web site devoted to informing users about outer space. He said last 
week that the Web site was still a priority but he also was 
pursuing offers for other ventures, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before his departure from CNN, Dobbs was involved in an  
unusually public spat with CNN president Rick Kaplan. A visibly 
unhappy Dobbs interrupted ``Moneyline'' so CNN could show a 
presidential news conference and told viewers it was under Kaplan's 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
	It prompted a Kaplan deputy to issue memos stating that CNN's  
executive producers have the authority to break into ``Moneyline'' 
to cover news when warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his CNN duties, Dobbs was president of CNN's  
financial network, CNNfn. It has run a distant second in influence 
to NBC's CNBC, the cable leader in business news. But Dobbs' early 
evening ``Moneyline'' on CNN drew more than twice as many viewers 
as CNBC's competing ``Business Center.''

<HEADLINE> Court: Muslim Cops May Wear Beards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to let Newark,  
N.J., authorities bar two Muslim policemen from wearing beards. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, acting without comment, rejected the city's appeal  
and left intact rulings that said such a ban would violate the 
officers' freedom of religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1971, the Newark Police Department barred officers from  
wearing beards but allowed them to wear mustaches and sideburns. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers Shakoor Mustafa and Faruq Abdul-Aziz are Sunni Muslims  
who say their religion requires them to wear beards. Both said they 
wore beards while serving on the force for at least 10 years, but 
that in 1997 the police chief issued a new ``zero tolerance'' 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy contained an exception for officers with medical  
conditions that keep them from shaving, but it did not contain a 
religious exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mustafa and Aziz were charged with disobeying orders to  
shave and were threatened with being fired, they sued. Their 
lawsuit said enforcement of the policy violated their right to 
freely exercise their religion. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled for the two officers, and the 3rd U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals agreed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The two officers ``are entitled to a religious exemption since  
the department already makes secular exemptions,'' the appeals 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the police department's lawyers  
said the no-beard policy is intended to present a ``professional 
and dignified image to the public'' and establish discipline and 
solidarity within the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers given medical exemptions are transferred to  
administrative duties with little contact with the public, the 
department's lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two officers' lawyers said officers with medical reasons for  
beards wrongly were treated more leniently than those who wear 
beards for religious reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Newark vs. Fraternal Order of Police, 98-1919.

<HEADLINE> Mother Launches Anti-Harassment Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The mother of a gay college student who was  
fatally beaten in Wyoming last year is appearing in a 
public-awareness campaign intended to help reduce anti-gay taunting 
in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The television announcement featuring Judy Shepard was unveiled  
Sunday by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network. It 
begins airing this month on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Shepard died Oct. 12, 1998, days after he was beaten  
unconscious and tied to a ranch fence outside Laramie, Wyo. Two men 
were accused of luring the 21-year-old student out of a bar, 
driving him to a remote prairie spot and then robbing and 
pistol-whipping him. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell A. Henderson, 21, was sentenced to life in prison after  
pleading guilty to murder and kidnapping. Aaron J. McKinney, 22, is 
scheduled to go on trial Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	In the announcement, high school boys in a locker room shout  
anti-gay insults. Then Judy Shepard says: ``The next time you use 
words like these, think about what they really mean.'' A photo of 
her son flashes on the screen with the dates 1976-1998. Then the 
words ``Murdered'' and ``Hate'' are followed by a shot of Mrs. 
Shepard with her head bowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please don't let there be a next time,'' she says quietly.  
</P>
<P>
	The announcement is designed to get viewers to ``think maybe  
there is a connection between their casual use of words like 
`faggot' and `homo' and a culture of intolerance that sometimes 
manifests itself in anti-gay violence,'' GLSEN spokesman Jim 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Jennings, the group's founder and executive director, said  
Mrs. Shepard played a key role in prompting California Gov. Gray 
Davis to sign legislation extending protections based on sexual 
orientation to students in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis signed the legislation late Saturday to outlaw the  
harassment of gay students and teachers in public schools and 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I am interested in seeing hate crimes laws passed, my  
primary interest is not in punishing future killers such as the men 
who take the lives of people like Matthew Shepard,'' Jennings said. 
``My goal is to prevent those killers from being created in the 
first place.''

<HEADLINE> Austria Far-Right Party Makes Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- A party whose leader once praised the  
Hitler era appears to have captured second place in Austrian 
national elections -- the best-ever showing for any far right party 
in Europe since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freedom Party's second-place showing -- which could change  
with 200,000 absentee ballots still to be counted -- leaves no party 
with an absolute majority, putting Joerg Haider's Freedom Party in 
a powerful position in the formulation of a government coalition. 
The election's final results will be announced next week. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Sunday's provisional results, Haider's party won 27  
percent, 5 percent more than in the last election and the party's 
best showing since its founding in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is terrible, it is frightening ... the world has not  
learned from its history,'' said Israeli Justice Minister Yossi 
Beilin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera's front page carried  
an editorial cartoon with a figure of Hitler raising his right hand 
and yelling ``Sieg Haider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the French Catholic daily La Croix, which described Haider  
as ``chancellor apprentice'' and a ``macho,'' explained Haider's 
success as an ``authoritarian populism `made in Austria.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Viktor Klima's Social Democratic Party remained in  
first place, with 34 percent of the vote. The conservative Austrian 
People's Party of Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel dropped to 
third place with 27 percent, only 14,000 votes behind the Freedom 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Democrats, the senior government coalition party for  
the past 13 years, have ruled out working with Haider's party 
because of its rightist policies. The Peoples' Party, the 
Socialists' coalition partner, have announced they would go into 
the opposition if they came in third. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless these positions change, Austria faces weeks of political  
uncertainty and the possibility of new elections if a viable 
government cannot be formed. 
</P>
<P>
	Haider, 51, said his party had ``risen with a sensational  
election result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer by training, the telegenic Haider has gained ground by  
addressing people's grievances in powerful and often strident 
speeches. He also appealed to fears among small business people and 
workers that European Union expansion into the former Soviet bloc 
could put jobs at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria is Europe's third most prosperous nation. The crime rate  
is low, and there has been no social or ethnic strife since the end 
of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Austrians feel a need for change. Much of Haider's  
popularity is based on the alienation many wage earners feel under 
the two ruling parties' high taxes and other policies. He has 
lambasted the stifling bureaucracy and ``fat paychecks'' of 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Haider's success likely will be frowned upon abroad. He is best  
known for having praised Adolf Hitler's employment policies and for 
having called veterans of the Nazi Waffen SS ``men of character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Freedom Party's campaign was dominated by calls to stop  
immigration -- posters in Vienna, the capital, warn against 
``over-foreignization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haider has also promised generous child care checks and other  
benefits that other parties say cannot be financed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a major change in the results from the absentee ballots,  
the Social Democrats will hold 65 seats in parliament, the Freedom 
Party 53 seats and the People's Party 52. The Greens, who won 7 
percent, will have 13 seats.

<HEADLINE> Titans' Fisher Defends Play Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans have had trouble  
running the ball, but coach Jeff Fisher said Monday he stands by 
his decision to hand off to Eddie George instead of passing for a 
2-point conversion that could have forced overtime against San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	George, who had just 26 yards on 15 carries, ran a sweep to the  
right side and was dropped for a loss, sealing the 49ers' 24-22 
victory and spoiling the Titans' opportunity for the first 4-0 
start in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of things we could've done. This one, we  
thought, gave us the best chance, and it didn't work. Give them 
credit for making the play,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans were in position to tie after Neil O'Donnell found  
Yancey Thigpen in the end zone for a 32-yard touchdown pass with 
1:48 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said the Titans hold out two or three plays a game for  
2-point conversions and can choose among them depending on how the 
game has gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans decided to run after calling seven pass plays on  
their previous three goal-line drives. Fisher noted 49ers 
linebacker Lee Woodall was blitzing when he stopped George, 
indicating the defense was expecting a pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said the Titans shouldn't have let themselves get into a  
position where they needed a 2-point conversion just to tie. They 
blew a 10-0 lead, and settled for three field goals after having 
first-and-goal three times. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was an interception by O'Donnell, a long punt return  
that set up San Francisco's second TD and a 53-yard run that set up 
the 49ers' final touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should have won this ballgame and didn't. You have to go  
on,'' Fisher said. ``There's no need to panic right now. We've won 
three games and are off to the best start in several years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is concern about the running game, which has been  
the most consistent part of the offense in recent years. The Titans 
averaged 123 yards a game last year, ninth best in the NFL. This 
year, the average has fallen to 69.3 yards. Only expansion 
Cleveland is worse. 
</P>
<P>
	George is averaging only 2.9 yards per carry and hasn't topped  
100 yards in 11 games dating to last season. His longest run is 13 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is fifth best in passing yardage, averaging 293 yards,  
and Fisher is confident the running game will come around. He 
pointed out that Tennessee started slowly last season before 
hitting its stride in October and November. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll come. Eddie's not frustrated. He's disappointed. Eddie  
right now is second in the AFC in all-purpose yards and at the 
running back position fourth overall. He had 100 yards (actually 
106 total yards) for us yesterday and we just didn't hand him the 
ball,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	George agreed, saying the Titans can't abandon the run just  
because it doesn't work all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had worse days rushing. We just have to find a rhythm  
once again as far as the running game is concerned,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Many Drivers Say They Run Red Lights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Virtually all American drivers agree that  
running red lights is dangerous -- but more than half say they've 
done it, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers who run red lights are involved in 89,000 crashes a  
year, causing 82,000 injuries and nearly 1,000 deaths, according to 
the U.S. Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Old Dominion University found that 55.8 percent  
of the licensed drivers they questioned admitted running red 
lights, even though 98 percent acknowledge that it's hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are enough red light runners out there that when you  
come up to an intersection and you stop, your first worry should be 
what's coming the other way,'' said the chief researcher, 
psychology professor Bryan Porter. ``I tell you, if you do this 
research long enough, you will get frightened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said he expected to find frustration and road rage to be  
the primary causes of running red lights. Instead, only 15.8 
percent of the people surveyed cited those reasons, while 47.8 
percent said they ran red lights simply because they were in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody does it, all demographics, all types of people,''  
Porter said Monday. ``We've all run red lights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 880 drivers ages 18 and older was  
conducted from June to August. It had a margin of error of 3 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officers said the findings reflect what they've seen.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a constant problem,'' said Mark Summerell, a sergeant in  
special operations in charge of traffic in Virginia Beach. 
``They're thinking about getting from point A to point B, 
forgetting about point B in between. It's such a fast-paced world 
we're living in now.''

<HEADLINE> Mets 5, Reds 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Once they finally figured out how to hold a  
lead over the Reds, the New York Mets put themselves in the 
postseason for the first time since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Leiter pitched a two-hitter and Edgardo Alfonzo homered on  
the sixth pitch as the Mets held firm Monday night, beating 
Cincinnati 5-0 in a one-game playoff for the NL wild-card spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's final postseason spot came down to a one-game playoff  
for the second straight year because the Mets couldn't put away the 
Reds, losing seven in a row after opening a four-game lead on Sept. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets now travel to Arizona to open the best-of-5 first round  
Tuesday night against Diamondbacks ace Randy Johnson. The win meant 
New York manager Bobby Valentine's first trip to the playoffs, and 
put the Mets and Yankees in the postseason together for the first 
time -- the Yankees take on Texas in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' victory also settled the other NL series. It will be  
Houston at Atlanta in Game 1 Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter (13-12), who ended the Mets' horrific slump just in time  
by beating Atlanta last Wednesday, made sure their lead over the 
Reds would never be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
	In his most important start since Game 7 of the 1997 World  
Series for Florida, the left-hander pitched his first complete game 
of the year. He did not allow a runner past first base until Pokey 
Reese doubled to start the ninth. Jeffrey Hammonds singled in the 
second for the Reds' other hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter struck out seven, walked four and retired 13 consecutive  
batters during one stretch, giving the Reds no opening for another 
magical comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's attempt to nickel-and-dime its way into the  
playoffs with the big-budget teams fell flat in front of the Reds' 
second-biggest crowd of the season. The Reds were shut out for only 
the third time this season and the first time since April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The $35 million Reds won 96 games -- their best total since the  
Big Red Machine was rolling in the mid-'70s -- but couldn't get that 
one final win. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of Ohio fans dreaming about an I-71 series with  
Cleveland, the New Yorkers can go back to speculating about that 
Subway Series with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Given a second chance to make the playoffs, the Mets showed up  
loose and relaxed and quickly muted the capacity crowd of 54,621. 
The cheers turned into gasps when Rickey Henderson led off the game 
with a sharp single to left and Alfonzo followed with a long drive 
to center on Steve Parris' sixth pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Hammonds turned, headed towards the warning track and  
appeared to have a chance for the catch, but the ball sliced 
through the damp, raw air and slammed off the soft gray background 
beyond the wall for Alfonzo's 27th homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets jumped and pumped their fists as they headed for the  
dugout railing as Alfonzo rounded the bases, sensing that the 
franchise's first playoff berth since 1988 was back in their 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd was buzzing again in the third when manager Jack  
McKeon made an uncharacteristically hasty pitching change. The Mets 
loaded the bases with two outs on Alfonzo's walk, John Olerud's 
soft double to right and an intentional walk to Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	Parris (11-4) flinched in disappointment and dropped his head  
when pitching coach Don Gullett came out to make a change, calling 
on left-hander Denny Neagle to make only his second relief 
appearance since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle, who threw 100 pitches Friday in a loss at Milwaukee,  
walked Robin Ventura on a full-count pitch to make the move 
backfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson led off the fifth inning with his 12th homer off the  
left-field foul screen, a drive that made every neck crane. 
Valentine jumped up and tried to wave it fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson pumped his fist when the yellow screen shook upon  
impact, jogged around the bases, then nearly came to a halt before 
walking the last few yards to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon made another hurried move in the sixth, bringing in  
closer Danny Graves to start the inning. This, too, backfired -- 
Graves walked Rey Ordonez on four pitches and gave up Alfonzo's RBI 
double for a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The temperature at the first pitch was 49 degrees. Both  
dugouts had heaters. ... The game was briefly delayed three times 
when fans ran on the field. ... The Mets and Reds split their 
10-game season series. All five of New York's wins came in 
Cincinnati. ... Neagle's other relief appearance since 1993 came 
last September in Atlanta's 4-0 win over the Mets. Neagle had 
thrown 100 pitches in a start Friday in Milwaukee. ... The Reds 
sold out only two other games all season -- opening day and a June 
12 game against Cleveland. ... It was the Reds' first home game 
under new ownership. Marge Schott transferred control of the team 
to three limited partners on Friday. Schott was at the game but 
stayed in the background. ... Leiter's previous complete game was 
Sept. 4, 1998, against Atlanta. ... All records from the game count 
in the regular-season statistics. ... Mets reliever John Franco 
will be making his first trip to the postseason.

<HEADLINE> Architect of Interstate System Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Francis Turner, a one-time federal highway  
administrator who advised President Eisenhower on the national 
interstate system and was considered its chief architect, has died. 
He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported that Turner died Oct. 2 and had  
been suffering from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner, a highway engineer in Arkansas who did road surveys that  
built support for a system of superhighways, started working for 
the federal Bureau of Roads in 1929. In World War II, he worked as 
an engineer in Alaska to help build the Alaska Highway, and after 
the war he coordinated the rebuilding of damaged roads in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenhower named Turner executive secretary of the highway  
advisory committee in 1954, which led to recommendations for a 
system of interstate and defense-oriented highways that were 
financed by both state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Mable Marie Nanney Turner, died in 1982. He is  
survived by three children, a sister, eight grandchildren and 13 
great-grandchildren.

 *Bernard Buffet    	
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Bernard Buffet, a painter often decried at home but  
revered abroad, killed himself Monday at his home in southern 
France, police said. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallery owner Maurice Garnier, who had worked with Buffet for 51  
years, said the artist was suffering from Parkinson's disease and 
had been unable to work for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	A millionaire who basked in fame since he was 20, Buffet was  
France's most prolific contemporary artist. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an outspoken advocate of figurative painting at a time  
when abstraction was the rage, and he remained faithful to the 
distinctive, black vertical brushstroke he used to recreate 
emaciated faces, imperial Russian palaces and sad-faced clowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffet was roundly ignored by the French art establishment. The  
Georges Pompidou Center, France's most prestigious collection of 
modern and contemporary art, never purchased any of his work. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Buffet was a superstar abroad, the subject of two separate  
museums in Japan, one featuring more than 600 of his works. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Paris on July 10, 1928, Buffet studied at the Academie  
des Beaux Arts. Private collectors have been snapping up Buffet's 
still-lifes, cityscapes and portraits ever since he burst onto the 
scene in 1946 with a self-portrait.

<P>
	PIERRE, S.D. (AP) -- Bill Hustead, who helped make Wall Drug a  
well-known tourist stop, died Monday after suffering Lou Gehrig's 
disease. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Hustead served as president of the internationally known  
business at Wall from 1972 to 1997. His father, Ted E. Hustead, 
founded the store in 1931. He died Jan. 12 at age 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Business at Wall Drug was meager at first. But the store was on  
a major route to the Black Hills and Badlands, and it began drawing 
in customers by offering free ice water and 5-cent coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	The store has grown from the original 24-foot by 60-foot wooden  
building into an emporium of 77,000 square feet that features 
souvenirs of all sorts, western art, clothing, a chapel, jewelry, 
veterinary supplies and more. Buffalo burgers and homemade 
doughnuts are especially popular food items. Coffee is still a 
nickel.

novels (``Starting Now'' and ``Night Calls''). 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962, Miller and his then-wife, Patricia George, founded the  
Film Industry Workshops as a training center for actors and 
directors. The pair, who divorced, co-wrote ``The Craft,'' a book 
on acting and directing.

</P>
<P>
	In 1984, Rubio took over as governor of Spain's central bank  
under the Socialist government of then-Prime Minister Felipe 
Gonzalez. He was forced to resign in 1992 because of allegations

</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Emil Schumacher, one of postwar Germany's leading  
abstract expressionist artists, died Monday. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher began drawing and sketching his surroundings and  
family members in his youth. In 1939 he became a technical 
draftsman at a nearby battery-works. 
</P>
<P>
	He resumed painting after World War II and in 1947, along with  
Gustav Deppe, Thomas Grochowiak, Ernst Hermanns, Heinrich Siepmann 
and Hans Werdehausen, he founded the group ``The Young West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1950s he broke with tradition and adopted a  
completely abstract style that became known as ``informal art,'' 
where the workmanship and application of paint and other materials 
becomes the image. 
</P>
<P>
	His paintings hang in museums around the world, including the  
Guggenheim in New York and the Tate Gallery in London.

 *Doreen Valiente    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Doreen Valiente, self-styled witch and a central  
figure in the revival of paganism in Britain, died Sept. 1. She was 
77. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Valiente was the author of several books, including ``The  
Rebirth of Witchcraft.'' Her verse and prose, such as ``The Charge 
of the Goddess,'' is recited by pagans all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in London and brought up as a Christian, Mrs. Valiente  
claimed to have experienced psychic episodes in her youth and was a 
practicing clairvoyant in her teens. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, a year after Britain repealed its Witchcraft Act, Mrs.  
Valiente was introduced to Gerald Gardner, who ran a coven 
practicing what he called traditional witchcraft -- a religion whose 
devotees worshipped the god and goddess of fertility. She was 
initiated as a witch in 1953 and became the coven's high priestess.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Tech Cracks AP Top 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Virginia Tech finds itself in elite territory for the first time  
in school history -- the Hokies cracked the top 5 in The Associated 
Press' Top 25 college football poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a 31-7 win over state-rival Virginia at  
Charlottesville, Virginia Tech (4-0) jumped three spots to No. 5 in 
this week's AP poll, while Florida State and Penn State remained 
1-2 for the third straight week. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this season, the Hokies' highest ranking was No. 10 -- for  
one week late in 1995 and in the final poll in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine teams in last week's Top 25 lost on Saturday, including  
Florida and Texas A&AMP;M. The Gators (4-1), who lost to Alabama 40-39 
in overtime, fell from No. 3 to No. 8, while the Aggies (3-1) were 
beaten 21-19 by Texas Tech and tumbled from No. 5 to No. 13. The 
Crimson Tide (4-1) jumped from No. 21 to No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (5-0), a 51-23 winner over Duke, collected 64  
first-place votes and 1,744 points from the 70 sports writers and 
broadcasters on the AP panel. Penn State (5-0), idle Saturday, was 
next with five first-place votes and 1,672 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan (5-0), a 38-12 winner over Purdue, moved up a spot to  
No. 3 with 1,606 points; Nebraska (5-0) improved two spots to No. 4 
(1,537 points) after a 38-14 win over Oklahoma State; and the 
Hokies rounded out the first five, receiving one first-place vote 
and 1,427 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (3-1) was No. 6, followed by No. 7 Georgia Tech, No. 8  
Florida, No. 9 Kansas State and No. 10 Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (5-0) was No. 11, followed by No. 12 Alabama, No.  
13 Texas A&AMP;M, No. 14 Mississippi State, No. 15 Marshall, No. 16 
East Carolina, No. 17 Purdue, No. 18 Syracuse, No. 19 Miami and No. 
20 Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State fell nine places to No. 21 after a 42-17 loss to  
Wisconsin, followed by No. 22 Southern California, No. 23 Texas, 
No. 24 BYU and No. 25 Minnesota, making its first Top 25 appearance 
since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	In the USA Today/ ESPN coaches' poll, the top five were Florida  
State, Penn State, Michigan, Nebraska and Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen teams in Division I-A have perfect records, and 12 are  
in this week's poll. Boston College (4-0) didn't make the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas State (4-0) moved up four spots after a 35-17 win over  
Texas, while the Longhorns tumbled eight places. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (5-0) moved up three spots to No. 11, and  
entertains Michigan Saturday in a battle of Big Ten unbeatens. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue fell six places after losing at Michigan, while Wisconsin  
returned to the rankings after a week's absence. Also rejoining the 
Top 25 were Southern Cal and BYU. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas, Oklahoma, Virginia and Oregon fell out of the Top 25  
after losses.

<HEADLINE> IOC Leader Will Testify on His Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch is  
ready to appear before Congress -- on his terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch says he's not available to testify at a congressional  
hearing this month because he's busy overseeing the reforms of the 
scandal-tainted Olympic movement. But he said he's prepared to go 
to Capitol Hill as soon as the reforms are adopted by the 
International Olympic Committee in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to go, but only in the right moment,'' Samaranch  
said. ``I have to walk into the House with the changes in my 
pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced Sunday at the close of a three-day IOC  
executive board meeting in Athens, allowed Samaranch to seize the 
political initiative and defuse the hostilities with his Washington 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC will ``fully cooperate'' with Rep. Fred  
Upton, who requested that he appear at an Oct. 14 hearing into 
excesses related to Atlanta's winning bid for the 1996 Summer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I welcome, indeed seek, the opportunity to inform you and your  
colleagues,'' Samaranch said in a letter to Upton. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton had threatened to subpoena Samaranch if he refused to  
testify voluntarily before the House commerce subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to appear last April when the Senate held  
hearings prompted by the Salt Lake City vote-buying scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch told Upton that his immediate priority is pushing  
through reforms aimed at restoring the image and credibility of the 
IOC after its worst crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the reform process as ``extremely important and  
time-consuming,'' Samaranch said: ``It is essential that I work 
full time to generate the required consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure you will understand that my primary responsibility  
in these circumstances must rest with the need to ensure that our 
reforms proceed as planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Samaranch said he would appear before Upton's committee  
any time after the Dec. 11-12 session at which the IOC will vote on 
sweeping reforms of its structure, rules and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apart from my inability to come to the United States earlier,  
this would also provide the most suitable opportunity to give you 
the best and most complete information, not only on what went 
wrong, but also and above all, on what remedies are being put into 
place,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, a Spaniard, said he will need a Spanish interpreter  
at the hearing ``to avoid any misunderstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would welcome a visit by Upton to IOC  
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he would ask the two IOC members in the United  
States, Anita DeFrantz and Jim Easton, and IOC director general 
Francois Carrard to be available to testify at the Oct. 14 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest move toward reform, the IOC announced in Athens  
that it has asked to be governed by an international anti-bribery 
convention. Reforms in the works also include new rules on age 
limits, terms of office and the bidding and site selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every crisis, you find a positive side, sometimes very  
small,'' Samaranch said at a news conference. ``This crisis gave us 
the possibility to change many things in our organization. It will 
allow us to present a new, younger and renovated IOC to the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upton has called the hearing to investigate what he described as  
a ``culture of corruption'' surrounding Atlanta's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	A report submitted to his panel last month detailed gifts,  
travel, favors and offers of college scholarships and job 
assistance to IOC members and their families from the Atlanta bid 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said the report, prepared by former Attorney General  
Griffin Bell, proved ``votes were for sale'' and accused the IOC of 
fostering a corrupt bid culture. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch said Sunday: ``I think the Bell report is very  
clear. It says there was no corruption. There are things that you 
can find in the report that are not as important as what happened 
in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has forwarded the Atlanta report to the IOC's new  
ethics commission, which will determine whether any IOC members 
committed wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Samaranch said the IOC will decide in December whether to go  
ahead with a scheduled executive board meeting in Colorado Springs 
and Salt Lake City in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has cited a possible ``scheduling conflict'' that could  
force the U.S. meetings to be postponed. Some IOC members are 
reluctant to travel to the United States because they could face

	-- The executive board said it was pressing ahead with its plans  
for a world anti-doping agency. The agency will be set up by the 
end of October and be operational by Jan. 1.

critics who say it should be totally independent of the IOC. While 
the head of the agency hasn't been appointed yet, Samaranch said it 
definitely won't be the IOC president.

the IOC and its anti-doping project.

	-- Salt Lake City organizers received IOC approval for their  
proposal to set aside for Utah residents 20 percent of the 887,000 
tickets for the 2002 Winter Games. The IOC said Salt Lake City's

study.

<HEADLINE> Report: UAL Eyes Air Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines reportedly is preparing a  
counterbid to an offer backed by rival American Airlines for 
control of Canada's largest air carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	United's parent, UAL Corp. based in suburban Elk Grove Village,  
and German airline Lufthansa are preparing a bid to buy 35 percent 
or more of the outstanding shares of Air Canada, the Chicago 
Tribune reported in Sunday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid, which could come as early as today, could block the  
merger of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines proposed by 
Toronto-based investment firm Onex Corp. That combination is being 
backed by American Airlines and its parent, AMR Corp. AMR owns 25 
percent of Canadian Airlines and would own 15 percent of the new 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL spokesman Matthew Triaca on Sunday said the company would  
not comment on the report. United Airlines is the world's largest 
air carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada spokeswoman Nicole Couture-Simard said the Tribune  
report is based on speculation and ``we are not commenting on 
speculation. We're not denying, we are simply not commenting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Lufthansa said he had no comment on the report  
but that the airline has ``never ruled out entering into even 
closer relationships for strategic purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Onex has offered $1.2 billion in cash and stock and would assume  
$2.7 billion in debt to take over the Canadian carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada has rebuffed the offer as an American plot to take  
over the Canadian airline industry. Canadian Airlines has not 
responded to the offer and may be waiting for Air Canada to sweeten 
a bid to buy the smaller carrier's international routes, its most 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune reported that UAL Chairman Jim Goodwin last week  
briefed United's pilots on the plan under which UAL and Lufthansa 
reportedly will each buy 10 percent of Air Canada's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	A Canadian bank, reportedly the Bank of Montreal, would buy up  
to 15 percent of the airline's shares, according to the Tribune. 
The Bank of Montreal owns Chicago's Harris Bank. Harris is the 
stock transfer agent for UAL. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL is 55 percent owned by three employee groups, with the  
airline's pilots owning the biggest stake. The arrangement obliges 
the airline to consult with the pilots and the machinists in any 
major undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
	A bidding war for a share of Air Canada would be a battle not  
only between United and American, but between two airline 
alliances: the United/Lufthansa-dominated Star Alliance, of which 
Air Canada is a member, and the American-dominated OneWorld 
Alliance, to which Canadian Airlines belongs. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL receives about $200 million annually as a result of Air  
Canada's membership in the Star Alliance, while Lufthansa receives 
about $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	American, meanwhile, receives about $120 million from Canadian  
because of its membership in the OneWorld Alliance. Canadian has 
said it will shut down next spring unless it has an infusion of 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	If Onex wins its bid to merge the two carriers, it has pledged  
that the new carrier will join American's OneWorld Alliance.

<HEADLINE> School Voucher Backers Laud Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court is letting Arizona give tax  
breaks to people who donate money for scholarships at religious 
schools, a development saluted as a major victory by backers of 
tuition vouchers and other aid for families whose children attend 
private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The court rejected two appeals Monday in which challengers  
called the Arizona program a flagrant violation of the 
constitutionally required separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	The action comes at a time when the political debate over  
tuition vouchers is heating up, sparked by Florida's adoption of 
the nation's first statewide voucher program. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, which began its 1999-2000 term with the traditional  
first-Monday-in-October flurry by issuing orders in some 1,750 
cases, is sure to play a key -- and still emerging -- role in that 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's action set no legal precedent, and the justices could  
decide sometime in the future to take up a similar case. In 
Arizona, the state's highest court voted 3-2 to uphold the 
tax-credit program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clint Bolick of the pro-voucher Institute for Justice said the  
Arizona ruling ``will now resonate widely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the momentum remains on the side of school choice  
supporters,'' Bolick said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church  
and State disagreed. ``It's dangerous to read too much into this 
denial of (review), especially when the court has before it a case 
much more directly involving aid to parochial schools,'' he said. 
``We hope the court will stop this erosion of the church-state wall 
of separation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The justices will hear arguments in December in a Louisiana  
dispute over the use of taxpayer money to supply computers and 
other instructional materials for parochial schools. Their 
decision, expected by late June, could offer important new 
insights. 
</P>
<P>
	The court has not yet said whether it will review appeals  
stemming from Maine's tuition-help program for families whose 
children attend private schools. In that state, the help is not 
offered for children attending religiously affiliated schools -- a 
law upheld by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, the justices similarly left intact a Wisconsin  
program providing vouchers good for up to $5,000 a year per child 
for students of poor families who attend private schools in 
Milwaukee. Most of those schools are religiously affiliated. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arizona, the state provides up to $500 in dollar-for-dollar  
tax credits for charitable donations to eligible private schools -- 
and religious schools are among those eligible. For taxpayers, 
that's far more advantageous than the simple tax deduction for 
other charitable donations, including those to religious 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	A $200 tax credit is available for public school extracurricular  
activity fees, covering items such as band uniforms, athletic gear 
and laboratory equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The rejected appeals, filed in behalf of some Arizona taxpayers,  
called the program ``a thinly disguised use of the tax code as a 
means of transferring public funds to the coffers of private -- 
mostly sectarian -- schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals were supported by the National School Boards  
Association, which argued in a friend-of-the-court brief that the 
Arizona program ``is a wink and a nod to the very clear and 
explicit prohibition against religious school financial support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Arizona Attorney General Janet Napolitano defended the  
program, noting that the tax credits are not given to parents, 
students or schools ``but to taxpayers making voluntary 
contributions for scholarships and tuition grants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Turned away arguments that Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former radio  
reported sentenced to death for the 1981 killing of a Philadelphia 
policeman, was denied a fair trial. There is little likelihood he 
will be executed soon. 
</P>
<P>
	--Let Knox County, Tenn., school officials require drug testing  
of everyone offered a teaching job, perhaps the boldest such 
program in the nation.

<HEADLINE> UPS Offers Customers Web Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service plans to provide free  
access to its World Wide Web site for customers who aren't already 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	The service is called ``fenced'' Internet access because it  
allows users to link only to the UPS Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The service, which uses the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser  
and connection software from AT&AMP;T, will be unveiled Wednesday at 
the Fall Internet World show in New York and will be distributed to 
interested companies early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	It enables companies that aren't already online to use the UPS  
Web site to track packages, estimate shipping times, calculate 
shipping costs and request pickup without having to go through UPS 
customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based shipping giant already provides those services  
online for customers with Internet access. UPS said it receives 
about 1 million tracking requests daily on its Web site.

<HEADLINE> Berbick Asks To Stay in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Former WBC heavyweight champion Trevor Berbick  
asked an Immigration Court on Monday to stay his deportation order 
for three years so he can work in the community and show he should 
be allowed to remain in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old Berbick presented himself to an immigration  
appeals tribunal as the victim of conspiracies wrought by his 
ex-wife, a former lawyer and former heavyweight champion Larry 
Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted to stay in ``the country that gave me the  
opportunity to be all I can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Neil Drabkin added that Berbick should not be deported  
because he has represented Canada in the ring for more than 20 
years and can contribute to society by working with troubled youth. 
He said that if Berbick stays out of trouble for three years, he 
would then ask to remain in Canada permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	Drabkin has lined up mostly character witnesses for the hearing,  
expected to last three days, including a United Church minister, a 
black community leader and some youths the fighter has begun to 
work with. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Clement, lawyer for the Citizenship and Immigration  
Ministry, said Berbick showed little commitment to Canada before he 
ran into legal problems in the United States and should not be 
allowed to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick, who won the Canadian heavyweight title last February  
despite his cloudy citizenship status, was ordered deported to his 
native Jamaica more than a year ago due to criminal convictions in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal also heard that Berbick was deported from the  
United States to Jamaica on June 27, 1997, but returned instead to 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been framed,'' Berbick said after Clement went over his  
convictions. ``But I'm not worried. I know I'm free and clean and 
not a bad person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick, who moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia after fighting for  
Jamaica at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, went to the United States 
after building an international reputation with victories over John 
Tate and an aging Muhammad Ali in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted of sexual battery against a woman he said he  
lived with five weeks after his second wife left him and served 15 
months of a four-year sentence in a Florida penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
	He denied assaulting the woman, whom he called an ``informer''  
in league with his wife and whom he said he later learned was 
working for Holmes, ``a guy I have serious problems with in 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick added that his lawyer at the time was ``working with the  
prosecution'' and did not know why Holmes had become his enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	An exasperated looking Clement found that Berbick was uncertain  
of the ages of his three children in Florida (he also had three 
with his first wife in Halifax) and didn't know if he had filed 
income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	During a break when lawyers discussed whether some evidence was  
complete, Berbick fell asleep in the witness chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick was listed as an ``absconder'' by the Florida State  
Corrections Department as recently as last summer, but the listing 
for parole violations was lifted on Aug. 20, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berbick won the WBC heavyweight title from Pinklon Thomas in  
1986, only to lose it to Mike Tyson in his next fight. His career 
record is 48-10-1, including a victory over Iran Barkley in his 
last fight, June 30 in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	He is scheduled to fight Shazzon Bradley, an American fighting  
out of Montreal, on an all-heavyweight card Oct. 29 in Montreal.

	CARDIFF, Wales (AP) -- The Welsh Rugby Union, host of the 1999

ticketing mixup at the opening ceremony and game between Wales and 
Argentina at Millennium Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Already under fire because overdue completion of the new

had never been sold. 
</P>
<P>
	It was uncertain whether the problem was caused by technical or  
human error, but with tickets for this weekend's game already 
allocated, there was no guarantee the same problem wouldn't occur 
again.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Eyes 'Tracking' Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp., irked by a slumping stock price,  
reportedly may create separate ``tracking'' stocks to reflect the 
value of different businesses such as the company's cable and 
wireless operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Any such plan would likely have to wait until after AT&AMP;T  
completes its acquisition of the cable TV company MediaOne Group, 
expected sometime next year, The Wall Street Journal said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over tracking stocks follows a recent 25 percent  
slide in AT&AMP;T's share price that some executives blame on confusion 
over how to value such a wide array of businesses, especially after 
the company's sudden foray into cable television. 
</P>
<P>
	One plan being discussed calls for three new stocks representing  
AT&AMP;T's wireless unit, its cable and Internet ventures, and its 
outsourcing unit for businesses, the Journal said, citing people 
familiar with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's board was scheduled to hold its annual strategy session  
in September, when the tracking-stock possibility was expected to 
be discussed, but that meeting was delayed until later this month 
because of Hurricane Floyd, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the nation's largest long-distance company declined  
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A new tracking stock wouldn't represent an ownership interest in  
any of the AT&AMP;T units, which would still be reflected by AT&AMP;T's 
common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, a tracking stock represents a stake in a specific  
division's financial performance. That way, an investor can choose 
whether to focus on an established, lower-risk business such as 
AT&AMP;T long-distance calling, or the company's high-priced gamble on 
using cable TV systems to deliver telephone and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, a fast-growing business, even if it generates  
little or no profits, can generally command a higher premium on 
Wall Street if it is not masked within a larger corporation. One 
recent success story that may inspire AT&AMP;T is Sprint PCS, the 
wireless company that has far outperformed corporate parent Sprint 
since the tracking stock was launched last year. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's reported discussions come less than a year after the  
company scuttled plans to create separate stocks for its wireless 
business and recently acquired cable operations. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, and for months to come, AT&AMP;T's shares were soaring  
amid enthusiasm over a $140 billion spending spree highlighted by 
the takeover of cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, however, investors have grown wary of the  
billions of dollars more that will need to be spent on upgrading 
and expanding the company's cable and wireless infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AT&AMP;T closed up $2, or 4.8 percent, at $43.75 on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Intel Renames 64-Bit Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Intel Corp. has named its fast  
microprocessor chip for powerful business machines ``Itanium'' as 
the giant computer chip maker moves into the fast-growing Internet 
networking business. 
</P>
<P>
	The 64-bit chip formerly had been named Merced, and is designed  
to run workstations -- machines with the ability to create 
sophisticated digital products such as movie special effects -- and 
servers, which are the traffic cops and information storers of the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Clara-based Intel said Monday the first samples of the  
chips had been delivered to its customers, with full-scale shipping 
scheduled for mid-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest maker of microprocessors is moving to break  
into the Internet networking business as sales of its core chips 
for desktop PCs slows and competition keeps profit margins down. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel is set to begin shipping its faster 700 megahertz Pentium  
III chip this month, but rival Advanced Micro Devices announced 
Monday it also has begun shipping a 700 megahertz version of its 
competing Athlon chip.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It happens only once every thousand years, but  
most Americans think the coming of the new millennium will be just 
another new year. 
</P>
<P>
	An ABC News poll suggests that six out of 10 think this is a new  
year like any other and one out of 10 won't even stay up to see the 
new millennium arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of those polled say they don't usually go out on New  
Year's Eve. Just over half, 54 percent, say they don't plan to go 
out this year, while 38 percent say they will. Three out of four 
say they've made no plans yet for New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABC poll of 506 adults was taken Aug. 16-22 and has an error

<HEADLINE> Convicted Reporter Loses Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former radio reporter convicted and  
sentenced to death for the 1981 killing of a Philadelphia policeman 
lost a Supreme Court appeal today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away arguments that Mumia  
Abu-Jamal was denied a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings about the justice system  
attracted worldwide attention. Thousands of supporters have staged 
demonstrations in Philadelphia to demand a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pennsylvania Supreme Court twice upheld Abu-Jamal's  
conviction and death sentence, most recently last year. The state 
court found no merit in the various arguments his lawyers raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal, a onetime Black Panther and radio journalist, was  
convicted of fatally shooting Philadelphia police officer Daniel 
Falkner, who was shot after stopping Abu-Jamal's brother for 
driving the wrong way down a city street. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal was found wounded at the murder scene. He has denied  
shooting Falkner, contending he was framed. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal acted on today raised three legal arguments, none of  
which focused on Abu-Jamal's claim of innocence. But his lawyers 
did tell the justices about ``an array of evidence powerfully 
supporting his longstanding insistence that he is victim of a 
monumental injustice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal centered on these claims:  
</P>
<P>
	--Abu-Jamal wrongly was stripped of his right to represent  
himself during his trial's jury-selection phase. 
</P>
<P>
	--He wrongly was removed from the courtroom after disrupting the  
trial proceedings, a violation of his right to confront the 
witnesses against him. 
</P>
<P>
	--He wrongly was excluded from a meeting in which the trial judge  
disqualified a sequestered juror who secretly had gone home to tend 
a sick cat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosecution's theory of the case was never placed within  
the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing such that the 
resulting verdict engenders confidence that justice was done,'' the 
appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	State prosecutors urged the justices to reject Abu-Jamal's  
appeal. They said he killed Faulkner ``by cold-bloodedly shooting 
him in the face as the officer lay helpless on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While today's action frees state prosecutors to seek an  
execution date, Abu-Jamal is not likely to be executed any time 
soon. He still can challenge his state court conviction in federal 
courts, a process that someday could lead back to the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Abu-Jamal vs. Pennsylvania, 98-1702.

<HEADLINE> Radio City Restoration Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All that glitters is gold again at Radio City  
Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	From its 3,000-pound gold silk curtain and scalloped sunburst  
ceiling to Depression-era artwork that has been hidden for decades 
under layers of grit and grime, the New York landmark visited by 
millions each year has been restored to its former Art Deco 
grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sparkling jewel once again,'' said Bob Russo, chairman  
of the restoration committee and general manager of Madison Square 
Garden, whose parent company Cablevision has a 25-year lease on the 
building and owns Radio City Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	The $70 million, seven-month restoration project was to be  
unveiled tonight at a benefit for the Lustgarten Foundation for 
Pancreatic Cancer. The event, which was to feature Billy Crystal, 
Ann-Margret, Sting, Tony Bennett, Ann Miller and Raquel Welch, will 
be aired on NBC on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first major renovation of the building since it opened  
Dec. 27, 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers replaced all six miles of the faded neon lights on the  
hall's famous marquee, rewired 1,500 chandeliers and re-insulated 
walls to improve the acoustics. All 5,901 seats were reupholstered. 
</P>
<P>
	Once considered the largest indoor theater and most modern  
structure of its time, the hall aged badly. Burnt out ceiling 
lights went unchanged, antiques were placed in storage rather than 
repaired, carpets and seats became shabby. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, the once grand lady of performance halls -- in debt  
and losing audiences with its tired formula of family movies and a 
stage show -- was nearly demolished. Saved by the wrecking ball 
after the city declared it an architectural landmark in 1979, a new 
management team was brought in and the hall slowly rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, nearly 2 million people visited Radio City.  
</P>
<P>
	The most Herculean effort in the restoration came in restoring  
the hall's artwork, which includes the 60-by-40 foot ``Fountain of 
Youth'' mural painted by Ezra Winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Russo said, the work got darker as layers of  
smoke and grime built up. It was made worse when someone decided to 
coat the artwork with polyurethane, sealing in the dirt and turning 
the painting yellow. 
</P>
<P>
	Art experts, using Q-tips, tiny scalpels and cotton squares  
restored the mural that graces the staircase leading to the 
mezzanine. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Collins, dance captain of the hall's signature Rockettes,  
said the sight of the restored theater moved her to tears. ``When I 
saw the theater, I felt like crying; especially when I thought of 
what almost was.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Davis Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Terrell Davis, the NFL's MVP last year, will miss  
the rest of the season because of a knee injury, a devastating blow 
to a championship team already reeling from four straight losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Broncos' running back tore ligaments and cartilage in  
his right knee while making a tackle Sunday during the first 
quarter of a 21-13 loss to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to him and he's in as good as spirits as he could  
possibly be in,'' coach Mike Shanahan said today. ``He's working 
through it right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is expected to be out four to six months and make a full  
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, with the ACL and the advancements they've made in  
technology, you never know for sure,'' Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach said Derek Loville will start in place of Davis. This  
is the third season he has backed up Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan, whose winless team is clearly diminished by the  
retirement of John Elway, will also review his quarterbacks. Brian 
Griese, who replaced Bubby Brister during preseason, threw three 
interceptions Sunday. Brister entered late in the fourth quarter 
and threw two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who led the NFL in rushing last season with 2,008 yards,  
has been off to a slow start. He was hurt during an interception 
return by Jets safety Victor Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos offensive tackle Matt Lepsis made a diving tackle to cut  
down Green at the sideline, but Lepsis also caught Davis, trailing 
the play slightly, on his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was assisted by trainers on the sideline, then limped to  
the locker room. He did not return. 
</P>
<P>
	After Davis' departure, the Broncos scored only a field goal.  
Davis rushed for 18 yards on eight carries. For the season, he has 
211 yards.

<HEADLINE> Study: Kids May Smoke To Lose Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Children who want to lose weight are more likely  
to experiment with cigarettes, researchers reported in this month's 
issue of the journal Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	``In both boys and girls we found children who thought about  
(smoking) were more likely to be concerned about their weight,'' 
said one of the study's authors, Dr. Alison Field of Harvard 
Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ``And 
those who were doing something to lose weight were more likely to 
smoke than those who were not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at more than 16,000 children, ages 9 to 14.  
</P>
<P>
	They were asked questions about their weight, including what, if  
anything, they were doing to lose weight. They were also asked if 
they smoked or considered smoking. About 6 percent of the 
youngsters were contemplating smoking cigarettes and 9 percent had 
smoked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Girls who were unhappy with their appearance were twice as  
likely to think about using tobacco,'' Field said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not directly ask the children if any actually  
smoked to lose weight, because ``we didn't want them to think we 
were suggesting this is a way to lose weight,'' Field said. 
Instead, the youngsters were asked separate questions regarding 
weight loss and smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Boys who exercised daily to lose weight were 90 percent more  
likely to have experimented with cigarettes than those who did not, 
Field said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the Journal of Clinical Investigation published a study  
that found moderate smoking helps the body burn fat. But the 
researchers also warned that smoking shouldn't be considered a 
substitute for dieting because it was a greater health risk than 
the added weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Jellinek, the chief of child psychiatry at  
Massachusetts General Hospital, said that although he doesn't 
believe the main reason children smoke is to lose weight, it is a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a tremendous amount of pressure to fit the  
societal stereotype of being very thin, and smoking fits into 
that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Bucks' Camp Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- George Karl thinks the Milwaukee Bucks  
can turn their honeymoon season into a long and successful 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks, fresh off their first playoff berth since 1991, were  
all smiles in the first get-together at their suburban training 
center on Monday. They had good reason to be: for the first time 
this decade, Milwaukee has a legitimate chance to advance beyond 
the first round of the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the mix of elements we've got here,'' said Karl, whose  
rookie season in Milwaukee was the best by any coach in franchise 
history. ``We're a little old, a little new, a little borrowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And not the least bit blue.  
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee's surge to a 28-22 record last season was a sign the  
perennially moribund franchise was on the way up for the first time 
since the Don Nelson era. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl said his task for the coming season is to merge Milwaukee's  
new arrivals with its talented, youthful returning core of 
starters. The Bucks have a week of camp in St. Francis before their 
exhibition schedule starts in Toronto on Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each year it gets better and better for us,'' said Glenn  
Robinson, who's entering his sixth season in Milwaukee. ``We have 
more depth than we did last year, and the players we've got want to 
win more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offseason didn't start well, with Michael Curry and Dell  
Curry leaving the team via free agency. Those departures were among 
the factors that got general manager Bob Weinhauer fired and former 
Knicks GM and Bucks player Ernie Grunfeld hired as his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld, who built the New York team that made the NBA Finals  
last June, did a startlingly efficient job of filling Milwaukee's 
holes while not tearing apart the team's youthful starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	He replaced 3-point specialist Dell Curry with veteran Dale  
Ellis, a more consistent shooter. He resisted the urge to trade 
Robinson, whom Karl expects to have a breakout year. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld couldn't address the Bucks' need for a big-time center,  
but he did the next-best thing, acquiring several players whose 
combined efforts could help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we obviously needed to get bigger and tougher, and I  
think we did that,'' Grunfeld said. ``It won't be center by 
committee, but we'll have a solid front line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks left last year's first-round playoff sweep by the  
Indiana Pacers convinced they needed a more physical inside 
presence that could play defense and improve the numbers of the 
second worst rebounding team in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Danny Manning, J.R. Reid and a healthy Scott Williams, all  
of whom should help Tim Thomas and Ervin Johnson to match up with 
bigger teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got pushed around a few times last year,'' Karl said.  
``That won't happen as much this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl lobbied hard for the acquisition of Reid, particularly  
after attempts to pry young center Kelvin Cato from the Portland 
Trail Blazers failed. Karl called Reid several times during the 
offseason and sold the unrestricted free agent on the Bucks' 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look around this room, and we've got most of the tools we  
need to succeed, if not all the tools,'' shooting guard Ray Allen 
said. ``Now it's a matter of us playing together and getting to 
know each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the best addition to the opening-day lineup will be Sam  
Cassell, who was acquired from New Jersey in March but played just 
four regular season games with Milwaukee because of an ankle 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	During the offseason, Cassell lost 15 pounds and worked to  
regain the quick step that made him one of the league's top point 
guards with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	While Karl said a forecast of a 50-win season was ``a little bit  
on the optimistic side,'' at least one new Buck isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a nice mix of players,'' Reid said. ``The way the  
league is so equal right now, who knows what we can do?''

<HEADLINE> Idaho Farmers Seek Water District / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (AP) -- Upping the ante in a fight over one of  
the West's most valuable commodities, Idaho farmers in Bonneville 
and Jefferson counties who irrigate by pumping from an aquifer are 
organizing to protect their water rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners last week approved an ordinance allowing farmers  
in Bonneville and Jefferson counties in central Idaho to vote on 
whether they want to create a groundwater district. Some farmers 
think the district will help protect their water rights in the face 
of increasing challenges, primarily from farmers in the Magic 
Valley area who irrigate from the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Taylor of Osgood hopes to get the issue on the November  
ballot but the farmers may have to wait until next February to vote 
to create the district and staff its three-member board. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in the Twin Falls Canal Co. and the Northside Canal Co.  
have filed a complaint in the Snake River Basin Adjudication Court 
alleging farmers from American Falls north to Madison County are 
pumping too much water from the aquifer. They say groundwater 
pumping depletes spring flows into the Snake River near American 
Falls, which means less water for them. That case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho's Snake River Basin Adjudication is the largest in the  
history of the West. It started in the mid-1980s and affects about 
180,000 water rights throughout southern and central Idaho. It 
already has cost over $30 million and is expected to cost an 
additional $20 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Creation of a groundwater district will allow farmers to  
organize and assess a levy to pay for attorneys and hydrologists to 
respond to the Magic Valley farmers' claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will allow the groundwater users to act in a united  
fashion to solve problems and to respond to threats to their water 
rights,'' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also allow farmers to measure how much water is being  
taken from the aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to a complaint, the Legislature passed a law for the  
formation of Groundwater Measurement Districts. Four districts were 
created covering the eastern Idaho Snake River plain. 
</P>
<P>
	But if they create a groundwater district, farmers within the  
proposed boundaries of the Bonneville-Jefferson Water District 
could hire their own hydrologist to conduct their own measurements. 
</P>
<P>
	Norm Semanko, a Twin Falls attorney representing Magic Valley  
surface water irrigators, is not troubled by the creation of 
groundwater districts. In fact, he encourages it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we've got someone we can sit and talk to,'' Semanko said.  
``Up until just two or three years ago, all we had was a disparate 
pack of thousands of water users.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texans will receive nearly 10 percent of the  
more than $1.3 billion being doled out by the Agriculture 
Department under a federal conservation program that pays producers 
not to plant crops on their environmentally sensitive land. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department on Monday announced the payment  
schedule, which averages $5,000 per farm or $45.15 per acre. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CRP is ... has reduced soil erosion and expanded wildlife  
habitat while improving air and water quality, restoring wetlands 
and encouraging tree planting,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
said. ``And at the same time, it has strengthened farm income.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has more acres enrolled in the CRP, 3.6 million, than any  
other state. Texas producers will receive $130 million in rental 
payments for September and October, USDA said, second only to 
Iowa's $137 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, producers voluntarily retire environmentally  
sensitive land for 10 to 15 years. In return, they receive annual 
rental payments. Enrolled land must be highly erodible, contribute 
to a serious water quality problem or provide substantial 
environmental benefits if devoted to certain specific conservation 
uses.

<HEADLINE> NYC Cardinal Says Tumor Not Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor said Monday that the  
brain tumor he had removed is not considered cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if doctors are using the word ``cancer'' to describe his  
case, O'Connor said: ``No one has used it. ... I haven't been using 
it. They told me I had a brain tumor. They took it out. And now 
they're using the X-ray treatment to assure there's nothing else.'' 
</P>
<P>

	``Each morning I go for five minutes and they zap me on either  
side of the head with X-rays,'' he said. His treatment is scheduled 
to continue for a few more weeks.

<P>
	O'Connor, 79, spoke about his condition after blessing a new  
cancer treatment facility affiliated with St. Vincent's Medical 
Center.

	O'Connor was released from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer  
Center about a month ago. Doctors removed a tumor from the surface

<HEADLINE> Agreement Reached on Safe Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian  
leader Yasser Arafat agreed on terms for the first-ever safe route 
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat cleared the way for the agreement early Tuesday, said an  
Arafat aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Israeli negotiator Shlomo Ben-Ami said Barak approved the  
plan Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The route will provide Arafat with one of the key underpinnings  
of the state he has sought for so long, and is the most substantive 
result of the newly revived peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben-Ami, who is also Public Security Minister, said the  
agreement brought a ``new atmosphere'' to the talks, which were 
revived last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to look at it as representative of a new phase of  
negotiations,'' Ben-Ami told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gaza Strip, on the Mediterranean coast, and the landlocked  
West Bank are about 24 miles apart and separated by Israeli land. 
The ``safe passage'' agreement would allow Palestinians to use 
Israeli highways along a fixed route between the territories. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of opening the route has been an emotional one for  
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	For Palestinians, the route is an essential link between the two  
territories under their control. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of safe passage is to make life easier for  
Palestinians,'' said Rashid Abu Shbak, a Palestinian security 
official in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Israelis, however, have protested that opening a route is  
an invitation to terror attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians said that the agreement over the route -- delayed  
for four years by previous governments -- was a sign of good 
intentions. They predicted that the passage would open within two 
days. It was supposed to open last week under the latest 
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our negotiations were conducted in a very positive,  
businesslike atmosphere,'' Saeb Erekat, the top Palestinian 
negotiator said. ``Both sides exerted maximum effort ... both sides 
were aware of the sensitivities and concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final sticking point had been over which side would dole out  
permits to travel the route. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately the two sides decided that Palestinians would apply  
to a Palestinian office for magnetic entry cards, and the 
applications would then be turned over to Israeli officials for a 
security checks. After approval, the traveler would pick up the 
card from a joint Israeli-Palestinian office, Erekat said 
</P>
<P>
	The passage would operate at least ten hours a day, seven days a  
week, Erekat said, and travelers would be expected to make the 
28-mile trip within two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben-Ami said the new agreement addressed Israel's concerns about  
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``A safe passage must be safe not just for Palestinians, but  
also for Israelis,'' he said. ``It's important to preserve the 
absolute and uncompromising sovereignty of Israel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barak said in a Knesset speech on Monday that he saw safe  
passage on Israeli highways as a temporary agreement, ultimately to 
be replaced by building a separate, elevated highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators also resolved the prickly issue over whether Israel  
could arrest Palestinians on the road, said Palestinian security 
chief Mohammed Dahlan, a member of the negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israel has given assurances that safe passage will not become  
a trap for Palestinians,'' he said, but was not more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of the delicate security situation, the head of  
Israel's Shin Bet security service, Ami Ayalon, met with Arafat on 
Sunday to discuss warnings that Islamic Jihad militants were 
planning anti-Israel attacks, Israel TV reported. Arafat promised 
security cooperation, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an Israeli soldier was injured Monday evening by  
stones thrown at his car in the southern West Bank, an army 
statement said. Troops were searching the area.

<HEADLINE> Oakland GM Gets Contract Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics, coming off one of  
their most successful seasons in recent years, on Monday rewarded 
general manager Billy Beane a three-year contract extension through 
the 2005 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Beane, working with just a $22.8 million payroll, was able to  
put together a team that finished second to the Texas Rangers in 
the AL West and challenged the Boston Red Sox for a wild-card 
playoff spot. The A's had not contended for a playoffs since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Beane assembled a team of promising young talent, including  
outfielder Ben Grieve, infielder Eric Chavez and pitcher Tim 
Hudson, with seasoned veterans thought to be at the end of their 
careers, including slugger John Jaha and utilityman Tony Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland finished with the best home record in the AL (52-29) and  
posted the league's third-best ERA (4.69). 
</P>
<P>
	Beane, 37, joined the A's as an advance scout in 1990 and became  
assistant general manager in 1993. Beane was responsible for 
signing such minor league players as outfielder Matt Stairs and 
pitcher Bill Taylor, who was traded to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation that Seattle and other teams might  
try to hire away Beane. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Oakland A's organization and fans are lucky to have one of  
the brightest minds in baseball calling the shots,'' A's owner 
Steve Schott said.

<HEADLINE> Chow Takes Chance With Coed Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	People find out what Loi Chow will risk to make $1,500 and  
think: If he's that desperate, why not just sell a kidney? 
</P>
<P>
	But maybe he's not desperate at all.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe,'' said boxing trainer Vern Miller, ``he's writing a  
book or something. Who knows? I'm pretty sure he's planning to use 
this publicity for something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chow won't be the first person to gain notoriety from women's  
boxing, only the first man. Come next Saturday, the part-time 
jockey and weightlifter, who stands just a shade over 5 feet and 
weighs 125 pounds, will give new meaning to the term ``Battle of 
the Sexes.'' He will be the male half of what is believed to be the 
first professional man-woman boxing match ever in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not farce, a husband-vs.-wife or  
boyfriend-vs.-girlfriend game-show stunt with ludicrously large, 
padded gloves. This is the real deal, on the undercard in Seattle's 
Mercer arena, sanctioned by the state of Washington. This will 
cross some very clear boundaries. More than pride could get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	What Chow, 34, expects to get, he won't say. If he does win, he  
was supposed to; and if he loses, well, he apparently hasn't 
thought that far ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fight will be over within a minute,'' Chow boasted during  
one of his few interviews. ``The first combination I land, the 
fight will be over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who trains the female half of the bout, isn't so sure.  
He's known 36-year-old Margaret McGregor for a while now and 
wouldn't step into the ring with the 5-5, 130-pound pro kick boxer 
himself. She turned pro last April and won all three of her bouts 
against women. The reason McGregor decided to fight a man was 
because the other women she was scheduled to fight kept ducking 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went through a couple months where a couple of fights fell  
through,'' Miller recalled. ``Margaret would train to be sharp, 
then have a hard time shutting down all that excitement and 
emotion, so sometimes she'd wind up fighting exhibitions against 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then one time someone told a local promoter about a guy, a  
lightweight, who was about to turn pro. And she kept asking to 
fight this guy. So I looked at the rulebook and saw nothing against 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That ``guy'' was Hector Morales, who claims to have had 10  
fights as an amateur in Mexico. He originally took the bout, then 
dropped it. At first, Morales said he was backing out because he 
was ashamed to tell his mother he was fighting a woman. Now he says 
problems with his visa made it impossible to guarantee he could 
take the fight when it was scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	In stepped Chow, who sparred with Morales, but hasn't had a pro  
fight in three years. The good news is the layoff can't hurt him -- 
much. Chow was already a very undistinguished 0-2 during his brief 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Loi Chow is a better boxer even than me,'' Morales said.  
``I guarantee he will win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if he loses?  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I got to admit, I was thinking about this when I was  
going to fight,'' Morales said. ``My friends, you know, were 
kidding me about being a `woman beater.' 
</P>
<P>
	``But then I started thinking, `If I lose, I jeopardize my whole  
career. If I lose to a woman, what man is ever going to fight me 
again? But for her, it's a different story, a big, big story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's part of the problem, too. Women's boxing is already a  
big, big story, equal parts sugar and spice. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia St. John, who insiders will tell you can't break an egg, is  
12-0 against hand-picked opponents and splashed across the cover of 
Playboy magazine. Muhammad Ali's 21-year-old daughter, Laila Ali, 
makes her pro debut Friday night in Verona, New York, already 
promising knockouts in rhyme. Just this past Saturday in Las Vegas, 
on the undercard of the Julio Cesar Chavez-Willy Wise fight, 
Christy Martin, one of the racket's proven superstars, collected 
$100,000 by starching Daniella Somers in the fifth round of a 
scheduled 10-round fight. 
</P>
<P>
	For those reasons, it's no longer just the prudent or the boxing  
purists who will be covering their eyes if McGregor vs. Chow 
actually goes off as scheduled. It's people like promoter Rick 
Kulis, who runs the International Female Boxers Association and 
knows just how far spilling real blood could set his sport back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell him not to worry,'' Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
	He's trained a few fighters and says few of them took to it  
better than McGregor. Miller is convinced it was because she knew 
what she wanted out of it. When McGregor was little, she bit off 
the feet on her sister's Barbie dolls. As a grownup, a man she 
loved hit her. Fighting back came easy. It felt good. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all grow up with ideas and fairy tales and set roles,''  
Miller said. ``But let me tell you, Margaret is no Red Riding Hood. 
If anything, she's the big, bad wolf.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Online Travel Firms To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Travelocity.com, a Texas online airline  
reservation service, and America Online's primary travel partner 
have agreed to form a new company in a multimillion-dollar merger, 
officials of both companies say today. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Worth, Texas-based Travelocity, a 3-year-old online airline  
reservation service, takes in $9 million a week in revenue and has 
provided hundreds of jobs in the San Antonio area and Dallas-Fort 
Worth. It will combine with Preview Travel Inc., to form a new 
company headquartered in Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said the merger would create a new powerhouse  
in the online travel market, which is the largest retail e-commerce 
category. It is projected to grow from $7.8 billion in 1999 to 
$32.1 billion by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Travelocity's owner, Sabre Inc., will contribute the assets of  
its online reservations division plus $50 million in cash in 
exchange for 70 percent ownership in the new company, formed as a 
Delaware limited partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Current Preview Travel stockholders will hold 30 percent of the  
combined entity through a new corporate entity, Travelocity.com 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the new company will benefit from a new,  
five-year contract with America Online Inc. It will make 
Travelocity.com exclusive reservations engine for all 
travel-related services within the AOL service, AOL.COM, 
CompuServe, Digital City and Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrell B. Jones, the president of Travelocity.com, will be  
president and chief executive officer of the new company. Donald J. 
Carty, chairman of Sabre Inc., will serve as chairman of the board 
until a new Sabre chief executive officer is named. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new Travelocity.com will bring together the very best of  
Travelocity and Preview Travel -- two successful and talented 
organizations -- to create an unparalleled combination of content 
and innovative services to online consumers,'' Jones said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Sabre Inc. has said it too is considering an initial  
public offering for Travelocity.com, where customers can buy plane 
tickets and other travel services over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Boards of directors at both Sabre and Preview Travel have  
approved the merger, which is expected to close in first quarter 
2000. But the deal is subject to regulatory approval, customary 
closing conditions and requires approval by Preview Travel's 
stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the largest online travel sites, Travelocity.com had $301  
million in gross travel sales for the first half of 1999, exceeding 
the total $285 million it recorded for all of 1998. Travelocity.com 
has more than eight million registered members. 
</P>
<P>
	Preview Travel is a leading online travel site with nine million  
registered members and reported gross bookings of $200.1 million in 
1998 and $166.7 million in the first half of 1999. Preview Travel 
offers integrated travel content and services to AOL's 18 million 
subscribers.

<HEADLINE> AL Umpires Picked for First Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jim McKean and Joe Brinkman were picked as crew  
chiefs Monday for the first round of the AL playoffs, and Rick Reed 
was chosen for the AL championship series. 
</P>

	The crew that opens in New York on Tuesday night for the  
Rangers-Yankees series has Jim Joyce behind the plate, Chuck 
Meriwether at first, Tim Welke at second, McKean at third, John 
Shulock in left field and Durwood Merrill in right. 
</P>
<P>
	That crew switches to the Red Sox-Indians for Games 3-4, then

</P>
<P>
	For the league championship, Tim McClelland opens behind the  
plate with Dan Morrison at first, Reed at second, Al Clark at 
third, Dale Scott in left and Tim Tschida in right. 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey by players last year, McClelland was the AL's  
top-rated ump, followed by Joyce. Hirschbeck was fourth, Reilly 
fifth, Tschida eighth, Scott ninth, Welke 10th, McKean 12th, Roe 
13th, Reed 14th, Morrison 17th, Cousins 18th, Shulock 21st, Young

<HEADLINE> In NFL, the Arms Race Never Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With apologies to Vince Lombardi, in the 1999 NFL season, a  
quarterback isn't everything, he's the only thing. 
</P>
<P>
	So:  
</P>
<P>
	--Denver and Atlanta, last year's Super Bowl contestants, are  
both 0-4 because John Elway retired and Chris Chandler keeps 
getting hurt the way he did before last season. Arizona is 1-3 
because Jake Plummer, who was supposed to become a superstar this 
year, has thrown 12 interceptions in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	--Washington is 3-1 because Brad Johnson has stayed healthy and  
is putting up enough points to offset a defense that's allowing 
almost 30 points a game. St. Louis is 3-0 because an Arena League 
graduate named Kurt Warner has become the first modern QB to throw 
three TD passes in each of his first three NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	--Green Bay could be 0-3 instead of 2-1 had not Brett Favre, the  
best quarterback in the game, thrown winning TD passes with 11 and 
12 seconds left. And New England is 4-0 because Drew Bledsoe has 
reached the elite level and his receivers, notably Terry Glenn, 
have remained healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	--Indianapolis is moving quickly into the middle echelons because  
Peyton Manning has developed into a premier quarterback in 19 NFL 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other examples.  
</P>
<P>
	There is Pittsburgh, where after two good games, Kordell Stewart  
has reverted to his 1998 form. Against Jacksonville on Sunday, he 
manage to get dumped for two safeties in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	There is Tampa Bay, where Trent Dilfer had been awful until  
Sunday, when he almost brought the Bucs back from a 21-0 
first-quarter deficit. But the emphasis is on ``almost.'' Dilfer's 
been an ``almost'' his entire six-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	There are the New York Jets, losers to Denver in last year's AFC  
championship but 1-3 because Vinny Testaverde tore his Achilles' 
tendon and Rick Mirer is now the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	There is Baltimore, which has a wonderful defense, but has  
replaced Scott Mitchell with career backup Stoney Case. Case has 
been OK, but the jury's still out. 
</P>
<P>
	There is San Francisco, which has a way of getting by with  
backups, and handed Tennessee its first loss Sunday with Canadian 
League refugee Jeff Garcia at quarterback. Steve Young is supposed 
to be back next week, but maybe Garcia is the future. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are the New York Giants, 2-2 because they have one of  
the NFL's best defenses but have Kent Graham and/or Kerry Collins 
playing quarterback. On Sunday, they managed to turn the ball over 
five times, giving Philadelphia 15 points and barely won 16-15 
despite outgaining the awful Eagles 361-174. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was struggling big time,'' coach Jim Fassel said of Graham  
after he threw three interceptions and was yanked for Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	So, unfortunately, are a lot of quarterbacks.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHO'S WHO:* The quarterback problems have produced a season in  
which almost no one looks good enough to win a Super Bowl, although 
someone will have to. There is certainly no dominant team like the 
Broncos, Packers, Cowboys and 49ers of previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's an early look:  
</P>
<P>
	An all-Florida conference title game in the AFC?  
</P>
<P>
	At this point, the Jaguars and Dolphins look like the  
conference's best, although they're certainly not overwhelming. New 
England has won all four of its games by a total of 19 points, the 
biggest margin being 12 over winless Cleveland on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee looks like a playoff contender, in part because it has  
a backup quarterback, Neil O'Donnell, who's better than half the 
starters in the league. And Mike Holmgren has predictably perked up 
Seattle. On the other hand, who in the AFC isn't a contender? 
Cincinnati, Cleveland and even Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NFC, the Vikings still look like the class of the  
conference even though they've lost twice and haven't yet scored 
more than 21 points in a game. Randall Cunningham finally found 
Randy Moss deep on Sunday, but Moss is still acting like a child. 
When Cunningham threw a ball too low, he pointed upward, showing up 
a quarterback who has 12 NFL seasons on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas is 3-0 because it has Troy Aikman, and the Cowboys  
probably will win the NFC East. But if they get to the Super Bowl, 
they're still only half as good as the team that won three times 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco is a shadow of its former self. But the 49ers,  
with Young and his receivers and a good linebacking corps, could 
win the West. The Rams, who have beaten two winless teams plus 
Baltimore, play host to San Francisco this week. They'll be trying 
to break a 17-game losing streak against the 49ers that dates to 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe the Redskins are this year's Falcons -- a team that becomes  
a contender by keeping an injury-prone quarterback (Johnson) 
healthy. But if Johnson goes down, the Skins can't survive because 
of a leaky defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre probably can carry Green Bay to the playoffs. And defense  
can do the same for Tampa, which needs Warren Sapp back. Beyond 
them are marginal contenders like the Giants, Cardinals and Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, it's a mediocre season.  

</P>
<P>
	QUOTE OF THE DAY: Carolina coach George Seifert, asked why he  
stuck with his plan to rotate Tshimanga Biakabutuka with Fred Lane 
after Biakabutuka had scored three times early in a 38-36 loss at 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I should have had him play defense,'' Seifert replied.  
``That was our real problem.'' 

</P>
<P>
	 *EARLY LINE:* A few quarter-season awards:  
</P>
<P>
	MVP: Tie, Brad Johnson, Washington; Brett Favre, Green Bay.  
</P>
<P>
	OFFENSIVE PLAYER: Tie, Kurt Warner, St. Louis; Tshimanga  
Biakabutuka, Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	DEFENSIVE PLAYER: Aaron Beasley, Jacksonville.  
</P>
<P>
	COACH: Tie, Chan Gailey, Dallas; Dick Vermeil, St. Louis; Dick  
Jauron, Chicago. 
</P>
<P>

	Ginsburg Back on Supreme Court  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Supreme Court opened its 1999-2000 term  
today, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was on the bench. 
Ginsburg had surgery for colon cancer just 17 days ago. The court 
issued a flurry of orders, including allowing Knox County, Tenn., 
school officials require drug testing of everyone offered a 
teaching job. Justices turned away an argument that former radio 
reporter Mumia Abu-Jamal was denied a fair trial, and rejected a 
challenge to Arizona's program allowing up to $500 in tax credits 
for contributions for scholarships at religious and other private 
schools as a violation of the separation of church and state.

	Groups Seek More Diversity on Court  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A coalition representing minorities and  
women's groups called for greater ethnic and gender diversity among 
Supreme Court law clerks as the court opened a new term today. 
Among the new class of 35 law clerks at work for the highest 
court's nine justices are five minority clerks -- two blacks and 
three Asian-Americans. Last year's class included one, a Hispanic. 
NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said the court still sends out the 
message that ``people of color need not apply'' for the influential 
clerkships.

	Clinton Facing Test-Ban Fight  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing almost insurmountable odds, the Clinton  
administration is trying to round up Senate votes to ratify the 
global treaty signed three years ago to ban nuclear tests. 
President Clinton was beginning with a strategy session today with 
members of his national security team, and he will lobby senators 
in person and on the telephone this week. Even if all 45 Democratic 
senators approve the treaty, 22 Republicans would have to join them 
to provide the needed margin. The vote is set for Oct. 12.

	Convicted Killer Captured in Mo.  
</P>
<P>
	BUFFALO, Mo. (AP) -- A convicted killer who broke out of an  
Arkansas prison and may have killed a man for his truck was 
arrested today in Missouri, police said. Kenneth D. Williams was 
captured in southern Missouri after a high-speed chase in which a 
motorist was killed, said an Arkansas state police spokesman. 
Williams escaped from the Cummins Unit maximum-security prison in 
southeastern Arkansas yesterday, and investigators said he was 
considered a suspect in the killing of a man who was found dead 
near the prison.

	Iraq Allowed To Export More Oil  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- While still deadlocked on an overall new  
policy for Iraq, the Security Council today authorized Baghdad to 
temporarily export more oil. The council unanimously adopted a 
draft resolution that slightly adjusts the U.N. oil-for-food 
program, which lets Iraq export $5.26 billion in oil over six 
months to buy food and medicine for its people suffering under 
sanctions. Iraq is expected to reach the $5.26 billion ceiling 
between Oct. 8 and 12 -- more than a month before the six-month 
period expires. Because of low oil prices and production limits, 
Iraq fell more than $3 billion short of the ceiling last year.

	State Farm Policy Holders Get $456M  
</P>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- A jury today ordered the nation's largest  
auto insurer to pay $456 million for allegedly cheating customers 
by ordering body shops to use substandard repair parts. Lawyers for 
State Farm policyholders complaining about ``aftermarket parts'' 
had asked for more than $5.4 billion in damages in the class-action 
lawsuit. Critics claim such parts fail to provide the same fit, 
finish, corrosion protection and, in some cases, safety as the more 
expensive parts made for automakers.

	Stocks Push Upward; Dow Up 125  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shot higher today, with  
telecommunications issues leading the way on word that BellSouth 
joined a bidding war with MCI WorldCom for Sprint. Market watchers 
were also guessing whether the Fed will raise interest rates when 
it meets tomorrow. Only a handful of economists now figure the 
central bank will see a need to cool off the economy. Just before 
the hour, the Dow industrials were up 125.38 at 10,398.38. On the 
NYSE, advancers led decliners 1,720-1,186. The Nasdaq was up 38.64 
at 2,775.49.

	Cubs Fire Manager Jim Riggleman  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs manager Jim Riggleman was fired  
today after a season in which his team went from 90-game winners to 
last in their division despite 63 homers from Sammy Sosa. The 
dismissal came one day after the Cubs finished their season with a 
67-95 record, the second worst in the National League and the 
team's worst since 1980, not counting the strike years of 1994 and 
1981. Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said he decided to fire 
Riggleman more than a week ago.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Revive Band's Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today sidestepped a dispute  
between a Virginia high school band director and the sheriff who 
arrested him during a parade for failing to speed up his marching 
band. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, refused to revive band director  
Robert F. Spiers' lawsuit against the sheriff who arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual legal case began during the annual Warsaw Harvest  
Parade in Warsaw, Va., in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiers was leading the Lancaster High School Red Devils marching  
band along the parade route when band members started lagging 
behind participants in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond County Sheriff Gene Sydnor, who was directing traffic,  
twice asked Spiers to speed up his band, saying the second time, 
``Pick up the pace or you're out of the parade.'' Spiers said he 
told the sheriff his students were going as fast as they could. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydnor grabbed a banner held by two band members and began  
turning them off the parade route. When Spiers told the band to 
keep moving toward its buses, Sydnor arrested him, handcuffed him 
and sat him on a curb. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now sit here and let everyone look at you,'' Spiers said the  
sheriff told him. Spiers was taken to police headquarters and 
released, and no charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiers sued the sheriff, accusing him of unlawful arrest, false  
imprisonment, using excessive force and causing him emotional 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydnor sought dismissal of the lawsuit under qualified immunity,  
which protects government officials from being sued unless their 
actions violated a clearly established right. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge let Spiers' lawsuit go forward, but the 4th U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the case after ruling that the 
sheriff was entitled to immunity. Sydnor overreacted, but he 
reasonably could have concluded the band director was obstructing 
the sheriff's performance of his duties, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Spiers' lawyers said Sydnor should  
have realized the arrest was unlawful. ``Failure to force a high 
school band to march faster than humanly possible is not an 
actionable offense in Virginia,'' the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Spiers vs. Sydnor, 98-1984.

<HEADLINE> Chow Takes Chance With Coed Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	People find out what Loi Chow will risk to make $1,500 and  
think: If he's that desperate, why not just sell a kidney? 
</P>
<P>
	But maybe he's not desperate at all.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe,'' said boxing trainer Vern Miller, ``he's writing a  
book or something. Who knows? I'm pretty sure he's planning to use 
this publicity for something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chow won't be the first person to gain notoriety from women's  
boxing, only the first man. Come next Saturday, the part-time 
jockey and weightlifter, who stands just a shade over 5 feet and 
weighs 125 pounds, will give new meaning to the term ``Battle of 
the Sexes.'' He will be the male half of what is believed to be the 
first professional man-woman boxing match ever in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not farce, a husband-vs.-wife or  
boyfriend-vs.-girlfriend game-show stunt with ludicrously large, 
padded gloves. This is the real deal, on the undercard in Seattle's 
Mercer arena, sanctioned by the state of Washington. This will 
cross some very clear boundaries. More than pride could get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	What Chow, 34, expects to get, he won't say. If he does win, he  
was supposed to; and if he loses, well, he apparently hasn't 
thought that far ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fight will be over within a minute,'' Chow boasted during  
one of his few interviews. ``The first combination I land, the 
fight will be over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who trains the female half of the bout, isn't so sure.  
He's known 36-year-old Margaret McGregor for a while now and 
wouldn't step into the ring with the 5-5, 130-pound pro kick boxer 
himself. She turned pro last April and won all three of her bouts 
against women. The reason McGregor decided to fight a man was 
because the other women she was scheduled to fight kept ducking 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went through a couple months where a couple of fights fell  
through,'' Miller recalled. ``Margaret would train to be sharp, 
then have a hard time shutting down all that excitement and 
emotion, so sometimes she'd wind up fighting exhibitions against 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then one time someone told a local promoter about a guy, a  
lightweight, who was about to turn pro. And she kept asking to 
fight this guy. So I looked at the rulebook and saw nothing against 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That ``guy'' was Hector Morales, who claims to have had 10  
fights as an amateur in Mexico. He originally took the bout, then 
dropped it. At first, Morales said he was backing out because he 
was ashamed to tell his mother he was fighting a woman. Now he says 
problems with his visa made it impossible to guarantee he could 
take the fight when it was scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	In stepped Chow, who sparred with Morales, but hasn't had a pro  
fight in three years. The good news is the layoff can't hurt him -- 
much. Chow was already a very undistinguished 0-2 during his brief 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Loi Chow is a better boxer even than me,'' Morales said.  
``I guarantee he will win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if he loses?  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I got to admit, I was thinking about this when I was  
going to fight,'' Morales said. ``My friends, you know, were 
kidding me about being a `woman beater.' 
</P>
<P>
	``But then I started thinking, `If I lose, I jeopardize my whole  
career. If I lose to a woman, what man is ever going to fight me 
again? But for her, it's a different story, a big, big story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's part of the problem, too. Women's boxing is already a  
big, big story, equal parts sugar and spice. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia St. John, who insiders will tell you can't break an egg, is  
12-0 against hand-picked opponents and splashed across the cover of 
Playboy magazine. Muhammad Ali's 21-year-old daughter, Laila Ali, 
makes her pro debut Friday night in Verona, New York, already 
promising knockouts in rhyme. Just this past Saturday in Las Vegas, 
on the undercard of the Julio Cesar Chavez-Willy Wise fight, 
Christy Martin, one of the racket's proven superstars, collected 
$100,000 by starching Daniella Somers in the fifth round of a 
scheduled 10-round fight. 
</P>
<P>
	For those reasons, it's no longer just the prudent or the boxing  
purists who will be covering their eyes if McGregor vs. Chow 
actually goes off as scheduled. It's people like promoter Rick 
Kulis, who runs the International Female Boxers Association and 
knows just how far spilling real blood could set his sport back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell him not to worry,'' Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
	He's trained a few fighters and says few of them took to it  
better than McGregor. Miller is convinced it was because she knew 
what she wanted out of it. When McGregor was little, she bit off 
the feet on her sister's Barbie dolls. As a grownup, a man she 
loved hit her. Fighting back came easy. It felt good. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all grow up with ideas and fairy tales and set roles,''  
Miller said. ``But let me tell you, Margaret is no Red Riding Hood. 
If anything, she's the big, bad wolf.''

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Battle Calif. Blazes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMPO, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters worked today to block two  
southern California fires burning through brush and grass, while 
lower temperatures and calmer wind elsewhere in California kept 
huge blazes for spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller fires lingered in the forests of Oregon.  
</P>
<P>
	Six firefighters were injured fighting a 4-day-old fire that  
blackened 5,000 acres near the La Jolla Indian Reservation in 
northern San Diego County. One firefighter was struck by a boulder 
rolling down a slope and was hospitalized in critical condition, 
said Tony Pereira, spokesman for the California Department of 
Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind drove the fire into part of the Cleveland National Forest  
by Sunday and charred a section of Palomar Mountain. The blaze, 
which was started Thursday by a trash fire, was 40 percent 
contained Sunday night, Pereira said. 
</P>
<P>
	In southern San Diego County, a blaze near Campo, a few miles  
north of the U.S.-Mexico border, destroyed a storage building and 
charred 2,000 acres of brush. It started Sunday afternoon but the 
cause was not known, said spokeswoman Betty Hawkes. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the central California coast in the scenic Big Sur country,  
the cooler, calmer weather eased the pressure on firefighters. Both 
of those fires in the Los Padres National Forest -- the 33,000-acre 
Tassajara fire and the 40,000-acre Hare fire -- were 50 percent 
contained Sunday, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Robert Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two fires started weeks ago by lightning in far northern  
California continued burning in the Trinity Alps Wilderness. They 
had spread across 93,397 acres, but one was 95 percent contained 
and the other was 30 percent contained, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in northern California, a 48,000-acre fire in the Sierra  
Nevada foothills of Tehama County, near Red Bluff, was 60 percent 
contained Sunday and fire crews allowed residents of remote Panther 
Springs and Boon Docks to return home, state forestry spokesman Tom 
Hostetter said. Full containment was expected by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A blaze on steep terrain in the Siskiyou National Forest near  
Brookings, Ore., grew to 1,760 acres Sunday but firefighters got 
help from fog and high humidity. The fire, which began Tuesday, was 
25 percent contained, said spokesman Frank Carson. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Oregon, crews had contained a fire that burned  
1,057 acres west of Eugene.

<HEADLINE> Government Reports Two Y2K Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government reported two more minor  
computer failures blamed on the Y2K technology problem on Monday, 
days after the start of its fiscal year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and Federal Aviation Administration each  
reported problems with budget-related computers caused by the date 
rollover, but they were able to solve the failures within hours, 
according to the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	The council, which monitored agencies through the weekend for  
reports of problems, earlier cited minor failures at the Energy 
Department and National Science Foundation. The fiscal year began 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department reported a problem with its financial  
management information system but was able to fix it by day's end, 
said Jack Gribben, a spokesman for the council. The FAA's national 
automated travel system also failed but was quickly fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gribben on Monday said none of the failures threatened public  
safety. The council asked agencies to continue to report problems 
through this week because failures could occur days or even weeks 
after Friday's date rollover. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be some agencies out there that haven't tried to use  
a fiscal application for the year,'' Gribben said. ``We don't 
expect we are going to hear much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department reported Friday that a purchasing system  
temporarily failed, and the science foundation reported problems 
with a system that provides information to grant recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Gribben said it was unclear whether agencies had previously  
tried to repair those systems that had failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Most departments are close to finishing repairs on their most  
important computers, but some won't be able to complete work before 
Jan. 1 on systems that weren't designated ``mission critical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Y2K problem exists because many older computers  
and software programs recognize only the last two digits of the 
year and could mistakenly interpret ``00'' as 1900.

<HEADLINE> Record Year for Home Runs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa didn't shatter a  
home-run record this year, all major league hitters did. 
</P>
<P>
	Homers sailed over fences at the biggest rate ever this season.  
Going into tonight's wild-card playoff between Cincinnati and the 
New York Mets, there were 5,526 homers hit in 2,427 games, a record 
average of 2.28 and up from 2.08 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous high of 2.19 was set in 1996, when 4,962 homers  
were hit in 2,267 games. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire beat Sosa 65-63 in the individual home-run race, the  
third- and fourth-highest single-season totals behind McGwire's 70 
and Sosa's 66 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty proud of myself as far as how I overcame a lot of  
things and to put up the numbers I put up this year,'' McGwire 
said. ``It just goes to show you the mind is a lot stronger than 
people think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a head-to-head matchup, each homered on the regular-season's  
final day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a happy man, not disappointed,'' Sosa said. ``I had a  
great year. For me, that's something to be happy about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. won his third straight AL home-run  
title and fourth overall, beating Rafael Palmeiro of Texas 48-47. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen players hit 40 or more homers, matching last year's  
total but still four short of the record set in 1996. A record 45 
players hit 30 or more homers, two more than the previous high set 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL batting average rose six points to .268, its highest  
since 1939, when it was .272. The AL average rose four points to 
.275 -- two points below its 1996 figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Larry Walker won his second straight National League  
batting championship. Walker, who started only 111 games because of 
injuries, hit .379, the highest NL average for a full season since 
Arky Vaughan hit .385 for Pittsburgh in 1935. Tony Gwynn hit .394 
in the strike-shortened 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's 42-point victory over Arizona's Luis Gonzalez was the  
biggest in the NL since 1948, when Stan Musial hit .376 and 
finished 43 points ahead of Richie Ashburn. Walker hit .461 with 26 
homers and 70 RBIs in 66 games at Coors Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing, I guess. In the same breath, it's a bad  
thing,'' Walker said. ``It's all right to have a batting title, 
then keep playing. But to win the batting title and go home, it 
doesn't mean as much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Nomar Garciaparra won his first AL batting title,  
hitting .357 to finish eight points higher than New York's Derek 
Jeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra has a sore right wrist and hasn't played since  
Thursday, but said he'll be ready for Boston's playoffs opener 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice but it hasn't really sunk in yet. I don't think  
maybe it'll sink in until after everything is all over,'' 
Garciaparra said. '' Myself and the team are focused on what's to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's Manny Ramirez had 165 RBIs, the highest total in the  
major leagues since Jimmie Foxx had 175 for Boston in 1938 and 
matching the 12th-highest total ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-nine players had 100 or more RBIs, nine more than the  
previous record, also set in '96. McGwire led the NL with 147 RBIs, 
matching his 1998 total and became the first player to play a full 
season and finish with more RBIs than hits (145). 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland scored 1,009 runs, the most in the majors since Boston  
scored 1,027 in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's Craig Biggio hit its 56th double Sunday, the highest  
in the majors since Detroit's George Kell had 56 in 1950 and most 
in the NL since Joe Medwick had 56 for St. Louis in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Randy Johnson led the majors in strikeouts for the  
sixth time, fanning 364, the fourth-highest season total ever. He 
struck out 10 or more 23 times, matching the record Nolan Ryan set 
with the California Angels in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Pedro Martinez won his first AL strikeout title with  
313 and won his first AL ERA title at 2.07 -- he won the NL ERA 
title two years ago for Montreal. Martinez also led the major 
leagues in wins, going 23-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's Mike Hampton had the most victories in the NL, beating  
Los Angeles on Sunday to finish 22-4, one win ahead of teammate 
Jose Lima. Johnson won the NL ERA title at 2.48. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Mariano Rivera led the AL with 45 saves and  
Montreal's Ugueth Urbina led the NL with 41. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Tony Womack won his third straight NL steals title,  
swiping 72, and Seattle's Brian Hunter won the AL title with 44 -- 
the fewest for an AL champion since Baltimore Luis Aparicio won 
with 40 in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero had 19 errors, matching the  
post-World War II high for outfielders of 19, by Lou Brock (1966) 
and Chili Davis (1988). After making nine errors in April, Guerrero 
avoided becoming the first outfielder to reach 20 since Bob Johnson 
of the 1935 Philadelphia Athletics.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Moves Closer to Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee moved closer to its first  
execution since 1960 when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal 
Monday from a man convicted of raping and murdering an 8-year-old 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee is the only Southern state that hasn't executed anyone  
since the high court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The 
state has 99 men and two women on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless Gov. Don Sundquist steps in or Robert Glen Coe is  
declared incompetent, Coe will be put to death Oct. 19. Coe can 
choose lethal injection or the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're as close since 1960 as we ever have been in the death  
penalty process,'' state Attorney General Paul G. Summers said. 
``We have about 13 steps in the death penalty process. We are at 
the 12th step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sundquist is unlikely to intervene. He has said the death  
penalty should be reserved for heinous crimes, and ``this fits that 
definition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public defender Henry Martin said in a statement that he is  
disappointed with the Supreme Court's decision and is ``evaluating 
options, which may include additional legal action and/or a 
petition for executive clemency or commutation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coe, 43, said that in 1979, he kidnapped Cary Ann Medlin near  
her home, raped and sodomized her, then choked her and stabbed her 
in the throat with a pocket knife. The former auto mechanic told an 
FBI agent that he became enraged when the girl kept saying, ``Jesus 
loves you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coe recanted before his 1981 trial and his lawyers used an  
insanity defense. The jury took an hour to convict him. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers have argued that there was no scientific evidence  
linking Coe to the crime, that the confession was unreliable and 
that evidence pointing to another man had been hidden or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Coe's conviction was set aside by a federal judge who  
said the jury was not given proper guidance. But a federal appeals 
court reinstated the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court refused without comment to hear the case.  
</P>
<P>
	The last person executed in Tennessee was William Tines, who  
raped a housekeeper after escaping from prison where he was serving 
time for a double murder. He died in the electric chair on Nov. 7, 
1960.

<HEADLINE> Radio City's Reopening A Gala Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Celebrities by the dozen turned out Monday night  
to celebrate the reopening of Radio City Music Hall after a 
seven-month, $70 million restoration project aimed at returning the 
Manhattan landmark to its 1930s art deco splendor. 
</P>
<P>
	Performers including Billy Crystal, Mary J. Blige, Sting,  
Ann-Margret, Lou ``Mambo No. 5'' Bega, Tony Bennett, 98 Degrees, 
Ann Miller, Raquel Welch and, of course, the Rockettes, were on 
hand to tape a television special to be aired on NBC in December. 
The taping was closed to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary J. Blige, a star on the hip-hop scene, hugged boxing  
promoter Don King as she walked down the red carpet into the 
concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard a lot about the place,'' Blige said. ``I'm really  
excited to see the place ... I've got to stay focused, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The renovation was the first since the building opened Dec. 27,  
1932. 
</P>
<P>
	All 5,901 seats were reupholstered. Wall covering was recreated  
by a textile mill following the design on a scrap of the original 
that was found buried behind faded wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
	And a team of 20 art experts cleaned layers of smoke and grime  
from the 60-by-40 foot ``Fountain of Youth'' mural painted by Ezra 
Winter. 
</P>
<P>
	As fans lined up across Sixth Avenue to catch a glimpse of their  
favorite stars going in, teen-age sensations 98 Degrees made their 
way into the historic hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us it's just great to be here. ... We're so honored to be  
here,'' said singer Drew Lachey. 
</P>
<P>
	King said he would like to see prize fighting in the restored  
music hall. ``It's a landmark of New York City ... a town that's so 
nice they named it twice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Christian Slater said he has a personal history with Radio  
City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I performed here as a child,'' Slater said as he was rushed  
past the media and into the theater. ``It's a place of history and 
it's a cornerstone of New York City. It's great it's restored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John T. Harris, 90, worked as an usher at Radio City's 1932  
opening. ``I made $15 a week. I was happy to have a job. It was the 
depression,'' Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	But is it really the same? Harris, who had a tour Monday  
afternoon said, ``It's a good impression of what it used to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The performance was billed as a benefit for the Lustgarten  
Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer, named in honor of Marc 
Lustgarten, former chairman of Madison Square Garden who recently 
died of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Hokies As Championship Contenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- While the mere mention of Virginia  
Tech and the national championship seemed laughable just a few 
weeks ago, the team notorious for playing weak teams early in the 
season might be changing the notion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies have stepped up their competition considerably in the  
last 10 days, and given Clemson and Virginia the same harsh 
treatment as James Madison and UAB. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, the last two victories against teams from the ACC  
have come with millions watching, and the dominance is getting 
noticed. In The Associated Press top 25 released Sunday, the Hokies 
climbed three spots to No. 5, their highest ranking ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's big time,'' defensive end Corey Moore said Saturday  
night, after the Hokies knocked Virginia from the rankings with a 
31-7 victory on ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to make a statement to anybody, but to the  
guys that are watching, I think we made a big statement,'' he said, 
speaking also about a 31-11 triumph against the Tigers on a 
Thursday night game shown nationally on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Both games demonstrated not only that Virginia Tech's No.  
1-ranked defense is as good as advertised, but also that the young 
offense is capable of dominance, too. 
</P>
<P>
	In Scott Stadium, redshirt freshman Michael Vick showed none of  
the impatience that led to three interceptions against the Tigers. 
By allowing plays to develop, he threw for 203 yards by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our first big game when we really stepped up as an  
offense and proved ourselves,'' said wide receiver Andre Davis, who 
burned Virginia's Tim Spruill deep both times he tried. ``People 
have got to recognize our offense now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had two catches for 110 yards, including a 60-yard  
touchdown, and seemingly could have run free all night had the 
Hokies chosen to run up the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Hokies opted just to run, with tailback Shyrone  
Stith carrying 11 times for 85 yards in the second half, when the 
Hokies added only 3 points to a 28-7 halftime edge but trimmed 
large chunks off the clock in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be surprised if anybody played well on defense,''  
Virginia coach George Welsh snapped after his team gave up 424 
yards. ``We let them do anything they wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech, meanwhile, let Virginia do nothing it wanted,  
holding Thomas Jones to 83 yards rushing, his lowest total since a 
55-yard effort against the Hokies last season. The Cavaliers were 
held to less than 10 points for the first time since a 26-9 loss at 
Blacksburg three seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who averaged 155 yards in the Cavaliers' first four  
games, said the defense was the best he's faced, comparable to 
top-ranked Florida State's. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter who it is,'' he said. ``If they're good,  
they're good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Ellis was sacked six times, including twice each by John  
Engleberger and Michael Hawkes, and Virginia's Donnie Scott punted 
nine times. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when No. 3 Florida and No. 5 Texas A&AMP;M both fell from  
the unbeaten ranks with close losses, the Hokies forged ahead in 
impressive fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	The toughest games remaining -- No. 18 Syracuse on Oct. 16 and  
No. 19 Miami on Nov. 13 -- both will be played before sellout crowds 
in Blacksburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Welsh seems to think Virginia Tech can be a major factor come  
championship time. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of defense can take you all the way just about,''  
the Virginia coach said, ``just as long as your offense doesn't 
hurt you.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Reviving Money Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin instructed his prime  
minister Monday to work out a compromise with parliament on a bill 
against money-laundering that the Kremlin had previously rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said after meeting with Yeltsin  
that the Cabinet and lawmakers would form a commission in an 
attempt to bridge their differences, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin rejected an initial version of the bill, proposed by the  
lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, claiming it 
contradicted the Russian Constitution and international agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Putin described the problem as simply a  
``technicality,'' according to ITAR-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to revive the bill comes amid allegations that Russian  
businesses and organized crime groups allegedly funneled up to $10 
billion through the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York scandal has been described as potentially  
one of the largest cases of money-laundering ever uncovered in the 
United States, though no one has been charged so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have dismissed the money-laundering  
allegations as a Western plot aimed to smear Russia.

<HEADLINE> Bledsoe Spreads Passes Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Ben Coates didn't catch a single pass and  
his coach wasn't even upset. That's because Terry Glenn caught 13. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Glenn had been shut out, Troy Brown, Shawn Jefferson or a  
running back might have been Drew Bledsoe's main target in New 
England's 19-7 win Sunday over the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots' passing attack is that strong.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good aspect of our team. It's very difficult to  
defend,'' coach Pete Carroll said Monday. ``You're seeing us 
benefit from being together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the fourth season that Bledsoe, Glenn, Jefferson, Brown  
and Vincent Brisby all have been with the Patriots and the second 
for Tony Simmons. Unlike last season when Bledsoe, Glenn, Brown and 
Brisby suffered serious injuries, all are healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are in the numbers:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Glenn leads the NFL with 32 catches and 544 yards receiving.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Bledsoe is first in the AFC in quarterback rating,  
completions, completion percentage and yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At least seven receivers have caught passes in each game, with  
a high of 10 in a 31-28 win over Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Patriots are 4-0 with a mediocre running attack.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not right yet and I don't mind saying that,'' Carroll  
said. ``We're not satisfied where it is right now, but it's good to 
be 4-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Browns, Glenn set team single-game records for  
catches and yards receiving (214). Coates, though, had his streak 
stopped at 34 regular-season games with at least one reception. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a case of them taking Coates away. A lot of our  
offense came where they were giving us an opportunity,'' Carroll 
said. ``We didn't know they would give us Terry Glenn but they did 
so we kept going to him.''

<HEADLINE> NL Playoffs a Jumbled Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Playoff baseball is coming a day early, again.  
</P>
<P>
	While Pedro Martinez and Orlando Hernandez are all prepared for  
the AL postseason, Greg Maddux and Randy Johnson will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because nothing is set in the NL, and it won't be until  
tonight's one-game playoff for the wild-card spot between the New 
York Mets and Cincinnati Reds at Cinergy Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know a lot about the National League clubs,'' Arizona  
manager Buck Showalter said. ``You don't hear the players saying, 
`If this happens or that happens.' We know we will be playing a 
quality opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the second straight year a one-game playoff has  
decided the final NL spot. Last season, Chicago beat San Francisco 
5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight's game starts at 7:05 p.m. EDT, with Al Leiter likely to  
start for the Mets against Steve Parris. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Mets win, they will take off for Arizona and face Johnson  
and the Diamondbacks. That also would send Houston to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Reds win, they'll go to Atlanta and see Maddux and the  
Braves. In that case, Houston would play at Arizona in the 
best-of-5 first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever wins, I don't think anybody will have anything to be  
ashamed of,'' New York reliever John Franco said after the Mets 
arrived at their Cincinnati hotel around 12:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets beat Pittsburgh 2-1 and the Reds weathered a rain delay  
of five hours, 47 minutes before winning at Milwaukee 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to go 163 games now, but it was worth the wait,''  
Cincinnati manager Jack McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL matchups, meanwhile, look extremely familiar.  
</P>
<P>
	New York vs. Texas, Boston vs. Cleveland. For the second  
straight year, and third time overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes for an interesting playoff,'' said David Cone, who  
helped pitch the Yankees to the World Series championship last 
year. ``All four teams legitimately think they have a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Yankee Stadium, Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez will pitch the  
opener on Tuesday night against Texas' Aaron Sele. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas will be trying to avenge last year's three-game sweep --  
and a four-game playoff loss in the opening round in 1996 -- to the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Last postseason, the hard-hitting Rangers scored only one run in  
the entire series against New York and batted just .141. They have 
since added Rafael Palmeiro to a lineup that includes Juan Gonzalez 
and Ivan Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great deal of respect for that organization, for the  
job Joe Torre has done,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates said. ``They 
are a professional team. But they had the season of the century 
last year. They're 15, 16 games less this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte is scheduled to start Game 2 for the Yankees on  
Thursday, followed by Roger Clemens and, if necessary, Cone. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not an easy task. I know our record is good against  
them, but it doesn't mean that we expect anybody to roll over and 
play dead. That's not a part of what they do,'' said Torre, the 
Yankees manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Again, I can't put enough emphasis on pitching,'' he said.  
``In a five-game series, you really can't afford to stumble. You 
get a little more air to breath in a seven-game series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, who became the first team in the majors to score  
1,000 runs since 1950, will face Martinez in the opener. He led the 
majors in wins (23) and ERA (2.07) and topped the AL with 313 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez won Game 1 at Jacobs Field last year, but the Indians  
came back to win the next three and chase Boston. In 1995, 
Cleveland completed a three-game sweep of the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping the third time is the charm against these guys,''  
Boston's Mike Stanley said. ``It's frustrating to continue to play 
them and keep losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Indians catcher Sandy Alomar Jr.: ``It seems like we have  
to play Boston every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux will throw the first pitch of the postseason on Tuesday  
afternoon at Turner Field. Kevin Millwood, Tom Glavine and, if 
necessary, John Smoltz will follow in the Atlanta rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our pitching staff is in great shape,'' Braves manager Bobby  
Cox said. ``It's as healthy as it's been all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Bank One Ballpark, Johnson was to start for the second-year  
Diamondbacks in Game 1 Tuesday at 11:09 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	The late start time at Arizona was partly to make sure all games  
in the first round are televised -- ESPN, Fox and NBC will take 
turns showing them. Tonight's game in Cincinnati was to be shown on 
ESPN.

<HEADLINE> Harbaugh Stays Chargers Starting QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- There is no quarterback controversy with the  
San Diego Chargers. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a bruised elbow and two slightly cracked ribs, Jim  
Harbaugh remains in charge of the Chargers' feeble offense, coach 
Mike Riley said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Riley left himself some wriggle room.  
</P>
<P>
	``I need to consider all things, but right now that's where I'm  
at,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh was forced out in the first quarter of Sunday's 21-14  
victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. Backup Erik Kramer threw two 
touchdown passes, but it was the Chargers' defense that won the 
game, intercepting Elvis Grbac four times, two of which set up 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers don't return to practice until Wednesday, and  
Harbaugh doesn't expect to do much work this week. ``But I expect 
to be able to play on Sunday,'' Harbaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers (2-1) visit Detroit on Sunday, their first game  
against Bobby Ross since he was forced out as San Diego's coach 
following the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Harbaugh said this elbow injury isn't nearly as  
serious as the one that bothered him last year. As far as the ribs, 
``If they're sore or broken, it's the same thing,'' he said. In 
other words, it's nothing a flak jacket can't solve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel surprisingly well, I guess,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh could have gone back in had anything happened to  
Kramer. He kept throwing on the sideline so his elbow wouldn't 
tighten up. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Erik would have gotten hurt, there's really not much of a  
contingency plan there. I just wanted to be able to go back in if 
that happened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of injury to both Harbaugh and Kramer, the Chargers  
really would have been hurting. With Ryan Leaf still rehabbing from 
shoulder surgery, wide receiver Mikhael Ricks is the emergency 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mikhael Ricks would have to go in and hand the ball off to  
somebody,'' Riley said. ``We weren't having very good success 
moving the ball with the regular quarterbacks, let alone having to 
go to our emergency guy. We haven't done enough work with that, 
either. We'll do a little more of that this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ricks hurt his neck on a reverse that set up San Diego's third  
touchdown. He later returned to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	That third TD, an 11-yard pass from Kramer to Chris Penn, was  
the only completion to a Chargers wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some bigger plays,'' Riley said.  
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's offense gained only 132 yards and is averaging 224  
yards per game. The only teams more pathetic on offense are 
Philadelphia and Cleveland, both 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
	With the way the offense has sputtered, the Chargers may  
actually welcome the return of Leaf, who had a troubled rookie 
season, on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf hopes to be ready to play by the Oct. 24 home game against  
Green Bay. One week later, the Chargers visit Kansas City, where 
Leaf had a disastrous game in 1998 that he'd like to atone for. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw what happened on Sunday,'' Leaf said, referring to  
Harbaugh's injury. ``They're both older guys, so it could come at 
any moment. Even if I am third string, I have to be prepared and 
ready to go in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf began throwing last week, and said he made about 30 throws  
of 20-25 yards on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Explosions During Kashmir Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANANTNAG, India (AP) -- Separatist militants triggered explosions  
during voting Monday, leaving one dead and 19 wounded and making 
good on threats to disrupt polls in Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Two explosions in Pampore, 20 miles south of the regional  
capital, Srinagar, injured nine policemen and two polling agents 
supervising the voting. One polling agent later died at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine other policemen were injured when rebels fired a rocket at  
a polling center in Pulwama an hour before it opened. The rebels 
detonated at least four more explosive devices near voting 
stations, but no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Separatist militants have successfully called general strikes  
and vote boycotts on each day that Kashmir has been scheduled to 
vote for a new Indian national parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Delhi, a spokesman for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party  
said voters had defied guerrilla threats in several parts of the 
country during the five-phase election. ``The ballot has survived 
bullets,'' Krishna Lal Sharma told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In Anantnag, only a few residents voted. In Srinagar, police  
used batons and tear gas against protesters, Press Trust of India 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels say elections do not give them the right of  
self-determination, which is their key demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of separatist groups have been fighting for a decade for  
Kashmir's independence or merger with neighboring Pakistan. More 
than 25,000 people have been killed since the fighting began in 
1989 in India's only Muslim majority region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thousands of people have shed their blood for the freedom  
struggle. We don't want their sacrifice to go in vain, so I didn't 
vote,'' said Ghulam Ahmad Tantaray, 60, a farmer harvesting his 
rice crop. 
</P>
<P>
	The monthlong general elections ended for most of the country on  
Sunday, and exit polls indicated the coalition led by Prime 
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee would return to power with a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	But the vote had been postponed in Anantnag because the local  
candidate of Vajpayee's party was assassinated a week before the 
original Sept. 18 polling day.

<HEADLINE> CBS Plans Majority Web Co. Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. is buying its first majority stake in  
a Web destination as the company steps up an aggressive expansion 
of its presence on the Internet, a source familiar with the deal 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has agreed to pay an undisclosed amount of cash for CTC  
Bulldog Inc., an Irvington, N.Y. venture formed earlier this year, 
said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. The agreement 
also calls for CBS to carry ads promoting the site. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement was planned in New York on Tuesday. Spokespeople  
from CBS and CTC Bulldog declined to comment on the deal, which was 
first reported Monday by The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	CTC Bulldog's Web site hasn't yet been unveiled but is ready to  
launch. It plans to use promotions such as prizes to try to draw 
Internet viewers, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has been greatly expanding its Web strategy and currently  
holds minority stakes in 11 Web sites, including SportsLine USA and 
financial news provider MarketWatch.com, which sold stock to the 
public this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS generally has exchanged air time to promote the sites in  
exchange for its stakes. While some of the investments have paid 
off handsomely, CBS currently has no single Web destination to help 
guide Internet surfers to other holdings. In contrast, NBC has Web 
portal Snap.com and ABC created Go.com to organize links to its Web 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether CBS would use its latest Web holding to unify its  
disparate properties, the source would only say: ``This is the 
beginning of what they're doing. It's their entrance.''

<HEADLINE> One in Six Americans Uninsured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 44.3 million Americans, one in six, had  
no health insurance coverage in 1998, about the same proportion as 
a year earlier, the Census Bureau reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found that the number of people without coverage grew  
by nearly a million, but overall population growth kept the rate 
about steady -- 16.3 percent in 1998, compared with 16.1 percent in 
1997. In 1996, 15.6 percent lacked coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those more likely to lack health insurance continue to include  
young adults in the 18- to 24-year-old age group, people with lower 
levels of education, people of Hispanic origin, those who work part 
time and people born in another country,'' said Jennifer Campbell, 
author of the Census report. 
</P>
<P>
	She said health care coverage among children did not change  
significantly from 1997 to 1998, with 11.1 million, or 15.4 
percent, of the under-18 population uninsured. Children aged 12 to 
17 were slightly more likely to be without health care coverage 
than those under 12 -- 16.0 percent, compared with 15.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lack of health care coverage has reached epic proportions,''  
contended Ron Pollock, executive director of the advocacy group 
Families USA. ``With this new Census Bureau report, it is now 
imperative that all candidates for public office come up with 
specific proposals to address the growing national problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs are the most common source of health insurance, with 70.2  
percent of Americans covered by a private insurance plan provided 
either through the employer or union. Nonetheless, nearly half -- 
47.5 percent -- of low-paid, full-time workers lacked health 
insurance in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The other major source of health coverage was the government  
through Medicare (13.2 percent of the population), Medicaid (10.3 
percent) and military health care (3.2 percent). Many people 
carried coverage from more than one plan. 
</P>
<P>
	While Medicaid covered 14 million poor people, about one-third  
of all poor people, 11.2 million, had no health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, higher-income Americans were most likely to  
have coverage. Only 8.3 percent of people in households with annual 
income of $75,000 or more lacked insurance, but the rate jumped to 
25.2 percent in households with incomes below $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign-born population were also more likely to lack  
coverage, 34.1 percent, than native-born Americans, 14.4 percent. 
Among Hispanics, 35.3 percent lacked health insurance.

<HEADLINE> Agreement Reached on Safe Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian  
leader Yasser Arafat agreed on terms for the first-ever safe route 
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat cleared the way for the agreement early Tuesday, said an  
Arafat aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Israeli negotiator Shlomo Ben-Ami said Barak approved the  
plan Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The route will provide Arafat with one of the key underpinnings  
of the state he has sought for so long, and is the most substantive 
result of the newly revived peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben-Ami, who is also Public Security Minister, said the  
agreement brought a ``new atmosphere'' to the talks, which were 
revived last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to look at it as representative of a new phase of  
negotiations,'' Ben-Ami told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gaza Strip, on the Mediterranean coast, and the landlocked  
West Bank are about 24 miles apart and separated by Israeli land. 
The ``safe passage'' agreement would allow Palestinians to use 
Israeli highways along a fixed route between the territories. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of opening the route has been an emotional one for  
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	For Palestinians, the route is an essential link between the two  
territories under their control. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of safe passage is to make life easier for  
Palestinians,'' said Rashid Abu Shbak, a Palestinian security 
official in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Israelis, however, have protested that opening a route is  
an invitation to terror attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians said that the agreement over the route -- delayed  
for four years by previous governments -- was a sign of good 
intentions. They predicted that the passage would open within two 
days. It was supposed to open last week under the latest 
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our negotiations were conducted in a very positive,  
businesslike atmosphere,'' Saeb Erekat, the top Palestinian 
negotiator said. ``Both sides exerted maximum effort ... both sides 
were aware of the sensitivities and concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final sticking point had been over which side would dole out  
permits to travel the route. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately the two sides decided that Palestinians would apply  
to a Palestinian office for magnetic entry cards, and the 
applications would then be turned over to Israeli officials for a 
security checks. After approval, the traveler would pick up the 
card from a joint Israeli-Palestinian office, Erekat said 
</P>
<P>
	The passage would operate at least ten hours a day, seven days a  
week, Erekat said, and travelers would be expected to make the 
28-mile trip within two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben-Ami said the new agreement addressed Israel's concerns about  
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``A safe passage must be safe not just for Palestinians, but  
also for Israelis,'' he said. ``It's important to preserve the 
absolute and uncompromising sovereignty of Israel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barak said in a Knesset speech on Monday that he saw safe  
passage on Israeli highways as a temporary agreement, ultimately to 
be replaced by building a separate, elevated highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators also resolved the prickly issue over whether Israel  
could arrest Palestinians on the road, said Palestinian security 
chief Mohammed Dahlan, a member of the negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israel has given assurances that safe passage will not become  
a trap for Palestinians,'' he said, but was not more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of the delicate security situation, the head of  
Israel's Shin Bet security service, Ami Ayalon, met with Arafat on 
Sunday to discuss warnings that Islamic Jihad militants were 
planning anti-Israel attacks, Israel TV reported. Arafat promised 
security cooperation, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an Israeli soldier was injured Monday evening by  
stones thrown at his car in the southern West Bank, an army 
statement said. Troops were searching the area.

<HEADLINE> Astros To Play Braves in Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Talk about flights of fancy: The Houston Astros'  
got on their charter plane Monday night and sat on the runway, 
waiting to find out whether to fly to Atlanta or Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a wild season, the Astros didn't know whether they  
would open the playoffs Tuesday at Arizona or Atlanta. They wound 
up with a first-round matchup against the Braves, thanks to the New 
York Mets' 5-0 win over Cincinnati on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Reds had won, they would have opened the best-of-5  
first round against the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get away as quickly as possible,'' general manager  
Gerry Hunsicker said before the team left the Astrodome. ``This 
won't bother them. I don't think anything can happen to this club 
that hasn't already happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astros manager Larry Dierker knows the Astros have a tough task  
ahead the Braves, who have won eight consecutive division titles 
and had baseball's best record this year at 103-59. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have the most complete team,'' Dierker said. ``They can  
out-pitch you or they can out-hit you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros lost six of seven games to the Braves in the regular  
season, including three of four in the Astrodome, where Game 3 will 
be played Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know how we've fared against the Braves,'' closer Billy  
Wagner said. ``Their reputation seems to beat us before we get out 
there. We seem to try to do too much against them. This season we 
didn't get the job done against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no lack of respect for the Braves.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know what to expect from them; there are no secrets,'' said  
third baseman Ken Caminiti, who was part of the San Diego team that 
beat Atlanta in the playoffs last year. ``They come at your with 
three Cy Young candidates and an MVP candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Reynolds (16-14) pitches against Greg Maddux (19-9) in the  
opener, and Jose Lima (20-10) faces Kevin Millwood (22-4) at Turner 
Field in Game 2 Wednesday. Mike Hampton (22-4) pitches against Tom 
Glavine (13-11) when the series returns to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to go out and try to give us some quality  
innings,'' Reynolds said. ``We're the underdogs and maybe that's 
good. Everyone expects them to win so let them have all the 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't matter which team the Astros faced, they knew they'd  
be underdogs after an injury- and illness-filled season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we'll be the underdogs and we should be the  
underdogs,'' Dierker said. ``We're a long-shot in a long season of 
improbable things that we have accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston clinched its third straight NL Central title on Sunday,  
finishing one game ahead of Cincinnati. But the Astros have been 
quickly eliminated in their last two playoff trips, getting swept 
3-0 by Atlanta in 1997 and losing to San Diego 3-1 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already shown the worst that we can do in the playoffs  
so now we have nothing to lose,'' Wagner said. ``We've been up 
against it all year. It's nothing new that we're the underdogs. 
We've been that all year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first year it was new and maybe a little overwhelming.  
Last year we weren't able to do a lot. This year, all we're ready 
to do is go out and play the best baseball we can. If it's 3-0 
again, well, we're going to give it our best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros won the NL Central by 12 1/2 games last season and they  
started this September with a 12-game winning streak, taking 
control of the race. But they won only six of their final 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played hard in the playoffs we just didn't always play  
good,'' Jeff Bagwell said. ``We expect to win. I don't think it 
matters that others think we're underdogs. Our whole goal is not 
just to get to the playoffs, but get to the playoffs and win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros hope to emulate last year's Padres, who won the first  
three games against Atlanta and took the series in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, the Padres didn't have the home-field advantage and  
they got hot and beat the Braves,'' Dierker said. ``This year, we 
go in with the fewest wins, and I hope it ends up the same way.''

<HEADLINE> Dean Convicted of Sex With Student </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARION, Ark. (AP) -- A former high school administrator has been  
convicted of having sex with a cheerleader after offering to take 
her home to retrieve her heart medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Love, 41, was sentenced Monday to three years in prison,  
the minimum sentence. He faced up to 10 years after being found 
guilty of violating a minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Love's only comment after his sentence was, ``God is good. He is  
good all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged victim, now 19, said she felt sick at West Memphis  
High School one day in 1997 but had left her heart medicine at 
home. Her mother wasn't home, and Love, then the dean of students, 
told her he'd take her to get her medicine, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said he took her to an apartment under the guise of running  
an errand and attacked her. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now 19, and her mother shrieked when the verdict was  
read. Her mother cradled the girl in her arms and rocked her as 
proceedings continued. 
</P>
<P>
	As the jury deliberated the sentence, the victim said, ``I want  
him to go to jail. He has to be punished for what he did to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love did not put on a defense during the trial, His lawyer,  
Samuel Perkins, said the victim fabricated the story to support a 
lawsuit against Love. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got this all fixed up,'' Perkins said. ``This is a $2  
million story here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love was hired this summer as a junior-high boys and girls coach  
and a special education teacher in a district about an hour from 
West Memphis. However, he took a leave from the new job after 
parents complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators there said they were waiting for this case to end  
before deciding on Love's employment.

<HEADLINE> Bush Backs Giuliani on Museum Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush on Monday backed  
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's attempts to cut off city 
funds for the Brooklyn Museum of Art for going ahead with a 
controversial art exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which opened Saturday, features, among other items, a  
black Virgin Mary adorned with body parts and elephant dung. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I've read, the exhibit besmirches religion,'' Bush,  
the GOP presidential front-runner, said during a campaign stop with 
Gov. George Pataki. ``It denigrates someone's religion. I don't 
think we ought to be using public monies to denigrate religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's right,'' Pataki added. ``When you use public money to  
denigrate someone's religion, I think it's wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, President Clinton disagrees with Giuliani, his  
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Monday that  
Clinton agrees with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who opposes 
Giuliani's position. Mrs. Clinton is considering mounting a bid for 
the U.S. Senate from New York, and Giuliani is her likely opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has indicated that he supports the first lady's  
position, and my understanding of the first lady's position is 
while she would find this objectionable -- wouldn't see it -- she 
doesn't ... agree with the action that the mayor's taken,'' 
Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have a grand tradition of freedom of expression in this  
country and a rich cultural art and humanities history that I think 
should not become part of or be attacked in the political 
context,'' Lockhart added.

<HEADLINE> UPS Offers Customers Web Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service plans to provide free  
access to its World Wide Web site for customers who aren't already 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	The service is called ``fenced'' Internet access because it  
allows users to link only to the UPS Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The service, which uses the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser  
and connection software from AT&AMP;T, will be unveiled Wednesday at 
the Fall Internet World show in New York and will be distributed to 
interested companies early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	It enables companies that aren't already online to use the UPS  
Web site to track packages, estimate shipping times, calculate 
shipping costs and request pickup without having to go through UPS 
customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based shipping giant already provides those services  
online for customers with Internet access. UPS said it receives 
about 1 million tracking requests daily on its Web site.

<HEADLINE> Seminoles' Warrick Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State's Peter Warrick, a  
leading contender for the Heisman Trophy, and Laveranues Coles were 
questioned Monday by authorities about a theft at a local 
department store. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick and Coles, who are roommates, were excused from Monday's  
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have all the facts in and until we do I won't discuss  
it,'' coach Bobby Bowden said Monday night after the top-ranked 
Seminoles finished practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Hunt, a spokesman for the Tallahassee Police Department,  
said Monday that two Florida State players ``are going to be 
witnesses or suspects,'' although he declined to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	TV stations WTXL and WCTV reported that police have a videotape  
of an alleged theft at Dillard's department store at the 
Tallahassee Mall where one of the clerks was selling designer 
clothes at reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Seminoles' 51-23 victory over Duke on Saturday in  
Jacksonville, Warrick scored three touchdowns and threw a 35-yard 
TD to Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, both players were arrested in separate incidents.  
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Warrick was charged with disorderly conduct and  
resisting arrest, both misdemeanors, for an altercation in the 
parking lot of a Tampa fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were eventually dropped  
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old Coles was charged with simple battery, a  
misdemeanor, in a domestic incident when he allegedly struck his 
stepmother outside her home. He was suspended for last year's 
opener against Texas A&AMP;M and later served 150 hours' community 
service.

airplane ticket and apologized to teammates before being reinstated 
to the team.

<HEADLINE> Lou Holtz' Wife Gets Good Prognosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Beth Holtz, with her husband nearby,  
underwent successful surgery Monday at the Mayo Clinic to remove 
her adrenal gland and a cyst on her ovary. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina coach Lou Holtz said in a statement that the  
operation went extremely well and his wife's prognosis is 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Holtz, who had a throat cancer operation two years ago, is  
expected to stay in the Rochester, Minn., hospital for five days, 
then recover at the family's home in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz had left the team Sunday and met his wife at their  
daughter's home in Indianapolis before the couple traveled to 
Minnesota. He is expected back at his office Tuesday and will be 
running the afternoon practice. 
</P>
<P>
	This surgery should end a frightening time for the Holtz family.  
</P>
<P>
	In September, Beth Holtz felt numbness and a lack of circulation  
in her leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors discovered tumors in her adrenal gland, lung, kidney and  
ovary. The only one found to be malignant was the adrenal gland, 
her son, Skip, an assistant to his father, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her latest troubles have nothing to do with the throat cancer,  
which radiation treatments have kept in remission, Skip Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two weeks, Lou Holtz has been upbeat and confident  
about his wife's recovery. ``She's stronger than I am,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their son says that strength comes from the couple's faith and  
solid family ties. ``It has always been that way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the concerns about his mother's recovery was her frailty  
after her throat cancer. She dropped to 85 pounds and needed nearly 
a year to feel like herself again, Skip Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was hard to gain the weight back since treatments created  
much scar tissue in her throat and damaged her taste buds, Skip 
Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took her so long in the past,'' he said. ``It's one of the  
worries about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other family members are expected to remain with Beth Holtz once  
Lou Holtz comes back to South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip, who is trying to spark the least productive Division I-A  
offense in the country, likely will not be among them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been one of the most difficult years of my life,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Holtz's medical problems also have kept Lou Holtz spinning  
in different directions. The 62-year-old keeps a hectic schedule 
normally, but he made two round trips between the Mayo Clinic and 
Williams-Brice Stadium last week, visiting his wife and preparing 
the Gamecocks for their 36-10 loss to Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Holtz was key in convincing her husband to end his TV  
studio retirement and take control of the Gamecocks. Her presence 
her helped persuade Skip to leave as Connecticut's head coach so 
his three children could be near their grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	The Holtzes have been married for 38 years and have four  
children, Luanne Altenbaumer, Skip, Kevin and Elizabeth Messaglia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gamecocks (0-5), who are home this week against Kentucky,  
have the country's longest Division I losing streak at 15 games.

<HEADLINE> Another Step in Expos' Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- The proposed sale of the Montreal Expos to a  
group headed by New York art dealer Jeffrey Loria took a step 
forward Monday when the team's current owners gave their unanimous 
consent in principle. 
</P>
<P>
	Expos chairman Jacques Menard, who has helped Loria put together  
the investors who hope to buy the time from Claude Brochu's group, 
said the plan will be forwarded to the commissioner's office. While 
Menard hopes the sale could be put to a vote within a month or so, 
but the approval process for baseball sales usually takes much 
longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have confidence in our ability to convince major league  
baseball that we have here a business plan which will make Montreal 
a winning baseball city,'' Menard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loria and the new investors would buy 35 percent of the team and  
hold the controlling interest. The current group, which might bring 
in some new partners, would own the remaining 65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is tied to the team obtaining funding for a new  
ballpark.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A central bank survey showing further optimism  
about Japan's economy helped pushed up Tokyo share prices slightly 
today. The dollar also gained against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 51.15  
points, or 0.29 percent, to 17,763.71. On Friday, the index climbed 
107.10 points, or 0.61 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar was trading at 106.11 yen on the Tokyo foreign  
exchange market today, up 0.17 yen from late Friday and also above 
its late Friday level of 104.96 yen in New York. The greenback 
traded from 104.42 yen to 106.22 yen during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	In the stock market, Tokyo share prices moved higher following  
the release of the quarterly ``tankan'' survey by the Bank of Japan 
earlier today. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey stated that sentiment among large manufacturers had  
brightened over the last survey to a figure of minus 22 from minus 
37, its biggest improvement since November 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The tankan measures the percentage of firms seeing business  
conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen. 
The bank surveyed 9,275 companies for the latest report. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the tankan also showed that business investment  
continues to taper off in Japan. Investment plans for large 
companies showed they expect spending on plant and equipment to 
shrink by 9.4 percent this year. In June, the same companies had 
forecast only a 7.9 percent drop. 
</P>
<P>
	As the implications of the capital spending plans became clear  
to traders, buying dried up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market rose a bit on the tankan results at first, but  
rather than rally, share prices then stumbled to trade within a 
narrow range,'' said Kazunori Shimono, manager of the equity 
trading section at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though market conditions aren't bad, the tankan results were  
not positive enough for players to buy higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed up 0.90 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,515.98. 
The TOPIX closed up 8.25 points, or 0.55 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 434.23 million shares, down from 543.54 million shares 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners outnumbered advancers 657 to 568 on the first section  
of the Tokyo stock exchange, while 113 remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed  
at 10,273.00 points, down 63.95. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar gained against the yen as the  
tankan survey showed weaker-than-expected corporate capital 
spending plans for fiscal 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The worse-than-expected capital spending figures for this fiscal  
year could yet spoil Japan's nascent economic recovery, which 
triggered investors to buy dollars, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the central bank survey, large corporation capital  
spending index for this fiscal year is seen falling to minus 9.4, 
from minus 5.8 in the last quarter. It's the lowest figure since 
September 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 113.82 yen today, up 0.46  
yen from its level late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.6000 percent from Friday's finish of 1.6750 percent. Its price 
rose 0.66 points to 100.87.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton To Visit Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will meet  
with the presidents of Poland and Slovakia at the beginning of a 
trip that will also include stops in Italy and Iceland, her office 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	New York politicians have traditionally considered Italy,  
Ireland and Israel valuable foreign stops, since those countries 
have large natural constituencies in New York City and elsewhere in 
the state. But the White House said Monday that Mrs. Clinton, the 
likely Democratic candidate for Senate in New York next year, is 
going abroad only as an ambassador of the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'll be continuing her work as an ambassador of the United  
States,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said. The trip 
focuses on ``democracy in Europe, and the many programs that she's 
worked so hard on,'' he said, including women's rights and economic 
empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton will meet separately Tuesday with Polish Prime  
Minister Jerzy Buzek and President Aleksander Kwasniewski in 
Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
	She will also speak to students at a Warsaw school and to female  
workers at a textile factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also meets separately with the president and prime  
minister of Slovakia during a visit to the capital, Bratislava, on 
Wednesday. She will attend a meeting of organizations that work 
alongside governments to promote democracy worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief stop in Italy, she'll go to Iceland for this  
year's Vital Voices conference, focusing on women's participation 
in democracy worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	At last year's gathering in Montevideo, Uruguay, Mrs. Clinton  
told 1,000 women from throughout the hemisphere that women can make 
democracy and prosperity spread more widely and deeply than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton will return to Washington on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tanker Makes Emergency Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRNS, Australia (AP) -- A United States Air Force tanker plane  
loaded with aviation fuel made a successful emergency landing at 
Cairns airport today after a faulty sensor incorrectly indicated 
one of its engines was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The K-135 midair refueller, a converted Boeing 707, with nine  
crew aboard, took off early this morning from the airport at this 
city 1,050 miles north of Sydney, AirServices Australia spokesman 
Richard Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four minutes later, the pilot requested emergency services be  
placed on standby after noticing a warning light indicating an 
engine was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot shut down the plane's number three engine and landed  
safely at the civilian airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers who inspected the engine determined there had been no  
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was caused by a loose hose clip, which allowed very hot  
heated air into the engine cell and activated the fire alarm 
sensor,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tanker had been returning to Hickam Air Force Base in  
Honolulu, said Merv Fowler, air traffic control manager at Cairns 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Further details on the flight and its crew were not immediately  
available.

<HEADLINE> NFL Owners Renew Expansion Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFL's expansion team mystery tour continues  
in Atlanta, with owners still trying to decide whether to give 
Houston or Los Angeles the league's 32nd franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion committee is scheduled to meet Tuesday evening,  
with the full ownership convening the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is weighing whether to award its 32nd franchise to  
Robert McNair and Houston, which has a stadium and financing plan 
ready to go, or to Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood super-agent who 
proposes to build a stadium at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion committee may or may not make a firm  
recommendation to the league ownership, which may or may not make a 
final decision. And there are signs that the selection process, 
which has been dragging on all year, could be further delayed by 
putting off any decision until the owners meet again next month -- 
and maybe beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is sentiment among at least some of the owners to try  
to assure having teams in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones suggested that the league give  
Houston the expansion team, then find an existing team to move to 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston has the more complete package, including $195 million in  
public funds for a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ovitz, whose group of backers include grocery  
billionaire Ron Burkle and actor Tom Cruise, seems to have 
captivated some NFL owners as a potential franchise owner because 
of his background in the entertainment industry. NFL commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue has called Ovitz a ``visionary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league also is very aware that it doesn't have a presence in  
what is the nation's second-largest TV market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz, who initially proposed building a stadium on a former  
landfill in suburban Carson, moved back in the forefront of the Los 
Angeles picture last week after oil billionaire Marvin Davis 
dropped his bid to bring a team to Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Coliseum, the league's top choice for a team  
several months ago, seems to be on the back burner. The NFL had 
asked for public funding for the Coliseum remodel and parking 
improvements, then opened the bidding up to other groups in the 
area after there was no promise of public money. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz has agreed to pay the league a reported $25 million in  
earnest money if he and his group are awarded a franchise. Such a 
deposit would guarantee the league that Ovitz and his backers meet 
the terms of their agreement, or forfeit the money. 
</P>
<P>
	If Ovitz and his group get the team, he may have some  
flexibility on where to put it. Although Hollywood Park was 
approved by the owners as a possible site for a team several years 
ago, there may be some stumbling blocks to building a stadium 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Parking, one of the league's complaints about the Coliseum, also  
could be a problem at Hollywood Park. There are plenty of 
additional spaces across the street at the Forum, but that arena is 
now owned by Ed Roski and his partner. Roski has been snubbed by 
the NFL in his attempt to bring a team to the Coliseum.. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is a question of whether some of the team owners now  
would approve a stadium on the same property with a horse racing 
track and a casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz said recently that he was optimistic about getting the  
expansion franchise, but cautioned that any such move would have to 
be approved by 24 of the league's 31 team owners. 
</P>
<P>
	They did reach a consensus last March, voting 29-2 to  
conditionally award the team to Los Angeles. The condition was that 
a stadium and financing plan agreeable to the NFL was presented by 
Sept. 15. That deadline passed quietly, however, and the league 
began talking again with Houston as well as continuing discussions 
with interested Los Angeles groups.

<HEADLINE> Patrick Ewing Still Hurting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- There were 16 New York Knicks, Latrell  
Sprewell not among them, in attendance Monday to hear coach Jeff 
Van Gundy explain the significance of the number 15. 
</P>
<P>
	With Sprewell still in California for closing arguments in a  
civil trial stemming from his 1998 reckless driving conviction, Van 
Gundy assembled the Knicks in a hotel ballroom, gave them T-shirts 
with the number 15 and told them that 15 postseason victories 
equals a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you have to do is sit through one of Jeff's speeches to  
know that there's work to do,'' forward Larry Johnson said. ``We 
didn't win it all, but we got there (to the NBA Finals). It was 
super hard to get there, and now it's going to be super hard to win 
it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things will be especially tough for New York at the start of the  
season, with centers Patrick Ewing and Chris Dudley injured and the 
team playing 13 of its first 18 games on the road -- not to mention 
Sprewell getting a late start. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, unsure when Sprewell will join them at training  
camp, are treating his tardiness as an excused absence. He is being 
sued by the driver and passenger of a car that overturned when 
Sprewell cut in front of them on an exit ramp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big deal that he missed the discussion,'' teammate  
Allan Houston said. ``Jeff made some great points in the meeting, 
but I'm sure Jeff will talk to him. He (Sprewell) has to take care 
of his business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing reported that the pain from his Achilles' tendinitis has  
lessened, although it's still so sore that he hasn't done any 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley said his goal was to be back from a strained knee  
ligament by opening night, with the worst-case scenario having him 
sitting out the first month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus Camby and Kurt Thomas are the likely candidates to open  
the season as the starting center, with newly signed Andrew Lang 
backing up until Dudley and Ewing are ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't promised me anything,'' said Camby, who worked out  
all summer in close view of Van Gundy at the Knicks' practice 
facility in Purchase, N.Y. ``Starting or coming off the bench, it 
really doesn't matter at this point. If I come off the bench, fine, 
like I did in the playoffs last year and got 30 minutes a night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the rest of the starting lineup, Van Gundy refused to  
disclose his plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject is a matter of much debate in New York, with the  
Knicks coming off a tumultuous and surprisingly successful season 
in which Sprewell was unhappy being kept in a sixth man role until 
the Eastern Conference finals against Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said over the summer that he was ``leaning'' toward  
making Sprewell a starter, but he wouldn't promise Sprewell the job 
publicly Monday. Nor did the coach address the Thomas-Camby 
question, the point guard roles of Chris Childs and Charlie Ward 
(who wore a ``Jesus is a Knicks fan'' T-shirt to media day) or the 
amount of playing time free agent pickup John Wallace will get 
behind Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to pin me down on anybody,'' Van Gundy said.  
``In my mind, I know who I'm going to start with and who I'm going 
to finish with, basically. But training camp is the x-factor. I 
don't know who's improved, who's in great shape. So I don't want to 
limit somebody. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I know is that championship level teams and  
championship level players never resent when another good player is 
added to the mix. They don't worry about shots, roles, minutes -- 
and that's what I expect of our guys.''

<HEADLINE> Profits Rise for Manchester United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, England (AP) -- Manchester United, considered the  
world's richest soccer club, has seen its operating profits 
increase by 20 percent to $53.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the club reported Monday a 22 percent decrease in  
full-year net income after spending on high-salaried players was 
taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the year ended July dropped to $27.8 million from  
$32.5 million. The club reported sales were up 26 percent to $183.8 
million from increased gate receipts and sponsorship revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Manchester United, the first English club to win Europe's triple  
crown -- European Champions Cup, league title and domestic F.A. Cup 
-- has spent heavily on player salaries in recent years to remain 
competitive in the 20-team English Premier League. 
</P>
<P>
	United said player salary costs increased by $12.8 million  
during the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial report came a day after the club sustained a  
humiliating 5-0 loss at league-rival Chelsea, Manchester United's 
first league defeat in 30 matches.

<HEADLINE> Dole Criticizes Clinton Nuke Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful  
Elizabeth Dole had harsh words Monday for President Clinton's push 
for a nuclear test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the New Hampshire Federation of Republican Women,  
Dole called Clinton's take on foreign policy and the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty ``wishful thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clinton-Gore foreign policy is no guarantor of our  
nation's security,'' she said. ``The Clinton-Gore rose-colored 
glasses have not adapted to the harsh realities of the world 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the fall of the Soviet Union, then-President Bush signed a  
limited testing moratorium to take effect Oct. 1, 1992, for nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton continued the moratorium -- the country's last test was  
in September 1992 -- then signed the comprehensive global treaty in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty went to the Senate for ratification in 1997 but  
languished there until last week when Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., unexpectedly scheduled a full Senate vote for next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said the treaty is ``ineffective and unverifiable.''  
</P>
<P>
	``In a time when America is naked to ballistic missile attack,  
there is no evidence that the (ban) would reduce proliferation,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among her concerns, Dole said barely half of nuclear-capable  
countries have signed the agreement and that the Central 
Intelligence Agency has difficulty monitoring low-level tests. She 
also said computer model testing, an alternative to actual nuclear 
tests, is inadequate to maintain the safety and security of the 
nation's aging nuclear stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Common sense says the (treaty) must be rejected and I say we  
must scrap this ill-conceived plan,'' Dole said.

<HEADLINE> Reagan License Plates OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Saluting Ronald Reagan as a gifted leader,  
the governor signed a law Monday that will create license plates 
bearing a picture of the former president and California governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Former first lady Nancy Reagan looked on during the ceremony at  
the Ronald Reagan State Building. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took this country to new frontiers of human freedom,'' Gov.  
Gray Davis said, standing in front of a poster-size personalized 
license plate reading ``GIPPER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the early '80s, when the country was wracked with  
self-doubt after Vietnam and Watergate, he taught us to believe in 
ourselves again,'' said Davis, a Democrat. ``And more than anything 
else he restored confidence in America and reasserted patriotism as 
a true American value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation License Plate  
will benefit educational and historical programs at the Ronald 
Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The plates, which will now be designed, will cost an extra $50  
initially and then $40 annually after that.

<HEADLINE> Roof Leak Affects Cleveland Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A leaky roof on a control tower led to flight  
delays and cancellations Monday at Cleveland Hopkins International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Water from overnight rain dripped on the computer displays that  
air traffic controllers use to guide planes when they are between 
five and 40 miles from Hopkins, said Federal Aviation 
Administration spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials shut down the operation because of the possibility  
of electrical shock. 
</P>
<P>
	A regional air traffic control center in Oberlin took over the  
work of guiding planes to within five miles of the airport. As 
usual, another control tower at Hopkins guided planes the rest of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the FAA nor airport officials could say when the  
Terminal Radar Approach Control would be functioning again. 
</P>
<P>
	The airport had 308,550 arrivals and departures last year and is  
a hub for Continental Airlines. Continental spokeswoman Catherine 
Stengel said the airline has 279 daily departures from Hopkins. 
Flights were delayed an average of 2 1/2 hours Monday, and about 10 
round trips were canceled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Small leaks at the tower had been reported since the FAA  
replaced rooftop air conditioning units in August.

<HEADLINE> `Vagina Monologues' Funny, Candid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Say a word three times and it's yours. If that's  
the case, playwright and performer Eve Ensler probably has a patent 
on ``vagina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The v-word happens to be the subject of her astonishing theater  
piece, ``The Vagina Monologues,'' which opened Sunday at 
off-Broadway's Westside Theater. Over the years, it's not exactly 
been a topic of conversation for what used to be called polite 
society. Yet this linguistic pioneer, who looks like a cross 
between Louise Brooks and Anna Wintour, has set out to change all 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	Ensler breaks taboos by talking, talking and talking some more --  
stripping fear and shame from what she celebrates here. It makes 
for quite a party. Funny, outrageous, emotionally affecting and 
occasionally angry. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress sits primly on a high red chair, her only prop a  
swing microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening consists of monologues Ensler constructed from  
interviews with women about ``down there,'' two words the 
playwright herself would never use today, although more than a few 
of the women she interviewed would. 
</P>
<P>
	Ensler begins by saying she is worried, worried about what  
people think of vaginas -- and worried even more about what they 
don't think about them. ``There's so much darkness and secrecy 
surrounding them -- like the Bermuda Triangle,'' she confides to the 
audience. ``Nobody ever reports back from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ensler does -- and she doesn't shrink from the serious, either. A  
bittersweet quality permeates a set of interviews she did with a 
group of women between the ages of 65 and 75, who arrived too early 
for the sexual revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	She also deals with mass rape in Bosnia, a tragedy of such  
immense proportions that it overwhelms its victims and the society 
in which they live. She then recounts the horrors of genital 
mutilation, which has affected, according to Ensler, upwards of 100 
million women. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there also is a celebration of birth, in which Ensler  
witnesses the arrival of her granddaughter, a joyous affirmation of 
life that she describes in jubilant detail. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the evening's most provocative and hilarious sections,  
Ensler uses a four-letter synonym for vagina, one of those words 
that would be used but never heard on the new television show 
``Action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Fox sitcom about the machinations of a young Hollywood  
producer, four-letter words are bleeped for comic effect. The 
repetition quickly becomes gimmicky -- and unfunny. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Vagina Monologues'' confront words to demystify and disarm  
them. In doing so, Ensler disarms the audience, too.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Wants Cheaper Prescriptions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve  
Forbes on Monday said Americans shouldn't have to cross the border 
to buy prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also promised to modernize the military and said there  
needed to be fewer restrictions on spending by political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said such change won't come if another Washington insider  
is elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``To move forward, it is going to take an independent outsider  
and individual not beholden to the establishment, special 
interests, lobbyists,'' Forbes said during a campaign appearance. 
``They have no hooks in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said he was discouraged to hear that some New Hampshire  
residents go to Canada to buy prescription drugs at cheaper prices. 
If elected, he promised a drug support system that would eliminate 
them to travel to Quebec for medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would work to modernize the military, adding  
that people in the service must be paid adequately to support 
themselves, their families and their country. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the military, as it now is funded, is not ready to  
handle conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a millionaire publisher who is financing his campaign,  
addressed the issue of campaign finance reform, saying fewer 
restrictions were needed on spending and that candidates ought to 
be able to do more with the money they have. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, speaking at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods,  
Forbes said the International Monetary Fund was obsolete and called 
for its abolishment.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Look at Lowe's Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- A small fire damaged a Lowe's home  
improvement store and state and federal investigators are trying to 
determine if it is related to recent bombings at three other Lowe's 
stores in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire Sunday evening at the Lexington Lowe's Home Improvement  
Warehouse damaged a door and was quickly extinguished, authorities 
said. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Two bombs exploded Sept. 22 at Lowe's stores in Asheboro and  
Salisbury, injuring three people. A third bomb was found last week 
at a Lowe's store in Concord and investigators believe the same 
person or group is responsible for all three bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said today they had not yet determined if the fire was  
connected to the bombs, but they had contacted the State Bureau of 
Investigation and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have confirmed they are looking for links between  
the Asheboro blast and an accident at Lowe's Motor Speedway in 
Concord on May 1 that killed three spectators and injured eight. 
</P>
<P>
	The News &AMP; Record of Greensboro reported last week that someone  
had called North Wilkesboro-based Lowe's to complain not enough was 
done for victims of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's is the corporate sponsor of the track, which is owned by  
Concord-based Speedway Motorsports Inc. The speedway reported a 
bomb threat last week on the same day of the discovery of the store 
bomb.

<HEADLINE> Magistrate Convicted of Fraud </HEADLINE>

	BERKELEY SPRINGS, W.Va. (AP) -- A magistrate has been convicted  
of fraud for fabricating a story that she was attacked in her 
northeastern West Virginia office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnie Riffle was found guilty Friday in Morgan County Circuit  
Court on two felony counts of Workers' Compensation fraud and five 
misdemeanor counts of filing false reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just utterly shocked,'' said her lawyer, Paul Lane, adding  
that Riffle will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The convictions could lead to four years in prison and fines of  
up to $10,000, Lane said today. The judge asked that a sentencing 
investigation be completed by Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Riffle, 43, testified Friday that a man wrapped a belt or rope  
around her neck while she worked late in her office on Feb. 16. She 
said she was cut on her face after she told the assailant she did 
not have money. 
</P>
<P>
	But state Medical Examiner James Kaplan testified that Riffle's  
facial wound was self-inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Riffle was suspended without pay by the state Supreme Court when  
she was indicted in April. 
</P>
<P>
	She remains free on bond pending sentencing.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Finds Test Ban a Hard Sell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four decades after President Dwight Eisenhower  
proposed a global prohibition on nuclear testing, U.S. 
policy-makers still are debating whether Americans would be safer 
with or without such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
	A week from today, the Senate votes on the Comprehensive Test  
Ban Treaty, a troubled Clinton administration initiative signed by 
154 nations -- but ratified by only two of the seven acknowledged 
nuclear powers, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Armed Services Committee opens three days of hearings  
today on the treaty. The first session, a closed one, will explore 
a central question: Can the United States maintain the integrity of 
its nuclear arsenal without occasional testing? 
</P>
<P>
	``If there were some feeling of weakness about that stockpile,  
it could induce a leader of another nation or some rogue element or 
some terrorist to challenge the United States,'' said Armed 
Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va. ``There can be no 
doubt about the credibility of that stockpile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Clinton acknowledges he doesn't have the votes right now to  
win ratification, but told reporters on Monday, ``I hope we can get 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By most counts, the administration is 15 votes or more short of  
the 67 needed to ratify a treaty. Democrats blame Senate Republican 
leaders for rushing to a vote after sitting on the treaty for two 
years, not giving them enough time to marshal public support. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you ask people what's the most important thing they worry  
about, the test ban treaty is not on the top of the list,'' said 
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. However, a July poll he 
conducted for the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, a pro-test 
ban advocacy group, suggested 82 percent of the American public 
supported such a treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate critics say the treaty, which would ban all nuclear  
testing and set up a seismic monitoring network to gauge 
compliance, is seriously flawed -- and unverifiable because there 
are ways to muffle atomic blasts. They contend it would not prevent 
U.S. enemies or terrorist elements from developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreign governments will decide whether to develop nuclear  
weapons based on a calculus of national interests, not on whether 
the CTBT has been ratified by the U.S. Senate,'' said Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, only the United States has used nuclear weapons -- the  
two atomic bombs against Japan that ended World War II in August 
1945. But putting the nuclear genie back into the bottle has proven 
virtually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Treaty supporters say it is crucial to keep nuclear weapons from  
proliferating further. They say it would keep large countries with 
advanced nuclear weapons already in their arsenals, including 
Russia and China, from manufacturing even more threatening weapons, 
and make it easier to rein in smaller nuclear powers, like India 
and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also lock in U.S. superiority achieved through more  
than 1,000 nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since we don't need nuclear tests, it is strongly in our  
interest to achieve agreement that can help prevent other countries 
like India, Pakistan, Russia, China, Iran and others from testing 
and deploying nuclear weapons,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	As to whether U.S. stockpiles could be kept current, Clinton  
said, ``We are spending $4.5 billion a year to make sure ... we can 
maintain the integrity of our stockpile.'' The United States has 
not conducted a nuclear test since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a staunch test-ban foe who refused to  
hold hearings on the treaty for two years, announced he would hold 
one Thursday -- with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as the 
leadoff witness to ``make her case for the treaty.''

<HEADLINE> Case Against Sportswriter Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Washington State University campus police,  
who arrested a Seattle Post-Intelligencer sportswriter in a dispute 
that followed last weekend's Cougars football game, have dropped 
their accusations, a school athletics spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelo Bruscas was arrested for investigation of fourth-degree  
assault and obstruction of an officer after Washington State's 
victory over California on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also will not pursue a case against Jeff Evans, a WSU  
sports information student employee who was cited for fourth-degree 
assault in the same dispute, athletics spokesman Rod Commons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Commons on Monday issued a letter of apology to Pacific  
Northwest sports journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will do everything in our power to make sure the mistake is  
not repeated,'' Commons wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Bunting, the P-I's managing editor, said in a statement the  
newspaper was ``gratified'' that Bruscas was exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have accepted the university's apologies for this  
unfortunate incident, and we intend to move on,'' Bunting said. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred as reporters were trying to make their way  
to an interview room in WSU's Bohler Addition to speak with Cougars 
players. A WSU event security guard barred the media from entering 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, who had a key, unlocked the door the security officer was  
guarding so he could enter. 
</P>
<P>
	As the door cracked open, reporters also went through past the  
guard, who reported he was pushed by Evans. Police also alleged 
Bruscas pushed the guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Once inside, a campus police officer confronted the reporters,  
asking them to stop. Bruscas didn't stop right away, deciding to 
use a restroom first. 
</P>
<P>
	The female officer handcuffed Bruscas as he came out of the  
restroom and then took him to the campus police station, where he 
was cited and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was notified that he had been cited in a telephone call to  
his home that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``After looking into what happened, it is clear to us that  
Angelo did not strike, push or shove anyone,'' Bunting said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Davis Out for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos were bracing for the worst.  
That's exactly what they got. 
</P>
<P>
	The winless Broncos, already reeling from an 0-4 start, learned  
Monday that MVP running back Terrell Davis will miss the rest of 
the season after tearing two ligaments and cartilage in his right 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, my spirits are high,'' Davis said in an interview  
on ABC's ``Monday Night Football.'' ``I know I'll be back 100 
percent and I'll be as good as new. The type of person I am, my 
mentality, I'm a workhorse and I just want to get back and play 
with my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis tore the anterior cruciate ligament, the medial collateral  
ligament and cartilage while making a tackle after an interception 
in the first quarter of Denver's 21-13 loss to the New York Jets on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos trainer Steve Antonopulos suspected the ligaments were  
torn and an MRI on Monday confirmed the injury. Davis is scheduled 
for surgery within 10 days and will be out 4-to-6 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing the young man like we all know him, I don't think  
there's any question, with his work ethic and his mindset that 
he'll be back performing at the same level, if not better,'' 
Antonopulos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' injury is the same one suffered by Atlanta running back  
Jamal Anderson in the first week of the season, leaving the NFL's 
two top rushers from a year ago out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he's working through it right now,'' Broncos coach  
Mike Shanahan said. ``I said, `Hey, I love you. You've done 
everything we've asked you to do. Just hang in there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	After becoming the fourth player in NFL history to run for 2,000  
yards in a season last year, Davis was faced with the challenge of 
succeeding without quarterback John Elway, who retired in May. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 211 yards on 67 carries in Denver's four games. He  
averaged 3.1 yards per rush, 1.7 yards below his career average. 
</P>
<P>
	In Davis' absence, the Broncos will turn to Derek Loville, whose  
last stint as a starter was with San Francisco in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want it this way,'' Loville said. ``I'd rather be 0-6  
and have Terrell in there. That's my man. ... I spoke to him 
earlier today when he was getting a little treatment. He said, 
`Hey, you've got to be a soldier.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers may be operating under a different platoon leader  
this Sunday against the Oakland Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching quarterback Brian Griese struggle through the  
first four games, Shanahan said he is contemplating a change. He 
said he will decide by Wednesday whether to stick with Griese or 
replace him with either Bubby Brister or Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to do something since we're 0-4. Exactly  
what we're going to do, I can't tell you because I don't know right 
now,'' Shanahan said. ``We'll definitely look at a few different 
things to shake the team up and see if we can get back on the right 
track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, who went 4-0 as an emergency starter last year, was  
Elway's anointed successor in training camp but lost his job to 
Griese in the preseason. He said he felt blindsided by the move at 
the time and had no comment Monday on a possible promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller spent the last three seasons out of football after a  
series of concussions. He said he supports Griese but would welcome 
a chance to help the Broncos as they try to salvage their season in 
the wake of consecutive Super Bowl championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the main thing is we all just want to get a win,''  
Miller said. ``That's the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping I could come in and kind of just jump on the  
bandwagon and enjoy the ride and be in the hunt for a playoff run 
and maybe a three-peat. It's just kind of come down to the fact 
that we've had some key injuries and haven't built any early 
leads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unstable quarterback situation and Davis' injury are the  
latest obstacles that have impeded the Broncos since they won their 
second straight Super Bowl in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's expected retirement announcement came in late April, and  
linebacker John Mobley was charged with drunken driving two months 
later. Mobley's season ended in Week 1 when he tore the ACL in his 
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's off-field problems continued in September when  
linebacker Bill Romanowski was named as a subject in an 
investigation into illegal drug prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, the Broncos are off to the worst start for a  
defending Super Bowl champion in a non-strike year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it rains it pours,'' Loville said. ``It's been tough.  
It's been tough this whole year -- losing John (Mobley), now losing 
Terrell. It's rough''

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Payroll Jumping $8M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates' payroll will increase  
from $24 million to $32 million next season, yet will again be 
among the lowest in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The payroll is expected to jump to $40 million in 2001, the  
Pirates' first season in their new ballpark, but will be less than 
half that of the Yankees and Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it's going up,'' managing general partner Kevin  
McClatchy said. ``For others, that's a pretty small payroll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden said last weekend the Reds  
would have to increase their payroll $20 million in 2000 to retain 
their current club. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite not having a single $3 million player this season, the  
Pirates finished third in the NL Central, ahead of the Cardinals 
and Cubs, teams which much bigger payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the third season of a five-year plan designed to field  
a contending team once the Pirates open PNC Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can judge a five-year plan in its third  
year,'' McClatchy said. ``But, from my standpoint, it's on track.''

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Freezer Bodies Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A man who confessed to killing his wife and  
infant son and hiding their bodies in a freezer was charged with 
two counts of murder Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Scott Newman said he hasn't decided whether to seek  
the death penalty against John K. Adams, 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams has given interviews in which he admitted to shooting his  
wife, Robin Schafer-Adams, 24, and torturing and killing the 
couple's son, John Ramseys Adams. He wanted to leave his wife after 
meeting another woman, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said he tried several ways to kill his 6-month-old son  
before putting him in a plastic bag and placing him in a freezer 
with the corpse of his mother. An autopsy showed the boy died from 
asphyxiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the frozen bodies wrapped in blue plastic tarps  
bound with duct tape Sept. 22 when a sheriff's detective tried to 
serve Adams with an arrest warrant. Adams was wanted in connection 
with two restaurant holdups. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams eluded police for a week until he was captured Friday near  
Kansas City, Mo.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grains Move Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices fell in early  
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, after a busy harvest 
weekend in some areas and continued reports of large supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans futures prices were lower as harvesting continued over  
the weekend in some soybean growing areas. Corn futures fell to an 
11-week low, amid reports of a big crop and declining feed use. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices tumbled Friday after an independent analyst  
reported the U.S. corn crop was higher than government estimates. 
The U.S. Agriculture Department will release a new production 
forecast this Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices also declined early today on reports of  
large supplies and lack of export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Some farmers and analysts are expecting a delay in harvests in  
parts of the Midwest that saw heavy weekend rains, including parts 
of southern Michigan and northern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, wheat for December delivery fell 3 3/4  
cents to $2.63 1/2 a bushel; December corn fell 1 cent to $2.04 cents 
a bushel; December oats fell 1 1/4 cent to $1.11 a bushel; and 
November soybeans fell 1 1/4 cent to $4.79 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, meat and livestock futures prices were mixed in early  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose 0.20 cent to 68.97 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle was unchanged at 81.85 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs fell 0.37 cent to 50 cents a pound; and February frozen 
pork bellies fell 1.05 cents to 64.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> CDC Announces HIV-Prison Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
today announced grants totaling $7 million to help develop HIV 
prevention programs in prisons in seven states. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released by the CDC in August found there are 8,900  
inmates nationwide with AIDS and 35,000 to 47,000 with the virus 
that causes it. The CDC said the figures represent a rate of 
infection and disease five times higher than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prisons and jails provide a critical opportunity to provide  
lifesaving HIV prevention services to a population that might 
otherwise be missed,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the CDC's 
National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention. ``Many of these 
individuals pass through these facilities only briefly before 
returning to the community. If we fail them, we fail our 
communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said inmates are not generally infected while  
incarcerated, but that only 10 percent of state and federal prison 
systems and only 5 percent of city and county jails have HIV 
prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
	States receiving grants of between $900,000 and $1.1 million are  
California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey 
and New York. The grant given Illinois will be shared with Chicago; 
New York's funding is to be shared with New York City; and 
California's grant is to be shared with Los Angeles and San 
Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Graffiti Analyzed in Boy's Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- Graffiti on a bathroom wall at a rest  
stop in the Oregon desert may hold a clue to what happened to an 
8-year-old boy who vanished last December while looking for a 
Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
	It could also just be a cruel joke.  
</P>
<P>
	Though the rest stop is 150 miles east of where Derrick  
Engebretson disappeared, detectives searching for any clue in the 
case removed part of the wall last week and sent it to the state 
crime lab to check for fingerprints or anything else that might 
shed light on the graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
	Klamath County Sheriff's Detective John Dougherty refused to say  
what was written on the wall. He did say it was 
``Derrick-specific,'' though it did not name the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick's mother also would not quote the graffiti, but she said  
Monday it suggested her son may have been abducted. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first you think, `Oh my God, he might be alive and somebody  
is actually going to give him back,''' Lori Engebretson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is I hope if Derrick did die, I hope he died on  
that mountain and not at the hands of some sick person. If he died 
on the mountain, he just closed his eyes and went to sleep. There 
would have been no pain or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, she and her husband, millworker Robert Engebretson,  
drove the 250 miles from their home in the small farming community 
of Bonanza, near the California line, to the rest stop to have a 
look for themselves. But they left unconvinced that the message was 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's just a big, sick joke,'' Mrs. Engebretson said.  
``I thought, if somebody would have had Derrick, if they put this 
on the wall, they were wanting to be caught. If they were wanting 
to be caught, why didn't they leave something of Derrick's there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not a trace of Derrick -- not one of his gloves bearing the logo  
of the Goosebumps books he loved to read, the jacket he hated to 
wear, or even the hatchet he carried -- has turned up since he 
disappeared Dec. 5 on the east side of the Cascade Range. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy had been out with his father and grandfather. The  
grandfather sent him up the hill to give his father the hatchet to 
cut down a tree. After the boy disappeared, a snowstorm blew in. 
Helicopters with heat sensors, tracking dogs and hundreds of 
volunteers all combed the woods for more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Derrick's family has spent nearly every weekend on  
the mountain looking for him. They have found someone's glasses, 
shoestrings, and the tag out of a T-shirt. But no sign of Derrick. 
</P>
<P>
	The remote-controlled Big Foot truck and laser-sighted BB gun  
Mrs. Engebretson bought her son for Christmas are still wrapped and 
underneath the artificial tree in the family room. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's clothing I can't imagine would fit him now, even if he  
does come home,'' she said. ``The presents, the paper is starting 
to come off because it's so old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Derrick's ninth birthday, July 5, they took a bunch of  
balloons up to the mountain and left them on a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't given up on him being alive,'' his mother said. ``I  
pray every single night for him to be alive in somebody's safe 
hands.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-NFLer Van Horne Loses Court Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Chicago Bears football player Keith Van  
Horne failed today in a Supreme Court bid to revive the 
negligent-hiring allegations of his lawsuit against the radio 
station that employed a disc jockey he says defamed him. 
</P>
<P>
	The court turned away without comment Van Horne's argument that  
WRCX should be financially liable for having hired and retained 
``shock jock'' Matthew ``Mancow'' Muller, known for outrageous 
on-air conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The part of Van Horne's lawsuit that accuses Muller and sidekick  
Irma Blanco of defamation is still pending in a state court. So is 
the part that accuses the station of negligent supervision and 
retention of Muller. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Illinois Supreme Court killed that part of the lawsuit  
seeking millions of dollars from WRCX for allegedly negligent 
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit stems from a 1994 broadcast in which Muller and  
Blanco repeatedly accused Van Horne, then a personality on radio 
station WLUP, of attacking Muller and threatening his life. Van 
Horne's lawsuit said the accusations were false. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's highest court let Van Horne's claims against Muller  
and Blanco proceed to trial but ruled that letting him sue the 
station would place a ``chilling effect'' on free speech because 
media employers would be reluctant to hire controversial people. 
</P>
<P>
	WRCX is owned by Evergreen Media Corp., which in 1997 merged  
with Chancellor Media Corp. Muller left that station in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Van Horne vs. Evergreen Media Corp., 98-1745.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen; Down Vs. Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the Japanese yen on  
Monday after a new survey raised concerns over whether Japan will 
be able to sustain its current economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.23  
Japanese yen, up from 104.96 late Friday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.0735, up from $1.0728. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy has been struggling to emerge from its deepest  
downturn in a half century. But there have been signs of recovery: 
There has been two straight quarters of growth in Japan's economy 
and a drop in the jobless rate from a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan, in its closely watched quarterly ``tankan''  
survey, said sentiment among large manufacturers had brightened 
over the last survey to a figure of minus 22 from minus 37, its 
biggest improvement since November 1987. The result exceeded 
analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The tankan measures the percentage of firms seeing business  
conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen. 
The bank surveyed 9,275 companies in September for the latest 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tankan also showed that business investment -- what  
companies spend on equipment and plants -- continued to taper off. 
The large corporation capital spending index for this fiscal year 
is seen falling to minus 9.4 from minus 5.8 in the last quarter. 
It's the lowest figure since September 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	That spooked investors, who saw the decline in capital spending  
as a sign that Japan's economic growth may be slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	While the dollar rose today, investors watched their moves ahead  
of meetings this week by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European 
Central Bank, where they will both decide whether to raise interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher U.S. rates could benefit the dollar by making  
dollar-backed assets more attractive to investors. The same would 
be true in Europe if the ECB boosted rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4829 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4820, and 1.4697 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4769. The British 
pound rose to $1.6559 from $1.6548. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8219 German 
marks, down from 1.8229; 6.1105 French francs, down from 6.1139; 
and 1,803.70 Italian lire, down from 1,804.71.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Says Book Won't Hurt Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite harsh criticism of his new book's  
conclusions about World War II, Republican presidentical candidate 
Pat Buchanan said Monday he did not think the controversy would 
hurt him politically. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten more press attention than I've gotten since (1996)  
when I won (the) New Hampshire'' primary, Buchanan said on CNN's 
``Larry King Live.'' ``The book's headed for the best-seller list, 
and I'm leading the polls for the Reform Party nomination even 
though I haven't joined it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he would probably make a final decision by the end  
of the month on whether to leave the GOP and join the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	His book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' has drawn criticism for  
his argument that Germany was not a threat to the United States 
after 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought the book would hurt him politically,  
Buchanan said, ``I do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The book is its best defense. When it hits the best-seller  
list, people are going to read it. They're going to realize all 
this talk that it's some kind of sequel to (Adolf Hitler's) 'Mein 
Kampf' is a lot of nonsense from hysteriacs,'' he said.

<P>
	HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- Even with Jayson Williams sidelined  
until at least January and Kerry Kittles coming off knee surgery, 
coach Don Casey thinks the New Jersey Nets have the pieces to make 
the playoffs this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim McIlvaine put it best the other day,'' Casey said Monday

their main guys.''

<P>
	While the Knicks went to the NBA Finals in June in the  
lockout-marred season, the Nets had everything go wrong. After 
opening the season with a 3-17 record, John Calipari was fired. 
Casey took over on an interim basis and finished 13-17, a 
performance that earned him the full-time job despite missing the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets still face problems heading into this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams, an All-Star center two years ago, is still battling to  
get back into shape after breaking his leg in April and undergoing 
recent knee surgery. January is the earliest anyone hopes to see 
him on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Kittles, their talented shooting guard who averaged almost 13  
points, also had offseason surgery and is not 100 percent with the 
Nets ready to open training camp on Tuesday at the Atlantic City 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to dig in, the coaches and players as well,'' Casey  
said. ``It looks good. We finished OK, but it's a longer season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The good news for the Nets is that they have two of the most  
talented young players in the game in point guard Stephon Marbury 
and forward Keith Van Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, acquired in March just before Calipari was fired,  
averaged 21.3 points and 8.9 assists last season. Van Horn averaged 
21.8 points and 8.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to win. That's it,'' Marbury said after taking his  
physical at Hackensack Medical Center. ``We're going to win. We're 
young, dynamic, and determined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The words are part of a Nets' advertisement, so many laughed  
when Marbury said them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can go out and play like them words, I think we can  
definitely do something this year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The big question is in the middle, where Jamie Feick, McIlvaine  
and Gheorghe Muresan will try to combine to give the team minutes 
at center. 
</P>
<P>
	With Marbury and Kendall Gill at the guards, Scott Burrell and  
Johnny Newman at the small forward and Van Horn playing the No. 4 
spot, the Nets should be OK. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are definitely one of the top five teams in the  
East,'' Burrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's on paper though.  
</P>
<P>
	``This team has no identity,'' Casey said. ``It's not  
established yet. When I went to Boston, they always felt they were 
going to win 50-plus games a year because they have been doing it 
for 10 years. This team has not done that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to keep everyone happy and try to establish the  
type of play, a style strong and resolute,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Joyride Comes to an End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Not enough cash, and not enough hits.  
</P>
<P>
	After challenging the big spenders for six months, the  
low-budget Cincinnati Reds fell short. 
</P>
<P>
	The Little Red Machine, trying to show the small markets can  
still compete, was derailed on two hits by Al Leiter, who led the 
New York Mets to the 5-0 win Monday night in a one-game playoff for 
the NL wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has to hang their heads,'' said Greg Vaughn, who was  
0-for-3 with two strikeouts but finished with 45 home runs. ``It 
was a fun year. This is a good group. We came together and proved a 
lot of people wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Mets began the season with baseball's eighth-highest  
payroll at $63.5 million, the Reds payroll was 22nd among the 30 
major-league teams at $33.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sure hope they keep the same unit. We believed in each  
other,'' said Dmitri Young, whose game-ending liner to second 
baseman Edgardo Alfonzo was one of the Reds hardest-hit balls. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the high rollers made the postseason an exclusive  
club. For the second straight season, the eight playoff teams are 
among the top 12 spenders, with opening-day payrolls of $52 million 
and up. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati had just two hits: Jeffrey Hammonds' second-inning  
single and Pokey Reese's leadoff double in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody expected us to be here,'' Reds manager Jack McKeon  
said. ``We started slow, but then we got the pitching straightened 
out and we played impressive ball. We played interesting ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't enough. The big spenders had more.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, who joined the Yankees to give New York two  
post-season teams for the first time since 1956, took a 2-0 lead on 
the game's sixth pitch, when Alfonzo hit a two-run homer off Steve 
Parris (11-4). 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo had been 0-for-9 against Parris before hitting his 27th  
homer of the season, a drive that took much of the life out of a 
capacity crowd of 54,621. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's bats were as quiet as the fans. Leiter retired 13  
straight before walking Eddie Taubensee leading off the eighth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds began the night with the sixth-highest average in the  
National League at .273 but went just 2-for-28. It took an extra 
game, but what they had wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Parris was chased after allowing three runs, three hits and  
three walks in 2 1-3 3 innings. He was relieved by Denny Neagle in 
the third inning. Neagle, in only his second relief appearance 
since 1993, walked Robin Ventura with the bases loaded to make it 
3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle and Danny Graves didn't pitch badly, each allowing a run  
and two hits, and Dennys Reyes finished with a scoreless ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not disappointing. I don't think anybody expected us to  
be here,'' Sean Casey said. ``It came down to a one-game playoff, 
and we hope to be back next year.''

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Asks Greeks To Be United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- International Olympic Committee president  
Juan Antonio Samaranch on Monday called on Greeks to unite in their 
support for the 2004 Olympics and dispelled rumors of delays by 
Athens organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I am asking something, it is unity,'' Samaranch said after  
three days of IOC meetings in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	During the meetings, Athens organizers presented an update of  
their progress since being awarded the games two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Athens organizers told the IOC they decided to make image  
building a top priority following media reports of disorganization, 
delays and problems with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Following the official report presented by the organizing  
committee, there are no delays,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said that although problems were normal until the end  
of the games, he trusted Athens organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to assure you things are going quite well,''  
Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he was impressed by the new Athens 2004 logo, a  
white wreath-shaped olive branch floating in a sky and sea blue 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``The games are very important, not only for us ... It is a  
golden opportunity for Greece,'' Samaranch said. ``The games in 
Athens, they have three dimensions... sport and culture, but you 
have something that belongs only to your country, that that is a 
history, the Olympic history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in Athens, Samaranch met with Premier Costas Simitis,  
Culture Minister Elisavet Papazoi and signed a final agreement to 
establish an Olympic Truce Center with Foreign Minister George 
Papandreou. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic Truce is aimed at reviving a tradition whereby  
warring parties suspended their conflicts during the ancient 
Olympic Games in Greece.

<HEADLINE> 'Mansion Madam' Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) -- A woman who ran a brothel in her upscale  
suburban mansion admitted Monday to charging men $200 an hour for 
sex while her fiance stood guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Judith Kelly Dempsey, dubbed the Mansion Madam, pleaded guilty  
to prostitution and violating a probation sentence she received in 
May for running the ``Afternoon Delight'' prostitution service out 
of her Victorian mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Dempsey prostituted herself at a Howard Johnson  
motel in August while her fiance, Edwin Accini, served as a lookout 
outside the motel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was in her best interest to enter the plea today,'' her  
lawyer, Michael Ascher said. ``It's that simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey said she had turned to prostitution so Accini could pay  
legal fees to cover a custody battle with his ex-wife over their 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey agreed Monday to give up her Lincoln Town Car, the lease  
to her Jaguar and the $4,847 in cash seized while she was arrested. 
She faces up to three years in prison at her sentencing on Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	She was sentenced in May to three years probation after  
admitting running ``Afternoon Delight.'' Prosecutors say the posh 
bordello catered to well-paid businessmen, many who worked at 
nearby office parks.

<HEADLINE> Young's Playing Status Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young, sidelined by his fourth  
concussion in three years, underwent a series of tests Monday and 
will visit with his neurologist Tuesday to try to decide whether he 
can resume playing this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Stanford neurosurgeon Dr. Gary Steinberg clears Young to  
return, San Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci left open the 
possibility of holding the quarterback out for another week as a 
precaution and again starting Jeff Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia made his first NFL start Sunday in place of the injured  
Young and led the 49ers to a 24-22 victory over the previously 
unbeaten Tennessee Titans. He said he's approaching this Sunday's 
game as if he's going to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way I approach every week, as far as being mentally  
prepared,'' Garcia said. ``Obviously, listening to the radio or 
reading the newspaper, I would have to think that right now, we 
would be leaning toward me starting. But nothing has been 
determined yet, so I'll just allow them to make that decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who watched Sunday's game in street clothes from the  
sideline, said he would like to start playing again but is leaving 
it in the hands of his doctor and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``My intent is to try to get healthy for this week,'' said  
Young, who sustained his latest concussion during last Monday 
night's 24-10 win at Arizona. ``It's just going to have to unfold. 
We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said a decision on the starting quarterback for  
Sunday's game at St. Louis would be made by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be based on what's learned from the tests and his  
visit with the doctor,'' Mariucci said. ``All I can tell you right 
now is it's up in the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci conceded there is some concern about allowing Young to  
return for a game being played on the TWA Dome's artificial 
surface, which is harder and less giving than grass. There is also 
Young's history of concussions to consider and the fear he could be 
one more serious hit from being forced into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Young already has told his coach he wants to resume playing but  
Mariucci said his decision will be guided by health factors above 
all else. The fact that Garcia also played a sterling game in 
relief of Young has no bearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a piece of work. He wants to play. I'm not telling you  
anything you don't know, but we're going to make a wise decision 
and do what's best,'' Mariucci said of Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Steve is not ready to go, I don't care if we don't have a  
quarterback on the team he's not going to go. It's nice that Jeff 
played a good game but he's not going to play if he's not ready to 
go.''

<HEADLINE> Tycoon Brothers Battling in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- It is a tale of two brothers from a  
billionaire family fighting over wealth and power from the family's 
oil business. Entwined through the years have been enough takeover 
attempts, conspiracies and betrayals to fill a soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, brothers Bill and Charles Koch face each another in  
federal court once again. 
</P>
<P>
	On behalf of the United States, Bill Koch is suing Koch  
Industries -- built by his father into the country's leading crude 
oil purchaser and now run by his older brother Charles Koch -- over 
allegations that it stole millions of dollars in oil from Indian 
lands and federal leases. Jury selection began today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Osage Nation, from which Koch gets most of the oil it  
obtains from Indian lands, isn't joining the civil lawsuit. Chief 
Charles Tillman said the tribe couldn't prove any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We even permitted Bill Koch to access and review and  
investigate the records,'' he said. ``There is no proof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side will say how much potential liability is involved  
for Koch Industries, the nation's second-largest privately held 
company with $30 billion in sales. But Bill Koch could receive up 
to one-third of the court award if he wins. 
</P>
<P>
	The staggering wealth involved has some Oklahoma producers  
questioning whether the Tulsa lawsuit has legitimate claims or if 
the courtroom is just a personal battleground for Bill Koch (age 
58, net worth $650 million) and Charles Koch (age 63, net worth 
$3.4 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Last year in Topeka, Kan., Bill Koch fought his brother in  
federal court claiming he was cheated out of more than $1 billion 
when he sold his stake in Koch Industries back in 1983. He lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge who heard the case later said, if given a second  
chance, he would not have let the case go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the lawsuit alleges Koch Industries routinely  
instructed employees to underreport the amount of oil they collect 
from producers' tanks. It accuses Koch of collecting enough oil to 
fill 5.3 million barrels -- more than $133 million worth -- without 
paying for it from 1981-1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is expected to last months.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of history behind this case and the parties  
involved,'' said Koch Industries spokesman Jay Rosser. ``We're 
confident our integrity will be affirmed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea Oklahoma producers were not aware that they were being  
ripped off makes the merits of the case shaky, said Dewey Bartlett 
Jr., president of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American Petroleum Institute's manual on  
standards for measuring crude oil, it is impossible to measure oil 
without error because of the variables involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Koch Industries relies heavily on company  
records that show millions of dollars in ``overages,'' or the 
amount of oil the company took in above what it paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch Industries officials concede the company made about $10  
million per year from overages, but they say that was a small 
amount for a company purchasing and transporting more than 20 
million gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawsuit maintains that Koch employees were trained to  
alter information on how much oil was collected, and some former 
employees, including former division manager Phillip Dubose, are 
expected to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is how you got promoted with Koch,'' Dubose told The  
Associated Press. ``They wouldn't use the word steal, but they 
would insinuate to change the numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others involved in oil production say they have no evidence of  
wrongdoing on the part of Koch Industries. Many expect nothing more 
from the trial than another family fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is probably more interest by people in non-oil states  
than those in oil states who think something sinister is going 
on,'' said Bland Williamson, general counsel for the Oklahoma 
Independent Petroleum Association. ``Those in oil states understand 
the practice and the circumstances.''

<HEADLINE> 'Double Jeopardy' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy'' held onto the top spot at  
North American theaters over the weekend, taking in $17.2 million 
and fending off three new movies, according to industry estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The revenge drama starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones has  
earned $47.4 million in two weeks and had only a 26 percent drop in 
ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three Kings'' was No. 2, earning $16.3 million for the  
weekend. The Gulf War action thriller stars George Clooney, Ice 
Cube and Mark Wahlberg as American soldiers seeking a cache of 
Iraqi gold who get entangled with local rebels. Industry experts 
said it had the best chance of unseating ``Double Jeopardy,'' 
</P>
<P>
	``American Beauty'' the dark and funny depiction of suburban  
angst from Dreamworks, climbed to third place, earning $8.1 million 
despite showing in only 706 theaters. It averaged $11,473 per 
screen, by far the best among the top 10 films. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, explores  
issues ranging from infidelity to homophobia to mid-life crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Audiences seem to want hard-to-peg films with complicated  
themes, said film analyst Robert Bucksbaum of Reel Source Inc. 
``American Beauty'' fits that bill. Dreamworks' Jim Tharp said the 
studio is considering upping the number of theaters showing it to 
1,200 or 1,300 this week, based on the strong showing. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new films did middling business during the weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Joan Hart's film debut, ``Drive Me Crazy,'' opened at  
No. 6, just below powerhouse supernatural thriller ``The Sixth 
Sense,'' in its ninth week. ``The Sixth Sense'' earned an estimated 
$7.2 million, and ``Crazy'' $7.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muppet movie ``Elmo In Grouchland'' came in at No. 8 with  
$3.3 million, about what studio executives expected for a movie 
aimed at the under-10 set. And ``Mystery, Alaska,'' about a hopeful 
hockey team from the boondocks, started at No. 9 with $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucksbaum called the showing by ``The Sixth Sense'' phenomenal  
and said the top five films will probably stay around into the 
Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $17.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Three Kings,'' $16.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``American Beauty,'' $8.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Blue Streak,'' $8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $7.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Drive Me Crazy,'' $7.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``For Love of the Game,'' $3.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Elmo In Grouchland,'' $3.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Mystery, Alaska,'' $3.1 million.

	Bidding War Erupts for Sprint Corp.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A bidding war has erupted for the Sprint Corp.,  
with two companies reportedly offering as much as $100 billion for 
the nation's third-largest long-distance telephone company. 
Sprint's board members met yesterday to compare offers from MCI 
WorldCom Inc., the No. 2 long-distance company, and a higher, 
last-minute bid from BellSouth Corp., the Atlanta-based Baby Bell, 
according to two people familiar with the negotiations. Sprint's 
board was scheduled to meet today to vote on MCI WorldCom's offer 
of about $63 a share. BellSouth is trying to trump that deal with a 
$72-a-share bid, according to the sources, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity.

	Online Travel Firms To Merge  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Travelocity.com, a Texas online airline  
reservation service, and America Online's primary travel partner 
have agreed to form a new company in a multimillion-dollar merger, 
officials of both companies say today. Fort Worth, Texas-based 
Travelocity, a 3-year-old online airline reservation service, takes 
in $9 million a week in revenue and has provided hundreds of jobs 
in the San Antonio area and Dallas-Fort Worth. It will combine with 
Preview Travel Inc., to form a new company headquartered in Fort 
Worth. Company officials said the merger would create a new 
powerhouse in the online travel market, which is the largest retail 
e-commerce category. It is projected to grow from $7.8 billion in 
1999 to $32.1 billion by 2004.

	Amazon To Sell Through Wireless Devices  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Amazon.com is making it easier for  
customers to shop anywhere and anytime the mood strikes them. A 
week after moving to offer online shoppers just about anything they 
could want to buy -- from yard sale trinkets to buffalo steaks -- 
Amazon planned to announce today it will become one of the first 
e-commerce companies to sell its products through new wireless 
devices. The move is timed to coincide with this week's nationwide 
release of 3Com Corp.'s new Palm VII, a hand-held computer that 
will provide wireless Internet access to allow users to read 
e-mail, shop and browse popular Web sites. 

</P>
<P>
	3Com Slashes Palm VII Price by $100  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Competition is driving down the price of  
electronic organizers. Pressured by rival sellers of less expensive 
hand-held computers, 3Com Corp., is slashing prices by as much as 
$100 on its Palm electronic organizers. Effective today, the Palm 
VII, a wireless organizer that lets users exchange messages and 
retrieve information off the Internet, costs $499, down from $599. 
3Com also reduced the monthly fees it charges users to hook into 
the wireless network serving the device being released nationwide 
this week.

	Pac Bell Blamed for Crashes  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Pacific Bell is to blame for computer crashes  
that have hit state agencies since the company was hired by 
California for $1 billion to transport data across high-speed 
telephone lines, the Los Angeles Times reported today. The problem 
``has been a lot worse than anything we expect from Y2K,'' said 
Elias Cortez, the state's chief information officer. The 
malfunctions began shortly after Jan. 1, when the company began 
providing telecommunications for the state's data network, the 
report said. The company has a seven-year contract to do the job.

	Clear Channel To Buy AMFM for $17B  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Clear Channel Communications Inc. is buying AMFM  
Inc. for $17.4 billion in stock, creating a company that will 
dominate the nation's airwaves with 830 radio stations. AMFM, 
formerly called Chancellor Media and the largest radio station 
group in the U.S., has been searching for a buyer since the 
beginning of the year. Clear Channel, the third-largest radio 
company in the country, has always been seen as the most likely 
bidder, but early negotiations faltered. The combined company, 
which will keep the Clear Channel name, will also own 425,000 
outdoor billboards and 19 television stations.

	Japan Sees Mixed Economic Signals  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In a mixed signal about Japan's prospects for  
economic recovery, the central bank reported today a steep rise in 
business confidence but a drop in business investment plans. In its 
closely-watched quarterly ``tankan'' survey, the Bank of Japan said 
sentiment among large manufacturers had brightened over the last 
survey to a figure of minus 22 from minus 37, it's biggest 
improvement since November 1987. The result exceeded analysts' 
expectations. But the tankan also showed that business investment 
continues to taper off in Japan. The worse-than-expected capital 
spending figures for this fiscal year could yet spoil Japan's 
nascent economic recovery, traders in financial markets said.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks resumed their slide Friday after new  
reports showed that the economy's surging growth has not slowed in 
recent months. The data renewed concerns that the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 
63.95 to close at 10,273.00, after falling nearly 153 points 
earlier in the session. The blue-chip index ended a fairly volatile 
week just 6.33 points below last Friday's close. Broader stock 
indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 edged up 
0.10 to 1,282.81, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 9.31 to 
2,736.85.

<HEADLINE> Timor Mission Appears on Fast Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Devastation and empty streets greeted  
international peacekeepers when they arrived in East Timor. Now, 
two weeks later, people are returning to their burned-out homes and 
aid is starting to reach the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been a mission without bloodshed, a multinational  
deployment that has occurred at remarkable speed compared with 
similar operations elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``This marriage of humanitarian and security forces moving  
hand-in-glove and reaching out to the people is quite 
exceptional,'' said Michel Barton, a spokesman for the U.N. 
humanitarian aid coordination office. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could be a significant turning point in terms of future  
operations of this type.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers have established their presence in about  
two-thirds of East Timor, and commanders say they will have the 
whole region covered in the ``very near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, they are moving into the battered and depopulated  
area bordering Indonesian-controlled West Timor, where the 
rampaging militia gangs that laid waste to much of East Timor are 
still believed to be active. 
</P>
<P>
	The force -- which has not yet reached its mandated size of 7,500  
troops -- has accomplished all this despite being only a fraction of 
the 40,000-member NATO force that went into the much smaller area 
of Kosovo earlier this year. It is also far smaller than the 60,000 
peacekeepers deployed to Bosnia in 1995 or the 23,000 sent to 
Somalia in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
	Close to a half-million East Timorese remain dispersed in the  
hills of their half-island homeland. Some 250,000 fled to West 
Timor after militias and their Indonesian backers launched a 
rampage of violence in the aftermath of an Aug. 30 referendum that 
resulted in the overwhelming endorsement of independence from 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked sometimes to have been even better than we  
have been, but it's just hard sometimes when you're so thin on the 
ground,'' said Brig. Gen. Mark Evans, commander of the Australian 
troops in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans credited the force's success to the extensive training of  
its Australian soldiers in conducting rapid operations over large 
stretches of northern Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Australia's peacetime army is so small, the emphasis is  
on versatility. Its 22,000 troops are trained to do multiple jobs 
that would be carried out by several soldiers in larger armies. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these 14 days, we've seen an immense turnaround in the  
situation in Dili, and now we're seeing it in the rest of East 
Timor as well,'' Evans said. ``You'll see much more of that in 
coming weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humanitarian groups have quickly followed the peacekeepers,  
distributing food, plastic sheeting and roofing timber to the tens 
of thousands of homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort was initially focused on the capital Dili -- where the  
first mass food distribution is planned for Tuesday -- but has 
quickly spread to outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the eastern part of the island is concerned, there's  
every reason to be confident that the full humanitarian effort will 
cover the entire region within a few days,'' Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The main worry in East Timor is the fate of those still hiding  
in the central mountain range. U.N. and other aid officials fear 
food is running low there and the approaching rainy season will 
result in illness and malnutrition on a massive scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are the recurrent threats from militia commanders to  
fight their way back into East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans predicted that the militiamen, who fled to West Timor  
ahead of sweeps by his men, probably will try to make a stand in 
coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The militias have never been up against a force like this, but  
I think that at some point they will try something against us,'' he 
said. ``We're well prepared for this, and whoever tries it will 
feel the consequences and they won't be very pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only shoot to kill; that's part of our doctrine.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise on Fed Expectations / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bonds staged a mild comeback Monday on  
expectations that Federal Reserve policy-makers won't raise 
interest rates Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 19/32, or  
$5.94 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 6.08 percent from 6.13 percent late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds fell more than a point Friday on stronger-than-expected  
economic news, which renewed fears that interest rates would be 
raised for a third time this year. The Fed increased rates in June 
and August in an effort to stem inflation caused by the strong 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But many investors stayed out of Monday's bond markets,  
uncertain whether interest rates would go up again, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
rose 1/16 point to 1/8 point, while intermediate maturities rose 5/32 
point to 1/4 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, yields on three-month Treasury fell to 4.84  
percent, as the discount fell 0.02 point from Friday to 4.71 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 5.07 percent as the discount rose 
0.07 percentage point to 4.87 percent. One-year yields fell to 5.23 
percent as the discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.25 percent from 5.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/32 to 111 7/8. The average yield to 
maturity of the index was unchanged at 5.91 percent.

<HEADLINE> Stars Suffer Injuries Against Ducks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The next time the Dallas Stars meet the Anaheim  
Mighty Ducks, there will be no love lost. Especially on the part of 
the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending Stanley Cup champions are in an uproar over  
incidents Saturday night that resulted in injuries to two of their 
key players: Mike Modano and Darryl Sydor. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he was disgusted by ``cheap  
shots'' by the Mighty Ducks that left Modano, the team's leading 
scorer last season, and Sydor sidelined for at least three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano suffered a mild concussion, broken nose and strained neck  
ligaments when hit from behind into the boards by Anaheim 
defenseman Ruslan Salei. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor, a defenseman, suffered a fractured left eye socket in the  
third period after having his head hit into the ice by Anaheim's 
Jim McKenzie. Sydor had come to the aid of No. 2 center Joe 
Nieuwendyk, who was checked hard into the end boards by Mighty 
Ducks defenseman Pascal Trepanier. Nieuwendyk wasn't seriously 
injured and returned to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't get over the fact there's so much disrespect there,''  
Hitchcock said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to wake up before somebody gets killed. It's really  
stupid hockey by stupid hockey players. I think those two players 
(Salei and Trepanier) are either the stupidest people in this 
league or they just brought themselves a war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams meet again Friday in Anaheim.  
</P>
<P>
	The defending Stanley Cup champion Stars went on to beat Anaheim  
2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Lewis, NHL director of officiating, said the NHL will  
review all three game misconduct penalties by the Mighty Ducks -- to 
Salei, McKenzie and Trepanier. The league must make a decision on 
any suspension before the Ducks play the Phoenix Coyotes on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mighty Ducks practiced at the Stars' practice facility on  
Sunday, and Anaheim general manager Pierre Gauthier said his team 
was not looking for a war with the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not a team like that. We don't go into other peoples'  
buildings and try to goon it up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano was taken off the ice on a stretcher Saturday and  
transported to Baylor Medical Center in Dallas, where X-rays, CAT 
scans and an MRI on his neck were all negative. He was held 
overnight for observation and released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said both Modano and Sydor will be re-evaluated after  
one week, meaning neither would go on a three-game road trip that 
will take the Stars to Detroit, Anaheim and San Jose this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``With ligaments in your neck, you never know,'' Hitchcock said  
of Modano's injury. ``Sometimes, it's 7 to 10 days and you're ready 
to go. Sometimes, it's two to three weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said Sydor would have to be able to work out without  
creating swelling around his eye before he could even think about 
returning to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to have to be cleared for contact, and he's going  
to have to wear a (protective) visor for a while,'' Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars players said seeing the normally peaceful Brett Hull  
respond to Modano's injury by getting into a fight with Salei was 
inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brett Hull played the best game since he's been a Dallas  
Star,'' Grant Marshall said. ``He brought intensity. He showed 
character in sticking up for Mike. We don't need him to do that all 
the time, but just to set the precedent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull, Modano's linemate, called Salei's hit ridiculous.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's disgustingly cheap to have a guy in such a vulnerable  
position and to just take advantage of firing him headfirst into 
the boards,'' Hull said, calling it ``worse than cowardly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for the powers-that-be in the NHL to put their foot  
down. It's time for them to sit up and make a lesson of this guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salei said he had no intention of hurting Modano, who led the  
Stars in regular-season scoring with 81 points and playoff scoring 
with 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he's going to be fine,'' said Salei, who received a  
five-game suspension last season for causing a serious injury to 
Phoenix's Daniel Briere by tripping him with his skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I barely touched him. He was going fast and I tried to catch  
him. Maybe I touched him, but I don't think I hit him from behind 
or really pushed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Plante or Pavel Patera is expected to take Modano's place  
on the first line with Hull and Jere Lehtinen. Richard Matvichuk, 
who joined the team Saturday after ending a contract dispute 
Friday, is the likely replacement for Sydor.

<HEADLINE> French Bosses Oppose 35-Hour Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Thousands of bosses gathered today in Paris to  
protest the French government's proposals for a shortened 35-hour 
workweek. They held their rally a day before lawmakers open debate 
on how to implement the controversial measure. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25,000 employers crowded into a noisy exposition hall,  
waving signs saying ``For The Freedom Of Business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across town, the Communist-backed union, the General Workers  
Confederation, known as the CGT, also drew some 25,000 people to 
its rally to press lawmakers not to leave companies too much leeway 
in interpreting the plan. The union held rallies in other cities as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	The French Parliament adopted the Socialist-sponsored law  
shortening the workweek from 39 to 35 hours in June 1998, although 
lawmakers left out many details about how the plan would be 
implemented. Salaries would remain the same for the shorter week, 
but questions remained about whether pay cuts could be made 
elsewhere, like in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's leftist government hopes that by  
cutting the workweek, companies will have to hire more employees to 
keep the same level of productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Many business leaders say the law is unrealistic and undermines  
their authority, while workers' unions fear it may not go far 
enough to ease unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the National Assembly is to begin discussing details  
of the plan, including how it will be put into the work code and 
how it will affect managers and part-time help, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of bosses at the Paris rally, sponsored by MEDEF,  
France's association of bosses, hooted and stomped their feet when 
speakers laid out their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, who heads MEDEF, said the law to  
implement the plan, if passed, would be a ``historic error,'' 
harmful to dialogue between employees and employers, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	Serge de Poix, of Laval in western France, came to the rally by  
bus with 30 others from his region. 
</P>
<P>
	``These laws are making me expand my factories in Asia, not in  
France,'' said de Poix, 42, who owns compact-disc factories in 
Europe, the United States and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies with more than 20 employees must implement the law  
before Jan. 1, though smaller companies have until Jan. 1, 2002. 
The government has offered tax breaks to encourage businesses to 
take up the plan ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Labor Minister Martine Aubry, sponsor of the  
shortened workweek, said the initiative has already surpassed the 
government's projections by saving or creating a total of 105,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The law is one of the most dramatic labor changes in France  
since 1936, when the leftist Popular Front introduced paid 
vacations and a 40-hour workweek.

<HEADLINE> Allen Co. Invests $1.65B in RCN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen is adding  
to his growing stable of cable TV and Web businesses with a $1.65 
billion investment in fiber-optic network operator RCN Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement with Allen's Vulcan Ventures investment  
company, RCN will form a joint venture with three companies 
controlled by Allen: the budding cable empire Charter 
Communications; the Go2Net network of Web sites; and High Speed 
Access Corp., a provider of high-speed Internet access over cable 
TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The new venture, Broadband Partners, will initially focus on  
providing high-capacity Internet service to RCN and Charter 
customers, and to other cable systems later on. RCN has also formed 
a partnership with Charter to provide telephone services in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday increases the stake in RCN held by  
Vulcan investment company from 4.5 percent to 27.4 percent. Vulcan 
would control no more than 15 percent of RCN's voting shares, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	RCN, based in Princeton, N.J., will use the money to finance the  
expansion of its fiber-optic network, which currently stretches 
from Boston to Washington and from San Diego to San Francisco, 
providing Internet, telephone and TV services. 
</P>
<P>
	The RCN investment comes as Charter prepares to sell $3.5  
billion worth of stock in an initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen bought St. Louis-based Charter just last summer. At the  
time, Charter had 1.2 million subscribers in 19 states. Since then, 
Charter has bought or announced plans to buy 11 other cable 
companies for more than $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deals are finalized, Charter will have 6.2 million  
subscribers in 36 states, making it the fourth-largest cable 
company in the country behind AT&AMP;T, Time Warner and Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Vulcan's investment in RCN will take the form of preferred stock  
convertible to 26.6 million shares of RCN common stock. The 
preferred shares must be converted to common stock within seven 
years at $62 per share.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Jury Examines Sprewell Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- New York Knicks guard Latrell Sprewell  
has no remorse for injuring a man and a woman in a car crash last 
year, and should pay them $450,000 in actual damages plus two 
months of his salary in punitive damages, their lawyer said Monday 
in closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Sprewell said the plaintiffs' attorneys were  
trying to make minor injuries seem major and were concealing the 
total amount they want: $3.5 million. The attorney advocated 
requiring Sprewell, who admitted responsibility for the crash, to 
give the victims $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A Contra Costa County jury began deliberating Monday and was  
scheduled to continue Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell is being sued by Arnulfo Perlas, 55, and Irma  
Feliciano, 54, both of Antioch. They were treated for minor 
injuries but testified the accident caused nightmares, depression 
and problems with relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell admitted in court that he caused the accident when he  
tried to drive his Mercedes-Benz back on the freeway from an 
exit-only lane near Walnut Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell pleaded no contest to reckless driving and was  
sentenced to 90 days in jail, which he served under electronic 
detention at his Milwaukee home.

<HEADLINE> Online Travel Firms To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Two of the biggest names in the online  
travel-reservation industry are getting together in a deal that 
will create one of the nation's largest Internet commerce sites 
with nearly $1 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabre Holdings Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas, announced Monday that  
its Travelocity division is acquiring Preview Travel, an exclusive 
partner of America Online, and creating a new publicly traded 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The new venture, Travelocity.com, will give the company a step  
up against rival Expedia, Microsoft Corp.'s online-reservation 
company 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the clear leader here,'' boasted Terrell B. Jones,  
president of the new company. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabre chairman Donald J. Carty said the new company will be the  
third-biggest Internet commerce site and rank among the nation's 
top 10 travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabre Holdings will contribute the assets of its online  
reservations division plus $50 million up front, and possibly 
another $50 million later, for a 70 percent stake in the new 
company, which will be based in Fort Worth. Shareholders of San 
Francisco-based Preview Travel will own the remaining 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock of both companies soared after news of the deal.  
Preview Travel's 14 million shares rose 38 percent, or $6.68 3/4, to 
close at $24.31 1/4 on the Nasdaq market. Sabre's shares rose 14 
percent, or $6.12 1/2, to $49.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will have 17 million online members. In the  
first half of this year, Travelocity reported selling $301 million 
in travel bookings -- more than its total for all of 1998 -- and 
Preview recorded $167 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was a bit surprising to analysts who believed it more  
likely that Sabre would take its online division public. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, David Boczar, an analyst with Value Investing Partners of  
Westport, Conn., said the deal instantly helps Travelocity.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will allow them to grow their business and become even  
more dominant in the domestic market,'' he said. ``Clearly there's 
a lot of interest in e-commerce, especially in the travel 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials touted Monday's deal as a marriage between  
Preview Travel's marketing panache and Travelocity's technical 
expertise -- its parent, Sabre, is the world's leading 
airline-reservation systems company and is 82 percent-owned by AMR 
Corp., which also owns America Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	From its founding, an important part of Preview's business  
stemmed from its exclusive arrangement with AOL, making the 
reservation service available to AOL's 18 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement with AOL will be extended for five years, and  
the companies will share travel commissions and advertising 
revenue, said Jones, who moves from president of the old 
Travelocity to president and chief executive of the new venture. 
AOL said the agreement is worth $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the new company has also extended a partnership  
with Yahoo! Inc., but they declined to give the agreement's length 
or other details. Travelocity.com also has partnerships with other 
Internet portals, including Lycos, Go Network and ExciteAtHome. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel Weekly, a publication for travel agents, in June ranked  
Travelocity the 19th largest U.S. travel agency in gross receipts 
and ranked Preview Travel 31st. Microsoft's Expedia was ranked 
25th. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors of both Sabre and Preview Travel have approved the  
deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and ratification by 
Preview's stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said the acquisition will result in  
duplication but they said they expected to hire workers instead of 
going through layoffs.

<HEADLINE> Monday's Supreme Court Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court took the following actions Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Let Arizona give tax breaks to people who donate money for  
scholarships at religious schools. Challengers called the program a 
violation of the constitutionally required separation of church and 
state. The court's denial of their appeal was saluted as a victory 
by backers of tuition vouchers and other aid for families whose 
children attend private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowed public schools in Knox County, Tenn., to require  
everyone offered a teaching job to take and pass a drug test. The 
school district said the tests were needed to ensure student 
safety. Teachers called the tests unreasonable searches under the 
Constitution's Fourth Amendment if officials do not suspect that 
the tested individual uses drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Turned down an appeal by a former radio reporter convicted and  
sentenced to death for the 1981 killing of a Philadelphia 
policeman. Mumia Abu-Jamal argued he was denied a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to clarify when a product's design is distinctive enough  
to qualify for legal protection. The court said it will hear 
Wal-Mart Stores' appeal in a dispute with a manufacturer of 
children's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	--Left standing a ruling that participation by Michael Montalvo,  
a Colonial Heights, Va., 12-year-old with AIDS, in a 
rough-and-tumble karate school would pose too much of a threat to 
the health and safety of other students.

<HEADLINE> Coelho Lawyer Admits Loan is Unpaid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's campaign chairman,  
Tony Coelho, has not fully repaid a $300,000 personal loan that was 
cited in a stinging government report alleging U.S. mismanagement 
at a world's fair in Portugal, Coelho's lawyer acknowledged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department investigators have said taxpayers may be liable  
for any unpaid balance on the personal loan Coelho took out while 
he was commissioner general for the U.S. pavilion at ``Expo98'' in 
Lisbon. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Brand, Coelho's lawyer, said his client still owes about  
$100,000 but the debt is ``in the process of being paid off.'' 
Brand did not say when the loan would be fully repaid. He reversed 
his comments of Saturday, when he contended the entire loan had 
been paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a United States government transaction,'' Brand  
said. ``There's no liability on the part of any government agency 
to pay a personal loan. There never was an exposure to the United 
States. I don't know how there could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the State Department inspector general, in a report on the  
1998 fair, criticized Coelho's loan -- obtained from a Portuguese 
bank so the private Luso-American Wave Foundation could construct a 
memorial wall in the shape of a wave near the site of the pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sculpture is still there, as a memorial to Portuguese  
emigrants to the United States. Coelho announced the formation of 
the Luso-American Wave Foundation on April 22, 1998, a month before 
the fair opened. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's report, which surfaced over the weekend,  
said, ``Obligations of a private foundation were recorded on the 
U.S. pavilion's financial records, and most staff wore buttons 
promoting this foundation during working hours although this 
organization was not officially connected to the pavilion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the U. S. Information Agency, whose operations  
are now part of the State Department, ``may be responsible for the 
repayment'' if the foundation ``does not raise sufficient funds to 
pay it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The private Center for Public Integrity, which distributed the  
inspector general's report and expanded on its findings, said 
Monday it has learned that Coelho used government employees and 
resources to raise money to repay the personal loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The report criticized Coelho, a former House member from  
California, for intermingling his activities as the commissioner 
general for the fair with activities and obligations of the private 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The center reported that the Luso-American Wave Foundation was  
no more than a toll-free telephone number and a mailing address 
within the offices of a Washington lobbying firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation has not been granted tax-exempt status by the  
Internal Revenue Service, and its certificate and articles of 
incorporation were revoked on Sept. 7 by the District of Columbia 
government ``for having failed and-or refused to file'' any of the 
reports required by law, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho did not report the loan as a liability on a federal  
financial disclosure form he filed on June 11, 1998, the center 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who earlier this year chose Coelho to guide his campaign  
for the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination, defended Coelho in 
a television interview Sunday. ``Tony Coelho is doing a terrific 
job. He's my close friend, and he's going to continue doing a great 
job,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sanders' Presence Big for Dallas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Even though Arizona quarterback Jake  
Plummer made sure that Deion Sanders couldn't unveil his new 
touchdown dance in his much-anticipated return to the Dallas 
lineup, Plummer couldn't stop the All-Pro cornerback from bringing 
something else to the injury-plagued Cowboys defense -- attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals never threw a pass in Sanders' direction on  
Sunday, but the mere presence of Sanders in the Dallas secondary 
helped the Cowboys force five turnovers en route to a 35-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gives us a little more cockiness,'' said Dallas safety  
George Teague, who returned an interception 32 yards for the game's 
first touchdown. ``We're more sure of what we can do. It makes 
everybody's job easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders hadn't played in a regular-season game since last Nov.  
15, when he severely injured a toe against the Cardinals. He played 
in the Cowboys' loss to Arizona in the playoffs and also made an 
appearance in the Pro Bowl, but had been sidelined since undergoing 
surgery in April. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Sanders effectively took a whole side of the field  
away from the Cardinals. For most of the game, the receivers 
Sanders covered simply ran deep routes down the field to get him 
out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought they would have tried him just once,'' Dallas  
defensive coordinator Dave Campo said. ``But he's so dangerous. You 
never know when he's going to make a big play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said the toe was ``throbbing'' at halftime, but that it  
didn't bother him in the second half. He said he feels like he's in 
the best physical shape of his career, although he admitted some of 
his footwork is still off. 
</P>
<P>
	The only time Sanders had an opportunity to touch the ball was  
on punt returns, but the Cardinals had a superb effort on their 
coverage team and he only managed 32 yards on six returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel wonderful,'' Sanders said. ``I've never lacked  
confidence, even as a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas coach Chan Gailey gave Sanders credit for continuing the  
struggles of Plummer, who completed just 16 of 33 passes for 111 
yards and three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's some kind of impact,'' Gailey said. ``When you avoid  
one side completely, you throw into coverage sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals said they were hesitant to test Sanders, but coach  
Vince Tobin placed more emphasis on his team's failure to execute. 
Wide receiver Andy McCullough, part of a receiving corps that 
dropped several passes, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deion is a great player, but we don't care about that,''  
McCullough said. ``The receivers just have to make the big plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Arizona didn't test him, Sanders said he doesn't expect  
that trend to continue for long. He said Sunday's game proves the 
rest of the defense is capable of taking advantage of teams who 
refuse to throw to him. He thinks some teams will eventually be 
more willing to take their chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must challenge me in order to have success,'' Sanders  
said. ``But it's just like Christmas -- you can't wait for it to get 
here.''

<HEADLINE> Austria Far-Right Party Makes Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- A party whose leader once praised the  
Hitler era appears to have captured second place in Austrian 
national elections -- the best-ever showing for any far right party 
in Europe since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freedom Party's second-place showing -- which could change  
with 200,000 absentee ballots still to be counted -- leaves no party 
with an absolute majority, putting Joerg Haider's Freedom Party in 
a powerful position in the formulation of a government coalition. 
The election's final results will be announced next week. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Sunday's provisional results, Haider's party won 27  
percent, 5 percent more than in the last election and the party's 
best showing since its founding in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is terrible, it is frightening ... the world has not  
learned from its history,'' said Israeli Justice Minister Yossi 
Beilin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera's front page carried  
an editorial cartoon with a figure of Hitler raising his right hand 
and yelling ``Sieg Haider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the French Catholic daily La Croix, which described Haider  
as ``chancellor apprentice'' and a ``macho,'' explained Haider's 
success as an ``authoritarian populism `made in Austria.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Viktor Klima's Social Democratic Party remained in  
first place, with 34 percent of the vote. The conservative Austrian 
People's Party of Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel dropped to 
third place with 27 percent, only 14,000 votes behind the Freedom 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Democrats, the senior government coalition party for  
the past 13 years, have ruled out working with Haider's party 
because of its rightist policies. The Peoples' Party, the 
Socialists' coalition partner, have announced they would go into 
the opposition if they came in third. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless these positions change, Austria faces weeks of political  
uncertainty and the possibility of new elections if a viable 
government cannot be formed. 
</P>
<P>
	Haider, 51, said his party had ``risen with a sensational  
election result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer by training, the telegenic Haider has gained ground by  
addressing people's grievances in powerful and often strident 
speeches. He also appealed to fears among small business people and 
workers that European Union expansion into the former Soviet bloc 
could put jobs at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria is Europe's third most prosperous nation. The crime rate  
is low, and there has been no social or ethnic strife since the end 
of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Austrians feel a need for change. Much of Haider's  
popularity is based on the alienation many wage earners feel under 
the two ruling parties' high taxes and other policies. He has 
lambasted the stifling bureaucracy and ``fat paychecks'' of 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Haider's success likely will be frowned upon abroad. He is best  
known for having praised Adolf Hitler's employment policies and for 
having called veterans of the Nazi Waffen SS ``men of character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Freedom Party's campaign was dominated by calls to stop  
immigration -- posters in Vienna, the capital, warn against 
``over-foreignization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haider has also promised generous child care checks and other  
benefits that other parties say cannot be financed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a major change in the results from the absentee ballots,  
the Social Democrats will hold 65 seats in parliament, the Freedom 
Party 53 seats and the People's Party 52. The Greens, who won 7 
percent, will have 13 seats.

<HEADLINE> Congress Urged To Pass FAA Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Warning of gridlock at the nation's airports,  
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater urged Congress on Monday to 
pass a Federal Aviation Administration bill with major changes in 
how air traffic control systems are run. 
</P>
<P>
	Widespread flight delays around the country this summer made  
clear that ``if we don't act that's exactly what we are going to 
have -- gridlock,'' Slater said in an interview. ``We could see this 
system come to a chokepoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Monday took up a bill that would authorize some  
$45 billion in FAA programs over four years. The Senate bill, like 
a five-year, $59 billion bill passed by the House in June, 
concentrates on safety, modernization and competition issues over 
the next decade when passenger loads on American airlines are 
expected to increase 50 percent to 1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater said 95 percent of the administration's reform elements  
are addressed by either the House or Senate bills but ``we're not 
at a point now where we have a bill the president could sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said an amendment to the Senate bill that would create an air  
traffic control oversight committee and a chief operating officer, 
was a good start toward operating the system more like a business. 
The amendment is being offered by Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and 
John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Other ideas the administration wants to consider as the bill  
advances through Congress include replacing the current excise tax 
on passengers with cost-based prices on commercial users -- the 
airlines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar FAA bill passed the Senate by a 92-1 vote last year  
but the Senate and House were never able to settle differences in 
their two versions. The main point of contention was the increase 
in flights at some of the nation's busiest airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., has  
pushed hard for lifting the ceilings on flights out of Chicago's 
O'Hare, New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy and Washington's Reagan 
National airports. He has argued that this is one way to increase 
competition and improve service to smaller communities that have 
suffered under airline deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Gorton-Rockefeller amendment would eliminate slot rules  
at O'Hare in 2003 and at the New York airports in 2007, with new 
slots -- a takeoff or landing -- going to new entrants or services to 
smaller communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington would get 24 new slots, 12 for service outside a  
1,250-mile ``perimeter rule'' established in 1986 to protect Dulles 
and Baltimore-Washington, the region's two long-haul airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from the three areas strongly oppose the lifting or  
raising of flight ceilings, saying it would lead to more noise 
pollution and pose safety risks. Allowing more flights would 
wrongly imply ``that it is safe to have more flights into the most 
congested airport in the world,'' Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., 
said of flights at O'Hare. 
</P>
<P>
	A final compromise on the legislation has also been slowed by  
provisions in the House bill, championed by House Transportation 
Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., that would bar Congress from 
using funds from the Aviation Trust Fund for non-aviation purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund, which takes in about $10 billion a year in  
airport user taxes, is now used for general budget programs as well 
as airport projects.

<HEADLINE> Bills 23, Dolphins 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills' defense did all the stomping  
Monday night against the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo harried Dan Marino into three turnovers and scored on  
Gabe Northern's 59-yard fumble return to beat Miami 23-18. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory avenged the Bills' 24-17 loss at Miami in last  
season's playoffs. After that game, Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson 
celebrated in the locker room by stomping on a box of Flutie 
Flakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker John Holecek led the defensive charge by the Bills  
(3-1), while the loss by the Dolphins (2-1) left the NFL with three 
undefeated teams. The Bills had lost five consecutive games in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	After Buffalo took a 23-12 lead on Steve Christie's third field  
goal with 6:56 left, Miami's Brock Marion returned the ensuing 
kickoff 93 yards to the 4. O.J. McDuffie then caught a 9-yard 
touchdown pass from Marino, the first touchdown allowed by the 
Bills' defense in 13 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins got the ball back with 2:59 to go, but Marino threw  
four consecutive incompletions from the Miami 43. He finished 
22-for-44 for 251 yards with two interceptions and two sacks, his 
first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Flutie went 12-for-25 for 186 yards and added 29 yards  
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams traded field goals before the Bills' defense broke a  
6-6 tie late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Holecek came through free on a blitz and blindsided Marino to  
jar the ball loose. Northern scooped it up, escaped the grasp of 
Miami's Cecil Collins and then ran untouched 59 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Holecek returned an interception of Marino 35 yards to set up  
Christie's final field goal, a 31-yarder. He also hit from 26 and 
52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins closed to 13-12 early in the fourth quarter, but  
Buffalo responded with an 80-yard touchdown drove. Flutie hit Eric 
Moulds for 40 yards, then hit him again for the 6-yard score and a 
20-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins' first score came after Flutie fumbled a snap and  
Miami's Shawn Wooden recovered at the Buffalo 41. Four plays later, 
Olindo Mare kicked a 30-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins drove 74 yards in the final 1:41 of the first half  
but settled for a 26-yard field goal by Mare. They marched 65 yards 
in the third quarter, but after McDuffie dropped a potential 
touchdown pass, Mare kicked another 26-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	Mare also hit a 44-yarder.

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Design Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday to use a  
dispute involving Wal-Mart Stores to clarify when a product's 
design is distinctive enough to qualify for legal protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will hear Wal-Mart's argument that it did not  
improperly copy the design used by another company that 
manufactures children's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Wal-Mart hired a firm to make children's clothing to be  
sold under the Wal-Mart label and modeled after a design used by 
Samara Brothers, a children's clothing manufacturer. According to 
court papers, Wal-Mart paperwork used in planning for the order 
shows photos of garments bearing the Samara label. 
</P>
<P>
	Samara sued Wal-Mart, alleging infringement of Samara's  
copyright and of its products' distinctive design, or ``trade 
dress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury ruled for Samara and awarded $912,856 in damages for  
copyright infringement and $240,458 for trade dress infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the damages for  
copyright infringement and all but $68,633 of the award for trade 
dress violation. The court said there was enough evidence to show 
that ``Wal-Mart's marketing of the knockoffs was willful piracy 
with an intent to deceive consumers as to the source'' of the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal granted Supreme Court review Monday, Wal-Mart's  
lawyers said the appeals court's ruling would reduce competition in 
the $100 billion garment industry. Samara was granted trade dress 
protection for ``a collection of designs that lacked a common 
theme,'' the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samara's lawyers said the company's clothes were distinctive and  
that a Wal-Mart official said on the witness stand that ``he 
recognized garments with 'the Samara type of look' even without 
looking at the labels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Wal-Mart Stores vs. Samara Brothers, 99-150.

<HEADLINE> Back To School in Flood Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Nearly three weeks after Hurricane Floyd,  
thousands of students returned to class Monday in North Carolina's 
hardest-hit county. At one school, students came even though more 
than 100 evacuees were still living in their gym. 
</P>
<P>
	The gym at Tarboro High was one of the last shelters still open  
in Edgecombe County. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get away from it anywhere in Tarboro,'' said senior  
Jonathan Kirkland, whose home was spared. ``I have so much, and 
these people have nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was the first day Edgecombe County's 8,000 students had  
set foot in the classroom since Sept. 15, the day before Floyd came 
ashore and drenched eastern North Carolina more than 20 inches of 
rain, causing the worst flooding in state history. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd has been blamed for at least 48 deaths in North Carolina.  
The high water drove more than 10,000 people into shelters and 
destroyed 3,680 homes. Floyd is expected to surpass Hurricane Fran, 
which caused $6 billion in damage in 1996, as the state's costliest 
natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the county's 14 schools did not reopen at all; they were  
destroyed by floodwaters. Their 550 students will attend classes in 
trailers at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	While teachers and administrators tried to restore a sense of  
normalcy, the flooding was the dominant theme. In one class, 
students were asked to summarize their experience in one word. 
Among the responses: ``wet,'' ``lucky,'' ``sad,'' ``relieved'' -- 
and ``blessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Squires, a Tarboro High senior, was upset that he had to  
attend school. He said his family needs his help recovering from 
the flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost everything,'' he said. ``I don't see why we're here.''  
</P>
<P>
	Brad Cox was happy to see his friends from Princeville, the town  
of 1,900 across the Tar River from Tarboro that remains 
uninhabitable. The flood scattered people from Princeville into 
shelters and, later, into the homes of friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to know they can meet here at school,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Businesses are reopening one by one, and the Tar and Neuse  
rivers are expected to drop below flood stage this week for the 
first time since the storm. Many people who were in shelters have 
been able to go home or find other places to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	But the misery is far from over. The Salvation Army said its  
disaster recovery center in Greenville ran short on food and 
volunteers and could open only for a half-day Monday. The relief 
organization said it has dispensed $4.5 million in meals, goods and 
services in Floyd's aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said nearly 50,000  
North Carolinians have applied for disaster assistance. Some 
complained of delays, but spokeswoman Buffy Gilfoil said FEMA is 
doing the best it can, with 400 inspectors in the field and more 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tarboro High, the enormity of the disaster was hitting home.  
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought about it being this real,'' Kirkland said,  
``until these people I've known 15 years say they've lost 
everything.''

<HEADLINE> Heinz Consolidates Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh, meet Charlie the Tuna.  
</P>
<P>
	H.J. Heinz Co. said today it would combine all its U.S. food and  
food-service businesses under the same division, Heinz Sales Co., 
and base it in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The headquarters of the Star-Kist tuna and Heinz pet food brands  
will be moved to Pittsburgh from Newport, Ky. Heinz's pet foods 
include 9-Lives and Snausages. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Star-Kist's 425 salaried employees in Newport in  
northern Kentucky will be offered the chance to move to Pittsburgh, 
executives said. Heinz expects 200 people to make the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is combining operations in an effort to get foods to  
stores more quickly and boost sales. Heinz earlier moved its frozen 
foods and Weight Watchers divisions under the Pittsburgh management 
umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	David Moran, previously vice president for Heinz U.S. retail  
sales, will be president of the new division. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of a fragmented collection of business fiefdoms, Heinz  
will become a unified, highly focused North American `megacompany' 
capable of fully leveraging the marketing, manufacturing and 
procurement power of its combined North American brands and 
businesses,'' said William Johnson, Heinz's chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The move ``will make us more nimble and entrepreneurial,''  
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses will be organized by products -- such as condiments or  
frozen foods -- rather than brands, executives said. The businesses 
involved in the reorganization account for $5 billion of Heinz's $9 
billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz is renovating its Pittsburgh factory to make room for the  
new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Heinz were up 12 1/2 cents to $43.75 in late morning  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Opinion on Hispanic Challenge Asked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said today it wants to know  
what the Clinton administration thinks about a pair of challenges 
by Hispanic voters in Texas to their school districts' at-large 
system of electing school board members. 
</P>
<P>
	The court asked Justice Department lawyers to file briefs  
commenting on the appeals by voters in San Antonio and suburban 
Houston. The voters contend they need only show that an election 
district could be drawn with more than 50 percent Hispanic 
voting-age residents, whether or not they are U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's response could take months, and the justices  
are not expected to say in the interim whether they will grant full 
review to the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanic voters in the Pasadena Independent School District in  
suburban Houston sued in 1992, saying the district's at-large 
election system violates the federal Voting Rights Act by giving 
them an unequal chance to elect the candidates of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board has seven members, including one Hispanic.  
According to 1990 census figures, Hispanics make up about 30 
percent of the school district's population. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled against the voters in 1997, saying they  
did not show it was possible to draw a voting district with a 
majority population of Hispanics who were U.S. citizens. The court 
said about 60 percent of the Hispanic people living in the district 
were citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's ruling  
in January, saying it courts must consider the citizen voting-age 
population of a group challenging a voting system. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the Hispanic voters' lawyers said  
the 5th Circuit court's rule was too inflexible. Minority groups 
should be allowed to pursue voting rights cases if they can show 
they could elect their own representative under another plan, the 
appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other challenge was filed by Hispanic residents of the Alamo  
Heights Independent School District in San Antonio. The voters said 
there has not been a Hispanic member of the school board in the 
past 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge ruled against the voters, saying they  
could not show that an election district could be drawn with more 
than 50 percent Hispanic voting-age residents who are U.S. 
citizens. The 5th Circuit court upheld that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The school district's lawyers said people can bring  
voting-rights lawsuits only when they show they would make up the 
majority of an individual voting district. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are Perez vs. Pasadena Independent School District,  
98-1747, and Valdespino vs. Alamo Heights Independent School 
District, 98-1987.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gov. Kean Not Running for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean said Monday he  
will not run for the U.S. Senate nomination that was being 
considered earlier this year by fellow Republican Gov. Christie 
Whitman. 
</P>
<P>
	The popular two-term governor mulled a possible Senate run for  
the seat in 2000, after Whitman decided to drop out of the race in 
early September. 
</P>
<P>
	The seat is being vacated by Democrat Frank Lautenberg.  
</P>
<P>
	Kean, who has twice turned back offers for him to run, said at  
the time he was ``giving it a thought. ... It's the third time it's 
come my way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He issued a two-paragraph statement announcing his decision,  
thanking those who offered support and adding, ``It would have been 
an honor to once again aspire to serve the people of New Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kean served as governor from 1982 to 1990 and was barred by law  
from seeking a third consecutive term. His successor was Democrat 
Jim Florio, who was in turn knocked out of office by Whitman after 
one four-year term and might run for the Senate himself next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kean, 64, has been president of Drew University in Madison since  
leaving office. He would have given his party a big-name candidate 
in their attempt to grab a long-held Democratic seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Party leaders thought they had that candidate in Whitman, but  
she eventually dropped out, saying she could not be a good governor 
and a good Senate candidate at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Kean's departure will likely mean a tough primary on the  
Republican side. Rep. Robert Franks and Essex County James 
Treffinger have announced their intention to run, and former 
Libertarian gubernatorial candidate Murray Sabrin has also said 
he's in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, Florio has an exploratory committee for  
the Senate race. Former Goldman Sachs chairman Jon Corzine has 
announced his candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise; Dow Ends Up 128.23 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rebounded sharply Monday, led by  
financial and telecommunications issues, as investors bet that the 
Federal Reserve will leave interest rates alone on Tuesday. Prices 
also got a boost from the latest corporate merger announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 128.23 to 10,401.23 after  
posting losses in three of the past four sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indicators also closed higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 21.79 at 1,304.60, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 
59.12 to 2,795.97. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the pounding that the market took in early and late  
September, it got pretty oversold, so it was set up for a reflex 
bounce or a short-term rally,'' said Richard McCabe, chief market 
analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Going into the week, the Dow had 
fallen more than 9 percent since August. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCabe predicted the rally would be short-lived. ``We  
haven't gotten to the bottom yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the market has come to believe that the Federal  
Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged when its policy-writing 
Open Market Committee meets Tuesday. While widespread worries about 
higher rates sent stock prices plunging in recent weeks, most 
economists say there actually are few signs that the economy is 
growing too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	A spate of merger announcements also helped lift investors'  
spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications issues rose after BellSouth joined a bidding  
war with MCI WorldCom for Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. long-distance 
carrier. Sprint rose 3 9/32 to 60 9/32, and MCI added 1 1/8 to 71 5/8 
while BellSouth slid 2 11/16 to 42 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio stocks rose after Clear Channel Communications said it is  
buying AMFM Inc. for $16.7 billion in stock, creating a company 
that will dominate the airwaves with 830 radio stations across the 
nation. AMFM's stock rose 1 5/16 to 65 3/16 while Clear Channel 
fell 3 7/8 to 76 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Gemstar International Group Ltd. said it would buy TV Guide for  
about $9.2 billion in stock and debt to improve its electronic 
program guides. Gemstar fell 7 7/16 to 76 3/16, while TV Guide 
added 4 13/32 to 45 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Dow component AT&AMP;T, the No. 1 long-distance company,  
rose 2 to 43 3/4 as news spread that it may create separate 
``tracking'' stocks to reflect the value of different businesses 
such as the company's cable and wireless operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The takeovers always add some pizzazz,'' said Barry Hyman,  
market strategist for Ehrenhrantz King Nussbaum. ``It creates a new 
landscape and people think bigger is better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Express led the Dow, rising 6 3/16 to 137 9/16 on  
optimism that interest rates will remain stable. Higher rates could 
hurt borrowing, which would hurt the giant credit card company's 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks of several major retailers, including Wal-Mart, up 2 to  
50 5/16, gained amid hopes for strong sales reports due out later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But some stocks were held back by warnings of disappointing  
third-quarter earnings. Mattel, the world's largest toymaker, said 
its profits will miss forecasts by as much as 55 percent because of 
lower-than-expected sales at its Learning Co. software division. 
Mattel dropped 5 to 11 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO stocks dropped after a class-action lawsuit was filed  
against Humana, accusing the health plan of failing to tell 
customers that costs greatly influenced health coverage decisions. 
Humana fell 1/16 to 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,729 up, 1,263 down and 523 
unchanged on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume of all listed shares totaled 1.06 billion shares,  
compared with 1.01 billion in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.08 to 426.61.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.3 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was up 1.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
1.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Early Flu Shots Urged in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A virulent strain of flu has reached the  
continental United States from Alaskan cruise ships, threatening to 
start the flu season early. 
</P>
<P>
	Public health officials already are kicking off campaigns  
encouraging people to get shots to prevent the disease, the 
sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember when you get your shots, just think to yourself  
afterwards, it's just one shot for man, one giant leap for public 
health,'' Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner Howard Koh said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu viruses follow well-worn paths, starting in Asia and heading  
east. Alaska is usually the first place in the United States to 
feel their effects, and the viruses then make their way to the 
western United States and eventually the East Coast, said Dr. 
Steven Mostow, associate dean of the University of Colorado Medical 
School and an influenza expert. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of flu cases were confirmed in Alaska over the summer,  
and Mostow believes the flu is showing up in the continental United 
States a month earlier than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the several cases reported in the Lower 48 states, four in  
Colorado have been linked to outbreaks on Alaskan cruise ships. 
``The way the boats are set up -- eating in large groups, touring in 
large groups -- facilitated the threat of the virus,'' Mostow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostow believes the virus will reach the East Coast soon -- by  
Thanksgiving in Massachusetts, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control estimates 10 to 20 percent of  
the population gets the flu every season, with about 20,000 
Americans dying from its complications every year. The elderly, 
residents of nursing homes and people with chronic medical 
conditions are particularly at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Although new drugs have been shown to be effective against the  
flu, health officials say the flu vaccination remains the best 
defense. The vaccine prepared for the 1999-2000 season protects 
against A-Beijing, A-Sydney and B-Yamanashi strains. 
</P>
<P>
	And states are getting more creative in their outreach efforts.  
Colorado gives flu shots in grocery stores and at football games. 
In Fort Edward, N.Y., motorists can get a flu shot at a 
drive-through clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlantic City, N.J., elderly gamblers got their flu shots  
Monday in the ballroom at Bally's Park Place while slot machines 
jangled in the next room. 
</P>
<P>
	When nurses warned seniors the shot could cause soreness in  
their arms, many replied they would work it out by pulling the slot 
machine handle, said Tracye McArdle, health officer for the 
Atlantic County Division of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``They loved it,'' she said. ``They absolutely loved it.''

<HEADLINE> Helicopter Crashes During Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- An Air Force helicopter crashed  
during a mountain search for a 3-year-old boy, injuring five 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The UH-1 Huey helicopter from F.E. Warren Air Force Base in  
Cheyenne, Wyo., had joined about 30 volunteers during the search 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft was equipped with gear that can detect body heat  
and was carrying four active duty Air Force crew members and one 
search-and-rescue crew member, officials at the air base reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The five suffered injuries including broken bones and bruises,  
and all were expected to make a full recovery, said Rulon Stacey, 
president of Poudre Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The little boy was still missing today. Jaryd Atadero of  
Littleton, disappeared Saturday while on a hike with a group of 
family friends near Twin Lakes. His parents were not on the hike, 
said Larimer County Deputy Cindy Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	She said temperatures in the area dipped to 25 degrees Sunday  
morning, but the boy was warmly dressed, ``so that gives us a lot 
of hope.''

<HEADLINE> Warriors Sign Free Agent Legler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Free agent guard Tim Legler signed a  
one-year contract with the Golden State Warriors on Monday. Terms 
of the deal were not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Legler, a 10-year veteran, averaged 4.0 points and 1.3 rebounds  
in 30 games last season with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	It is Legler's second stint with the Warriors as he appeared in  
24 games with them in 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outside shooting was an area that we wanted to address this  
offseason, and we think that by adding Tim, who is one of the best 
3-point shooters in the league, we have filled a need on our 
basketball team,'' Warriors general manager Garry St. Jean said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Golden State and Washington, Legler has also  
played for Phoenix, Denver, Utah, Dallas and Washington. He also 
played six seasons in the Continental Basketball Association. 
</P>
<P>
	He has averaged 7.3 points, 1.6 rebounds and 1.3 assists over  
his career. In the 1995-96 season, he led the league with a .522 
percentage from 3-point range.

<HEADLINE>  Court Sentences WWII Camp Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Dinko Sakic, the last known living  
commander of a World War II concentration camp, was found guilty 
today of crimes against humanity and sentenced to a maximum of 20 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic, 78, was convicted of responsibility in the killings of  
2,000 people while he ran Croatia's Jasenovac concentration camp in 
1944. 
</P>
<P>
	As Chief Judge Drazen Tripalo announced the verdict, Sakic  
applauded -- apparently mocking the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripalo said the seven-member court found Sakic guilty of all  
charges. He said the commander, ``maltreated, tortured and killed 
inmates -- acts that he either personally ordered, participated in, 
or did nothing to prevent his subordinates from doing the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Sakic was personally responsible for killing four  
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that the sentence -- made 55 years after the events --  
will be a warning that all those who committed crimes in the near 
or distant past will not escape justice,'' Tripalo said. ``We also 
hope that the verdict will be a warning for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jasenovac, described by Jewish groups as the ``Auschwitz of the  
Balkans,'' was the worst of more than 20 concentration camps run by 
the pro-Nazi puppet state of Croatia. Tens of thousands of Serbs, 
Jews, Gypsies and anti-fascist Croats perished in Jasenovac between 
1941 and 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripalo said ``the obvious mass suffering of inmates'' and  
Sakic's demonstrated ``lack of remorse,'' were aggravating 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates were subject to physical torture, starvation and hard  
labor, leading to the deaths of an unknown number of detainees, the 
court said. Sakic also was responsible for incidents in which 
individuals or groups were taken to a certain building within the 
camp, where they were tortured and killed, the verdict said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic also was found guilty of participating in or allowing sick  
inmates to be killed, and of carrying out ``individual or group 
punishments'' in order to intimidate other detainees. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was found responsible for mass killings and hangings, as  
well as for allowing his guards to kill ``without reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crimes ``were not excesses, but a systematic procedure that  
certainly was not happening without the commander's knowledge,'' 
Tripalo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic's lawyer, Ivan Kern, said he planned to appeal the  
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Baer, former president of the Jewish organization B'nai  
B'rith, praised the court's decision. ``This should be a proud day 
for Croatia. The chief judge gave a very thoughtful, a very 
complete explanation of both the judgment and the reason for the 
sentence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the decision was announced, several right-wing extremists  
gathered in front of the courthouse, singing Croatian songs from 
World War II. One struck a human rights activist in the head, 
injuring him, before police led the rightists away. 
</P>
<P>
	During the six-month trial, more than 30 camp survivors recalled  
starvation, untreated diseases and killings of inmates deemed unfit 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four witnesses said they saw Sakic empty his gun into  
the head of a former inmate, physician Milo Boskovic. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic sat calmly during their testimonies, appearing completely  
unmoved, sometimes even bored. He laughed at one testimony and 
rejected others as ``fantasies'' or anti-Croat propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
	He never expressed remorse, claiming defiantly that all he did  
was for the good of Croatia and Croats and that ``no harm was 
done'' to the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no guilty conscience whatsoever,'' he stated in his  
final remarks last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Slavko Goldstein, who lost more than 30 family members at  
Jasenovac and other camps, said, ``we who survived the Holocaust 
should not be vengeful, but this case was about justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic fled Croatia in 1945, when the country's fascist regime  
was crushed, and lived peacefully in Argentina until June 1998, 
when he was extradited to Croatia to stand trial.

year after he took over on Oct. 14, 1987, is still the chairman, 
CEO and managing general partner. 
</P>
<P>
	He also holds those positions with baseball's Arizona  
Diamondbacks and serves on the NBA Board of Governors, but said he 
didn't make the move because he was swamped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think he's entitled to the promotion,'' the senior  
Colangelo said. ``He deserves the title. He's done a terrific 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Colangelo, who played basketball at Cornell while studying  
for a degree in business management, received the credit for 
rebuilding the Suns after they traded Charles Barkley to Houston in 
the summer of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he brought Jason Kidd, Clifford Robinson, Antonio  
McDyess, Tom Gugliotta and Penny Hardaway to the team. The Suns are 
164-132 with Colangelo as GM. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he still answers to the chief.  
</P>
<P>
	``The roles really won't change,'' Bryan Colangelo said. ``The  
way the organization has been running for a couple of years now, 
it's been a situation where Jerry still has his global approach to 
the sport and is the primary contact and liaison with the NBA on 
what I'll call the larger issues relative to the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's obviously been a tremendous mentor to me over the years,  
and he's given me the opportunity to somewhat step out from his 
shadow, and it's worked out very well for him and for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Colangelo was the Suns' first general manager, and was the  
youngest GM in the league at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	His son is still the second-youngest GM behind Philadelphia's  
Billy King. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Colangelo has been assistant director of player personnel,  
vice president, assistant GM and vice president for administration. 
For seven years, he has been director for the Nike Desert Classic, 
a college all-star tournament held each April.

<HEADLINE> CDC Plans Grants To Curb Prison HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Seven states will receive a total of $7 million  
in grants to help develop HIV prevention programs in prisons, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Each state will receive between $900,000 and $1.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	A study released by the CDC in August found that there are 8,900  
inmates nationwide with AIDS and between 35,000 and 47,000 with the 
virus that causes it -- a rate five times higher than the national 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prisons and jails provide a critical opportunity to provide  
lifesaving HIV prevention services to a population that might 
otherwise be missed,'' said Dr. Helene D. Gayle, director of the 
CDC's National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said inmates typically aren't infected while  
incarcerated, but that only 10 percent of state and federal prison 
systems and only 5 percent of city and county jails have HIV 
prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The states receiving grants are California, Florida, Georgia,  
Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Retirement Fund May Be Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Banking officials said Monday they have been  
unable to find evidence of a retirement account that Mexicans who 
worked in the United States say could hold as much as $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure adds another roadblock in the path of the former  
workers, who claim they have been cheated of money they paid weekly 
into the retirement fund during the bracero program, which ran from 
1942 to 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	``The documentation has been searched for exhaustively, but we  
don't have a way of confirming the existence of the fund in this 
bank,'' said Alejandro Romero, an attorney for the National Rural 
Credit Bank, known as Banrural. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, the governments of Mexico and the United  
States created the bracero program which granted Mexicans temporary 
U.S. visas to work the land and man the railroads. About 2.6 
million Mexicans participated from 1942 until 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement by the US and Mexico, each worker had 10  
percent deducted from his paycheck by the Farm Security 
Administration. It was sent to Banco Nacional de Credito Agricola, 
a predecessor of Banrural, or another bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Bracero advocates say that with interest, the fund could hold up  
to $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen former braceros had gathered at the bank Monday to hear  
the promised report. 
</P>
<P>
	Romero said those with claims can come forward individually and  
provide with documents that prove they are entitled to money. 
</P>
<P>
	Bracero representatives said that unfairly places the burden of  
proof on people who have waited generations to receive the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here in Mexico things seem to get lost, especially when the  
heat is on,'' said Ventura Gutierrez, general coordinator of Union 
Without Borders, a U.S.-based group representing former braceros 
trying to claim the benefits. ``If we have to go to Washington 
we'll go to Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez said he plans to meet this week with congressmen in  
Mexico to press for a remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	If that does not work, he said he will investigate the National  
Archives for documents proving the existence of the fund and the 
amount of money paid into it. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they want to do use the old divide and conquer tactic by  
placing the burden on affected individuals to prove they have right 
to the money,'' Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez earlier said he estimated that only about 2 percent of  
braceros were able to collect the money owed them from the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 million braceros have died, while approximately 20,000  
ex-braceros or their survivors have been located. 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel Angel Gonzalez, an attorney for the Foreign Relations  
Secretariat, said initial research there indicates that while the 
bracero program lasted until 1964, the savings fund existed only 
until 1950.

<HEADLINE> Early Flu Shots Urged in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The flu season appears to have arrived early this  
year, courtesy of an influenza strain that reached the continental 
United States by hopping a ride on Alaskan cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Public health officials from Colorado to Massachusetts have  
kicked off campaigns encouraging people to get vaccinated against 
the disease, the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember when you get your shots, just think to yourself  
afterwards, it's just one shot for man, one giant leap for public 
health,'' Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner Howard Koh said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta  
estimates that as mush as 20 percent of the population gets the flu 
every season. Approximately 20,000 Americans die from flu 
complications each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu viruses follow well-worn paths, starting in Asia and heading  
east, health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska is usually the first place in the United States to be  
affected, with the viruses eventually making their way south to the 
western United States and eventually the East Coast, said Dr. 
Steven Mostow, associate dean of the University of Colorado Medical 
School and an influenza expert. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (flu viruses) follow a very prescribed pattern,'' Mostow  
said. ``This is early. You can predict by the week over a 30-year 
period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado moved up its flu vaccine campaigns by two weeks this  
year, Mostow said. He expects the flu will show up four weeks 
early, hitting Colorado this month and reaching the East Coast by 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	Several cases have been reported in the continental United  
States, including four in Colorado linked to Alaska cruise ship 
outbreaks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way the boats are set up -- eating in large groups, touring  
in large groups -- facilitated the threat of the virus,'' Mostow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	States have become creative with their flu vaccination  
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts, Koh distributed T-shirts. Colorado gives flu  
shots in grocery stores and at football games. In Fort Edward, 
N.Y., health officials have set up a drive-through shot clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlantic City, N.J., elderly gamblers got flu shots Monday at  
Bally's Park Place ballroom while slot machines jangled in the next 
room. Nurses said the shot could cause soreness in their arms, but 
many replied they would work it out by pulling the slot machine 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They loved it,'' said Tracye McArdle, health officer for the  
Atlantic County Division of Public Health. ``They absolutely loved 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Pele's Son Faces Murder Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The son of soccer great Pele goes on  
trial for murder Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pele's son, Edson Cholbi do Nascimento, 27, and Marcilio Jose  
Marinho de Melo, 24, are accused of killing a motorcyclist by 
smashing into him when racing their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Simoes Neto, a 50-year-old retiree, was thrown from his  
motorcycle and killed in 1992 in Santos, a port town 50 miles 
southeast of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, authorities ruled Nascimento and Melo should be  
charged with murder, and not, as was expected, with involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento's lawyer and Pele's office were not available for  
comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento was a reserve goalkeeper for eight years for Santos,  
Pele's former club. He retired from pro soccer in June and then 
joined his father's company, Pele Sports and Marketing.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Davis Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Terrell Davis, the NFL's MVP last year, will miss  
the rest of the season because of a knee injury, a devastating blow 
to a championship team already reeling from four straight losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Broncos' running back tore ligaments and cartilage in  
his right knee while making a tackle Sunday during the first 
quarter of a 21-13 loss to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to him and he's in as good as spirits as he could  
possibly be in,'' coach Mike Shanahan said today. ``He's working 
through it right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is expected to be out four to six months and make a full  
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, with the ACL and the advancements they've made in  
technology, you never know for sure,'' Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach said Derek Loville will start in place of Davis. This  
is the third season he has backed up Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan, whose winless team is clearly diminished by the  
retirement of John Elway, will also review his quarterbacks. Brian 
Griese, who replaced Bubby Brister during preseason, threw three 
interceptions Sunday. Brister entered late in the fourth quarter 
and threw two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who led the NFL in rushing last season with 2,008 yards,  
has been off to a slow start. He was hurt during an interception 
return by Jets safety Victor Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos offensive tackle Matt Lepsis made a diving tackle to cut  
down Green at the sideline, but Lepsis also caught Davis, trailing 
the play slightly, on his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was assisted by trainers on the sideline, then limped to  
the locker room. He did not return. 
</P>
<P>
	After Davis' departure, the Broncos scored only a field goal.  
Davis rushed for 18 yards on eight carries. For the season, he has 
211 yards.

<HEADLINE> Gemstar Buying TV Guide for $8.6B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gemstar International Group Ltd. is buying TV  
Guide Inc. in an $8.6 billion stock deal, the second time in less 
than a year the magazine is changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, TV Guide International Inc., will be based at  
Gemstar's headquarters in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	TV Guide, based in Tulsa, Okla., is the nation's top-selling  
weekly magazine with circulation of about 11 million -- down since 
1988 from 17 million because of competition from newspaper TV 
listings, online listings and other program schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	Gemstar is a leading marketer of electronic programming guides  
for broadcast networks, cable channels and Internet services. The 
company also markets VCR Plus, which allows viewers to easily 
program video players. 
</P>
<P>
	TV Guide's publishing expertise will blend well with Gemstar's  
electronic programming services, said Gemstar founder Henry Yuen, 
who will remain chairman and chief executive officer of the new 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers who prefer hard-copy TV listings can get the magazine,  
while the deal broadens the prospects for advertising revenue from 
online and other electronic program schedules, said Peter Boylan 
III, TV Guide's president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, News Corp. sold TV Guide to United Video  
Satellite Group Inc., which adopted TV Guide's name.
