<HEADLINE> Wild, Basuki out of Nokia Open (Correction) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Unseeded Tamarine Tanasugarn of
Thailand shattered top seed Linda Wild's title-defending hope
while Chen Li became the first Chinese to enter the Nokia Open
quarter-finals Friday by crashing second seed Yayuk Basuki.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Tanasugarn, coached by her father, upset
American world No. 32 Wild 6-4, 6-4 to gain a semi-finals berth.
</P>
<P>
"I greatly appreciate the match," said Tanasugarn, who broke
Wild five times in the one hour 17 minutes match.
</P>
<P>
"I can return her serve though she served high and tough and
that's important. I just want to play my best every match."
</P>
<P>
Said Wild: "It's her day today."
</P>
<P>
Chen Li, the world No. 213, broke Basuki three times each set
to take a overwhelming 6-2, 6-2 win.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Chen controlled the match with her baseline
play which forced the Indonesian world No. 32 Basuki into errors.
</P>
<P>
"She can't return my serve well because I'm left-handed," Chen
said. "But I return hers well."
</P>
<P>
Chen defeated Basuki in their only other meet eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Chen plays well today. But it's my worst match in these days,"
Basuki said.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, third seed Sandrine Testud of France
outplayed Japanese sixth seed Mana Endo, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, in one
hour and 30 minutes. And fifth seed Wang Shi-ting from Chinese
Taipei ousted fourth seed Naoko Kijimuta of Japan 6-3, 6-4 with
her powerful forehand groudstrokes.

Chen takes on Testud.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Smoking Ban Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Over the past five months,
Beijing has forcefully implemented its local law banning smoking
in public places, making the city a tough place for compulsive
smokers.
</P>
<P>
Since the law went into effect on May 15, more than 1,100 people
have been fined for smoking in public places. The fines totaled
11,200 yuan, said Zhang Xizeng, deputy director of the Beijing
Patriotic Public Health Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told Xinhua that more people are asking doctors how to
kick the habit, and that in June, 23 percent fewer cigarettes were
sold in the city, compared with June 1995.
</P>
<P>
The official said that a total of 77,000 public places in eight
types are listed as non-smoking places in the legislation. among
these, conference rooms, including those in the Great Hall of the
People and the Zhongnanhai Compound where the state council meets,
stand out as the most successful in the campaign to ban smoking.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Medical Sciences University has announced it will
not enroll students who are cigarette addicts.
</P>
<P>
Zhang attributed the successful smoking ban partly to strict
enforcement measures and the education program to inform the
public about the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
"The city erected 220,000 billboards across the city carrying
the words 'smoking forbidden'," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the city dispatched more than 1,200
law-enforcement officials and supervisors, and some 80,000
inspectors armed with legal documents to check on the
implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
He said that 336 of the more than 41,800 companies, schools,
institutions and government agencies were found to be lax in
enforcing the smoking regulation. One unit was fined 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The official did not call the smoking ban 100 percent
successful, because, he said, "smoking still occurs in some public
places, and in the conference rooms of a tiny number of units,
individuals still smoke."
</P>
<P>
Management on some mini-buses and trains entering Beijing still
needs be strengthened, he added.

was called "unusually intimate" by Venice sporting judge Sergio
Rigo and earned him a one-match ban.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pakistan-U.S. Defense Group to Hold Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani-U.S.
Consultative Group will begin its three-day annual meeting here on
Sunday to discuss bilateral and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Top officials of the Pentagon and Pakistan's Defense Ministry
will attend the meeting, according to the official Associated
Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The group was suspended in 1990 when the United States stopped
military and economic assistance to Pakistan due to its suspicion
of a Pakistani nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
It was revived in January last year during a visit of U.S.
Defense Secretary William Perry to Pakistan and held its first
annual meeting after revival in Washington in June last year.
</P>
<P>
No formal agenda of the meeting is available, but sources said
the group will discuss important topics, including an overview of
the security environment in South Asia, Pakistani-U.S. security
relations in the post-Cold War era, joint exercises, military
training and the outstanding defense-related issues between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The group is also expected to review progress in the delivery
of 368 million U.S. dollars' worth of embargoed military equipment
to Pakistan. The equipment, already paid for by Pakistan, had been
held back by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Negotiations End in Taba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators ended their talks in the Egyptian resort town of Taba
today without reaching agreement on the long-delayed redeployment
of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, head of the Palestinian negotiating delegation,
was quoted by Egypt's new agency MENA as saying after the talks
that the Israeli intransigence put the negotiations in a "vicious
circle."
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross, who
participated in the talks, said in statements carried by MENA
that progress was achieved in the negotiations held in Taba and
its neighboring Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat this week.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides held very good and constructive
talks and their differences were narrowed.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that discussions were held in a serious and
positive atmosphere as both the Palestinians and Israelis were
keen on reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, meanwhile, said the Palestinian team openly stressed
that it will not alter what has been previously agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
"This is the core of differences between the two sides," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans tried to bring views of the two sides closer,
but there is an Israeli determination to run in a vicious
circle," he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of procrastinating and adding new points to
the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on expanding Palestinian
self-rule in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached in Taba in September last year,
Israel should have withdrawn from 80 percent of Hebron, the last
West Bank town still under Israeli occupation, seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted on making amendments to the agreement,
saying that it wants to ensure security for the 450 Jewish
settlers, who live among some 120,000 Palestinians in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Ross said that the negotiations will not resume until Monday,
but unofficial contacts will be held between the two sides
Saturday and Sunday, MENA reported.
</P>
<P>
On the talks to be held next week, Ross said that while a
Hebron accord was a first priority, the two sides would be
discussing other issues as well.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have listed what they describe as 34 Israeli
violations of the peace agreements already signed, including a
failure to pull back troops from West Bank rural areas, to
release prisoners and to open a passage between the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Erekat expressed the hope that the Israelis would realize that
there could be no renegotiation on what had been earlier agreed
upon.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should negotiate a mechanism for the
implementation of the Taba 1995 agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from both sides, the key sticking points
are Israel's demand for retaining the right to pursue Palestinian
suspects into Palestinian-controlled areas and for creating
buffer zones between the Jewish enclaves and the Arab
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks in Taba followed a three-hour session of talks
that began late Thursday night and adjourned at 2 a.m. (0000 GMT)
today in Eilat.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Asfour, Palestinian coordinator of the negotiations,
was quoted by MENA as saying that differences within the Israeli
team had led the talks in Eilat to a "deadlock."
</P>
<P>
"We went to Eilat but Israeli differences prevented us even
from sitting with them in Eilat," he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Diaoyu Islands Are China's Territory: Japanese Historian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Diaoyu Island and its
adjacent islands have been part of China's territory since ancient
times, said a famous Japanese historian in a book reprinted
recently.
</P>
<P>
In the new edition of his book "The Diaoyu Island and Its
Adjacent Islands", Kiyoshi Inoue, honorary professor of the Kyoto
University, said in the foreword that many historical facts attest
to the fact that since as early as at least the 16th century, the
Diaoyu, in the East China Sea between China and Japan, have been
an intrinsic part of the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
The book was first published 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Inoue said before writing the book he collected in Okinawa,
Japan's southernmost island, a lot of historical records and
documents about the Diaoyu Island.
</P>
<P>
He also found, in the library of the British Admiralty Board,
many sea charts, logbooks and exploration records drawn and
written by the British navy about South China, Taiwan and the
Ryukyu islands.
</P>
<P>
Not only these documents, but also the Japanese historical
books and records themselves showed that the Diaoyu islands
belonged to China, Inoue said, referring to an atlas published in
1785 in Japan, in which the Diaoyu islands were illustrated
differently to indicate they were part of China.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some Japanese right-wingers have repeatedly taken
provocative actions on the issue of the Diaoyu islands, in
violation of China's sovereignty. They made several landings on
the Diaoyu Island and illegally built a lighthouse there.
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese government, who had an unshirkable
responsibility, turned a blind eye to the right-wingers' actions
and a deaf ear to China's strong protests.
</P>
<P>
Inoue said he felt this was a serious provocation of the
reviving Japanese militarism against China, which made it
necessary to reprint the book.

BONN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali said today in Hamburg that he opposed sending

</P>
<P>
The three-day talks of the Sino-Indian Joint Working Group on

Both sides agreed to continue consultations to gradually solve
their differences concerning the alignment of the actual control
line in certain areas, in an effort to maintain peace and
tranquillity in the border region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that exchanges between military training
institutions of the two countries should be continued and
expanded, and that border defense authorities should gradually
establish mid-level and high-level contacts. The two countries'

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong-Beijing Rally Makes History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- When the flag drops this
weekend for the start of this year's 555 Hong Kong-Beijing Rally,
it makes history.
</P>
<P>
The kick-off of the 3,844.19-kilometer event marks the end of
an 11-year efforts which have helped win honor through the
introduction of the crueling sport into China.
</P>
<P>
Years of efforts have brought the rally in China to the
international arena of auto racing.
</P>
<P>
The idea of an auto rally in China came in 1982 but such a
rally was not held until 1985. After three successful years, the
Rally was suspended for five year before being resumed in 1993. So
this year's Rally is the seventh in the series.
</P>
<P>
Of the total length for this year's Rally, 484.75 kilometers,
are for special stages, where time is counted for each of the
participating cars.
</P>
<P>
This is the last time the 555 Hong Kong-Beijing Rally will take
its twisty, tortuous route to the Chinese capital. The week-long
historical Rally starts at Hong Kong at 10:30 Saturday and
finishes at 10:30 in Beijing's Tiananmen Square next Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although the Hong Kong-Beijing Rally comes to an end, officials
of the event are already looking forward to 1997 and a new format
which will see a bright new future for rallying on the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
And the historic Hong Kong-Beijing Rally '96, which is also the
 final stage of this year's FIA Pacific Championships for
Manufacturers, has brought a record entry of 70 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Each team has a drive hoping to write his name in the history
books. Ari Vatanen from Finland, driving a Mitsubishi Lancer this
year, won the event in 1993. Kenneth Eriksson from Sweden,
driving a Subaru Impreza 555, was the winner last year. A victory
in 1996 would make either of them the first driver ever to win the
event twice.
</P>
<P>
Chinese drivers have participated in every of the past six
races, with Lu Ningjun posing as the runner-up in the second Rally
 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have some sort of advantage as competing on home
soil, we have to challenge much more experienced drivers from
abroad," said Lu, a former Beijing police driving instructor.
</P>
<P>
"The foremost goal for me at this final Hong Kong-Beijing Rally
 is to survive and reach the finish ramp in Beijing," he
added.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Calls for Demolishment of Fences in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- World soccer's ruling body FIFA
said on Friday there should be no perimeter fences at the 1998
World Cup venues in France in wake of this week's stadium tragedy
in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
"Fences are for animals and prisoners -- not football fans,"
FIFA general secretary Sepp Blatter was quoted as saying in
Munich.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that all the fences for the World Cup in France
should be taken down," he continued
</P>
<P>
At least 75 people were killed and hundreds injured in
Guatemala City Wednesday night when soccer fans tried to squeeze
into Mateo Flores Stadium for a World Cup qualifying match between
Guetemala and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Many died crushed against the chainlink fence separating the
stands from the field in the worst soccer stadium disaster in
World Cup history.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said FIFA had been working for the last few weeks on
dropping plans to have fences in France, which is due to host the
finals of soccer World Cup in 1998.

<HEADLINE> US Tobacco Companies Sued to Recoup health Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW York, October 18 (Xinhua) -- New York City sued big u.s.
tobacco companies on Thursday to recoup the billions of dollars
that the city has spent to care for the people with illness caused
by smoking, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Among the tobacco companies that were sued by New York City is
Philip Morris, one of the city's largest and most influential
corporations, which is the biggest maker of cigarettes in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of the city was quoted as saying at a
press conference on Thursday that the major tobacco companies had
waged a decades-long campaign to dupe the public into believing
that cigarettes were not addictive or harmful. "In New York City,
this deceit has caused enormous suffering and death," he
asserted."And it has huge economic repercussions."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 17 states and more than a dozen localities
have already filed similar lawsuits, trying to end the companies'
long record of courtroom successes.

<HEADLINE> Iran Tries to Broker Peace in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati said here today that Iran and six Asian nations
had launched wide-range efforts to remove differences among
warring Afghan groups and bring about unity among them.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement upon return from his six-nation Asian
tour, which took him to Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that he and officials of the six countries
agreed that they should strive as much as possible in helping
various groups in Afghanistan to achieve a comprehensive solution
based on peace and fraternity.
</P>
<P>
He said that they had agreed that peace could not be restored
in Afghanistan through bullying and continued war and bloodshed
by the belligerent groups, and that continuation of war would
make the situation in Afghanistan more complicated.
</P>
<P>
"Clashes among various Afghan groups had just further deepened
enmities, putting Afghanistan's independence into danger," he was
quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Taliban's function vis-a-vis Afghan people, Velayati said
that certain behaviors of the group had been unknown and
unjustifiable to Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The function of Taliban, as the so-called 'pro-Islamic
government' group, is not only incompatible with Islamic
standards in certain cases, rather contrary to them," the Iranian
foreign minister pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Study: Big Businesses, Big Campaign Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A watch group's study has
projected that this year's Presidential race in the United States
would cost 800 million dollars, three times as much as the 1992
figure, and that another 800 million dollars would be spent on
Congressional races, up from 660 million dollars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
So far, tobacco giant Philip Morris is the No. 1 contributor at
2.7 million dollars, followed by a long list of corporations,
unions and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
Special interests underwrite America's political campaigns
because they expect to "cash in" on their investments, according
to researchers at the Center for Responsive Politics, a
non-profit, nonpartisan group that studies campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
"Our campaign finance system is a quid-pro-quo system to all
manner of interests," said Ellen Miller, the center's executive
director. "Both parties and every candidate is up to his or her
eyebrows in it."
</P>
<P>
But Corporate and political officials argued that donors don't
receive special consideration for their money.
</P>
<P>
"Our donors tell us that they give to the Republican Party
because they believe in the principles that underlie our party --
smaller government, lower taxes, fewer regulations," said Mary
Crawford, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
The center analyzed the big spenders who gave to the Republican
and Democratic parties and to congressional and presidential
candidates from the start of 1995 through last June -- the most
recent complete numbers available from the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The totals include "soft money," donations of unlimited amounts
which can only be given to the political parties, as well as
political action committee contributions and gifts from
individuals associated with the companies.
</P>
<P>
The three top contributors -- Philip Morris, AT&AMP;T, and the
Association of Trial Lawyers -- each had vital interests at stake
in the last session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
There were the tighter restrictions on cigarette sales and
advertising proposed by President Bill Clinton. The Congress
passed, and Clinton signed, legislation making sweeping changes in
the way communications companies including AT&AMP;T are regulated. And
Congress passed a bill to limit the awards in lawsuits, which
Clinton vetoed.
</P>
<P>
Financial companies such as securities firms, banks, insurance
companies and real estate brokers shelled out more political money
than any other sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Financial companies, their executives and employees -- big
supporters of Republican presidential nominees -- gave 59.8
million dollars, or half of it in soft money. While Clinton
collected a great part of his money from lawyers and lobbyists.

<HEADLINE> French Trade Unions Threaten to Stage Further Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Three biggest trade unions of
France today threatened to stage further strikes to pressure Prime
Minister Alain Juppe to abandon his austerity plans which they
said would drastically worsen unemployment and destroy the
country's public service.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary of the Confederation General du Travail,
Louis Viannet, said that his union is proposing to all other
unions to turn November 15 the day of "national initiative of
great format".
</P>
<P>
The leftist union of Force Ouvriere estimated that half a
million people demonstrated across the country on Thursday in
protest of Juppe's social and economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Viannet said that the strike, which has won great public
support, "confirmed the great power of the salary-owners to
mobilize and unite themselves to make their demands heard and met".
</P>
<P>
About 35 percent of all the employees of the public sector
across the country, who were in the hundreds of thousands, took to
the streets on Thursday and called for the defense of employment
and public service, a halt to privatization and salary hikes.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Juppe, meanwhile, vowed to go ahead with his
privatization plan by announcing today the takeover of the
state-run Compagnie Generale Maritime by the Marseille-based
Compagnie Maritime d'Affretement.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came two days after the government decided to
sell the Thomson SA industrial-military group to the group of
Jean-Luc Lagardere, while pouring 11 billion francs (2.2 billion
U.S. dollars) in extra state aid to the Thomson SA to help carry
out the privatization program.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Socialist Party denounced the decision today.
It accused the government of adopting austerity measures with the
excuse of budget constraint while selling state companies with
state aid.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks achieved a
record new high today, with the Hang Seng Index gaining 73
points, or 0.59 percent, to close at 12,510.
</P>
<P>
The bullish sentiment on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has
continued for over a month, and in the past four weeks the Hang
Seng Index has gained a total of 918 points, representing an
increase of 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Before the major rally over the past four weeks, the highest
closing point of the Hang Seng Index on the Hong Kong market was
recorded on January 4, 1994 when the market hit 12,201.
</P>
<P>
That was surpassed on October 9 this year when the market
closed at 12,250, and since then the market has kept on creating
new records.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said that this continuous bullish sentiment has largely
been buoyed up by the rally on Wall Street, and a flow of funds
from other markets also helped the stocks advance. The present
fairly good economic conditions in China's mainland and Hong Kong
should be included in the supporting factors as well.
</P>
<P>
They said the market is likely to hit new highs before the end
of this year.

<HEADLINE> 1995 Brought General Decline of EU Economic Growth: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth of the
European Union slipped from 2.8 percent in 1994 to 2.4 percent
last year, according to a report published today by EU's
statistical office in which the recent health of the EU
economy came under the microscope.
</P>
<P>
However, the report pointed out that EU's economic growth last
year was higher than the United States' two percent and Japan's
under one percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Eurostat showed that GDP(Gross Domestic
Product) of the EU as a whole worked out at 6438.6 billion ECU(one
ECU equals 1.3 U.S. dollars) in 1995 compared with 5539.6 billion
ECU for the U.S. and 3907.7 billion ECU for Japan.
</P>
<P>
Within the EU, Germany had the highest GDP, representing about
28.7 percent of the EU total.
</P>
<P>
Four EU-economies(Germany, France, Italy and the United
Kingdom) accounted for nearly 73 percent of the total GDP of the
Union, while at the other end of the scale the five
countries(Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal and Finland)
contributed only about 4.9 percent to the total.
</P>
<P>
Concerning per capita data, it was Luxembourg which had in 1995
the highest level(31860 ECU) while Greece and Portugal, with 8150
and 7800 ECU respectively fell below the Union's average(17260
ECU).
</P>
<P>
EU domestic demand remained weak last year. However, having
peaked in the fourth quarter of 1994, investment showed
substantially positive growth rates in the short term, although
the overall trend was downwards, particularly in construction
activity.
</P>
<P>
Last year, EU economic activity was supported by external demand
led by extra-EU countries. Trade surplus with rest-of-world rose
to 24 billion ECU from six billion in 1994.
</P>
<P>
While EU productivity rose steadily in 1995, pay in this period
was up strongly, an annual rate of 4.7 percent matched the US and
overtook Japan.
</P>
<P>
Regarding consumption pattern, food, drink and tobacco and, to
a lesser extent, clothing and footwear were down, things like
housing, water, fuel and power and health and medical care were
up.

<HEADLINE> Corsicans Warn Juppe of Reprisal of "Relentless Fullness" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A mainstream Corsican nationalist
group has warned French Prime Minister Alain Juppe of "reprisal of
relentless fullness" if he resorted to "physical elimination" of
any member of the nationalist group.
</P>
<P>
But in a brief meeting with the press today in Bordeaux, Juppe
said that the government will continue to "apply the law" in
Corsica.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued Thursday evening, the Corsican National
Liberation Front, or FLNC-Canal Historique, which blew up part of
the Bordeaux mayoral office of Juppe on October 5, said that the
government must stop investigations into a rally of 600 Corsican
militants held nine months ago on the island.
</P>
<P>
The General Attorney's Office of Paris announced this week it
was launching an inquiry into the rally attended by militants who
were bearing illegal weapons on January 11-12 in Tralonca, Upper
Corsica.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was part of Juppe's plan to crack down on
Corsican nationalists, who also claimed responsibility for two
bomb attacks on two government buildings in Nimes, southern
France, and two others on Corsica, this week.
</P>
<P>
On the black list prepared by Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere and
Judge Laurent Le Vert, who are in charge of anti-terrorist files
in the Paris Investigative Court, was Francois Santoni, head of
the Cuncolta Naziunalista, the legal wing of the FLNC-Canal.
</P>
<P>
Santoni, who was believed to be hiding in southern Corsica, was
sentenced in absence to one year in jail by a court in Bastia,
Corsica, on Wednesday for using and transporting illegal firearms.
</P>
<P>
The FLNC-Canal said that the rally was permitted by an envoy of
President Jacques Chirac, who reportedly tried to secretly arrange
a solution to the 20-year-old violence on the island launched by
the nationalists fighting for independence from France.

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary to Visit Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcom Rifkind is expected to visit Cyprus in December in a bid to
push forward the island's peace process.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides after a meeting between Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides and Britain's special envoy for Cyprus Sir David
Hannay at the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Clerides and Hannay discussed key issues
concerning the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman said preparatory discussions will be
stepped up early in 1997 to achieve the necessary progress that
would lead to negotiations toward the end of spring.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hannay's week-long meetings here with President
Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash,
Cassoulides said the British envoy is formulating an overall
picture of the situation and is beginning to realize the reality
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He added that the British envoy will make suggestions to his
government on how it can act.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, said the Turkish Cypriot leader
Denktash insists on his positions on the Cyprus problem and noted
the gap between the two sides had not been bridged.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides reiterated that negotiations between Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides can not begin until the Turkish side
changes its positions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
intervened and seized the northern third of the island following
an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The problem has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and
international community's peace efforts for the past 22 years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Narrowed to $10.8 Billion in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
slipped slightly to 10.8 billion U.S. dollars in August, but still
the second-largest deficit in five years, according to a report
from the U.S. Department of Commerce issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the trade deficit ebbed 6.6 percent
from 11.6 billion dollars in July, which was the largest monthly
imbalance since the government began tracking monthly goods and
services trade in 1992.
</P>
<P>
For August, U.S. exports of goods and services went up 3
percent to 69.3 billion dollars while imports rose by 1.6 percent
to 80.2 billion dollars. The increase in exports was led by an
increase of 497 million dollars in sales of commercial aircraft
and a 197 million dollar increase in exports of American cars and
parts. Meanwhile, on the import side, demand for foreign cars and
parts was up 462 million dollars and U.S. demand for foreign
consumer goods was up 530 million dollars while the country's
foreign oil purchase edged down 8.1 percent to 5.04 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the month, America's deficit with China once again surpassed
that of Japan, which attributed mainly to America's strong demand
for Chinese toys and Christmas lights. Some U.S. analysts believe
that it signals the start of a new trend in which a growing trade
gap with China will overshadow Japan, the country that usually has
had the biggest trade imbalance with the United States.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the department's statistics, the U.S deficit
with China climbed to a record 4.7 billion dollars, up 23 percent
from the previous month. U.S. exports to China were down 22
percent, displaying a big drop in sales of American passenger jets
and fertilizer while imports climbed 14 percent, reflecting a big
growth in U.S. demand for Chinese toys and Christmas decorations,
clothing and telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with Japan fell in August by 11.8 percent to
3.8 billion dollars. For the first eight months of this year,
America's deficit with Japan is down 28 percent to the lowest
level since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The nation's deficit with Western Europe also narrowed in
August. After hitting a record high of 4.2 billion dollars in
July, the imbalance declined to 1.6 billion dollars. Much of the
improvement came from a drop in American imports of European cars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with Mexico continued to run at record levels,
showing the fact that Mexico's currency crisis has made Mexican
imports cheaper in this country while making U.S. exports to
Mexico more expensive. The U.S. deficit with the southern neighbor
rose to 1.5 billion dollars, up 11.2 percent from July.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slight decrease, the U.S. deficit in goods and
services is running at an annual rate of 112.04 billion dollars,
compared to 105.06 billion dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Chirac's Mideast Tour Aims to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac will start a Middle East tour Saturday, with the first leg
in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
It will be Chirac's first Middle East tour which will also
cover Jordan, the Palestinian self rule territories, Israel and
Egypt. It is taking place at a time when the Middle East peace
process is facing difficulties and stumbling blocks.
</P>
<P>
According to today's statement by the spokeswoman of the
French presidency, Chirac's tour will be devoted to the peace
process, promoting the principles of peace and the land-for-peace
formula, and the implementation of the related international
legitimacy resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Observers here maintain that Chirac's choice of Damascus as
the first leg of his tour aims to demonstrate Syria's important
role in the region, to express Europe's determination to
undertake an effective and distinguished role in the peace
process, to support the process particularly the land-for-peace
formula, and to call for negotiations with the participation of
the EU.
</P>
<P>
The observers have the opinion that the French President's
visit to the region is aimed at furthering the European role in
general, and that of France in particular, in peace-making. Such
stance is warmly welcome with the hope that it will create a role
equivalent to the pro-Israeli role of the United States. Besides,
the U.S. is virtually paralyzed on account of the presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, France, seeking to restore its influence in the
region, is playing an important role in promoting an effective
EU role. Accordingly, the French President will listen to the
views of the concerned Arab parties and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will endeavor to help the Palestinians and the Israelis
in their negotiations and to put the peace process on track once
more. He will express France's readiness to play an effective
role together with the EU, in an effort to enhance European
interests, thus, transforming the European role from a mere
economic donor to a political player. As a matter of fact, Europe
has provided the Palestinian Authority with 75 percent of the
international assistance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital point out
that the Arab parties, in seeking an effective European role to
save the peace process, hope to see the EU playing a political
role and making initiatives other than those of the U.S. Thus,
the EU could take economic and political stances that bring about
pressure on Israel to implement the related Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here believe that the French and European
efforts to push forward the Middle East peace process have given
rise to U.S. and Israeli concerns. While the U.S. and Israel are
endeavoring to alienate the European role, France is determined
to play an effective role and to introduce Euro-Mediterranean
partnership together with the countries of the region, in view of
the EU's strategic, security and economic interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
Observers maintain that the French President's tour will
definitely help enhance France's ties with the countries of the
region, and will push the Middle East peace process forward,
besides establishing concrete and practical Euro-Mediterranean
partnership.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Get Good Rains This Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Department of
Meteorological Services says although normal rains are expected in
the country this season, they will be less than last year's.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a preliminary report released here today
Zimbabwe was likely to receive its first rainfall at the end of
October or during the first week of November.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the department met in Harare for two days to debate
the prospects of the 1996/97 rainy season, after which they released
their first report.
</P>
<P>
The report said the early part of the season was expected to be
normal and indicators suggested the season might be shorfter than the
last one.
</P>
<P>
''The 1996/97 national rainfall total should be between 80 and 100
percent of the long-term average, that is, approximately 663
millimetres,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe received above normal rains during 1995/96, which the
country needed to revive the agro-based economy after a second
drought in five years. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese City Cuts Real Estate Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 18 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of south
China's prosperous Guangdong Province, a showcase of the country's
reform and opening-up policy, today announced an across-the-board
cut on real estate prices.
</P>
<P>
The reduction, which is effective as of this month, was aimed at
easing the financial burden of enterprises and the urban areas as
well as improving the city's investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The land price for office buildings will be 30 percent lower
from October on, while that of highrises will be 10-15 percent
lower, according to the announcement by the city government.
</P>
<P>
However, the land prices for commercial buildings, multi-storied
commodity houses and houses for work units remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Construction fees for support facilities have nearly been
halved, whereas the fees for managing the commandeering of land
and managing demolitions and the real estate trading charges have
been lowered by 20-50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 fees have been withdrawn, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The city government also said that the development of land for
real estate would be strictly controlled, noting that farmland
would be used for building commodity houses only in some
exceptional cases.
</P>
<P>
A practical annual real estate development plan is being
formulated and will be announced, the city government said.
</P>
<P>
Starting next year, Guangzhou will make a greater effort to
implement the "Comfort Housing Project," a national project
designed to provide affordable houses for ordinary families.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the sale of commodity houses, people outside the
city can obtain a Guangzhou residence permit if they buy houses in
the three districts of Huangpu, Fangcun and Baiyun, the government
said.

HAVANA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- All flights, domestic or

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Teachers Raps New Varsity Fee Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Teachers Union
(ZITU) today described the government's decision to make
university students pay 50 percent of their annual educational
fees from next year as ''counter-productive''.
</P>
<P>
ZITU National Chairman Felix Mafa said university education
will in future be available only to children of the rich while
''brilliant'' students from poor families are denied access.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''we are afraid that 95 percent of potential students
will be disadvantaged by this new policy because most brilliant
students come from poor families living below the poverty datum
level.''
</P>
<P>
The government announced on Wednesday that students enrolling
at local universities will have to pay 50 percent of their annual
fees while it paid the remainder.
</P>
<P>
Mafa said, ''sixty percent of the Zimbabwean population is
poor and children from these families will obviously be denied
the opportunity to have higher education.''
</P>
<P>
If the new policy was implemented, he said, the standard of
education in the country would go down because money and not
intellectual qualities would determine who will enter university.

<HEADLINE> No Parastatal Privatisation Yet, Says Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government has not yet
privatised any parastatal because the mechanism for empowering the
indigenous people is not yet in place, Minister of State responsible
for parastatals and indigenisation Cephas Msipa said today.
</P>
<P>
In a paper read on his behalf at a five-day senior policy
seminar for diplomats of embassies, Msipa said progress had,
however, been made in commercialisation where four companies had
been commercialised since last year.
</P>
<P>
''A lot more progress will be made in the coming year as the
national investment trust will be operational and hopefully the
present efforts to strengthen institutions responsible for
spearheading the privatisation and commercialisation program will
succeed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe government, in its endeavour to improve the
operational efficiency of parastatals, has undertaken to reform the
state enterprises sector through commercialisation and privatisation.
</P>
<P>
Msipa said it was anticipated that by freeing the parastatals from
government control, they would be in a position to make timeous
decisions leading to an overall improvement in their operational
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He added as the government transferred the assets from the public
to the private sector, it was committed to seeing more blacks
involved.
</P>
<P>
The government has approved the setting up of the national
investment trust from which indigenous Zimbabweans would be able to
buy shares, he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Asian Arts Festival Opens In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- "Kabuki for Everyone," the
traditional Japanese music theater, raised the curtain of the 16th
Festival of Asian Arts here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong audience were entertained with a compelling
popular play "Narukami" and a delightful romantic dance "Fiji

first time that a full-scale display of the traditional "Kabuki"
art is put up in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
About 90 more performances are going to be staged during the
23-day arts festival, including dance, drama, music and operas

<HEADLINE> UK Uses Courts to Tackle Stalkers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The British Government today
unveiled its plans which covers tough measures to combat stalkers.
</P>
<P>
It proposes legislation which would outlaw harassment and
behavior which causes people to fear for their safety. Offenders
face up to five years in prison and an unlimited fine, and victims
will also be able to sue them.
</P>
<P>
The Government had come under pressure to introduce new
measures after a series of high-profile cases including a German
doctor who pursued Princess Diana for months.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Wagner, the German doctor who sparked security scares by
turning up bearing placards at Diana's private and public
engagements, was sent to a mental hospital for 28 days in March.
</P>
<P>
In July, a male stalker received a suspended sentence after
terrorizing a 13-year-old girl for l0 months and, last month, a
man was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm to a dental
nurse he subjected to an eight month campaign of intimidation in
which police recorded 200 incidents.
</P>
<P>
Under the plans, offenses included repeated telephone calls or
sending of flowers to an unwilling recipient.
</P>
<P>
Home Office minister David Maclean told BBC Radio 4: "Sending
flowers isn't a crime, but if it is persistent and causes alarm,
then powers are needed."
</P>
<P>
"The new criminal offenses would punish stalkers for the harm
they have already caused, and give the police the power to
intervene at an early stage," he added.

<P>
PESHAWAR, PAKISTAN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Afghan government
troops led by Ahmad Shah Masood have disarmed 400 of the Tajik
rebels who are based in Afghanistan and fighting against the
government of Tajikstan, said a report reaching here today.

Tajikstan.
</P>
<P>
The 400 Tajik rebels and 25 Arabs were disarmed by one of
Masood's field commander, Najamudin Wasiq, in Badakhshan province

<HEADLINE> Fighting in Eastern Zaire Forces 20,000 Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting between Zairean
troops and Banyamurenges in eastern Zaire have forced 20,000
refugees to flee their camps and the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR) to cease its activities there.
</P>
<P>
A Hercules C-130 aircraft belonging to the International
Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) came under gun fire today while it
was trying to land in Uvira, South Kivu in eastern Zaire, to send
medical equipments to a hospital run by the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was forced to turn back and returned to Goma, in
North Kivu, Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted ICRC sources in
Kinshasa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fightings erupted from Thursday night to Friday morning about
30 kilometers north of Uvira between Zairean troops and militias
of the Banyamurenges, the ethnic Tutsi people who have been living
in eastern Zaire for generations, AFP quoted a Zairean source in
Uvira as saying.
</P>
<P>
The source said that since Tuesday, tens of thousands of
"Hutu, Tutsi and Rwandan refugees" began to flee their camps
near the fighting sites over rumors of attacks. About 20,000 of
them are still fleeing, said the source.
</P>
<P>
"The infiltrators wanted to cross the low area of Rusizi to
return to the overhanging mountains of Uvira, from Burundi. They
were intercepted by the Zaireans," said the source, adding that
"fighting is still going on with light arms, grenades and
mortars."
</P>
<P>
Zaire has repeatedly accused Rwandan army of training and
arming some 3,000 Banyamurenges, and accused the latter of
infiltrating into eastern Zaire from Burundi on the vehicles of
the UNHCR for destabilizing missions.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, the UNHCR said that its staff have stopped
humanitarian activities in at least three refugee camps in eastern
Zaire because of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The fighting took place after Zaire announced this week that it
would force more than one million Rwandan refugees out of the
country before May 1997.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, most of them Hutus, fled to Zaire in July 1994
after a genocide against the Tutsis took place in Rwanda.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- World number one Peter
Sampras and number three Thomas Muster crashed out of the title
race after surprising defeats in their final group outings of the
Marlboro Tennis Championships at the Victoria Park Friday.
</P>
<P>
When taking on 51st-ranked Byron Black from Zimbabwe in the
Silver Group, American Sampras was difficult to find the
rapid-fire capability he had enjoyed in earlier matches of the
722,000 U.S. dollars event.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, the top title contender, lost the first set 6-4 in 34
minutes and conceded the second 6-2 in 31. He fired six Aces past
Black in the match, but that did not help a lot in turning the
tide.
</P>
<P>
The world's top-ranked player denied the suggestion that he had
not paid enough attention on this exhibition event.
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to play well and win every tournament, but that did
not happen today," he said.
</P>
<P>
He did not quite blame on the noice from a nearby art festival
but said the humid weather made some trouble as he felt hard to
have a tighter grasp of his racket during the match.
</P>
<P>
Muster from Australia injured his waist as he played against
Sweden's Jonas Bjorkma in the Gold Group. He won the first set
6-3, but lost the next two 6-2, 6-4 to concede the match.
</P>
<P>
The Australian had caught a cold and has been taking medicines
these days.
</P>
<P>
In the day's only other singles match, Vincent Spadea beat
fellow American Richey Reneberg 6-1, 0-6, 6-4 in one hour 23
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The victory, however, did not bring about much to Spadea.
Although the two tied with one win and one loss for each, Reneberg
came out as the group winner with higher win-loss ratio.
</P>
<P>
As the round-robin group matches came to an end, Reneberg,
Bjorkman and Black qualified for the semi-finals slated for
Saturday, together with Australia's Patrick Rafter who qualified
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The final is set for Sunday.

ISLAMABAD, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The military commander of the
ousted Afghan government Ahmad Shah Masood has called for a
ceasefire north of the Afghan capital Kabul, said reports from
Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
Wakil Ahmed Akhunzada, spokesman for the Taliban militia, said
in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar that the call for a
truce was conveyed by a delegation from northern warlord Abdul
Rashid Dostum during talks with Taliban leaders Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation sent by Dostum, who controls seven northern
provinces, is now in Kandahar, stronghold of the Taliban, for
talks with the Taliban leadership following Dostum-Taliban talks
in Mazar-i-Sharif, the headquarters of Dostum in the north.
</P>
<P>
The two rounds of talks between Dostum and the Taliban were
brokered by Pakistan, whose Interior Minister has been sent to
Afghanistan, trying to persuade the two sides to sit down and
talk.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Establish Rapid Deployment Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Greek Dfense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos announced today that an elite rapid deployment
force will be established in the country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of a strong rapid intervention force, made
up of well-trained men, and with fully-equipped firepower is
priority in the national defense ministry's planning",
Tsohatzopoulos said in an interview with the Athens afternoon
daily "Ta Nea" (the news).
</P>
<P>
He said that the men in the 1,000-3000-strong force would be
volunteers on a five-year tour of duty but would also include
conscripts after a planned restructuring of the armed forces,
aimed at making better use of manpower.
</P>
<P>
The minister also talked about other planes of the armed
forces, which are aimed at strengthening the effectiveness and
pre-emptive capability of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos said that Greece would set up two peacekeeping
units made up of between 100-200 men to take part in European
Union and United Nations missions.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the five-year (1996-2000) weapons system program,
Tsohatzopoulos said the program introducing new technologies and
weapons systems would exceed the three trillion drachma (about 13
billion U.S. dollars) mark.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's military defense diplomacy would be
strengthened not only within the framework of NATO and the Western
European Union but through bilateral defense agreements.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Greece's national strategy "is
exclusively of a defensive nature".

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner Urges Review of Ulster Peace Fund Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Commissioner for regional policies Monica Wulf-Mathies has
expressed the hope that the European Parliament would review its
proposal on cutting the special fund for the Northern Ireland
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Dublin earlier today,
Wulf-Mathies is quoted by press reports as saying, "I still hope
that parliament will review the decision of the budget committee"
on reducing the special fund.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament's budgetary committee recently voted to
reduce funding for the EU's peace initiative for Northern Ireland
and the six bordering counties of Ireland by 78 million punts
(about 125 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This would reduce the 1997 allocation for the peace process
from 125 million punts (about 200 million dollars) to 47 million
punts (75 million dollars), putting at risk dozens of schemes and
cross-border projects.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commissioner made it clear that "it is the wrong
political message. People in Northern Ireland are scared that what
they have started to establish might be ended by having no funds."
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of the political signal in a very difficult and
crucial moment of the peace process but for very practical
reasons, I hope the decision can be revised," she added.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU's budget procedure, this proposal goes for full
vote of parliament on October 24 and then to conciliation between
the parliament the Council of Ministers, which shares budgetary
authority under the co-decision process.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Taiwan's "Representation" at UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Permanent
Representative to U.N. Qin Huasun reiterated today that China
strongly opposes the so-called Taiwn's "reprepresentation" at the
United Nations advocated by a very small number of countries.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
Qin noted that representatives of a very small number of countries
openly brought up the question of the so-called Taiwan's
"representation" at the U.N. and advocated "two Chinas," "one
China, one Taiwan," and "one country, two seats" in their
statements in the general debate of the 51st session of the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people express their utmost
indignation at and strong opposition to this move which not only
tramples on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter and
General Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI), but also constitutes a
serious encroachment upon China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity and a gross interference in its internal affairs," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been an inalienable part of the Chinese territory
since ancient times. The 159 countries that have established
diplomatic relations with China so far all recognize that there is
but one China in the world and that Taiwan is an inalienable part
of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the United Nations is an inter-governmental international
organization and only sovereign states are entitled to the
membership of the U.N., Taiwan, a province of China, has no
qualifications whatsoever to join the U.N., he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the excuses about "split the country and rule under separate
regimes," he stressed whatever change that is made to the way in
which leaders of Taiwan are produced cannot change the fact that
Taiwan is a part of China and that Taiwan's leaders are leaders of
a region of China.
</P>
<P>
Any attempts by the Taiwan authorities to "join the U.N." are
in the final analysis aimed at splitting China, creating "two
Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan" and "Taiwan independence," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Should the Taiwan authorities continue to carry out activities
aimed at splitting China, there are bound to be tensions in the
Taiwan Straits, posing a threat to peace, stability and
development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
As a few members of the European Parliament brought up in last
July a resolution on the so-called "Taiwan's role in international
organizations," openly advocating Taiwan's participation in U.N.,
he said, "This is an attempt to deliberately undermine the
friendly relations between China and Europe, in disregard of the
basic norms governing international relations and in violation of
the principles on the establishment of diplomatic relations
between European countries and China."
</P>
<P>
"It is the lofty mission and common aspiration of the entire
Chinese people including the Taiwan compatriots as well as an
irresistible historical trend to end the state of separation
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits and accomplish the
grand cause of national reunification of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Taiwan authorities to desist from secessionist
activities not only in words but also in deeds. "Only in this way
can dialogue between the two sides of the Straits be resumed and
relations between the two sides develop normally."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Staffs Cease Work in Zairean Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the U.N.
Secretary-General confirmed the fleeing of thousands of refugees
from a camp near the eastern Zairean on Friday after fighting
between the Zairean military and a group of armed men from
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Fawzi, deputy spokesman for the Secretary-General, said
at a noon briefing that the alleged infiltration of armed men into
Zaire from Burundi last night prompted UNHCR staff in Uvira to
cease their work today in at least three camps.
</P>
<P>
There was an exchange of small arms and automatic weapons fire
as Zairian troops encountered the armed group, Fawzi said.
</P>
<P>
He said during the fighting on Sunday, four refugees on Runingo
camp were killed, and the majority of the 18,900 Rwandan and
Burundi refugees fled the camp as a result.
</P>
<P>
There's no movement in Biriba and Kagunga camps, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he had no further details, but according to
reports of the western media, over the past week, dozens have died
and aid workers and diplomats fear the fighting could precipitate
a wider regional conflict involving Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Both Rwandan and Burundian refugees languish in camps north
of Uvira, a town in the delta to the north west of Lake
Tanganyika surrounded by steep hills.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Parastatals Threaten Economy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe may soon drift into a
debt trap unless urgent steps are taken to improve the poor
performance of various parastatals, Chief Secretary to the Office
of the President and Cabinet Charles Utete said today.
</P>
<P>
Closing a three-day business retreat for over 30 heads of
government ministries, Utete said the poor performance of public
enterprises is threatening to disrupt progress in the
implementation of the country's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said the accumulated huge losses and guaranteed loans
incurred by public enterprises are deepening the country's debt
crisis, denying essential social sectors adequate resources to
operate effectively.
</P>
<P>
''If not urgently addressed, the poor performance of these
bodies will plunge the economy into a debt trap,'' he said,
pointing out that a clear program with a time-frame for
commercialization and privatization needed to be put in place.
</P>
<P>
On the need to improve government revenue generation, Utete
said short and long term revenue restoration measures must be
undertaken to complement expenditure reduction efforts.
</P>
<P>
Such revenue restoration measures include reviewing of fees
and charges for all government services with a view to charging
economic prices, he said, adding, ''i am informed that a draft of
the value added tax proposals is nearing completion.''

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The volume of import and
export handled by the National Shipping Agencies Company (NASACO)
of Tanzania between January to September this year declined to
2.53 million tons from 3.06 tons in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The local paper Daily News quoted NASACO Managing Director
David Lwimbo as saying here today that the traffic level has
really fallen and the company is losing sizeable revenue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decline in the cargo handled by NASACO was
not confined to the port of Dar es Salaam, but also in the ports
of Mtwara and Tanga.
</P>
<P>
The managing director attributed the decline to diversion of
traffic from Dar es Salaam port to the ports in Mozambique and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He added that the current trade embargo imposed on landlocked
Burundi has also affected the traffic flow.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the Great Lakes region have slapped economic
sanctions against Burundi following a military coup in July which
toppled the government led by Sylvestre Ntibatunganya.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Appeals for IMF Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today urged the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to provide financial assistance to his country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told visiting IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus
that the IMF help is needed to bolster South Africa's foreign
exchange reserves and to protect the local currency of Rand from
speculations.
</P>
<P>
"If we want assistance they must be convinced that our
monetary policy complies with the guidelines which they have
set," said Mandela, adding that he was personally convinced that
the IMF guidelines were "very good".
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, who arrived here on Thursday for his first official
visit to South Africa, gave full support to the government's
recently-released macro-economic plan, saying the IMF was at the
disposal of the South African government to help implement it.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said the greatest challenge facing South Africa was the
unacceptable level of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The IMF boss also held talks with South Africa's Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Reserve
Bank Governor Chris Stals.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Inaugurates Law of Sea Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today inaugurated the
International Tribunal for the law of the Sea in Hamburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
In a swearing-in ceremony of 21 judges from various countries,
the U.N. Chief called the establishment of the Tribunal "a truly
historic event" as it dedicated to resolve disputes relating to
seas, oceans and on the seafloor-- a jurisdiction covering almost
75 percent of the surface of the planet.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that "the Tribunal will be a modern
institution upholding the rule of law not only between states but
also among states, the international seabed authority, companies
and individuals engaged in the exploitation of the international
seabed area.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal is set up following the adoption of the Law of the
Sea Convention by member states of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the Secretary-General, the new organ has special
competence to prescribe provisional measures when the ocean
environment is seriously threatened.
</P>
<P>
"Because maritime disputes can be a source of confrontation and
conflict between states, the tribunal has a important role to play
in the building of an international society governed by the rule
of law." he added.
</P>
<P>
Though not an organ of the United Nations, the Tribunal will be
part of the system for the peaceful settlement of disputes among
nations and parties involved.
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration, the Secretary-General also laid a
foundation stone of the building that is to house the Tribunal.

<HEADLINE> Children of Single Mothers Have More Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Children of single mothers are
more likely to exhibit problems ranging from threatening others to
hyperactivity, according to a survey by Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
One in six of these children experience problems including
depression, anxiety, physical aggression and difficulties getting
along at home or school. One in nine repeat a grade at school, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
At present, almost 15 percent of Canadian children under 12
live in a house headed by a single mother.
</P>
<P>
Some of the problems might be explained by poverty, as about 56
percent of single-mother families are poor compared to only about
12 percent of two-parent families.
</P>
<P>
However, the study also found that even in families that did
not have a low income, children of single mothers still have more
problems that two parent families.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to say whether the problems are caused by living in
household headed by a single mother, or because of the emotional
trauma suffered as a result of family breakups," one social worker
was quoted as saying by a local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
Many children feel guilty about the breakup, and some have
conflicts with their mother's new husband or boyfriend, she added.
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, more Canadian children will encounter
these and other problems, as more than 40 percent of today's
children are expected to experience the breakup of their parents'
relationship, the paper predicted.

NAIROBI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today rejected the American idea of forming an African crisis
response force to solve various conflicts in the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the Kenyatta University here today, Moi
pointed out that the idea, proposed by the United States
Secretary of State Warren Christopher who concluded his
five-nation Africa tour a few days ago, would not be a right
solution to the conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the problems facing Africans today arise from their
refusal to abide by their age-old system of moral principles,"
said Moi, explaining that the idea borrowed from other parts of
the world may not suit the practical situation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan was also "coolly" received in other African
countries, together with some European nations including France.

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Monitors Condemn Wounding of Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 18 (Xinhua) -- After a "Marathon" meeting in a
south Lebanese border town, a multinational cease-fire monitoring
group held this afternoon the Jewish state responsible for the
bombing and wounding of 13 south Lebanese civilians last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the United States, France, Lebanon, Syria
and Israel, who make up the cease-fire monitoring committee,
ended a 19-hour meeting this morning in the U.N. peacekeeping
forces headquarters in Naqoura.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up by a cease-fire understanding reached
between Lebanon and Israel on April 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In a verdict issued in the afternoon, the committee "condemned
the wounding of civilians in Safad Al-Batikh" on October 11, and
stressed that "it was the Israeli artillery which caused the
mentioned woundings and damages."
</P>
<P>
The verdict put an end to trade of accusations between the
Lebanese delegate on the one side and the Israeli delegate on the
other since Monday, when the committee held its first meeting to
consider a complaint filed by Lebanon against the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"The monitoring group held non-stop meetings from October 14
to 18 to look into the complaint lodged by Lebanon against
Israel, accusing it of violating the April 26 understanding," the
verdict said.
</P>
<P>
"According to the Lebanese complaint, the Israeli forces
bombarded the village of Safad Al-Batikh, wounding 13 civilians,
including four seriously, and damaging four houses and networks
of electricity, water and telephone," the verdict noted.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Israeli representative expressed its regret
over the wounding and damage, but stressed that it was an
"unintentional" result of self-defense against a mortar attack
launched by guerrillas of the Lebanese Pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
</P>
<P>
military members of the monitoring committee carried out
"fact-finding missions" at Safad Al-Batikh and the Israeli
artillery position from where Israeli troops fired at the
village, according to the verdict.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the results of the fact-finding missions, the
group affirmed that it was the Israeli artillery which caused the
mentioned wounding and damage," it said.
</P>
<P>
It warned Lebanese guerrillas not to launch military
operations from near areas resided by civilians, and held the
Israeli forces responsible for the formula it used against
Lebanese armed groups.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was immediately welcomed by the Lebanese
government, and a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry
described the verdict as "objective."
</P>
<P>
According to the April 26 understanding, Israel and Hezbollah
are committed to ensuring that under no circumstances will
civilians be the target of attack or will civilian areas be the
launching ground for attacks.
</P>
<P>
But it allows Hezbollah to attack Israeli occupation forces in
south Lebanon and allows Israel "the right of self-defense"
</P>
<P>
Israel established a 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer to shield its northern Jewish
settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks. The zone is
routinely patrolled by Israeli troops and their allied South
Lebanon Army militiamen.

LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Irish police have uncovered a
suspected Irish Republican Army (IRA) arms cache during a joint
army-police action close to the border with Northern Ireland,
according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
An Irish police spokesman was quoted as saying earlier today in

ammunition and some bomb-making equipment" near Hackballscross in
County Monaghan.

Last month Irish police found a store of mortar tubes, the most
favored weapon of the IRA guerrillas, but it was not known if the
two findings were connected, the spokesman said.
</P>

The latest arms discovery was the third in six months and the
IRA is thought to have up to 100 tons of arms, ammunition and
explosives concealed in underground bunkers in Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sees Record Trade Surplus in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's trade surplus jumped to
a record monthly high of 4.0 billion Canadian dollars (2.952
billion U.S. dollars) in August due to booming exports to the
United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada said today that Canada's exports rose 2.7
percent in August to a record 23.2 billion Canadian dollars
(17.122 billion U.S. dollars), while imports slid by 2.7
percent to 19.1 billion dollars (27.466 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Car sales and revived sales of grain and other agricultural
products led the way to robust growth, the federal fact-gathering
agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, sluggish domestic demand for machinery,
industrial goods and auto parts played major roles in the decrease
of the imports.
</P>
<P>
"Export strength and import slippage resulted in the largest
trade surplus on record," the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
"The United States accounted for most of the increase, but
trade with partners other than Japan also made a contribution," it
added.
</P>
<P>
Canada's trade surplus has been rising steadily as a proportion
of the gross domestic product. It stood at 4.5 percent in the
second quarter of this year, compared with 0.5 percent in 1991,
the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Unveils Balanced Budget in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Finance Minister
Abdullatif Sener today unveiled a balanced 1997 draft budget at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget forecasts GNP to be 6.255 quadrillion Turkish
liras (658.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The draft said that consolidated budget expenditures and
revenues would be equal to each other; i.e. the budget deficit
will be zero.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government forecasts the 1997 year-on-year
wholesale inflation to be 57.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since the economic crisis of 1994 when the economy shrunk by 6
percent and the IMF-backed austerity plan of that year, the growth
rate for 1995 was 8 percent and in 1996 estimated as 7.5

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Jien Gong, a wildlife
manager who studied the endangered panda in Sichuan Province,
Southwest China, may become the first in his department to own
a foreign academic degree.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Lehnhoff, who will complete his one-year study in
natural resource economics and policy, said that his experience in
the United States will help him do his job better as one of the
environmental policy makers in his country, Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
These are among 33 people and institutions receiving grants,
scholarships and fellowships from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)'s
Russell Train Education for Nature Program. Launched in 1994, it
is the only scholarship and grant program designed to support
study and research within the developing countries and help
develop local institutions.
</P>
<P>
"The single greatest stumbling block in both the development
and the implementation of conservation projects worldwide is the
lack of trained natural resource managers," said Russell Train,
founder of the WWF, the world's largest private conservation
organization known worldwide by its panda logo.
</P>
<P>
"Education is at the heart of meeting conservation goals," Dr.
Molly Teas, director of the program, said. "This investment will
enable more people and institutions to develop conservation
programs suited to their unique needs."
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Teas, students, conservationists and
institutions in developing countries are welcomed to participate
in the program, and a five-member group will evaluate each of the
applications.
</P>
<P>
Several of this year's scholarship winners are supported by a
donation from Duracell International Inc. -- the program's first
corporate sponsor. A 600,000 U.S. dollar grant from the alkaline
battery giant focuses on candidates in the developing world where
it has business interests, including China, India and Brazil.

<HEADLINE> US Says Not in Position to Confirm DPRK Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
said today that it could not confirm an imminent missile test by
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), but it expressed
its concerns over any possible test.
</P>
<P>
"I am not in a position to confirm that North Korea has
launched a missile test or launched a missile as a test," State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Burns has repeated the U.S. position on the DPRK's possible
missile test for the past three days running, saying it would be
harmful to the stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"Should North Korea undertake such a missile test, it would be
destabilizing. It would be harmful to our efforts to provide
stability in the Korean Peninsula. The United States would very
much be opposed to this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the United States has sent an advanced
reconnaissance plane to monitor the possible imminent test which
was said to fire a medium-range ballistic missile into seas just
off the Japanese coast.
</P>
<P>
An official from Japan's Self-Defense Agency said that a U.S.
reconnaissance satellite had confirmed the DPRK had moved a launch
platform for the Rodong-1 missile.
</P>
<P>
Burns told reporters that the United States had contacted the
DPRK very recently and expressed "clearly" its opposition to the
possible missile test.
</P>
<P>
"We have conveyed a very strong message to the North Koreans
that they ought not to undertake such a test," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports here also said that the DPRK had already canceled the
missile test or might cancel the test after U.S. officials
contacted DPRK officials, possibly in the United Nations in New
York.
</P>
<P>
But Burns avoided making an explicit answer to reporters who
asked him to give a clear answer over the issue.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Plans to Privatize Shareholding Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 18 (Xinhua) -- To further speed up the
privatization program, the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) is
considering plans to privatize some of the main closed
shareholding companies which are not registered in the stock
market, an official of the authority said today.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the authority Al-Rashid Al-Badr told the
official Kuwait News Agency that preliminary studies were under
way to privatize the companies such as the Public Transport
Company, Kuwait International Fair Company and Food and
Agricultural Company.
</P>
<P>
He said the state owns large amounts of shares, sometimes
reaching 100 percent in closed shareholding companies including
the above three.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that this is a new step to be taken by
the KIA, the only official investment managing body in the
country, to quicken the process of the privatization program
which started in 1994 with the aim of selling stakes in some 60
companies worth about 800 million dinars (2.64 billion
U.S. dollars) by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The KIA has so far sold 500 million dinars (1.65 billion
dollars) worth of state shares, including more than 60 millions
dinars (198 million dollars) through the stock market and the
rest by auction or tenders.
</P>
<P>
Badr said so far the KIA has fulfilled the implementation of
the privatization program, taking the market situation and the
investors interests and readiness into consideration.
</P>
<P>
On future privatization steps, Badr said market prices for
more than 20 registered local companies in which the government
owns more than 50 percent of the assets were estimated at one
billion dinars (3.3 billion dollars) and it is hoped that the
privatization of these companies would be completed by the end of
1998, depending on the market and investors.
</P>
<P>
Badr said some of the closed companies belong to the service
sector.
</P>
<P>
The KIA was set up in Kuwait as a government agent to manage
state funds, including the State General Reserve Fund and
Reserve Fund of Future Generations. The state acquired most of
the shares in companies now being privatized by the KIA in the
1970s and 1980s when the local share market was faced with
collapse and the government intervened to support the economy.
</P>
<P>
Now, government-owned shares of less than 10 percent are
usually sold directly through the market while companies with
bigger shares are sold through public tenders or auctions.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government says it also aims to sell stakes in
major utilities such as telecommunications, electricity and
water, but no specific sales in these infrastructural fields
have been conducted so far.
</P>
<P>
Badr said the KIA and the World Bank would organize a seminar
in December to assess privatization and its effect on the local
market, the Stock Market and concerned companies and prospects
for their development.

WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
expressed its "very deep concern" about the new developments in
Belarus and called on Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko
to "enter immediately into constitutions."
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, at a news
briefing, accused Lukashenko of attempting to split Belarus.
</P>
<P>
"By declaring his unwillingness to work with parliament,
President Lukashenko appears to be on a course that would further
split Belarus," Burns told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that the Belarussian people are being asked to
choose sides in a dispute between the president and parliament
over a proposed referendum that, he said, "would build in
far-reaching constitutional changes into the Belarussian political
system."
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed constitution under consideration "would
fail to provide any semblance of separation of powers, protection
of individual freedom or rule of law," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"We call on President Lukashenko to enter immediately into
consultations with the leadership in parliament to find a
compromise that protects basic human rights, the democratic
process and fundamental freedoms and avoids violence," added the
U.S. State Department spokesman.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq Rolf Ekeus arrived here
today for talks with the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N chief inspector is not available for any comment on his
current tour, which is the routine one within every two months
under a joint statement he reached with the Iraqi side in June
this year.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus' visit to Iraq defused a confrontation between
U.N. inspectors and the Iraqi government. Earlier, the U.N
inspectors were denied access to what Iraq termed as sensitive
military bases.
</P>
<P>
However, an unidentified source said that Ekeus' talks with
the Iraqis are believed to concentrate on Iraq's missile
area.
</P>
<P>
Before his arrival, he said he will verify Iraq's claim that
it has destroyed 85 long-range missiles which are prohibited by
the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's biological and chemical weapons program also remains
the major concern of the U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Iraq has been
suffering from sweeping U.N. sanctions for more than six
years.
</P>
<P>
It must acquire verification from UNSCOM that it no longer
possesses weapons of mass destruction before the sanctions are
hopefully to be removed.

Nasirullah Babar said today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen at Nowshera in Pakistan's North West

the Taliban and Dostum who has forged an alliance with Masood in
the face of the Taliban's offensive northwards.
</P>
<P>
"It is a big achievement to get agreed different factions to
sit together and initiate a serious dialogue to bring peace and
reconciliation which seemed impossible a few weeks back", he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that his peace mission would lead to
grand reconciliation and a broad-based government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Babar also said that there are acute shortages of food,
medicine and clothing in Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said people in Kabul would be exposed to the rigor of the
coming winter.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Although last-minute change
of schedule caused some trouble, American Vincent Spadea managed
to replace sick compatriot Richey Reneberg and won a final berth
of the Marlboro Championships Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Spadea, 65th-ranked in the world, rallied to beat Jonas
Bjorkman of Sweden, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 in his semi-final.
</P>
<P>
He will meet Australia's Patrick Rafter, who defeated Byron
Black from Zimbabwe 6-2, 5-7, 6-3 in the other semi-final Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Spadea, who had failed to qualify for the final, had prepared
to leave for home this evening. But sudden stomach-ache forced
Reneberg to quit the semi-finals and Spadea was informed at noon
to replace.
</P>
<P>
Totally unprepared, Spadea lost the first set to Bjorkman,
ranked 56th in the world.
</P>
<P>
Switching to a more speedy game featuring power serves and
passing shots, Spadea won the two following sets to qualify for
the final.
</P>
<P>
Spadea fired eight aces past Bjorkman who got only two.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, ranked 61st in the world, won the first set with no
trouble, but lost the second when the 51st-ranked Zimbabwean took
an upper hand with fierce forehand drive shots.
</P>
<P>
The Australian ace had to resort to every ounce of energy to
win the third and decisive game.
</P>
<P>
Rafter fired 15 sces against just one by Black.
</P>
<P>
The final of the 722,000 U.S. dollar event is set for Sunday
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rejects Normalization of Cultural Ties with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk
Hosni has rejected the possibility of normalizing cultural ties
with Israel before the realization of a just peace in the region
and the restoration of the Arab right.
</P>
<P>
Hosni made the statement in an interview with London-based
Arabic-language newspaper "Al Hayat," which was carried by the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Describing the cultural normalization as a trump card in hand,
the minister said "time is not ripe yet to abandon the card." "It
is deferred," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hosni said peace is a strategic option for Egypt, and the
accusation that he is anti-peace is not true. He said he is
committed to the Egyptian policy in this field.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Israel have been time and again at loggerheads over
some bilateral issues and the Middle East peace process, although
Egypt spearheaded the Arab-Israeli reconciliation and made peace
with the Jewish state in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The minister denied that his rejection of the cultural tie
normalization is motivated by fear of the impact of the Israeli
culture.
</P>
<P>
He said the culture of Egypt, which commands world-wide and
influence and respect, will be undaunted by and invulnerable from
anyone.
</P>
<P>
Hosni said he has turned down an invitation for him to visit
Israel and rejected inviting his Israeli counterpart to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has made it clear that he
would not meet Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu until
Israel and the Palestinian Authority reached agreement on troops
redeployment from Hebron, the last West Bank town still under
Israeli occupation.

<P>
LANZHOU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
is expected to rewrite its grain output record this year, despite
a number of natural disasters in earlier months.
</P>
<P>
Provincial agricultural officials have estimated this year's
grain output at 7.5 billion kg, over 50 million kg more than the
record high reported in 1993.
</P>
<P>
An increased government financial input, which was 144 million
yuan (about 17.3 million US dollars) more than last year, is a
major element behind the anticipated bumper harvest, the officials
explained. State bank loans for the farming sector also rose by
21.8 percent from last year to 2.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The spread of the use of plastic sheeting and scientific
training among farmers also helped to boost Gansu's grain output
this year, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Gansu was hit by a grave drought, floods and
hail.

ISLAMABAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Uzbek militia led
by Rashid Dostum today denied their involvement in the fighting
against the Taliban militia.

<P>
A report coming from Dostum's headquarters Mazar-i-Sharif in

Dostum is expecting a decision on Sunday from the Taliban on

Previous reports from Bagram said that the airbase fell to the

The official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported today that
Iraq's permanent representative Nizar Hamdoon said in a letter to
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali that two Kuwaiti

<HEADLINE> China's Yellow River-Control Draws Wide Notice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River, though known
as the Cradle of Chinese Civilization, has been a dangerous force
which caused tremendous losses to the Chinese people for thousands
of years.
</P>
<P>
However, in the past 50 years, the river has brought fortune to
the country, thanks to the efforts of the Chinese government and
people to harness it.
</P>
<P>
China's success in curbing the rampant river has drawn much
attention from foreigners: hundreds of thousands of overseas
experts, officials and tourists have visited the Yellow River
Museum since it was re-opened in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee
recently told Xinhua that more and more foreign experts are
interested in the subject. Between 1988 and mid-1996, over 500
overseas experts had approached the committee for research
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the committee has launched 22
international cooperative projects on anti-flooding and water
conservancy, and has received 280 million US dollars in donations
and loans from overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to some Chinese experts, harnessing the Yellow River
is viewed worldwide as being technologically difficult, requiring
international, joint efforts for success.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a large number of foreign experts are working on the
Xiaolangdi Hydropower Project, which has been contracted by three
international consortiums.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Labor Export, Pillar of Bangladeshi Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The export of manpower has become
a pillar economic sector of Bangladesh, one of the world's least
developed countries with a population of about 120 million.
</P>
<P>
To deal with an increasing glut of manpower in Bangladesh, the
government has been encouraging local people to work abroad.
Since 1977, both the number of workers going abroad and the amount
of their remittance sent back home have increased markedly.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, about 200,000 skilled and
unskilled Bangladeshi workers are currently working in a number of
countries and they bring back more than 50 billion taka (about
1.25 billion US dollars) earnings annually. The figures for 1976
showed that there were only 6,000 workers and a total remittance
of 358.5 million taka (nine million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The country's labor export grew by 2.68 percent in the first 10
months of 1995 compared with the corresponding 1994 period when
the figure stood at 199,925.
</P>
<P>
The remittance sent home by Bangladeshi workers abroad in the
first nine months of 1995 rose by 6.96 percent as compared with
the same period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The figures are increasing this year, officials at the Ministry
of Labor and Manpower said.
</P>
<P>
While trying hard to maintain its old labor markets in Middle
East countries, Bangladesh is also turning to those countries
whose economies are growing fast -- like Malaysia, South Korea and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
There were 32,288 Bangladeshi contract workers in Malaysia by
the end of October 1995.
</P>
<P>
But Saudi Arabia remains the largest market for Bangladesh's
manpower export. The Middle East country had received a total of
68,818 Bangladeshi laborers by last October.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the manpower export, the Bangladeshi government
has set up special agencies under the Ministry of Labor and
Manpower to help those who wish to work abroad as contract
laborers.
</P>
<P>
In a related effort, the government launched a pilot scheme in
1993 to provide local poor people with bank loans to help them pay
for the service charges and air tickets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a training school -- the Singapore-Bangladesh
Training Corporation -- has been set up in Dhaka to train
unskilled local manpower for export. Foreign instructors
including some from Singapore have been invited to train
Bangladeshi laborers.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, not every Bangladeshi worker wishing to go abroad
could work as a contract laborer and many have chosen to go
illegally.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Malaysia has complained that illegal
Bangladeshi migrants, their number ranging from 10,000 to 40,000,
are hiding in the jungles of Thailand waiting for their chance to
cross into Malaysia to seek jobs.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi authorities are challenging the figures, but they
admit that many Bangladeshis staying in Malaysia do not carry
legal documents with them. Some were detained during the
crack-down on illegal foreign immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The same problem exists in Saudi Arabia, which sends back
thousands of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants every year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the issue of illegal Bangladeshi migrant workers,
Bangladeshi authorities will by no means slow down the manpower
export. Consultations are going on with labor recipient countries
to try to find proper solutions to the problem.

<HEADLINE> Stock Market Booms in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Stock market in Kuwait has
experienced a boom for the past two weeks, according to a
specialized economic published here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report by authoritative specialized economic firm Al-Shaal
said that the share prices in Kuwait surpassed estimates made by
the companies registered in the bourse.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, trading boomed in the Kuwaiti stock
market, and the volume of trade at the Kuwait Stock Exchange
Market set a post-Gulf War record -- more than 1.6 billion shares
were traded, 53 percent up from the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The value of trade rose by 60 percent to 325 million Kuwait
dinars (1.072 billion U.S. dollars). The bourse price index rose
by 73.6 points compared to the closing rate at 1855.7 points in
the previous week.
</P>
<P>
An increase in demands for shares amid expectations that new
investment funds are to be created and the possibility of amending
the hard debts law in the country have contributed to the
unprecedented high share prices.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaal, however, urged government officials to watch the
situation carefully to avoid a sudden surge in share prices in the
market, which might have a future adverse effect. But it failed to
elaborate what the adverse effect might be in the future.

<P>
TEHRAN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,500 Iraqi Kurdish
refugees returned home from different camps in border areas of
Iran's northwestern province of West Azarbaijan, an official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Qasem Hassan-Nejad from the Red Crescent Society said that
these refugees returned home voluntarily due to cold weather and
relative security established in some regions in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that more Iraqi refugees will probably leave camps
for their country in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Despite cold weather and shortage of fuel, Iran is still
providing humanitarian aid to some 30,000 Iraqi Kurdish
refugees, according to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish refugees fled northern Iraqi regions to the Iranian
border region following the assault jointly launched by Iraqi
troops and Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). Since then they
have been settled in different refugee camps in Iranian border
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities claimed that more than 65,000 Iraqi
Kurdish refugees have been sheltered in different camps in the
border region.
</P>
<P>
However, some U.N. organizations said that their estimation
was 40,000 in total.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Afghan Government Troops Recapture Airbase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The ousted Afghan government
troops led by Ahmad Shah Masood have seized Bagram airbase north
of Kabul again, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources from the frontline as saying that
Masood's troops captured the airbase, 50 kilometers north of
Kabul, from the hands of the Taliban Militia late Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed Masood's victory mainly to the support of
the Afghan Uzbek militia led by Rashid Dostum who had joined hands
with Masood last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Uzbek militia dug into firm positions on the hills near
Charikar, capital of Parwan province which is 65 kilometers north
of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Dostum's men also placed heavy weapons on the hills which
overlook Bagram airbase, the biggest military and civilian airport
in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The airbase fell after an intensive fighting between the
Taliban and Masood's troops who appeared to get artillery cover
from the Uzbek militia on the hills.
</P>
<P>
The re-taking of Bagram by Masood's forces came after days of
intense fighting in the area which saw the airbase change hands
three times in four days.
</P>
<P>
Masood's men had captured the airbase on Tuesday but were
routed by the Taliban which recaptured the airbase on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest report coming from the frontline said that Masood's
forces today pushed 20 kilometers south of Bagram airbase and
prepared for an offensive on Kabul which fell to the Taliban on
September.

<P>
KUNMING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China plans to introduce a hotel
booking system that will enable tourists to book rooms and air
tickets from a number of different, mostly travel-related
locations throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The "China Tianma Hotel Sales System," to become operational in
January, 1997, will use the Asiasat 2 Satellite to eventually link
up computer terminals in major hotels, airports, ports, railway
stations, airlines, travel agencies, large department stores and
major tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
China has over 340 hotels with three-star or higher ratings,
located in 130 cities. Till now, tourists mainly referred to
travel advertisements to make their room reservations.
</P>
<P>
The new system will for the first time link these hotels to a
unified market.
</P>
<P>
Businesses included in the hospitality industries in Australia,
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and countries in Europe
and the US have shown interest in entering the network, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The system is jointly funded by the Tianma Industry Corporation
under the China National Tourism Administration, the Yunnan
Yingmao Tobacco Telecommunication Corporation and the Beijing
Zhongshengxinda Investment Planning Co. Ltd., with a total
investment of 40-45 million US dollars.

</P>
<P>
"I adapted myself in the last two sets and I did stand to the
end though I got a cramp in my legs," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The world No. 36 Testud broke Chen in the opening game to take
a 3-1 lead but Chen fought back to a 5-4. Testud then broke Chen

Chen, in her top form, took upper hand in the second set to tie
the score.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The People's Assistance Organ,
a non-governmental organization in Norway, will step up the
clearance of mines in Angola by using more police dogs.
</P>
<P>
Havard Bach, leader of the mine-clearing team of the organ,
told newsmen here today that five to 10 more police dogs will be
brought here soon to reinforce the original five in the work of
clearing 10 million mines in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
These well-trained dogs have built up experience in tapping
mines in Mozambique, Bach said.
</P>
<P>
He said his organ will buy more sophisticated mine-sweeping
equipment and will have trained 300 Angolan engineers by
February, 1997 to intensify the work of sweeping mines in
northern Angola.
</P>
<P>
The main roads in central Angola have been ridden of mines at
present and the work will spread to other areas, Bach said.
</P>
<P>
Funded by Norway, Sweden, Demark, the U.S. and the U.N., this
Norwegian organ has been working to remove about 60 varieties of
mines planted during nearly 20 years of civil war since the
country became independent from Portugal in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Rybkin Pledges to Continue Peaceful Chechen Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's new national security
chief Ivan Rybkin said today that he would continue the efforts of
a peaceful settlement in Chechnya, according to the Itar-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin, who was appointed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin
earlier today as secretary of the Security Council and the
president's special envoy in Chechnya, told the news agency that
the Khasavyurt peace accord, signed by dismissed national security
chief Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist leaders in August
must not be revised.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin issued two decrees earlier today appointing 50-year-old
Rybkin, who was speaker of the State Duma (lower house of the
Russian parliament) in 1993-1995, to his new posts.
</P>
<P>
He has been until today the chairman of the Political
Consultative Council under the Russian president.
</P>
<P>
The president dismissed Lebed on Thursday from his posts of
Security Council secretary and the presidential national security
aide.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Itar-Tass following his new
appointments, Rybkin said: "I think very difficult work has been
done, and it should be persistently continued by joint efforts."
He was referring to the solution to the Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
Pledging to "keep continuity" in the Security Council's work
toward a Chechen settlement, Rybkin said he is planning a trip to
Chechnya.
</P>

PARIS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Former world hour record holder
and pursuit world champion Graeme Obree said Saturday he plans to
retire, largely because of the widespread use of banned drugs in
the sport.
</P>
<P>
Scotsman Obree said he would probably end his cylcing career
after the track event in Geneva on October 29.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons he was quitting was because many riders were
using drugs, especially erythropoietin (EPO), a substance that
stimulates the production of red blood cells which transport
oxygen around the body, he said.

The Scot, who jumped to fame in track cycling on a home-built

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Economy Turns for Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SHENYANG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The overall economic situation
in northeast China's Liaoning Province, which has a great
concentration of old state-owned enterprises, is improving,
economic indicators show.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates put Liaoning's full-year grain output at 16.5
million tons, 2.25 million tons more than last year, or the second
largest in history.
</P>
<P>
Industrial enterprises throughout the province reported an
incremental value of 83.55 billion yuan (about 10 billion US
dollars) in the first nine months, a year-on-year rise of 9.8
percent. They racked up a net loss of 270 million yuan in the
January-June period, but harvested a profit of 550 million yuan by
August.
</P>
<P>
The provincial retail price index was up 5.9 percent in the
first three quarters, 9.5 percentage points lower than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning's total exports between January and September reached
5.83 billion US dollars, and foreign investment rose 28.3 percent
to 1.01 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Though contradictions and problems still exist in great numbers,
the economic performance in the first nine months shows that
Liaoning's economy is bottoming out anyway, a provincial official
said.

<HEADLINE> Tests Suggest TWA Crash Caused by Mechanical Malfunction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Officials investigating the
crash of TWA Flight 800 said today that metallurgical tests
conducted on wreckage suggested the July 17 crash was a result of
a malfunction and not caused by an explosive device.
</P>
<P>
National Transportation Safety Board officials said metal
recovered from the wreckage did not reveal that a bomb blew up the
jet but they were not yet ready to make a determination of
mechanical malfunction.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-bound place exploded shortly after taking off from
the New York John F. Kennedy International Airport, killing all
230 people on board.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said late today that detailed analyses of debris
from the center fuel tank showed damage patterns indicating a
slower, less energetic explosion than that produced by a bomb or a
missile.
</P>
<P>
With more than 80 percent of the fuel tank and 90 percent of
the total plane recovered so far, investigators said the way in
which much of the metal from the tank was bent, rather than
shattered or pulverized, was consistent with a "low order"
explosion or one that had less velocity and force than a bomb or
missile detonation.
</P>
<P>
Investigators also said that tests had shown that parts of the
center fuel tank were blown in an outward direction, indicating
the blast occurred somewhere inside it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an NBC news report said that just before the plane
exploded, pilots were trying to transfer fuel from one side of the
plane to the other to correct a fuel weight imbalance.
</P>
<P>
But investigators have yet to determine whether the imbalance
played a role in the crash.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board said the transfer of
fuel is a routine function carried out by pilots to improve a
plane's balance and efficiency.

<HEADLINE> GCC Chief Optimistic over Bahrain's Participation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil Al-Hujailan said
today he was optimistic that his Gulf tour would succeed in
"ending the issue of Bahrain's participation in the forthcoming
GCC Summit."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks before he left Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh
for Doha, the capital of Qatar, to start the Gulf tour which will
also take him to Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait,
according to Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hujailan's tour comes in line with GCC efforts to convince
Bahrain to attend the regional organization's summit scheduled to
be held in December.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general held talks with Bahraini Emir Sheikh Isa
Bin Suleiman Al-Khalifa during a visit to Bahrain on October 14.
He is expected to hold talks in Doha with Qatari Emir Sheikh
Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
He said "the GCC leaders are eager to solve the issue in a
brotherly atmosphere to stop an unprecedented event since the
establishment of the council in 1981."
</P>
<P>
Al-Hujailan said during his meeting with the Bahraini emir,
he sensed a true response that Sheikh Isa was "eager to end all
lingering issues."
</P>
<P>
He said Sheikh Isa praised all efforts aimed at consolidating
the GCC ranks, stressing that his country believes in the
GCC role to boost the Gulf joint work and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hujailan expressed his hope that Bahrain would attend the GCC
summit in the Qatar capital in December.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain had informed the GCC foreign ministerial meeting in
held in Riyadh last month that it would not attend the GCC leaders'
annual meeting, but stressed that it was not boycotting the GCC
activities.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain had reiterated its call to develop the Saudi
mediation in the Qatari-Bahraini dispute to the level of an
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Qatar had expressed readiness to withdraw the dispute case
from the International Court of Justice. Saudi Arabia has been
mediating between the two GCC member countries to solve their
border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Qatar have been locked in the border dispute over a
number of islands which Bahrain has controlled since 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Qatar unilaterally asked the International Court of Justice
in 1991 to settle the problem. But Bahrain had refused to accept
the jurisdiction of the court.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Attend Cairo Economic Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
will lead a high-level delegation to the Third Middle East and
North Africa economic conference to be held here next month.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation also includes Minister of Planning
and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath, Minister of Trade and
Economy Maher Masri and a number of businessmen, according to the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The many difficulties facing the troubled Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks have originally provoked some suspicion of a
Palestinian boycott of the Cairo conference, in protest against
what they call the Israeli intransigence on renegotiating the
previous peace accord on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Egypt proposed to postpone the conference until next
autumn because of "changes in the political climate" since the
Likud party victory in the Israeli elections in May.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt changed its mind when it found the positive results,
if the conference is convened, would outweigh the negative
aspects, according to Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Ahmed
Abu el-Kheir.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has said earlier this month
the Cairo conference is just an economic event instead of a summit
and that it would not cater to Israel.
</P>
<P>
A number of senior officials from other countries also declared
their participation in the economic conference slated for November
12-14.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Secretary of
Trade Micky Cantor will head a 300-strong business delegation to
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli delegation headed by Finance Minister Dan Meridor has
confirmed its participation in the economic gathering.
</P>
<P>
Canada, Japan, Britain, Germany, South Korea and central and
eastern European countries also said they will come.
</P>
<P>
Egypt invited high-level officials in 87 countries and heads of
47 regional and international organizations to the event.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 countries and about 600 foreign companies have
reportedly confirmed their presence, along with 400 Egyptian
companies.
</P>
<P>
The conference aims to promote a regional development process
integrating the countries of the region into an economic
community, in parallel with the Middle East peace process underway.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on developing infrastructure, attracting
international capital for investment projects in the region and
encouraging industrial and commercial development.

<HEADLINE> Probe Into South Korean Ex-Defense Minister Scandal Ordered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam today ordered a thorough investigation into the
corruption scandals involving ousted Defense Minister Lee Yang-ho.
</P>
<P>
Those guilty of corruption or irregularities should be punished
severely by law, regardless of their positions, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
On October 17, South Korea's main opposition National Congress
for New Politics (NCNP) said that Lee had leaked military secrets
regarding the country's plan to purchase precision equipment to an
American dealer when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP also disclosed that Lee offered a set of jewelry worth
44,000 U.S. dollars to a daughter of then President Roh Tae-woo
for his promotion to Air Force chief of staff when he was the
chief information official in the Defense Ministry in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean prosecution, which has already begun to
investigate the scandals, planned to summon Lee for questioning
early next week.
</P>
<P>
The Prosecutor General's Office took over materials about Lee's
case from the Defense Security Command today and promptly banned
him from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
The probe will initially be centered on determining whether the
memo Lee had given to the arms dealer contained classified
military information, a prosecution official said.
</P>
<P>
Lee has denied the charges of divulging military secrets and of
bribery, describing them as groundless.
</P>
<P>
In a military reshuffle on October 17, President Kim named
outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Kim Dong-jin to
replace Lee as the new defense minister.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Gathering on Lu Xun Held in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Over 400 officials and local
writers and artists gathered here today to commemorate the 60th
anniversary of the death of Lu Xun, who is known as a great
Chinese thinker, revolutionary and man of letters.
</P>
<P>
Lu Xun spent his last but most noted 10 years in Shanghai, and
literature was his lifetime focus, said Chen Zhili, deputy
secretary of Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, in a speech at the
event.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Lu's works are an important part of Chinese culture,
and his personality and noble character will forever encourage
people to march forward.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Taifeng, deputy head of Propaganda Department of Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made a keynote speech at
the gathering, saying it is of special significance to remember Lu
Xun at a time when the whole country is studying the resolutions
on promoting ethical and cultural progress recently proposed by
the Sixth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He praised Lu as the greatest representative of the country's
ideological and cultural front in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Zhai noted that Lu came to the conclusion, after difficult
soul-searching, that only the CPC really reflects the interests of
the people, the future of the country and the hope of the nation,
that only the integration of Marxism with China's practical
situation can meet the need of China's social reform, and that
only socialism can save China, Zhai noted.
</P>
<P>
As a pioneer of China's new literature, Lu made trail-blazing
achievements in the fields of fiction, prose and poetry, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Lun Xun is the spiritual beacon of the Chinese nation," Zhai
said.
</P>
<P>
He repeated the call of Chinese President and General Secretary
of the CPC Central Committee Jiang Zemin, asking people from all
walks of life to learn from Lu Xun.

<HEADLINE> Agreement on Hebron Redeployment Expected Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel said today a deal on
its troop redeployment from Hebron could be reached next week
after intensive talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Israel Radio quoted Israeli sources as saying
that the two sides had in fact reached a deal on Hebron through
talks this week in the Egyptian resort of Taba and Israel's port
city of Eilat, but it was waiting for the approval of Palestinian
Authority (PA) leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will hold further meetings
tonight in a limited scale to sort out the last obstacles. And on
Monday, they will resume formal negotiations in Eilat in order to
clinch the deal.
</P>
<P>
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, who has been involved in the
talks, told reporters Friday that the two sides were making
progress and had solved many issues despite their own
concerns. He said the parties were doing their best to reach an
agreement as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu held consultations
Friday afternoon with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Foreign
Minister David Levy and Israeli negotiators. Ross also attended
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Before the weekly cabinet meeting Friday, Netanyahu also
discussed the ongoing peace talks with his four deputies. But the
prime minister imposed a news blackout on all discussions
concerning the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The last sticking points in the talks on Hebron redeployment
remained the issue of hot pursuit, and whether Palestinian
policemen should be armed with automatic weapons in the buffer
zone to be created in Hebron to separate the Jewish and
Palestinian residents.
</P>
<P>
The idea of creating buffer zone, aired earlier by Israel, was
totally rejected by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials still criticized Israel for footdraging
in the talks. Abu Mazen, Arafat's deputy, said there were still a
number of issues of disagreement that needed further discussion
and clarification.
</P>
<P>
Senior negotiator Hasan Asfour blamed the slow pace of the
talks on Israeli negotiators, who he said were divided and not
serious toward the talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians praised the U.S. government for
its role in moving forward talks on Israeli troop redeployment
from Hebron. The commendation was included in an open letter
presented at the PA meeting held Friday in the Gaza Strip.
</P>

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- For the past year, Yang Hu has
been building his dream ship -- a three-story complex featuring a
hotel, restaurant and nightclub.
</P>
<P>
So far, the 45-year old entrepreneur has invested about one
million yuan on his tourist vessel, anchored on the southern bank
of the Yellow River near the site of the multi-billion yuan
Xiaolangdi Hydropower Project in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The ship can only travel at very low speeds and is not designed
for river-cruising, according to Yang. Instead, it will be
stationed along the bank, where its 20-30 guest rooms are expected
to be a major draw for the large group of foreigners working for
the nearby hydropower project.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who lives with his wife and two children, was formerly a
farmer in Xiaolangdi Village. He spent most of his life savings to
fund part of the floating hotel/restaurant, which is nearly
complete. The rest came from bank loans, his friends and family.
</P>
<P>
He hopes to recover the investment within the first few months
after his luxury boat opens.
</P>
<P>
The hydropower project takes its name from the village, located
in Mengjin County. Residents there were forced to move to make
room for what is the second largest river-power scheme in China.
</P>
<P>
The hilly area of Xiaolangdi is one of the poorest in the
country. Most local rural residents live in huts and caves.
</P>
<P>
The more than 1,200 Xiaolangdi villagers have been resettled in
New Xiaolangdi Village, five kilometers away from their hometown,
and now live in newly-built flats. More than 100,000 people are
scheduled to be relocated because of the river project.
</P>
<P>
New Xiaolangdi village head Jing Daomin said Yang is the first
person in the village to make such a "bold and creative move."
</P>
<P>
Jing said that many local farmer-turned businessmen, from New
Xiaolangdi and other neighboring villages, are following Yang's
lead by building tourist boats, setting up bars or opening other
recreational and leisure-time facilities to squeeze money out of
travelers pockets.
</P>
<P>
The New Xiaolangdi Village will be built into a big tourist
attraction, with motels, restaurants, bars and a park with a
panoramic view of the Yellow River, according to an ambitious plan
developed by Jing.
</P>
<P>
"It is the huge hydropower project that has brought new
opportunities to local people," Jing noted.

<HEADLINE> Hainan to Grow Out-Of-Season Vegetables and Fruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Southernmost China's Hainan
Province, China's second largest island, is to invest more than
220 million yuan developing out-of-season vegetable and fruit
growing.
</P>
<P>
The move will provide fresher and cheaper vegetables for local
urban citizens and other provinces.
</P>
<P>
And it will also mean that large quantities of fresh vegetables
that are now left to rot will reach inland food markets.
</P>
<P>
Among the total investment, 13.77 million US dollars is in
loans from Asia Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
In addition to pilot farms spanning 600,000-hectares, Hainan
Vegetable and Fruit Industry Company plans to set up three
wholesale markets, a packaging plant, a transportation system
equipped with nearly 100 vehicles and ships, a quick-freezing
plant with annual production capacity reaching 20,000 tons, and
four transportation centers.
</P>
<P>
The company has already invested more than 40 million yuan in
the system, which is expected to be finished in the coming three
years.
</P>
<P>
When the system is completed, the company will use ships to
transport 300,000 tons of fresh fruit and vegetables to north,
east and south China annually. It will greatly ease the shortage
of out-of-season vegetables in these regions.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the volume of fruit and vegetables sold by
the company will account for nearly one-third of the provincial
total, and more than 14,000 peasants will benefit from the
plantation, to increase their annual per capita income by more
than 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The 'greenhouse' island of China, Hainan transports nearly one
million tons of vegetables and fruit to the inland areas of the
country annually, while large amounts of vegetables cannot be
shipped out and rot as a result of the current inconvenient
transportation system.

certification writing off 4.2 billion dollars for Egyptian debt,
constituting the last instalment of its debt.
</P>
<P>
The move reflected the international recognition of the
success of the Egyptian economic reform which began in 1991 in
such sectors as lower inflation rates, lesser budget deficit
rates as well as higher foreign currency reserve and more
investments into new projects, which aimed at increasing
production and creating jobs.

<P>
MACAO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Both former chairperson and
vice-chairman of the Macao Legislative Assembly (LA) renewed their
posts as chiefs of the newly-established sixth LA following
today's election.
</P>
<P>
Anabela Sales Ritchie, who has been a member of the Macao LA
since 1976, successfully won 15 votes among all the 23 members of
the LA, to renew her post as chairperson of the sixth LA, which
took office early this week.

financier, gained 13 votes and maintained his position in the LA.
</P>
<P>
Two secretaries were also elected at today's session, and the
four will form the executive committee of the LA.
</P>
<P>
Ritchie vowed after the election that she would work hard to
live up to the expectations of the members.
</P>
<P>
"The Macao LA shoulders great responsibilities as time draws

<HEADLINE> W. African States to Jointly Try on Immunization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Nations of west Africa will make
joint efforts on immunication when the national immunication day
program initiated by the Nigerian government will be launched
simultaneously by them this December.
</P>
<P>
The joint efforts, according to Nigeria's Health Minister
Iheckukwu Madubuike, would facilitate the attainment of set
objectives of eradicating poliomyelitis, eliminating neonatal
tetanus and controlling measles in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that since other regions of the world such
as America and Europe have succeeded in attaining the objective
of eradicating poliomyelitis, Africa, where the disease is more
rampant, must obtain the same achievement before the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Although immunization has been recognized as the most
effective medical tool, "we have contined to perform poorly in
this area," he said, quoted by the "Guardian" newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
"The results of this have always been frequent outbreaks of
epidemics of various vaccine preventable diseases which often
lead to high mortability and mortality rates," the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, a blueprint and the guidelines for
the implementation of the immunization day have been circulated
to all the states throughout Nigeria, while state
epidemiologists, program managers and officers concerned have
been trained on how to implement the program.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian parliament
speaker Ivan Rybkin was named today the new national security
council chief to succeed Alexander Lebed and to serve as the
presidential envoy to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin press service announced President Boris Yeltsin's
appointment, the Interfax news service reported.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin, 50, served as speaker of the State Duma, or the lower
house of parliament, from 1993 to 1995. He had been a member of
the conservative Agrarian Party of Russia, but later became an
ally of Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The moderate politician is known for his strife to steer the
Duma away from clashes with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Yeltsin sacked Lebed from his post as the security
council chief to subdue a squabble between the ex-army general and
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov over the issue of the fall of
Chechnya's capital Grozny to the hands of separatists in August.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin removed Lebed from the post as the presidential envoy

<P>
LAGOS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in Nigeria have called
on the government to check on under-age marriage, which they said
is responsible for the country's high maternal mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
Today's "Weekend Times" reported that 80 out of every 1,000
women die during childbirth in Nigeria, compared with a rate of
10 to 100,000 in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that the country's maternal mortality
rate is still on rise, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bomi Ogedengbe, an associate professor at the Lagos
University Teaching Hospital said that a major part of the
victims are girls under 18 years old, who are susceptible to
infections.
</P>
<P>
Under-aged girls are likely have their babies stuck during
delivery, an occurrence normally resulting in death due to
Prolonged labor, she said.
</P>

An anonymous chief consultant at a Lagos hospital also pleaded
for control over marriage age. He said his hospital records not
less than 30 deaths per 1,000 deliveries every year.

<HEADLINE> China to Issue New Rule on Beer Bottles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China is to cure its problem of
exploding beer bottles by imposing a strict life-span on bottles.
</P>
<P>
From January 1, a new standard of beer bottle is being
introduced, which will have to include the date when the bottle
was produced.
</P>
<P>
It can only be recycled for two years after its production
date, before being withdrawn. The aim of a new nationwide
regulation is to prevent substandard bottles, and protect the
interests of consumers.
</P>
<P>
According to the revised state standard on beer bottles, all
breweries and beer bottle producers must meet the new standard to
preserve the rights and interests of consumers.
</P>
<P>
Experts say it is the first state rule governing the quality of
beer bottles. The move will also prevent the mixed use of beer
bottles for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
The new standard requires that all beer bottles to be labeled
with a character "B" on their base, together with information
showing the quarter and year when the beer was produced.
</P>
<P>
According to the new standard, beer bottles can only be used
within two years.
</P>
<P>
In recent years beer bottles have occasionally exploded, and
the safety of bottles has aroused wide social concern, leading to
the revision of the standard on bottles. Continually recycled
bottles - often damaged - are partly to blame.
</P>
<P>
Drinking beer has become a popular pastime for young Chinese,
helping to make China one of the largest beer consumers in the
world.

<HEADLINE> Fightings Kill 25 in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zairean government said today
that 25 people were killed in fightings between Zairean army and
Banyamurenge militia from Thursday night to Friday morning in the
region of Uvira, Eastern Zaire, according to reports from Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after a cabinet meeting, the Zairean
government said that the dead included "attackers and local
population," without giving further details.
</P>
<P>
"In the night of (October) 17 and 18, the armed Banyamurenge
elements besieged the sugar refinery of Kiliba (near Uvira), where
they plundered a maternity hospital, a commercial center and a
parishioners' land," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report by humanitarian groups in eastern Zaire said
that at least 31 people, including 28 villagers and three
Banyamurenge infiltrators, were killed in Friday's fighting in
Uvira.
</P>
<P>
"The attempt by the attackers to occupy the airport (of Uvira
situated in Kiliba) and the sugar refinery was foiled thanks to
the intervention by the Zairean Armed Forces (FAZ), who forced the
attackers to flee into the mountains," said the government
communique.
</P>
<P>
The Banyamurenges, who are ethnic Tutsis originally from Rwanda
but have long settled in eastern Zaire's mountainous areas,
reportedly began to infiltrate into Zaire from Burundi since the
beginning of September.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government said that it had "decided on a series of
measures to face up to this situation."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Palestinians Turn to Europe for Help(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Disappointed by American
failure to exert pressure enough to change the hardline policy of
the current Israeli government, the Palestinians tend to believe
that the Europeans may play a more positive role, one way or
another, in helping bring about a favorable peace deal with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority (PA) is expecting French President
Jacques Chirac to assert the role during his Middle East tour
beginning from Syria's capital Damascus today. He is due to visit
Israel and the Palestinian autonomous area Monday.
</P>
<P>
PA President Yasser Arafat has said on more than one occasion
recently that he wants to see more European involvement in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. He has even called on Israel to
agree with European participation in the current negotiations
first at Erez, a checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip,
and then in Taba, Egypt, alongside the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Palestinians say that Europe, due to its proximity, had a
historic involvement in the Middle East. Although this had a
dark side, the involvement nevertheless created ties, friendship
and affiliations -- none of which the U.S. had. Neither is
Europe's foreign policy, whether as a union or individual
state, hostage to a pro-Israel lobby as is the case in the
U.S. particularly in the election year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Palestinians are convinced that Europe could
play a better mediating role than the U.S. and they do not wish
to leave their future solely in the hands of an uncommitted and
biased U.S..
</P>
<P>
Europe voiced strong opposition toward Israel over the recent
bloody clashes in the West bank (including East Jerusalem) and
Gaza Strip, which left some 60 Palestinians dead and about 1,000
wounded. European leaders stated that Israel's failure to
implement the peace agreements it had signed, had stoked the
atmosphere which led to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians said privately that the Clinton Administration
had declined to pressure Israel into implementing the Oslo Accords
for fears of distancing millions of pro-Israeli Jewish voters and,
unfortunately, this was partly responsible for the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Arafat voiced his appeal to Europe to play the missing role
during visits to Luxembourg, Italy and France early October,
where he met European Union officials on his way to
Washington. He also met with Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring,
the EU envoy to the Middle East, in Gaza on October 6 and 7. The
Irish envoy assured the PA that Europe was ready to commit itself
to the peace talks in order to see that they are successful.
</P>
<P>
Spring said the EU had decided during a meeting in Dublin to
send a special envoy to the Middle East to observe
negotiations. However, he added that the envoy will not
participate in the negotiations, in spite of Palestinian
requests, but will watch closely and offer an opinion whenever
the need arises.

<TEXT>
<P>
Spring also promised that the EU is committed to financial
contributions toward the development of the Palestinian economy
and this, according to him, also justified EU's increasing
interest in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Spring's words were echoed by French President Chirac and
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette. They expressed hopes that
the EU, France in particular, would play a direct role in the
peace talks on an equal footing to the U.S., if not a
substitute. France was disappointed by Washington's failure to
invite the EU to the summit and also by its efforts to keep
Europe out of the talks. In striking contrast with the U.S., Chirac
telephoned Arafat to express his solidarity with the
Palestinians when Israeli troops clashed with Palestinian
protesters and police.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Chirac's visit here next Monday, French Foreign
Ministry official Bertrand Dufourcq on October 14 held separate
talks with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and other senior
officials. He also had a brief meeting with Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu. France is reported to press for the
appointment of an EU Middle East envoy. A name that the
French have floated is former EU president Jacques Delores.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq, who also met with U.S. special coordinator Dennis
Ross, sought to assure his Israeli hosts that France is not aimed
at supplanting the U.S. role as Middle East mediator, but rather
has its own specific ideas to offer.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is also expected to ask Israel to permit the
Palestinians to open the Gaza international airport and develop
a sea port in the Gaza Strip. Chirac will also become the first
world leader to address the legislative Palestinian Council
scheduled to convene in Ramallah, the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel has strongly opposed EU participation in the peace
talks. Levy met with all the EU ambassadors based in Israel
Wednesday, providing his own overview of the peace process
underway and voicing opposition to the idea of dispatching an
European envoy to the region.
</P>
<P>
Although Europe wants to make a greater contribution, it
appears that it is unsure how to mobilize. Differences among EU
members over the extent of involvement and whether it can
challenge the U.S. in this way, are obstructing the emergence of
a clear policy. Germany, for example, a major donor to the peace
efforts, has sort of reservations over the degree of European
involvement. It feels that Europe should not pressure Israel,
but be ready to assist if approached by both the Palestinians
and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been reportedly in consultation with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in an apparent effort to block the EU
move.

PARIS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Since the Supreme Court of Belgium stopped Judge Jean-Marc
Conerotte from investigating into the case of serial child
kidnapper Marc Dutroux on Monday, tens of thousands of Belgians
have taken to the streets across the country to protest the
decision by the highest judicial authorities. A nationwide
demonstration will be joined by 200,000 people on Sunday to pay
homage to four little girls who were killed by Dutroux.
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac today began the most difficult
diplomatic initiative since his election by entering the melee of
the Middle East. By visiting five countries and the Palestinian
autonomous territories in six days, Chirac is following the
commitment he made in Cairo in April: "The Arab policy of France
should be an essential dimension of its foreign policy."
Meanwhile, the United States is watching the French peace
initiative with discontent.

<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Seven children in Bethune, northern France, have been
hospitalized after being diagnosed as having been infected by a

cases are reported each year of the disease, which causes fever
and brings complications sometimes.
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac today began his tour of the Middle
East by going to Syria first to hold talks with President Hafez
al-Assad. Syria is anxious to find a counterweight to the United
States, which is the sponsor of the Middle East peace, by calling
on Europe, and especially France, to play a "more direct" role in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Negotiate With Kenya on Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Electricity Board (UEB)
is to send a delegation to Kenya on Monday to negotiate with
their counterparts on new price of electricity Uganda has
supplied to Kenya since 1954.
</P>
<P>
"The New Vision" paper today quoted Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi as saying that Kenya will pay current market rates for
the electricity of 30 megawatts from Uganda, provided the
electricity is received during day time, and not after 6:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda delegation will led by Minister of Natural
Resources and negotiations will be held on October 22.
</P>
<P>
Currently Kenya pays two U.S. Cents to Uganda for each unit of
electricity. Uganda complains that it costs six U.S. Cents to
produce one unit of electricity at the Owen Falls Dam, 80 km east
of Kampala, capital of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The exports of 30 megawatts of electricity from Uganda to
Kenya was stipulated by an agreement signed between the two
countries during colonial days.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on CPO, Tin, Rubber in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's crude palm oil
(CPO) physicals, tin and rubber markets ended the week lower or
mixed.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physical market finished lower this week in moderately
active trading.
</P>
<P>
The bearish palm oil figures for September released by the Palm
Oil Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA) on Tuesday
brought about a generally weak sentiment to the cash market.
</P>
<P>
Lack of interest in the market was also due to the absence of
fresh leads which had kept players to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
October South was traded 25 Ringgit (about 10 US dollars) lower
at 1,145 Ringgit (about 458 US dollars) per ton from last week's
close at 1,170 Ringgit (about 468 US dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, prices on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM)
ended the week sharply lower in quiet trading following price
volatility on the London Metal Exchange (LME).
</P>
<P>
The metal fell by 31 sen (about 12.4 US cents) to 14.62 Ringgit
(about 5.848 US dollars) per kilogram from 14.93 Ringgit (about
5.972 US dollars) per kilogram last week.
</P>
<P>
The demand and supply situation of the market remained tight
despite the possibility of higher consumption in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the week's transactions came from local, European
and Japanese buyers.
</P>
<P>
The week's accumulated turnover stood at 376 lots as compared
with 370 lots previously. The price differential between the KLTM
and the LME was at a premium of 35 US dollars, which was the same
as last week's premium.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market, however, prices closed mixed
this week in dull trading with players remaining on the sidelines
in the absence of fresh leads.
</P>
<P>
November RSS One buyers fell by half a sen to end the week at
310.00 sen (about 124 US cents) per kilogram while SMR 20 firmed
by half a sen at 306.50 (about 122.6 US cents) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The local market saw no inquiries from overseas traders and
there was little consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Trading was also trapped within a tight range due to the
players' reluctance to participate actively in the market.
</P>
<P>
Market players still viewed the market bearishly although the
current wet weather indicated the possibility of a general
shortage of raw materials.

<HEADLINE> Crop Buying Service Set Up in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A crop buying service has been
set up in Zambia to give farmers easy access to markets at a fair
price.
</P>
<P>
Announcing here on Friday the formation of the service,
Executive Director George Grey of the Zambia National Farmers
Union (ZNFU) charged that the country's business community has
taken the advantage of the farmers' desperate need of money to
repay loans by giving the farmers a low price.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU President Ajaye Vashee said the service will be operated
through the Agricultural Commodity Exchange (ACE), which will
arrange the necessary transport guaranteeing fast payment.
</P>
<P>
The service will iron out difficulties the farmers experience
in selling their crops, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Vashee urged the private sector to play an active role in
ensuring that uncollected maize is brought to the nearest market.

LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Paul Gascoigne has issued a
public apology Friday for his shamed behavior both at field and
home but insisted he will not quit soccer or Glasgow Rangers.
</P>
<P>
The England midfielder was sent off against Ajax in a
Champions' League game and allegations he assaulted his wife
Sheryl.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, Cascoigne issued a public apology to Rangers
manager Walter Smith, his team mates and supporters for his
ordering-off in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
He declared himself ready to face Aberdeen on Saturday in
front of around 50,000 fans and the full media glare at Ibrox.
</P>
<P>
"There were stories about me leaving or being sacked by the
club," said Gascoigne. "It's easy for me just to pack my bags and
walk away from football. I ain't going to do that."
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne's only reference to the reports relating to his wife
was to say that he took "a domestic problem" into Wednesday's
match against Ajax, in which he was dismissed for kicking an
opponent.

<HEADLINE> Rules Urged for Protection of Stock Investors in Cyberspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Japanese analysts are urging the
government to formulate rules to protect investors buying stocks
on the Internet, Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
As many businesses eyeing the Internet for the release of their
stocks, the analysts called on the government to come up with new
rules for stock trading, which now only cover transactions taking
place inside brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
"We need to sort out the problems of stock transactions on the
Internet and make clear what is lawful and what is not," Kyodo
quoted one analyst with the Nomura Research Institute as saying.
</P>
<P>
"In the process, we must also make sure that regulation does
not wipe out opportunities for growing venture businesses."
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that in the United States, on-line transactions
are approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
investors are given due protection.
</P>
<P>
Currently, virtually any Japanese can raise funds on the
Internet, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any particular rules against it," the news
service quoted an official at the Securities Bureau of the Finance
Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The only requirements are that companies that plan to issue
stock for 50 or more people, submit papers to the ministry and
draw up financial statements, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Special Team Set Up in Nairobi to Crack Down on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The government has reacted
strongly against a wave of armed robberies in Nairobi over the
past several days in a bid to convince people that the security
in the capital is under control.
</P>
<P>
A special anti-crime team comprising senior police officers
was set up on Friday to monitor the combat against the escalating
wave of crime, especially armed robbery, around Nairobi and other
parts of the east African country, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a major operation mounted by Nairobi police on that day,
seven suspects over Thursday's armed robbery in the city were
arrested, including a "hefty" woman who is said to have
coordinated the terror raid.
</P>
<P>
"East African Standard" newspaper quoted a top police source
as saying that the mastermind behind the spate of armed
robberies, crime and terror in the city has been identified as a
retired senior policeman on a revenge mission.
</P>
<P>
The source said the retired officer had been linked with a
number of armed robberies in the capital and other parts of the
country where he had served.
</P>
<P>
"We know he is behind the current crime wave to prove that
without him armed robberies and other criminals will rule the
city and its surroundings," the officer added.
</P>
<P>
The mastermind behind armed robberies was recently forced to
retire due to his "criminal tendencies", the police officer
noted.
</P>
<P>
The firm actions taken by Nairobi police followed an upsurge
of daring and violent robberies mainly targeting banks,
supermarkets and other business premises in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, armed gangsters mounted raids on Koinange Street,
looting and ransacking in a 20-minute operation coordinated by a
well-built woman.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the gangsters raided the office of Air Zaire
located on the street, where they stole 1,400 U.S. Dollars and
117 airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday this week, 10 gunmen took over Nairobi's busy
Kirinyaga Road and sent police officers and civilians fleeing for
cover as they staged a 20-minute robbery mission.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Copper Miners Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- operations underground and at
the open pit at Nchanga division of Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM) in Chingola have been disrupted as over 1,000 miners
there went on strike on Friday, demanding production bonus.
</P>
<P>
The move took management by surprise when workers reported for
work but refused to go underground while their colleagues at the
open pit switched off machines to back up the demand, the local
press reported today from Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
The miners last week gave management a one-week ultimatum for
the payment and it expired on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Miners Union of Zambia met management which
promised to pay next week but the pledge was rejected by the
miners who earlier had gathered outside the plant and vowed not
to resume duties until the bonus was paid.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the bonus, the miners want to be pruned and paid
their terminal benefits before the mines are sold to new
investors for fear of being reduced to beggars during the ZCCM
privatization process.
</P>
<P>
The miners' strike is the latest in a series of industrial
unrest in Zambia after nurses and teachers went on strike
earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, Minister of Labor and Social Security Newstead Zimba
warned on Friday that teachers and other workers flouting
industrial laws by going on illegal strikes should not be paid to
bring sanity to industry.
</P>
<P>
''Under the employment act, you only pay one who has worked...
employers should not waver on not paying those not working... no
employers, not even the government, should pay workers who have
not been working,'' Zimba added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
the Joint Communique between the People's Republic of China and
the Republic of Slovenia issued today:
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of President Jiang Zemin of the People's
Republic of China, President Milan Kucan of the Republic of
Slovenia paid a state visit to the People's Republic of China from
October 14 through 19, 1996.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China held
talks with President Milan Kucan of the Republic of Slovenia. The
two leaders exchanged views on stronger bilateral relations,
international issues of common concern and cooperation between the
two countries in international organizations. The talks were held
in a friendly, frank and constructive atmosphere. The two sides
were satisfied with the results of the talks.
</P>
<P>
There exist traditional good relations and cooperation between
China and Slovenia. Since the establishment of diplomatic
relations, the two countries have cooperated with each other in
the political, economic, scientific, technological. cultural,
educational and health fields. Contacts between various localities
of the two countries have also been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The two sides believe that the visit will contribute to greater
mutual understanding and trust and stronger friendship and
mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian side reiterated that it would stick to its
principled position of one China. It recognized that there is but
one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and
the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal
government representing the whole of Chinese people. The Republic
of Slovenia does not change its position of refraining from
conducting any official exchanges or establishing any official
relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side appreciated this position of Slovenia and
stated that China deeply valued its friendly relations and
cooperation with Slovenia in all fields, respected Slovenian
independence and sovereignty, attached importance to the positive
role Slovenia was playing in Europe and the international
community and understood Slovenia's interest in joining in
European integration. China respects Slovenia's foreign policy of
peace and its role in solving the Balkan crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian side stated that it cherished its long-term and
stable relations with China, respected the special role China
plays in the Asian region as well as in the international community
and international organizations and appreciated China's rapid
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian side stressed that Slovenia was one of the
successor states to the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (SFRY). The Chinese side expressed its understanding of
it and hoped that the countries of the former SFRY would step up
their consulations and China would respect the consensus they may
reach.
</P>
<P>
President Milan Kucan of the Republic of Slovenia expressed his
thanks to the Chinese side for the warm and friendly reception
accorded to the Slovenian Delegation and invited President Jiang
Zemin of the People's Republic of China to visit Slovenia at a
convenient time. President Jiang Zemin appreciated and accepted
the invitation.

million taka (about 12.5 million US dollars) for setting up
transmission lines and installing other equipment at two bordering
points, according to a preliminary estimate by the ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The island province of Hainan
will try to develop agriculture into its an economic pioneer in
view of the country's bulging market appetite for farming produce,
according to Chen Suhou, vice-governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Hainan has grown into a major farm produce
supplier of the country in recent years, with over 600,000 tons of
tropical vegetables and fruits shipped to other parts of the
country every year, adding that 30 percent of the farmers' annual
income comes from such produce.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is also China's major rubber producer, turning out
246,000 tons, or more than two-thirds of the country's total need.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Hainan has still much to do to meet the
country's rising demand for tropic fruits and vegetables and
rubber.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his desire for closer cooperation between
Hainan and Taiwan because the two provinces may compensate each
other for their needs.
</P>
<P>
Hainan's agriculture is mainly traditional but Taiwan's has
already developed into the standard comparable with the advanced
countries', he said. But Taiwan's further agricultural development
is restricted by shortage of land and labor as well as high cost,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Should the two islands cooperate with each other, both can see
their shortcomings compensated and both can develop in a more
robust fashion," he said.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 200 Taiwan agricultural firms have been
established in Hainan. These firms, with total investment
exceeding 100 million US dollars, export 60 percent of their
products to Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hainan will also take advantage of the vast ocean to
develop fishing, shipping, mining, energy and tourism industries.

<HEADLINE> EU Meets to Discuss Fighting Economic Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Judicial officials and police
officers from Portugal and some other countries of the European
Union (EU) met here Thursday to discuss economic crime within the
EU and measures for fighting it.
</P>
<P>
The meeting noted that criminal activities, such as
embezzlement, smuggling and evasion of taxes in the economic field
had been rising since the EU removed border restrictions in 1993
to allow free circulation of capital and commodities.
</P>
<P>
The EU investigation reports show that in 1995, economic crimes
caused the bloc 1,500 million US dollars of damage. Tax losses
involving cigarettes amounted to 530 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting stressed that EU countries must first
perfect their legal systems in order to effectively fight and
contain economic crimes and protect the common interests of the
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, member countries should improve techniques of
fighting economic crimes
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, technological equipment had to be improved.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam is Biggest Gold Consumer in Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has become the biggest
gold consumer in Southeast Asia, using 35 tons of the precious
metal in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Vietnam's demand for gold has risen by an
average of 20 percent a year, the Vietnam News quotes
W.K.Cruikshanks, the chief representative of the World Gold
Council (WGC) as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam demand is seen to result from the increasing
incomes of urban residents.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year the country's demand for
gemstone jewelry increased by 40 percent, compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh city, the country's main economic hub, accounted
for 70 percent of country's total gold sales.
</P>
<P>
While many people continue to invest in gold as a form of
savings, two-thirds of Vietnamese customers buy gold jewelry as
personal decoration or as gifts for relatives on birthdays and
weddings.
</P>
<P>
Increased demand has led to a rapidly growing trading network,
which includes 40 state-run gold trading companies, 20 commercial
banks and financial companies and more than 2,000 private
businesses.

SANTIAGO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
said today that his government wants to strengthen ties with the
European Union (EU) through Britain as a step towards trade
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Frei made these remarks at the Santiago international airport
on returning from a four-day visit to Britain, where he met
British Prime Minister John Major, Queen Elizabeth II, and British
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The president said 14 British entrepreneurial, commercial, and

</P>
<P>
Britain and Chile expressed their willingness to invest in each
other and make each other their respective bases in Latin America
and the EU.

<P>
Frei also stressed the importance of agreements which were
designed for both countries to avoid double taxation in bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
Britain asked Chile to reduce the tariff levied on imported
British whiskey by 70 to 40 percent, because it considered the
present tariff "discriminatory".

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippines' Biggest Opposition Splitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' biggest
opposition party, the Laban Ng Demokratikong (Laban), is
undergoing a split which, ironically, stemmed from a successful
Senate coup by its leader against the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lakas Ng Edsa and National Union of Christian
Democrats (Lakas-NUCD) held a special ceremony at the presidential
palace last Thursday to welcome 17 Laban defectors including one
congressman, two provincial governors and some town mayors.
</P>
<P>
According to House Speaker Jose de Venecia, this is just the
start of an exodus from the Laban.
</P>
<P>
The defection, together with the resignation of Neptali
Gonzales from Laban emeritus presidency and membership three days
before, has seriously crippled the Laban party.
</P>
<P>
However, Laban President Edgardo Angara seemed still immersed
in happy memories of the Senate coup he staged on October 10 with
Ernesto Maceda, secretary general of the Nationalist People's
Coalition (NPC).
</P>
<P>
At that weekly session of the Senate, Angara and Maceda
suddenly announced that 16 of the 24 senators had agreed to
reshuffle the upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
They declared all positions in the Senate vacant to pave the
way for the elections of a new set of officers from the Senate
president down to the Senate Minority leader.
</P>
<P>
Taken off guard, Senate President Gonzales had to step down. On
the same day, Maceda was installed as new Senate president while
the heads of all powerful committees in the Senate were replaced.
</P>
<P>
Senator Leticia Ramos Shahani, President Fidel Ramos' younger
sister, also lost her position as Senate president pro tempore to
Senator Blas Ople.
</P>
<P>
For Angara, the coup was successful, but might have gone a
little bit overboard. His strange alliance with Maceda in the coup
immediately stirred up widespread opposition among his partymates.
</P>
<P>
Some Laban members suspected "dirty deals" in the unusual
alliance between Angara and his former enemy Maceda who had ousted
him from the Senate presidency last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that by joining hands, the two men got what they
wanted -- Senate presidency for Maceda and nomination for Angara
as a common candidate for the 1998 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
What enraged most Laban members was that Angara "stabbed in the
back of his colleague" and installed a non-Laban Senate president
in the coup.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he tore his "gentleman's agreement" pledging to
support Gonzales until 1998, Angara said that although the Laban
formally broke up with the ruling party last year, Gonzales
"apparently failed to sever ties with the Lakas-NUCD."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Angara warned that any partymates or
congressmen would be expelled if they failed to apply with the
party's decision to break up with the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
As if responding to the warning, Gonzales resigned from Laban
emeritus presidency and membership and was elected as Senate
Minority leader by the new Senate minority which comprises five
Laban senators and three Lakas-NUCD senators.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said the Laban "is no longer the same party that I
founded once and led." He said he received offers from many
political parties after his resignation, but he was not sure if
they are serious in taking him in.
</P>
<P>
He also said he would not rule out the possibility of
organizing a new political party.
</P>
<P>
The schism inside the Laban continued to go deeper as Angara
found himself in danger of being stripped of the chairmanship of
his party. Seven lawmakers who called themselves the "Democratic
Wing" of the Laban announced on October 14 that they would unseat
Angara on the ground of "treachery."
</P>
<P>
"Angara's alliance with the Nationalist People's Coalition and
his instigation of the ouster of Gonzales as Senate president
placed the entire party in peril," said Hernando Perez, leader of
the Democratic Wing and also secretary general of the Laban party.
</P>
<P>
He said he had asked the party to form a panel to investigate
Angara.
</P>
<P>
Angara and his supporters, however, blasted the Democratic Wing
as hypocrites for "playing a nasty trick" to remain aligned with
the ruling Lakas-NUCD.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos said he was shocked when he first heard that
"the united opposition" took over the Senate in the coup, but then
things appeared to be going better than expected.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party is harvesting from the fallout of the biggest
opposition party with the defection of 17 Laban local officials.
Ramos has ordered his partymates to open the door wider for more
disgruntled party members of the Laban and the NPC.
</P>
<P>
The new Senate leadership also gave its assurance to Ramos that
it will cooperate with the executive branch in passing vital
pieces of legislation such as the Comprehensive Tax Reform
Package.
</P>
<P>
Maceda told Ramos that the Senate will speed up its debate on
the excise tax bill which comprises one part of the Comprehensive
Tax Reform package.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the Laban has been crippled by the aftermath
of the Senate coup, but it is not yet the end of the story. The
realignment of political forces triggered by the Senate coup is
foreboding a stormy prospect for the Philippines' 1998
presidential elections.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hints Displeasure at French Hand in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
hinted at displeasure with French President Jacques Chirac's
coming visit to the Middle East -- fearing that European meddling
might erode its decisive influence over the region.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will begin a six-day Middle East tour on Saturday,
obviously to try to exert European influence on the region's
stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
While hoping Chirac's trip would turn out to be "positive and
productive," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said it was
Washington that had exclusively handled the peace process in the
past.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is the only country that's sitting at the
table in Taba and Elat with the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to have a mini-United Nations around the
table," he added.
</P>
<P>
France showed disappointment with U.S. President Bill Clinton
when he excluded the European Union from a Washington summit early
this month between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and Jordanian King
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The summit, designed to save the peace process after bloody
clashes between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers, made no
progress as neither side would cede ground.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, determined to have its voice heard in the
Middle East, sent Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring to visit the
Middle East right after the Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
Ireland holds the rotating six-month EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Over last weekend, a French special envoy traveled to Egypt for
talks with President Hosni Mubarak over the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's visit is seen by Washington as another significant
incursion into the United States' sphere of influence.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Introduces Reform in Customs Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
embarked on a major reform in the country's customs offices to
modernize procedures and simplify formalities, especially for the
business community, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Department of Customs will introduce a new
data management system -- automated system for customs data, or
ASYCUDA -- as a tool for the reform process.
</P>
<P>
The ASYCUDA system, developed by the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), has been installed in 70
countries worldwide and has helped to increase government revenues
in most of these countries.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the customs reform project, including
computerization of the headquarters of the Customs Department and
the Customs Office at the Kathmandu International Airport, is
nearly completed with the financial support of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the project will see the installation of
the ASYCUDA system in the country's main border customs offices.
</P>
<P>
A workshop held here this week prepared a tentative work plan
for further implementation of the project after extensive
discussions on the new system between representatives from the
government, business circles and donor agencies.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Repay $1.1 Billion Foreign Debts This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will pay back about 1.1
billion U.S. dollars in foreign debts this year, Finance Minister
Dimitar Kostov said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing lawmakers at the National Assembly (parliament),
Kostov said the country would repay its foreign debts on
time. Otherwise, it would be isolated by international financial
institutions and could attract little foreign investment in
future.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has less than 600 million dollars of foreign currency
reserves in hand, and it still has a 200 million-dollar foreign
debt to pay by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The only way to increase the foreign currency reserves was by
stepping up the privatization process and the structural reform of
the economy, and enhancing contacts with international financial
institutions, said the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's total foreign debts reached 12 billion dollars in
1990. But after years of negotiations, it has reached agreement
with European bodies on deferring its debts payments. Some of
these, became bonds of different durations, 30 years being the
longest.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria suspended repaying its foreign debts in 1990 because
it lacked sufficient foreign currency reserves.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan health authorities
are intensifying their efforts to prevent a possible spread of
epidemics such as malaria, dengue, and diarrhea in the capital
city after torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
The rains, brought by tropical storm "Lili", increased cases of
diarrhea, cholera, dengue and respiratory ailments in Managua,
said the director of the System of Integral Attention to Health in
Managua, Carlos Jarquin.
</P>
<P>
Jarquin said that as many as 1,920 cases of diarrhea and
13,518 cases of respiratory ailments, 55 of cholera and six of
rabies were reported in Managua.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry sent 17 additional ambulances and 15
medical brigades to the health centers in the Managua coastal
strip.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jarquin said that flood caused latrines in the zones
near Lake Nicaragua to overflow. Drinking water service did not
reach those communities which further increased the chances of an
epidemic outbreak.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Legislators Slam Russian Fleet Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian parliament today
lashed out at a bill passed by Russian lawmakers to halt a planned
division of the Black Sea fleet between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The move is "an anti-Ukrainian action which violates the rules
of international law and strikes a blow against Ukrainian
sovereignty," the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine said in a declaration
passed by 276 votes to 13.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Duma, the lower house of parliament, on Wednesday
overwhelmingly approved a bill at the first reading, calling for
expanded Russian jurisdiction over Sevastopol, the headquarters of
the fleet, and a halt to the break-up of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
The bill demonstrated Russia's consistent territorial claims
against Ukraine, the declaration said. It accused Russian vote of
threatening not only Ukraine's national interests but also talks
between Russia and Ukraine over the fleet, and the prospects of
their initialing a wide-ranging friendship pact.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the Russian house "is playing a destabilizing
role in the region," the declaration warned that if the draft law
were actually adopted, "Ukraine would insist on the immediate
withdrawal of the Russian fleet from Ukrainian territory."
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Russia are due to sign a major friendship treaty,
but signing has been repeatedly delayed by disagreements over the
fate of the fleet.

<HEADLINE> 374 Democrats Expected to Run for 393 Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Democratic Party has
decided to field 374 candidates to run for 393 seats of the House
of Representatives in the upcoming general election scheduled for
November 17.
</P>
<P>
The lineup was announced by Democratic Party leader Chuan
Leekpai during the orientation for party candidates at a hotel in
Bangkok on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that out of the total 374 candidates, 37
will be fielded in Bangkok to run for the 37 seats and 219 will be
fielded in central, northern and southern provinces for the total
219 seats in the regions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Democratic Party will field only 118 candidates
for the 137 seats in northeastern provinces, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The lineup was the largest in number announced so far by a
single political party in Thailand to run in the country's general
election.
</P>
<P>
The New Aspiration Party, the major rival to the Democratic
Party, earlier said that it would field only more than 100
candidates for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party's campaign team is likely to expand as
several former members of Parliament defected from other camps
reportedly have shown interest in joining the party to run in the
northeast.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loans Used For Forestry In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China has received more than
600 million US dollars in loans from the World Bank over the past
ten years, using it to add more than 2 million hectares of new
forests, according to an official with the Chinese Ministry of
Forestry.
</P>
<P>
The official said that documents were signed in 1985 for four
"National Afforestation Projects", the third of which was just
completed, making it the largest World Bank forestry loan
world-wide.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, with 300 million US dollars in World Bank loans,
1.37 million hectares of forest in 16 provinces and autonomous
regions have been planted.
</P>
<P>
"After 20 years," the official said, "this forest will have 400
million cubic meters of timber reserve, which may provide 6
billion US dollars worth of timber."
</P>
<P>
Because of the success and good management of the project, it
has won praise from both Chinese and World Bank
officials. According to a World Bank study, this project was among
the best of its 110 loan projects in China.
</P>
<P>
"The former president of the World Bank once said that this
project was one of the best he has ever seen during his term of
office," said the official, and when it ends at the turn of the
century, 620,000 hectares of new forest will be planted.
</P>
<P>
In order to see that things go smoothly, the Chinese Ministry
of Forestry is setting up a special group to be responsible for
the World Bank-aided projects, with the Minister of Forestry, Xu
Youfang, as head.

<P>
SHANGHAI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Electromagnetic waves produced
by mobile telecommunication base stations are not in fact harmful
to human beings and the environment, according to a study by the
Shanghai Environment Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
Doubts were raised by local people about the effects of
radiation and the harm they might be doing to the environment and
people's health. Some people have even tried to block the efforts
to build more stations.
</P>
<P>
To relieve people of these fears, the center started the
testing in May at five base stations in different locations, such
as around highrises in densely-populated areas, and in the
downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of data was collected, and, after computer
processing, it revealed that the maximum radiation level of the
base stations is lower than the country's standards.
</P>
<P>
The city began to build mobile telecommunication systems in the
early 1980s, and there are expected to be more than 280 of them by
the end of the year.

<P>
TOKYO, October. 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar is likely
to sustain its strength against the yen in Tokyo next week, due to
the buying of Japanese importers and institutional investors and
the stability of stock and bond prices on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo today quoted dealers as reporting that Bank of Japan
(BOJ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita is expected to suggest Wednesday
at a press conference after a two-day BOJ branch managers' meeting
that the central bank will keep the current easy monetary policy
for the time being, and this will also underpin the dollar.
</P>
<P>
They expect the U.S. currency to move between 110.50 yen and
113.00 yen next week.
</P>
<P>
The dollar hit the year's high of 112.34 yen Wednesday on buying
by institutional investors, who are interested in buying foreign
bonds, and on the surge in stock prices on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Although the dollar slipped to the 111 yen level on selling for
profit-taking, it soon rebounded as dealers confirmed support is
solid at around the 111.90 yen level.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The increase in overseas
investment in the past few years has had a marked impact on
China's commercial sector, according to the director of the Policy
and Legislation Department of the Ministry of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
"Overseas investment has brought much-needed funds to China's
commerce, especially to the State-owned commercial sector", the
official, Huang Hai, said in an recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Many aging State-owned retailers are in bad need of
improvements to face the intensifying market competition, but are
strapped for cash, and overseas investment is a welcome
assistance, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors have not only brought in funds, but also
much-desired international knowledge about modern sales and
management techniques, raising the overall level of China's
commercial sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
Huang has been involved in the sector's look for overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
Most investors involved in the 15 Sino-overseas joint retail
ventures approved by the Central Government, he notes, are from
Asian countries and regions, and called this kind of investment
structure "not quite rational".

<P>
Also of concern is the excessively large scale of the
undertakings, which prolongs construction work.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that too many projects under construction
are upscale department stores, while what is really needed is
super markets.
</P>
<P>
Huang has been involved in many of the talks on restoring
China's GATT status, and entry into WTO, and said he believes that
China's most urgent task in opening up the commerce sector is
speeding up the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
He called the recent signing of contracts for two Sino-overseas
joint retail chain stores "another major step by the Chinese
Government in the opening-up."
</P>
<P>
He suggests that the government open up the retail market in
the central and western regions to overseas investment, and
accelerate the opening-up of the wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
Since the Central Government opened the retail market up on a
trial basis in six major cities and five economic zones in 1992,
15 joint venture department stores have been ratified, three of
which have opened for business.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment is also involved in China's gigantic retail
market in the form of management, renting shop space, transfer of
licenses, property development, and opening boutiques for Chinese
products.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Police Recover Kidnapping Ransom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan police have
recovered the remainder of the 200,000 U.S. dollars ransom paid to
the kidnappers of a Dutch couple in Costa Rica, Costa Rican police
said today.
</P>
<P>
The recovered money, about 40,000 dollars, was hidden on a
mountain near the border with Costa Rica, where five of the
kidnappers were arrested last week, police say.
</P>
<P>
On October 2, Costa Rican police recovered 160,000 dollars on
the Costa Rican side of the border, where the kidnapping occurred
late August 24 or early August 25.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch couple, Huite Zijtra and Jetty Cuors, who worked for
a teak tree farm in the north of Costa Rica, near the border with
Nicaragua, were kept hostage for 24 days.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said Nicaraguan police found the money thanks to
information provided by one of the kidnappers who was detained
last week.
</P>
<P>
Five of the eight kidnappers fled to Nicaragua after collecting
the ransom and releasing the couple on September 17, and were then
captured.
</P>
<P>
Two others were arrested in Costa Rica, and one of them is
still on the run.
</P>
<P>
Two others, both women, a German tourist and a Swiss travel
guide, were kidnapped in the same region at the beginning of the
year. They were kept for 71 days and released after their
relatives paid a ransom.

<HEADLINE> China To Overtake US As World's Biggest Beer Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China is estimated to become the
world's largest beer market by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate of the country's beer market has reached
22 percent since 1983, ranking it the second largest beer market
in the world after the United States.
</P>
<P>
Per capita beer consumption a year in China is only 12 liters,
far lower than the 92 liters in the US. The brewing industry
sources say that this is as a result of China's growing demand for
beer exceeding its supply.
</P>
<P>
China has now more than 800 breweries, but the top ten among
them only occupy 10 percent of the domestic market. And one out of
twenty bottles of beer sold in China is brewed by overseas-funded
enterprises in the country. China now has at least 30
overseas-funded breweries.
</P>
<P>
Along with an large inflow of overseas funds, and raising of
people's living standards, China's beer market is set to become
more fierce and competitive, and will be be more challenging for
domestic breweries.
</P>
<P>
Advanced brewing facilities and equipment, and convenient
transportation in Wuhan, encouraged the US's Anheuser Busch (AB),
the world's largest brewery, to invest a massive amount in Wuhan,
capital of central China's Hubei province, setting up a Budweiser
International Brewery Company in 1995.
</P>
<P>
AB now holds 80 percent of middle- and high-quality beer market
in Wuhan, and the local Budweiser company plans to lift its annual
production capacity from the current 60,000 tons to more than
100,000 tons next year,
</P>
<P>
AB bought five percent of stock share of China's famous Qingdao
Brewery, the country's largest brewery, ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
In addition to AB, the world's other three big brewery
companies -- the US's Miller, Holland's Heineken and Japan's
Kirin -- also have poured large investments into China.
</P>
<P>
Heineken has set up three breweries in southernmost China's
Hainan Province, and Kirin has also set up extensive production
bases in the country.

<HEADLINE> Americas Support Bill to Stem Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from 34 American
countries today expressed support for a bill stating punishments
for laundering money.
</P>
<P>
The bill was presented by the Argentine government to a
four-day meeting of the Inter-American Commission for the Control

Under the bill, a commission for the punishment of those who
are involved in money laundering would be created to make
investigations and present accusations before courts.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates a minimum penalty of three years prison for
the conversion or transference of resources or assets originating

<HEADLINE> Five Policemen Arrested or Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Five police officers have been
punished or arrested in southwest China's Sichuan Province for
abuse of power, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
A Renshou County Public Security Bureau (PSB) police officer,
Li Bosong, was taken into custody in August this year after he
beat a theft suspect to death. The suspect, Li Jinquan, was later
found to be innocent.
</P>
<P>
Two other PSB police officers in Renshou County have been
arrested for accepting bribes from people suspected of stealing
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
After taking 6,000 yuan (723 US dollars) from one suspect in
August this year, Xiao Zhonghui and Pan Fei changed the arrest
report and offense description, from the original "stealing
vehicles," which carries a lesser punishment.
</P>
<P>
The People's Court of the E'bian Yi Nationality Autonomous
County handed down a 10-year sentence against Qiu Pingfang, a
prison police officer from the Shaping Reform-through-Labor Center
of Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Qiu was accused of buying a dozen grams of heroin and selling
them to several labor-reform prisoner. Qiu himself also took
heroin.
</P>
<P>
Qiu's colleague Wang Jiahong, also a drug user, was given a
four-year prison sentence for drug trafficking and bribery.

<HEADLINE> Policy to Defend Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 19 (Xinhua) -- China is developing a set of
rules to prevent local governments from leasing land to overseas
investors at unreasonably low prices, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rules are intended to regulate booming but chaotic
agriculture projects. China is concerned about losing valuable
farmland and the practice of some local governments abusing
agricultural development incentives, the English language paper
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is no doubt the central government is encouraging such
joint land exploitation because it brings overseas funds and
advanced agricultural technology, machinery and management
know-how to China," said a senior State Land Administration
official, who declined to be named, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
That philosophy has resulted in 1,318 overseas projects
involving more than 300,000 hectares of land in 14 provinces and
autonomous regions, it said.
</P>
<P>
Now that the real estate boom has cooled down and is no longer
consuming as much cultivated land, farm projects are hot prospects
for overseas investments.
</P>
<P>
But State officials urge caution before rushing into such
projects. They say local authorities must prevent State land
assets, particularly those with limited resources, from being
lost.

<HEADLINE> Start New Chapter In Life By Reading, Wealthy Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- People in the coastal city of
Wenzhou in east China's Zhejiang province may have earned riches
with a rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But officials are worried that many city folk have become
culturally poorer as a result.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 60 percent Wenzhou residents spend most of
their spare time watching TV, 13 percent rarely read books and 58
percent people own less than 100 books.
</P>
<P>
Their reading habits fall well behind residents in
underdeveloped inland cities.
</P>
<P>
Now government officials in Wenzhou have launched a project,
"Please take the bookshelves home".
</P>
<P>
They hope it will encourage their wealthier city dwellers to
turn over a new leaf by reading more books.
</P>
<P>
Wenzhou is a prosperous region that has scored rapid economic
growth in China over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"Some people around me never read books. Some just want to seek
pleasure. They are short of everything but money," said Zhou
Lixia, a young teacher in a medical college.
</P>
<P>
Wenzhou Mayor Qian Xingzhong said that a modern city needs
luxury hotels, as well as bookstores and libraries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the shelf project will help improve
the quality of local residents.
</P>
<P>
Ten families with the largest book collections have proposed
that every family in the city should have a shelf with 300 books
and subscribe to two newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"More and more people have come to realize that he who never
reads books is just like a man who does business without capital,"
said Li Yong, manager of the Wenzhou Zhonglian Books Company.
</P>
<P>
"As more and more people become knowledge-thirsty, the Wenzhou
book market will certainly thrive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Dadong, director of the Wenzhou Press and Publications
Administration, said that a five-year plan for the shelf project
has been drawn up.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the next five years, his administration
plans to build a book-publishing network covering all towns and
villages in Wenzhou, a modern books distribution center, publish a
major magazine, and open a well-equipped library.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley Takes Shape in Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A new "silicon valley" has
taken shape in an east China city that just a few years ago was a
small coastal town.
</P>
<P>
Jiaojiang Prefecture with a population of 400,000 successfully
joined the world of high tech, even though it had no college or
research bases to provide a ready-made reservoir of experts.
</P>
<P>
But now the prefecture, located in Zhejiang Province, has
became home to major production bases for anti-cancer medicines,
antibiotics, electronic industrial raw materials and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
It is also the largest base in the world for producing
artificial crystals, accounting for 30 percent of the world's
total. The crystals are widely used in the manufacture of
artifical jewelry.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has imported more than 230 technologies and new
hi-tech products, generating over 200 million yuan of industrial
output value in the first half of this year, local statistics
showed.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 firms in the prefecture have been ranked among the
world's most advanced, with most listed to play major parts in the
country's Ninth Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
Jiaojiang, used to be a small coastal town, was 'promoted' to a
city in 1981, and a prefecture in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years, the prefecture has set up a group of
hi-tech industrial parks and development areas.
</P>
<P>
The success was due to the attention the prefecture government
paid to training and introducing qualified personnel, said Zhao
Pingan, secretary of the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Wang Yuanyou, farmer entrepreneur and manager of
Donggang Company, offered one million yuan to establish the
"Donggang Stipend" to help fund research by 290 postgraduate and
doctoral students.
</P>
<P>
In the same year 16 enterprises in the prefecture subsidized
119 doctoral students at 16 universities to accomplish their
studies.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 doctoral postgraduates from different
universities developed new hi-tech products, and made key
technical transformations for the firms in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Now Jiaojiang prefecture has established long-term cooperation
arrangements with more than 160 domestic universities and research
institutes. Hundreds of research centers have been set up in the
prefecture.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- World number one Peter
Sampras and number three Thomas Muster crashed out of the title
race after surprising defeats in their final group outings at the
1996 Marlboro Tennis Championships at the Victoria Park here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
When taking on 51st-ranked Byron Black from Zimbabwe in the
Silver Group today, American Sampras seemed difficult to find the
rapid-fire capability he had enjoyed in earlier matches of the
722,000 U.S. dollars event.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, the top title contender, lost the first game 6-4 in 34
minutes and conceded the second 6-2 in 31. The American fired six
Aces past Black in the match, but that did not help a lot in
turning the tide.
</P>
<P>
The world's top-ranked player denied the suggestion that he had
not paid enough attention on this exhibition event.
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to play well and win every tournament, but that did
not happen today," he said.
</P>
<P>
He did not quite blame on the noise from a nearby art festival
but said the humid weather made some trouble as he felt hard to
have a tighter grasp of his racket during the match.
</P>
<P>
Muster from Australia injured his waist during his match
against Sweden's Jonas Bjorkma in the Gold Group today. He won the
first game 6-3, but lost the next two 6-2, 6-4 to concede the
match.
</P>
<P>
The Australian had caught a cold and has been taking medicines
these days.
</P>
<P>
In the day's only other singles match, Vincent Spadea beat
fellow American Richey Reneberg 6-1, 0-6, 6-4 in one hour 23
minutes.
</P>
<P>
But the victory did not bring about much to Spadea. Although
the two tied with one win and one loss for each, Reneberg the
loser Friday came out as the group winner with higher win-loss
ratio.
</P>
<P>
As the round-robin group matches came to an end, Reneberg,
Bjorkman and Black qualified for the semi-finals slated for
Saturday, together with Australia's Patrick Rafter who qualified
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The final is set for Sunday.

MOSCOW, October 18 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin on
Friday replaced chief of the general staff of the Russian armed

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Insurance System for Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A billion yuan fund is taking
the worry out of life for thousands of workers in northeast China's
Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
They no longer have to be concerned about their basic living
standard or re-employment, thanks to the establishment of an
unemployment insurance system.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of June this year, the
province's total amount of premium reached 958 million yuan and
was fast approaching the billion yuan mark. Over 500 million yuan
has been used since the system was established in 1986.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, over half of the total amount paid out
was used to help workers who have lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
About a third of the total expenditure was used to help
displaced workers find new jobs. Using the fund, 219,000 former
laid-off workers have found new jobs.
</P>
<P>
During the past ten years, Liaoning province set up 65 workers'
training bases, and improved 126 employment agencies using the
unemployment insurance premium.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 95 percent of workers from state and
foreign-funded enterprises, and some 70 percent of workers from
collective firms, have joined the unemployment insurance scheme.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment insurance for workers in private enterprises is
expected to be implemented this year.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Set New Rules for Refugees' Voting at Bosnian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Interim Election
Commission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) has adopted new regulations for the voting of
refugees at the local elections in Bosnia next month.
</P>
<P>
OSCE spokesman David Foley said in Sarajevo today that refugees
would be able to vote only in municipalities where they had a
place of residence at the time of the 1991 census. The OSCE is
charged with the responsibility of organizing and monitoring the
elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"Those who insist on voting in their new municipalities will
have to provide reliable evidence confirming that they had been at
that place of residence since December 14, 1995," when the Dayton
peace accords were signed in Paris, the Tanjug news agency quoted
Foley as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new rule for voting was decided at a meeting of the
commission Thursday. The meeting was attended by representatives
of Serbs, Muslims and Croats and international officials, Foley
said.
</P>
<P>
Local elections in Bosnia were originally set to be held in
parallel with the September 14 national elections for the
collective presidency and parliaments of the two entities -- the
Muslim-Croat Federation and Republika Srpska, but were later
postponed until November 23-24 as the OSCE found signs of fraud in
municipal elections at that time.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Stop of Theater Missile Defense System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Disarmament
Ambassador Sha Zukang today urged countries concerned to cease
immediately the research, development and deployment of the
so-called Theater Missile Defense system (TMD).
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the First Committee of the 51st Session of the
General Assembly, Sha gave two reasons for such an appeal.
</P>
<P>
"The so-called TMD which certain countries are going all out to
develop will in fact possess the capacity to intercept strategic
missiles, thus breaking the limits imposed by the Anti-ballistic
Missile Treaty and rendering the treaty virtually meaningless," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The development of such a system will constitute an impediment
to the further reduction of nuclear weapons by the major nuclear
powers, touch off a new round of arms race and destabilize the
global strategic equilibrium," he said.
</P>
<P>
The second reason is that it will lead to the proliferation of
advanced missile systems and the related technologies, thus posing
a threat to regional and even global security and stability.
</P>
<P>
"In a word, there is nothing to gain but everything to lose
from the development of the TMD system," he said.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks End With New Record Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets in
London, Frankfurt and Paris all surged strongly today and ended
the week at new record highs, supported by firm U.S. government
bonds and the waning of nervousness on Lebed's sacking Thursday.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market finished the session 11
points up at 4,053.1 on the FTSE 100 index, a new record high
which surpassed its previous record close of 4,050.8 set on
October 15, and 25 points higher on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that despite recent strong British economic
figures which suggested a growing danger of inflation, the market
could still rise higher so long as U.S. shares keep advancing.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt market also closed at a record high today in
response to Wall Street's overnight gains and buoyed by surges on
other bourses, with the DAX-30 index up 18.56 points at 2,734.82,
a rise of 48.17 from seven days ago.
</P>
<P>
Investors also felt relieved from the situation in Russia as
one dealer said that the Russian situation was not as bad as they
had thought.
</P>
<P>
French share prices hovered around their two-year highs as
buyers took advantage of Wall Street's bullish tone and finished
the week at its highest level since May 1994, with the CAC-40
index 19.9 points up at 2,185.23, 38.11 points higher on last
week.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Conference on Future of Asia's Cities to Be Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A conference on "The Future
of Asia's Cities" will be held on December 2-5 in Jakarta,
Indonesia, to address the effects of rapid urban development on
the political, economic and cultural life of city residents
throughout Asia, the Asia Society announced today.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Suzhou in China Zhang Xinsheng will be one of the
speakers of note at the conference which will be attended by more
than 500 policy-makers, leaders of nongovernmental organizations,
business people and scholars.
</P>
<P>
Following up on the Habital II conference of the U.N. in
Istanbul, the upcoming conference will focus on implementation of
successful strategies to manage urban issues through partnerships
among the private and public sectors.
</P>
<P>
The social transformations wrought by the rapid urbanization of
Asia are unprecedented in their scale and impact. By the year
2025, more than half the world's population will be living in
Asia, and more than half of these people will be living in cities;
as many as 52 Asian cities will house over 4 million people each.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic growth of Asian cities also brings about changes
in traditional family-centered living arrangements and in the
ability of municipal and national governments to deliver social
services to residents.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the conference will discuss the historical
framework in which specific cities have grown, the consequences of
change in land use and allocation, the evolution of neighborhoods
and communities, and the role of cities as centers or links in the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
Speakers will include internationally recognized government
leaders with special interest in urban issues as well as leading
business executives, policy-makers, practitioners, leaders of
non-governmental organizations and scholars.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being co-organized by the Asia Society, an
American leading institution dedicated to fostering understanding
between American and Asian peoples, and the Center for Information
and Development Studies of Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> China Suggests New Measures on Nuclear Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Nations, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Disarmament
Ambassador Sha Zukang said today that despite significant progress
in international arms control and disarmament, huge nuclear
arsenals still exited.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the First Committee of the 51st Session of the
U.N. General Assembly, he suggested that further steps should be
taken before the complete prohibition and total elimination of
nuclear weapons. The steps include:
</P>
<P>
-- The abandonment of nuclear deterrence policy by the
nuclear-weapon states and further reduction of nuclear weapons by
countries with huge nuclear arsenal;
</P>
<P>
-- An undertaking by all nuclear-weapon states not to be the
first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any
circumstances, and unconditionally not to use or threaten to use
nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states and
nuclear-weapon-free zones and the early conclusion of
international legal instruments to that effect;
</P>
<P>
-- Those states which have deployed nuclear weapons overseas
should withdraw them completely. The deployment of nuclear weapons
on the territories of other countries for whatever reason and in
whatever form is tantamount to nuclear proliferation; and
</P>
<P>
-- All nuclear-weapon states should commit themselves to
supporting the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, respect
the nuclear-weapon-free status of such zones and undertake
corresponding obligations.
</P>
<P>
"If we can agree on a complete ban on two types of weapons of
mass destruction, i.e. chemical and biological weapons, and
conclude international treaties for that purpose, we have no
reason not to be able to agree on the complete prohibition and
total elimination of the nuclear weapons," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Land-Mine Remains Effective Weapon of Self-Defense: China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Disarmament
Ambassador Sha Zhukang said today that land-mine remains an
effective weapon of self-defense, especially for countries having
a long land border.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the First Committee of the 51st Session of the
U.N. General Assembly, Sha stressed that all states are entitled
under the U.N. Charter to use legitimate military means to protect
its own security and that a proper balance should be struck
between humanitarian concerns and those of self-defense with
regards to the land-mine question.
</P>
<P>
"We support the humanitarian efforts of the international
community aimed at preventing the indiscriminate killing and
maiming of innocent civilians by land-mines," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the proper way to prevent land-mine from
harming the innocent people should be to restrict in an
appropriate and reasonable manner the use of land-mine and
strictly prohibit its indiscriminate use.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the proposal to ban all anti-personnel
land-miness was unjustified.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal to ban all anti-personnel land-mines, an
assumption based on an over-exaggeration of humanitarian
concerns and the total disregard of the specific situations of
other countries and the military utility fo land-mines, is
unjustified," he said. "We cannot agree to it."
