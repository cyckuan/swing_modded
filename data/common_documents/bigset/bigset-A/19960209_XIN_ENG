<HEADLINE> U.S. Productity Up by 1.4 percent in 3rd-quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The productivity of the
American workplace rose at a 1.4 percent annual rate during the
July-September quarter, a weaker pace compared with the previous
three months, a U.S. Labour Department report said today.
</P>
<P>
The report said nonfarm productivity is down from its initial
estimate of 2 percent and less than half the 3 percent rate during
the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
The latest productity figure was revised from a 2 percent
increasing rate previously reported.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the report showed that the inflation remained
muted. Unit labour costs, typically two-thirds the cost of a
product, rose at a 2.4 percent annual rate, little changed from
2.3 percent in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that productity rose just 0.5 percent in
1994, up from 0.2 percent in 1993 but much slower than 1.9 percent
rate of earlier estimates.
</P>
<P>
Productivity is defined as output per number of hours worked
and is a primary measure of the nation's living standards and
business competitiveness. Increases mean companies are making
their goods more efficiently and at lower costs.

"Let us be frank and say that the current service is too
large, and it has to be rationalized," said the president, adding

Huambo today to inspect the assembly work of troops of the
opposition Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Welcomes Zairean Assurance of Refugee Repatriation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Friday said it welcomes the
assurance from the Zairean authorities of commitment to voluntary
repatriation of Rwandan refugees.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond told a press briefing this
morning:"We welcome the re-affirmation of voluntary repatriation
from Zairean authorities", who said they are committed to it.
</P>
<P>
He said this against the background that Zairean authorities
are going to proceed with the administrative closure of certain
refugee camps very soon, namely Kishusha and Kimbumba, with a
population of up to 240,000 people.
</P>
<P>
According to him, those who do not want to return to Rwanda can
choose to remain in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also expressed welcome to Zaire's assurance that
the some 250-head troops it plans to deploy around the camps
selected to be closed down will be strictly limited to the task of
controlling movements in and out of camps.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Zairean authorities have promised that the
troops will be under very strict orders prohibiting their entry
into the camps.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the assurances because we certainly do not want to
see a repeat of chaotic situation that we faced in Northern
Burundi", said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
According to him, in the Ntamba Camp in Northern Burundi, there
occurred certain level of military pressure on the refugees, who
were given a choice between returning to Rwanda or going to
another camp.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers entered the camp at night. No violence took place but
the threat was clear, the spokesman said, adding that "Anyway, we
don't want to see the situation occur again."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zairean security contingent that have been
deployed in the camps since last February will continue to stay
carrying out their traditional tasks of maintaining order,
preventing intimidation and protecting humanitarian workers.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Zairean move to close the camps
of Kishusha and Kimbumba is in accordance with the agreements
reached at a tripartite meeting between Zaire, Rwanda and UNHCR
held in last December in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The three parties at the meeting agreed to make efforts to
encourage voluntary returns to Rwanda with focus being placed on
certain camps with an aim of the eventual and progressive closure
of camps.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the spokesman said that the Rwandan government has
confirmed its readiness to receive the returnees and is
considering measures to facilitate the return of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Elk to Be Shipped to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 9 (xinhua) -- A total of 30 Canadian elk will
be shipped to the United States next week following the
reintroduction of wolves into the south neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The elk will be transported to Kentucky, 3,300 kilometers away
from Alberta province next Monday in an effort to replace huge
herds long-since extinct, according to the Canadian daily Globe
and Mail today.
</P>
<P>
The animals, 22 females and eight males, will become the first
seen in Kentucky since 1850, when they were hunted out by
settlers. They will be bundled onto trucks and transported to a
national recreation area on the border between Kentucky and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
Last year, wolves also from Alberta were reintroduced into
Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. The move angered American
ranchers who were afraid the wolves would kill their livestock.
</P>
<P>
Steve Bloemer, a Kentucky wildlife biologist, said Canadian elk
are preferred to elk from other parts of the United States because
they are known to be disease-free. The Canadian elk also closely
resemble the species that was hunted out.
</P>
<P>
The elk that once roamed Kentucky were known as eastern elk,
and traveled a range bounded by Quebec, Canada in the north and
Alabama, the United States in the south. They could also be seen
as far west as present-day Kansas City in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Nears Buy of U.S. AMRAAM Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand may be permitted to
buy up to 50 U.S.-made AIM-120 Advanced Medium range Air-to-Air
Missiles (AMRAAM) instead of a planned dozen, the latest U.S.
Defense News weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted U.S. Air Force officials as saying that the
United States had prepared a letter of agreement to replace an
earlier, controversial deal for eight AMRAAMs and four training
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Thai government officials insisted on the missiles as part of
the plan to buy F/A-18 fighters from U.S. McDonnell Douglas
Aerospace despite concerns by U.S. State Department officials and
arms control advocates that that release of the new technology
could fuel an arms race in the region, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement, like the previous missile deal, stipulates
that actual deliveries will not be permitted until a like missile,
such as the Russian-built AA-12, is introduced in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon notified on January 25 the U.S. Congress of the
potential 578 million U.S. dollars sale of 8 F/A-18 C and D model
aircraft to Thailand, a package that also would include five
Harpoon air-to-surface missiles and spare aircraft engines.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has 30 days from the notification, or until
February 24, to issue an objection to the proposed F/A-18 sale.

<HEADLINE> U.S. General Pledges to Hit Back Any Threats to IFOR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A top U.S. military officer
today warned that the U.S.-led NATO Bosnian peace implementation
force (IFOR) would take strong actions against any threats to IFOR
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I find any threats IFOR to be gross violation of the Dayton
agreement," U.S. head of the joint chiefs of staff John
Shalikashvili told reports accompanying his trip in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. general is inspecting the American ground forces in
the northern Bosnian city of Tuzla. The 20,000-strong U.S. force
is part of the 60,000 NATO IFOR enforcing the U.S.-brokered
Bosnian peace accord reached in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili made the remarks when commenting the latest
development of tensions in the implementation of the peace treaty.
The Bosnian Serb army has suspended contacts with the NATO force
and its leaders have threatened to retaliate against Muslim-Croat
federation after it arrested two Serb officers in war crimes
investigations.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who thinks they can threaten IFOR and consider that a
minor issue is flat wrong," he said. "We will not hesitate to be
very resolute with anyone who in fact threatens us."
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili flies to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo later
today to meet with NATO military officers and Bosnian Muslim-led
government leaders to review the development in implementing the
peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Defense Minister Reiterates Demonstration Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Defense Minister
Mohsen Dalloul today reiterating a government ban on
demonstrations, saying that the government is responsible for the
public security and will not compromise on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a dialogue to discuss the demand to lift the ban,
the minister underlined that the government gives a top priority
to the public security and will not let any one to shake it.
</P>
<P>
Labor and student unions in Lebanon have threatened to stage a
nation-wide strike on February 29 to protest against economic and
media policies of Prime Minister Rafik al Hairi's government.
</P>
<P>
Dalloul was quoted by the state-run National News Agency as
stressing that the demonstration ban, which the government signed
last July to foil a scheme of the powerful Confederation of Labor
Unions to stage demonstrations all over the country, is still
"effective."
</P>
<P>
"The decision of the Council of Ministers forbidding the
demonstrations on the lebanese lands is still effective and the
government will not go back on it," the defense minister
announced in a dialogue with folks at the town of Niha in Zahle
area in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the government will not let the security
be shaken under any excuse and in any circumstance "since
the security is the base for all the things and there is
no meaning for any reconstruction and building without the
security."
</P>
<P>
"The security, then the security, then the security," the
defense minister declared, "we do not let any side destroy
the security."
</P>
<P>
"If the workers, teachers and university students have any
demand, they can announce it in a form and by a means
they see suitable, keeping away from any attempt to shake
the stability and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The strike is their right, the demand is their right, and
announcing their demands is their right as well, but the dialogue
is the ideal means to realize these demands," Dalloul said.
</P>
<P>
"The government has stretched out its hands to all the
slices in the Lebanese community and it is making efforts to
fulfill the social causes," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
In a popular rally in a coastal luxury hotel in west
Beirut Wednesday, opposition leaders, labor unionists and
student activists announced February 29 is a "national day for
defending freedoms and daily bread," and decided to observe a
nation-wide strike and stage demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The move was seen as an escalation in the confrontation
between the government and a wide-ranged opposition forces
clamoring for better economic conditions and freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
When the government was determined to adopt a law organizing
the country's broadcast media industry, which will limit private
TV stations to six and radio stations to 12 from the present
level of over 40 private televisions and more than 60 radio
stations, the confrontation loomed.
</P>
<P>
Initial steps toward a showdown have already been taken by
about 1,600 teachers of the Lebanese University who staged a
two-day strike earlier this week and plan another strike next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Teachers of private and public schools have already scheduled

<HEADLINE> Angola Welcomes Extension Of UN Peacekeeping Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Angola's political parties
today welcomed a three-month extension of the United Nations
peacekeeping mission in the war-torn southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democratic Party said the move reflected the
confidence of the international community on the Angolan peace
process, calling for commitment of both the government and the
former rebel UNITA movement.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial-Agricultural Youth Alliance said three months
may not be enough for the full implementation of the Angola Peace
Accord.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Unity Party said speedy disarmament and
camping of the UNITA rebels are possible in a three-month period.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Opposition Alliance formed by 13 opposition
parties said the Security Council decision was "positive",
holding the view that the three-month extension, though short,
would "push" for an early end of the Angola peace process.

<HEADLINE> Army Ready to Control Security in South Lebanon: Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Defense Minister
Mohsen Dalloul today urged Israel to withdraw its troops from
South Lebanon, emphasizing that the Lebanese Army is "ready" to
control the security in the south.
</P>
<P>
The official National News Agency quoted the defense minister
as promising that there will be no guerrilla attacks against
Israel launched from Lebanon after a pullout of the Israeli
forces from Lebanon's land.
</P>
<P>
In a dialogue with local residents at the town of Niha in Zahle
 area in eastern Lebanon Thursday night, the defense minister
called for the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon in conformity
with U.N. Security Council resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Dalloul described a recent Israeli proposal on an conditional
withdrawal from Lebanon before an agreement with Syria as one
of "maneuvers aimed at splitting the Lebanese rank and at
attempting to cause a division between Lebanon and Syria."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres announced at an
Israeli-occupied enclave in south Lebanon last Tuesday that the
Jewish state "would not wait for the negotiations with the
Syrians" and it would withdraw its forces from Lebanon if
the Lebanese government made a "real attempt to guarantee that
there will be just one government, just one army and peace
and security."
</P>
<P>
"He (Peres) said he wants the (Lebanese) government to be
one, is there more than one government in this country?" the
Lebanese defense minister said.
</P>
<P>
"He also said he wants the (Lebanese) army to be united, but
we have only one army which enjoys a confidence by all the
Lebanese citizens," he added.
</P>
<P>
"When Peres says he wants a united army, the (Lebanese)
army is united, and if he by means of his disgusting
maneuver intends to create interior differences and to plant
the differences between Lebanon and Syria, we are attentive to
this wicked maneuver and will not be driven to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel wants to withdraw, who prevents that?" he
asked. "There is a decision issued by the biggest institution in
the world, that is the U.N. Security Council which prescribed to
Israel the withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese lands in
compliance with the resolution 425, and Israel should implement
this resolution."
</P>
<P>
"On the security in Lebanon, however, we have announced for
times and repeated that the Lebanese army is ready to control the
security in the south and there will never be an operation
against Israel launched from Lebanon's land."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Lebanese resistance movement is
"carrying out its duty" in waging a guerrilla warfare in south
Lebanon and there have been "many great sacrifices in the
resistance against the occupation."
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that when the occupation ends, there will not be
an (guerrilla) operation against any side launched from the
Lebanese land.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Arrives in Egypt for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Head of the PLO Political
Department Farouk Kaddoumy arrived here this afternoon from Iraq
for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on negotiations
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Egypt, Kaddoumy will also hold
talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said upon arrival that his visit to Iraq was aimed at
getting to know the sufferings and ordeals of the Iraqi people as
a result of the U.N. sanctions imposed on the country for its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Baghdad was also to express the support of the
Palestinian people to the Iraqis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Signs indicated that there were tangible improvements in the
Iraqi economic conditions, said Kaddoumy.
</P>
<P>
The current Arab atmosphere, he said, shows there is hope that
Arab reconciliation could be realized.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumy has expressed opposition to the direction the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks are moving. He boycotted the PLO
Executive Committee meeting held in the Egyptian resort town of El
Arish on February 5-6.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Schools Threatened with Industrial Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Three main teaching unions in
Britain have raised the threat of industrial action in reaction to
their phased pay increase, it is reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The British government decided on Thursday that teachers get
2.75 percent pay rise in April, with a further one percent in
December.
</P>
<P>
The three teaching unions considered that the phased pay award
for teachers of 3.75 percent meant further increases in class
sizes, redundancies and shortages of staff in key subjects.
</P>
<P>
Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association
of Schoolmasters/Union of women Teachers, said that the staging of
the award was bound to accelerate those demands and phasing in the
pay rise could lead to teachers phasing out their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of
Head Teachers, branded the award as "outrageous", adding that the
government's refusal to fund the award in full sacrificed teachers
on the altar of its public sector borrowing policy.
</P>
<P>
Both the Association of Teachers and Lecturers and the National
Union of Teachers accused the government of "hypocrisy".
</P>
<P>
The main teaching unions all hold their annual conferences
around the Easter Weekend in early April. It is predicted that
industrial action is likely to be discussed then.

<HEADLINE> New York Largest Union Approves 5-Year Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The 120,000-member New York
City's largest municipal employees union announced Thursday its
rank-and-file approval of a five-year contract with the city that
promises job security but freezes wage increase for two years.
</P>
<P>
The contract agreement was reached in early November between
the city authorities and the District Council 37 of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. They agreed
the terms of wage freeze in the first two years and a pay hike of
13 percent in the last three years during the contract period.
</P>
<P>
The freeze angered many union members who threatened to veto
the contract especially after the City Council approved a 28
percent increase in salaries of city officials.
</P>
<P>
The month-long vote with a 57 percent to 43 percent in favor of
the contract, though divided the union members, supported Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani's strategy for a peace with the labor during
his re-election.
</P>
<P>
But it adds pressure to the 90,000-member United Federation of
Teachers, which rejected a similar contract with the city
authorities in its rank-and-file vote early December.
</P>
<P>
The teachers' union leaders have called for new talks on a new
contract, but the Mayor has refused, saying he will not offer the
teachers a better pact than the one they rejected.
</P>
<P>
However, Sandra Feldman, the union's president, said that she
would not resubmitting the proposed teachers' contract to her
members for a second vote.
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, the teachers, whose hard position once added some
uncertainties to the fate of the contract of civilian employees,
now face an uphill fighting.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls For "Patriotism" To Fight Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today called for a "new patriotism" in the
post-apartheid era to combat crime, violence and corruption.
</P>
<P>
In his hour-long State of the Nation speech delivered to the
1996 opening sitting of Parliament in Cape Town today, Mandela
cited the danger of economic decline if the idea of "patriotism"
was ignored.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his worry over violence in the
Kwazulu/Natal Province, calling for a political solution to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
He also highlighted education, health, housing and land
reforms as key areas of development in 1996. He did not specify
detailed programs to attain these goals.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's speech met with a different reaction from the main
political parties.
</P>
<P>
His African National Congress said it would mobilise millions
of supporters behind the crucial elements of the patriotism
outlined by the president.
</P>
<P>
But Democratic Party leader Tony Leon said his party was
deeply disappointed by the apparent lack of any comprehensive
anti-crime program in Mandela's speech.
</P>
<P>
The National Party said Mandela's speech was full of promises,
many of which were just the same as those in last year's State of
the Nation speech.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Leaders Launch Attack on EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Some of the UK's most senior
business leaders have launched a scathing attack on European
economic and monetary union (EMU), arguing it would bring higher
interest rates and unemployment and harm business competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
In a 48-page report published today, 14 company director refute
claims that British business wants EMU.
</P>
<P>
The report, sponsored by the European Research Group of MPs,
will open a rift in British business over the single currency
issue.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, claims that a recent survey
by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which found a
majority of businessmen in favor of EMU, was "contentious, full
of loaded questions and dismissed" by serious observers.
</P>
<P>
"The CBI is not the exclusive voice of British business," says
the report. "There is an alternative business view which is
rapidly growing in strength. A monolithic European economic
authority would do great damage to business interest."
</P>
<P>
The report claims the benefits of a single currency such as
lower exchange costs and stable money have been overstated and EMU
is more likely to produce higher interest rates and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"A single currency would impose enormous costs on UK
businesses, costs that would dwarf the benefits from reduced
transaction costs and exchange rate uncertainty," says Tim
Melvill-Ross, director general of the Institute of Directors.

<HEADLINE> UK Tories' Political Popularity Improved: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- It is the first time during the
two years that Britain's ruling conservative party's political
popularity has been improved as shown by a Gallup poll published
in today's Daily Telegraph newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Now the Opposition Labour's big poll lead of 39.5 points has
tumbled to 26.5 points, while support for the Tory party has risen
by seven points.
</P>
<P>
Gallup's latest poll puts Labour on 54.5 percent, the
Conservatives on 28 percent and the Liberal Democrats unchanged on
14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll also records a sharp improvement in the "feel-good
factor" expected by the Conservative government for a long time,
namely, voters' expectations of whether their financial situation
will over the next year.
</P>
<P>
It is considered here that Labour's 26.5 point lead is still
substantial but its lead drop will be a considerable boost to
Conservative morale.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to party workers in London on Thursday night, the
embattled Prime Minister John Major declared that the "tide is now
turning" in favor of the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Major turned on his backbench critics, warning them that his
party would not tolerate dissents as the election approached.
</P>
<P>
"There is no room for fainthearts in our party. Those who think
we cannot win should leave," he said.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the latest Gallup poll, Major was seeking to exploit
his new-found authority to demand discipline and unity among Tory
parliament members, commented the Times newspaper.

structural adjustment in Cameroon.

Development Association (IDA), a concessionary affiliate of the
World Bank for the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The structural adjustment credit is intended to improve public
finance management, settle domestic debt, and restructure the
financial sector in the African country. Key components of the
program include: public finance which will strengthen fiscal
revenues and incorporate improvements in the tax and incentive
system to encourage environmentally sustainable growth and
resource use as well as the financial sector, which will reform
the regulatory framework and restructure key banks and insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
The credit contains standard IDA terms of 40-year maturity,
including 10 years of grace without interest charge but a 0.5
percent commitment fee on undisbursed credit balances.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales in Britain Continue to Rise in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- British retailers reported
further strong growth in sales last month, suggesting that the
revival in high-street spending since the autumn may be
continuing.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) latest monthly
distributive trades survey shows today that the sharp improvement
in retail sales in December, due in part to early new year price
cutting, was repeated last month.
</P>
<P>
The CBI's survey, covering 15,000 shops and stores, shows that
retail sales have now risen on an annual basis for four successive
months, after a year of uneven volume growth.
</P>
<P>
In January, the balance of retailers reporting an increase in
sales volumes, those registering a rise against those recording a
fall, stayed at 31 percent, sharply up on the minus 2 percent
recorded for the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
The CBI research also paints a rosy picture of prospects for
this month.
</P>
<P>
Forty one percent of retailers polled in the distributive
trades survey said they expected a further pick-up this month,
against seven percent predicting a downturn.
</P>
<P>
Grocers, chemists, and footwear retailers saw the highest rises
in sales volumes compared with a year ago, while confectionery,
tobacco and newspaper outlets saw their first fall since February
1994, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
CBI officials said February would provide a key test of
consumer activity, with shops hoping to draw in customers without
big discount sales.
</P>
<P>
The early indicator about January business and the improvement
in confidence will provide welcome relief for Kenneth Clarke, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is banking on an increase in
consumer spending to help provide a stronger platform for economic
growth.

<HEADLINE> UK Nurses Furious at Unfair Pay Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- British nurses have threatend to
take industrial action after learning they had been left at the
big gap between their two percent of pay rise and the rise above
3.2 percent inflation rate for other sector workers.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided that judges, military staff,
teachers and doctors all receive pay rise above 3.2 percent
inflation rate, and some up to 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the 450,000 nurses have been guaranteed only two percent
and furthermore, like last year, they are the only group who face
pay negotiations with local health authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Royal College of Nursing described the deal as "derisory".
</P>
<P>
The College's spokeswoman Joanne Rule said her colleagues would
want to know why they were not worth as much as teachers and
doctors, particularly in view of plans to encourage them to take
on more of the work of junior doctors.
</P>
<P>
"Nurses actually care more about being treated fairly than the
exact level of the rise, and this is totally unfair," she
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The big health union Unison denounced the nurses' deal as
"totally inadequate".
</P>
<P>
Unison's spokesman Malcolm Wing warned that staff would
continue to leave the service in drove.
</P>
<P>
And all the unions in the public National Health Services would
be meeting next Monday to discuss plans for a nationally
co-ordinated campaign against the deal and there would inevitably
be industrial action, he added.

<HEADLINE> WHO Leads Yellow Fever Vaccination Campaign in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A mass vaccination campaign
launched in late November to control a yellow fever outbreak in
Liberia has succeeded in vaccinating almost one million people in
the war-torn west African country, the World Health Organization
(WHO) which is leading the campaign said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, the largest ever emergency vaccination
campaign against yellow fever have now vaccinated nearly 80 percent
of the original target of 1.3 million people. International
organizations expect to complete their vaccination activities by
the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The campaign has almost completely halted further spread of
yellow fever, WHO experts said.
</P>
<P>
At the peak of the current outbreak, between November 7 and
December 15, there were a total of 356 reported cases and nine
confirmed deaths, all of them in or around the port city of
Buchanan in Grand Bassa County. Fewer than 20 cases have been
reported since then in scattered rural areas with one additional
death, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
There is no specific treatment for yellow fever, a serious
public health risk throughout subtropical Africa. The WHO is
particularly concerned that the abundance of mosquito vectors in
many urban centers of Africa, combined with increased
international travel, may cause outbreaks of the disease to
quickly spread and develop into large-scale epidemics.
</P>
<P>
Once an outbreak occurs, the most effective way to keep it from
spreading is emergency mass vaccination, supplemented in some cases
by vector control efforts, according to WHO experts.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Implement Water Rationing Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A severe drought suffered
during the last several months on this eastern Mediterranean
island has prompted the authorities here to implement a water
rationing plan.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Costas Petrides met with other officials
Thursday to review the situation in the light of the continuing
drought.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to take water conservation measures, aimed
at ensuring a water supply well into 1997.
</P>
<P>
These include a 10 percent cut in supplies to all water
development departments, municipalities and communities, 30-40
percent restrictions on cultivated land with seasonal crops,
strict implementation of the law governing excessive use of water
and the launching of a campaign to get the public to save the
precious resource.
</P>
<P>
According to local meteorologists, the October-December 1995
period witnessed one of driest season in this century. The
average rainfall from the beginning of October to the end of
January was about 103 mm or 69 percent of normal.
</P>
<P>
During the month of January, the total water flow into the
island's dams reached just 12 million cubic meters bringing the
total quantity of water in the dams to 110 million cubic meters or
41 percent of capacity.
</P>
<P>
During the same period last year, the total quantity of water
in the dams was 170 million cubic meters or 63.3 percent of
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The island relies on rainfall to save water for
consumption. The water storage capacity of the dams on the island
has increased from 6 million cubic meters in 1960 to 300 million
cubic meters at present.

BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The China Film Import and
Export Corporation (CFIEC) will keep its monopoly on importing of
major foreign movies.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, some Chinese film studios will be allowed to
distribute some foreign movies as an award for their efforts at
making better movies domestically.
</P>
<P>
Chinese film studios are not allowed, however, to import
foreign movies directly. They "should be introduced by the CFIEC,"
Wang Zengfu, vice-president of the company said, adding that it is
beneficial for China to control its film market.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that China has imported 11 major foreign
movies since 1994, such as the Fugitive, Rumble in the Bronx, True
lies, and Speed.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the imported movies have brought more Chinese
audiences back to the cinema, and have gotten large box-office
receipts.
</P>

China is expected to continue to import ten better foreign
movies this year, including Outbreak and First Strike, sources

<HEADLINE> China Sweeps Men's Figure Skating in Winter Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Guo Zhengxin led the
Chinese skaters to a medal sweep in the men's figure skating at
the Asian Winter Games on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Guo, hailing from Harbin, took his first gold medal in an
international competition with 2.5 factored points after the day's
free skate.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Min, runner-up of the Asian championships last December
in Tokyo, came out second in an identical points with Guo. He
fell in his first quadruple jump in the free skate.
</P>
<P>
Zhang led the short progam, but he got less first place votes
from seven judges and had to settle for the silver.
</P>
<P>
"I was disppointed with my performance and this silver medal,"
Zhang said. "I failed to finish my two quadruple jumps because I
was not concentrated. I will do my best to win over my teammate
next time."
</P>
<P>
Li Xia, fourth-place finisher of the world youth championships
last year, placed third with 4.0 pionts. He was followed by
Japanese Naoki Shigematsu, Yosuke Takeuchi and Gaku Aiyoshi.
</P>
<P>
Guo's victory was a little surprising for more than 2,000 fans
here, but never for the Chinese team leader Ren Hongguo, who said
his three skaters all had chance to win.
</P>
<P>
"All of these three were capable to claim the title, which
depended on who had better form during the competition," Ren said.
"The result showed China's dominance of the men's figure skating
in Asia."
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Guo, who finished third overall at the world
youth championships, skated only third in the short progam after
teammates Zhang and Li. He came back mainly because of his
nailing two triple axel jumps.
</P>
<P>
"I am so happy to win the gold medal with such a good
performance," he said. "That is a reward to my hard training for
years."
</P>
<P>
The figure skating, cut from the last games which conflicted in
schedule with the world championships, also saw China's world
champion Chen Lu lead the women's singles in the short program and
Kazakhstan's ice dancing pair Elizaveta Sgtekonikova and Dmitri
kazarlyga remain first after the original skate.
</P>
<P>
The titles for the women's singles, pairs and ice dancing
will be decided on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Japan Declares De Facto Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's battered economy is on
the recovery track, the Japanese government said today in its
monthly economic report.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is beginning to show signs of recovery again,
albeit moderately," the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said in its
carefully worded economic report for February.
</P>
<P>
The report uses the word "recovery" for the first time in half
a year. The word was removed from September's report to reflect
the negative effects of the yen's rapid appreciation against the
U.S. dollar since last March.
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled from data through December, the latest
available, said improvements have been seen in industrial
production, real estate, public projects, exports and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Clear signs of economic recovery, the EPA report said, are
shown in an upward trend of investment by companies -- led by
manufacturers in particular -- and of housing construction spurred
by low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But the EPA remains cautious about too much optimism, citing
concerns of a severe employment situation.
</P>
<P>
Although the ratio of job offers to job seekers is on the
increase, the jobless rate remained the highest on record at 3.4
percent, the EPA report said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that worsening unemployment may drag down
consumer spending, since actual spending by households decreased
in October and November.
</P>
<P>
To spur stable medium and long-term growth, the agency urged
deregulation of the financial sector, expansion of domestic
demand, disposal of bad loans, promotion of effective use of land
and an overall reform of the nation's economic structure.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Kills Six in Predawn Shooting in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A gunman opened fire on a
group of municipal workers in a southern U.S. city early today,
killing five before committing suicide, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, described as a disgruntled former city employee,
also seriously injured another in the predawn shooting in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida.
</P>
<P>
"Seven people have been shot," said police Maj. Al Ortenzo.
"Six are dead. One of the six dead is confirmed to be the
shooter."
</P>
<P>
News reports from Fort Lauderdale said a witness identified the
gunman as a former city employee who was fired several months ago
for failing a drug test. But police said they were still trying to
confirm the identities of all involved.
</P>
<P>
"They had a drug test and he was fired because he tested
positive on the drug test. He made threats to come back and do
things," said the witness, who was among the group of municipal
workers.
</P>
<P>
The gunman opened fire as the municipal workers gathered at a
trailer office near the coastal city's famed beach to begin their
daily shift of cleaning the beach.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: GM Looks to Asia-Pacific for Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The giant US automaker, General
Motors (GM) Corp. will count on the Asia-Pacific region for its
future growth.
</P>
<P>
GM spokesman Andrew Andersz said here today, "the GM is
investing serious money in the region because it knows that it is
here where its growth is going to be in the future."
</P>
<P>
The GM currently controls five percent of the regional market
for passenger cars and commercial vehicles and aims to meet about
10 percent of the estimated 16 million vehicle demand by the year
2005.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its foothold in the robust regional car market,
the GM plans to establish a regional manufacturing base either in
Thailand, or the Philippines in addition to existing assembly
plants in Australia, China and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Andersz stressed that the site of the proposed regional base
was still a toss between the Philippines and Thailand, saying that
a final decision would not be made until mid-April.
</P>
<P>
The proposed plant will assemble about 180,000 passenger cars
yearly, and require up to one billion US dollars in investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, David Jerome, a leading negotiator for the GM's
regional vehicle projects, said that results of feasibility
studies identify "two countries that we feel are equally viable
for us to consider."
</P>
<P>
A final site decision would be based on "a variety of economic
and non-quantifiable factors," including the package of incentives
and the general investment climate, he added.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Thursday that the GM had filed last week an
application with Thailand's Board of Investments (BOI).
</P>
<P>
The GM is considering filing a similar application with the
Philippines' BOI, according to Andersz.
</P>
<P>
Top GM executives have checked out several sites in the
country, including the Subic Bay Freeport Zone and a former
Vietnamese refugee center in Bataan Province.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection Remains National Policy: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said that China
will adopt an even stricter policy on environmental protection in
the last five years of this century.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the fight against pollution will still
focus on reducing the harmful effects of water, noise, and air
pollution, and refuse, by using effective environmental monitoring
and protection techniques.
</P>
<P>
During a talk with the chief of the Environment and Resources
Protection Committee of the National People's Congress, Li said
the environment should be protected in accordance with the law,
and governments at all levels should make a greater effort at
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that the environment is a matter of overall
importance and is related to economic and social development, and
that since China's reform and opening-up policy of 1978, the
country has scored rapid economic development. At the same time,
its environment has generally not suffered from severe pollution
due to effective protection measures.
</P>
<P>
However, Li added, pollution has become a major problem in some
areas and is affecting people's daily lives and health because of
neglect of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The premier emphasized that China should first of all change
its economic growth mode to protect the environment as a part of
national policy, and that the traditional methods of growth with
their high input, high consumption, but with low efficiency and
high contamination simply cannot be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that government at all levels incorporate
environmental protection as part of their social progress plans
for the next five years, guided by the 21st Century Agenda, the
environmental protection plan the Chinese government has promised
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He also called on businesses, as well as governments at all
levels, to inject more funds into environmental protection
projects.

<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called for an acceleration in the use of scientific and
technological knowledge across the country.
</P>
<P>
If a nation lacks sufficient scientific knowledge, it is bound
to fail in the world, Jiang said in a meeting with delegates to
the national working conference on popularizing scientific and
technological knowledge here.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng, and Hu Jintao, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party,

</P>
<P>
Jiang said that, as a developing country, China must increase
the scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation to produce
more skilled personnel for a successful transformation of both the
economic system and the economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology should be relied on not only for
development of material civilization but also for promotion of
socialist culture and ideology progress, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Officials at all levels should have a deeper understanding of
scientific and technological knowledge, and create better
conditions for the work of disseminating the knowledge, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that it is necessary to crack down on
superstition and criminal offences that masquerade as
pseudoscience and go against the law.
</P>
<P>

than 500 delegates from across the country.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Vows to Promote Carpet Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba said today that his government would try to protect
and promote the country's carpet industry, one of the major
pillars of Nepal's national economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Nepalese Central Carpet Industry
Association here today, Deuba said that the decline in quality of
Nepalese carpets had hampered its exporting performance.
</P>
<P>
He urged the carpet industry to pay special attention to the
quality of their products.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the carpet industry was a major source of Nepal's
foreign exchange income and created large employment opportunities
in the country, Deuba said that the government was considering to
give more authority to the industry.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that he would personally extend his
cooperation to solve the problems facing the industry after his
visit to India.
</P>
<P>
Deuba is scheduled to pay a week-long official visit to India
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Low quality, use of the hazardous azo dyes and the alleged
involvement of child labor are among the main problems facing the
Nepalese carpet industry, which has been suffering from the
continuous decline in export in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources, the carpet industry in Nepal has
provided employment to about 300,000 people and earns some 2
million US dollars worth of foreign exchange every year for the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Mediterranean port of
Alexandria remained closed for the second consecutive day today
due to bad weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency (MENA) said that fishing also
stopped at the port, which was closed Thursday after a severe
sandstorm swept Egypt.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 ships are stranded outside the port, waiting for
an improvement of weather conditions and resumption of navigation,
MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The authorities of the port, the largest one of its kind in the
country, have requested ships outside and inside the port to take
necessary precautions in the face of strong wind.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, sand covered a number of squares in Alexandria as
a result of the sandstorm, which almost dimmed the vision
completely at the entrance of the Alexandria-Cairo highway.
</P>
<P>
Several flights coming from abroad were redirected to other
airports as visibility was reported to be less than 150 meters at
the Cairo airport.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Police to Work for Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today urged police to work harder and create a more stable social
environment for the smooth development of the nation's reforms,
opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with participants at the 19th national conference on
public security this afternoon, Jiang said that it is a glorious
and arduous task for the police force to maintain social
stability, safeguard national security and citizens' interests.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting were Premier Li Peng and Hu Jintao,
member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, public security departments made
great achievements in keeping public order, cracking down on
criminal offences and enhancing the reform and opening-up, which
fully indicates their combat effectiveness, Jiang said, but asked
police to increase their sense of politics and awareness of state
power, and do their utmost to safeguard social and political
stability.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for public security departments to closely
follow sabotage activities of hostile elements both at home and
abroad, and take more effective measures to fight them, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is essential that the police force keep in mind the overall
interest of the country and pay great attention to the work of
maintaining public order, which has a significant bearing on both
the society and citizens' interests, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
There are many problems in public order at present, some of
them being grave and complained about by the people, Jiang said,
noting that it is important to facilitate comprehensive
administration of public order.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to discover various criminal offences timely
and crack down on them in accordance with the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng also delivered a speech at the meeting, urging
the police force to improve the quality of its personnel and do a
better job in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Li pledged that both the central and local governments will
make greater efforts over the next five years to upgrade police
equipment so as to cope with various complex circumstances
effectively.

<HEADLINE> World Champion Chen Enthrals Crowd in Winter Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Women's world figure
skating champion Chen Lu riveted a packed crowd with a nearly
perfect short program as China regained its top place with three
more golds at the Asian Winter Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Chinese nailed three triple jumps to top a
field of 12 skaters in the short program which accounts for one
third of the total score.
</P>
<P>
Chen became China's first figure skating world champion after
edging her French rival Surya Bonaly, three-straight-time world
runner-up, to once again second place in Birmingham of Britain in
March last year.
</P>
<P>
Chen, hailing from Changchun of northeastern China's Jilin
province, skated a well-choreographed program to a Chinese
traditional music "Spring Breeze".
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan's Tatyana Malinina finished second and Japanese
Hiromi Sanoi was third.
</P>
<P>
The free skate, which was worth two thirds of the total score,
will be held on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese swept the top three spots at the men's event
after Friday's free skate which was dotted with slips and
falls.
</P>
<P>
Guo Zhengxin, who placed third in Thursday's short program,
made the least mistakes to win the title.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Guo, who nailed one quadruple jump and landed
the other with the help of hand, received 2.5 factored points for
the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Overnight leader Zhang Min, who fell on a quadruple, also
received 2.5 points. He had to settle for the silver because of
less first-place votes from seven judges.
</P>
<P>
Asian ice dancing champions Elizaveta Stekonva and Dmitri
Kazarlyga of Kazakhstan led the original skate. They were
followed by Japanese pair Aya Kawai and Hiroshi Tanaka and Chinese
Zhang Weina and Cao Xiaoming.
</P>
<P>
China walked away with two more ski golds in Yabuli, some 200
kilometers north to Harbin.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Chinese Guo Dandan beat 1994 Olympic champion
Lina Cheryazova of Uzbekistan to take the women's aerials
freestyle title.
</P>
<P>
Guo, gold medalist at the 1995 All-Japan tournament, collected
145.25 points to come first, followed by her teammates Xu Nannan
and Ying Hong.
</P>
<P>
Cheryazova, who got one of Asia's three ski golds in the Winter
Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway, finished a disappointing
fifth.
</P>
<P>
China wrested its second ski gold in the women's 4x7.5-
kilometer biathlon relay with a total time of one hour, 48 minutes
39.5 seconds and Kazakhstan took the silver in 1:50:07.8.
</P>
<P>
At the men's 4x7.5-kilometer relay biathlon, Kazakhstan came
first in one hour 34 minutes and 14.7 seconds, followed by Japan
and China.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Kazakhstan has got seven ski golds, five silvers and
three bronzes while China has a record of 3-5-6.
</P>
<P>
Japan registered a 3-3-1 book with South Korea at 1-1-1.
</P>
<P>
The speedskating competition ended on Friday after Shigekazu
Nemoto won the men's 10,000 meters race, boosting Japan's
gold collection from the nine-event speedskating to five.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old university student clocked 14 minutes 34.72
seconds, bettering the Asian record of 14:46.17 set by Vadim
Sayuntin of Kazakhstan in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Japan's five golds came from the men's 500, 1,000, 1,500, 5,000
and 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
All Asian speedskating records have been shattered in the
games.
</P>
<P>
Japan downed debutant Kazakhstan 6-2 to take the women's ice
hockey curtain-raiser.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion China, whose best performance was a fourth
place in the world championship, will take on Kazakhstan in its
first game at the three-team tournament on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese six, tipped as a sure shot at the title, gave a
sigh of relief after watching Kazakhstan lost on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Kazakhstan had been wrapped in mystery," said Chinese coach
Wang Yongjun. "After Friday's game, we have known something
about them."
</P>
<P>
The women's ice hockey has been listed as a title event in the
Winter Olympics in Nagano of Japan in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Crushes Pirated Audio-Video Products To Bits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Chang Junbin, 52, drove the
brand-new Ingersoll Rand steamroller, imported from the United
States, just as he would on any other day, but Friday's work had a
different twist: Chang was rolling it over some 50,000 pirated
laser discs (LD) and other illegal audio-video products.
</P>
<P>
"It just like doing my routine job of road building," he said,
noting that he had "never watched these kinds of audio-video
programs" anyway.
</P>
<P>
A dozen foreign and Chinese journalists video-taped or took
photos of Chang's work, and several foreign reporters even climbed
up on the cabs of nearby trucks for a bird's-eye view of the
strange sight.
</P>
<P>
The crushing took place at 2:20 P.M. in an open courtyard of
the Bureau of Roads in Miyun County, on Beijing's outskirts. Eight
trucks and vans had taken two hours to transport the fake goods
here from downtown Beijing, and it took the police and workers one
hour to unload them.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese bulldozer was first used to level the mountain of
goods, then Chang followed suit with his 11-ton machine, lumbering
across the shiny items. The performance lasted for 40 minutes
before an enthusiastic audience of many local residents.
</P>
<P>
"Those counterfeit and harmful goods should meet exactly this
end excl." Yang Yong, a young worker, shouted at reporters to make
himself heard above the rumbling and crackling sounds.
</P>
<P>
On the covers of some of the fake LDs destroyed today could be
seen pictures of recent American blockbuster movies.
</P>
<P>
Huang Guangquan, an official with the Beijing Broadcasting and
Television Bureau has compared pirated and pornographic
audio-video products to opium, the difference being, he noted,
that "the opium ban a century ago still could not prevent the
nation from declining, but China today has the determination and
capability to fight piracy, and the drive will help the nation's
industries, as well as culture, science and technology to prosper."
</P>
<P>
Omiya Lee, a representative of a foreign company investing in
Beijing's Yuncheng Laser Disc Co. Ltd., a joint venture that is
located near the spot where the crushing was done, said that he
has noticed that the number of pirated LDs in south China's
Guangdong Province have been decreasing dramatically.
</P>
<P>
He added that he was quite confident now with his investment in
authorized LDs here, but, he understands China when it says,
"radically eliminating piracy will be an arduous, difficult and
continuing process."
</P>
<P>
The State Press and Publications Administration noted that the
more people have been joining in exposing piracy cases. The
illegal audio-video products destroyed today were part of items
confiscated by the Beijing Municipal Government last year. China
confiscated more than 800,000 pirated and other illegal
audio-video products last year nationwide, according to the Press
and Publications Administration.
</P>
<P>
The deputy manager of Capital Cinema, Liu Yongnian, said his
cinema suffered at least 100,000 yuan (12,000 U.S. dollars) in
losses because of the piracy of one imported top-rated movie last
year.
</P>
<P>
Holly Doan, bureau chief of Canadian Television Network
Ltd. said that after watching the crushing activities: "I think
the move represents one of the ways China has adopted to
demonstrate its resolve to get rid of piracy, and one of the best
ways to warn illegal businesspersons and to educate the public."
</P>
<P>
"Most of all, I'm interested in the reaction of the US trade
delegation after they see this," she said.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Appoints Opposition Defectors "Ministers" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader
General Mohamed Farah Aideed has admitted six opposition members
into his self-proclaimed government, Radio South Mogadishu
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The radio reported Abdurahman Mohamud, the Abgals clan leader
of the opposition United Somali Congress (USC), was appointed the
Fifth Deputy President of the Aideed government.
</P>
<P>
Four other Abgals clan members were appointed Minister of
Reconstruction, Minister of Water Development, Minister of Jubba
Valley, and Deputy Interior Minister, separately.
</P>
<P>
The another was appointed Governor of Mugadishu.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Abgals clan members defected from
their USC leader, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, the major rival of General
Aideed. Ali Mahdi controls northern Mogadishu while Aideed
occupies the southern part of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The newly appointed "ministers" still stayed in northern
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Clan political analysts said the event was a major political
setback to Ali Mahdi, who had earlier enjoyed full support of his
Abgal clansmen since the outbreak of the Somali civil war in
1991.
</P>
<P>
"Armed confrontation among the Abgal subclans is insight,"
said a clan political analyst who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
"And this in turn would be more disastrous than those
inter-clan fighting along the green line that divides the
war-torn capital," he added.
</P>
<P>
So far, Ali Mahdi has not yet made any comment on the event.
But sources said the situation of northern Mogadishu was tense.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio, the six new officials of the Aideed
administration were sworn in last week in front of General
Aideed, the selfstyled President of Somalia. Aideed established a
government in southern Mogadishu last June but it has not been
recognised by the international community except Libya.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the occasion, General Aideed said he was delighted
by the joining of the newcomers from northern Mogadishu to his
"government". "Brothers can never be kept apart forever," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said with the participation of the new "ministers", his
"broad-based government" had achieved a step forward to the unity
of Somalis.

MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has recorded its
lowest trade deficit of 1.4 billion US dollars last year, the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said today.
</P>
<P>
DTI Undersecretary Cesar Bautista said the low trade deficit is
due to increased revenues earned by the country's export of goods
and services.
</P>
<P>
Exports for the 12-month period reached 17.4 billion dollars in
value and up 29 percent as compared to the 13.4 billion dollars
recorded in 1994. Bautista said the government aims to earn 21
billion dollars from exports this year.

20 percent last year and the foreign exchange reserve amounted to

<HEADLINE> Iran Pledges to Continue Islamic Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today pledged that Iran will continue the Islamic
Revolution against the wish of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Addressing worshipers in the compound of Tehran University,
Khamenei warned that the Iranian people will smash the supporters
of the United States if they see them in the country.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the people are taking an active part in political
activities and consider the Islamic Revolution as their
own, even if there are 10 superpowers like the United States,
they could not do slight harm to this revolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the strongly-worded statement on the occasion
of the 17th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Iran,
which is challenged with economic crisis and intensifying power
struggle in the regime.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Khamenei's statement indicates that
he has discovered that some executive officials want to resume
relations the United States despite the tremendous
anti-U.S. pressures at home.
</P>
<P>
According to the observers, the supreme leader is trying to
arouse people's revolutionary zeal which is fading with worsening
economy and hardships.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranians said that they do not want Islamic Revolution any
longer but seek economic revolution in a bid to get rid of
poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We should not blame the youth for their dreams," Khamenei
said. The United States is trying to either destroy or change the
Islamic Revolution in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The material power of the United States can only threaten a
regime which has come to power through coup," he added.
</P>
<P>
He warned officials of a prospect that Iran will get hurt if
the Islamic system loses popular support from the people.
</P>
<P>
"If they are able to make Iran compromise with former enemy,
the United States, this will deject all Moslems around the
world," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the West is angry at Iran because Iran sets
off many Islamic movements around the world, such as in Algeria
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The West can not suppress the Islamic movement in Algeria for
long, he noted, adding that they tried their best to make sure
Moslems in Turkey could not be able to form the government.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader said that the Israeli media networks said
that Iran is against human rights, Iran has produced atomic bombs
and Iran is against the right of women.
</P>
<P>
"These are all excuses,"
he said. "The real problem they see is with Islamic Revolution
Moslems around the world are no longer docile," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The All Stock Index on the
Shanghai stock market finished the week 2.04 percent off the close
of last week, closing at 525.12 points.
</P>
<P>
Weekly turnover was 1.752 billion yuan, or 63.3 percent of last
week's.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, listing Shuanghu Coating Materials Co. Ltd. of
central China's Hubei Province raised the index a little, but by

previous Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Chemical Fiber was listed on Tuesday, further driving
down the index, with turnover decreasing by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The index recovered slightly on Wednesday, reversing the trend,
but transactions were still sluggish.
</P>
<P>
Today, the last trading day, saw the worst turnover in the week.
</P>

NICOSIA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The huge dust from sandstorms
in Egypt and Libya has engulfed the whole of this Mediterranean
island in the last two days, making visibility difficult.
</P>
<P>
According to local meteorologists, the dust, which is blown to
the island from northern Africa by southern strong winds, will
remain over Cyprus throughout today.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the dust cloud, pollution levels in the
atmosphere have exceeded the maximum allowable by almost 600
percent from 250 mg per cubic meter to 1,450 mg per cubic meter.
</P>
<P>
No serious problems were reported in Cyprus Thursday as a
result of the dust cloud and the air traffic was normal.

<P>
However, police have warned the public to be extremely careful
when driving and not to stay out without reason.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists forecast the haze would gradually clear late
this afternoon as winds died down and rain washed the dust from
the atmosphere.

WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Her Way Versus the Washington Way
</P>
<P>
Hillary Rodham Clinton came to Washington three years ago
steeled for battle. Filled with grand plans for her husband and
herself, the new first lady also was steeped in suspicion of the
Washington culture -- from Capitol Hill to the news media, to the
permanent staff of the White House itself -- she believed was out
to thwart them.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Communications Bill Signed, And the Battles Begin Anew
</P>
<P>
President Clinton Thursday signed a sweeping bill to overhaul
the telecommunications industry, starting a new round of warfare
between the giant media and communications companies even before
the ink was dry.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor Department's New Math Deflates Productivity Gains in
Latest Revision
</P>
<P>
Productivity gains at U.S. businesses faded in the third
quarter to a revised 1.4 percent annual rate from the 2 percent
rate originally reported, partly because of a math change, the
Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- Iowans Hear Last-Minute GOP Appeals
</P>
<P>
Iowa is the mecca of the political universe this weekend as the
nine Republican presidential hopefuls and President Clinton arrive
to make last-minute appeals for votes in Monday's caucuses.
Clinton is unchallenged in Democratic voting. The outcome of GOP
voting in 2,142 precincts will be the first test of Senator Bob
Dole's claim to the title of front-runner and of publisher Steve
Forbes' strength.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Prime Minister to Visit Vatican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri is going to visit Vatican to meet Pope John Paul II on
February 17, the Beirut conservative daily An-Nahar and other
newspapers reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
The largest-circulated An-Nahar daily said that the visit is
aimed at pressing for a moderate Vatican stance on Lebanon
following a controversial message issued by a special
Vatican-sponsored Synod on Lebanon last December.
</P>
<P>
Critical of Hariri's government, the message had evoked
hostile reactions from moslem leaders and pro-Syrian political
leaders in the country, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Convened by the Pope, the synod was supposed to bolster peace
between Lebanese Christians and Moslems who had fought each other
during 15 years of civil war from 1975 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
The most controversial points in the synod's message included
a call for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied
border strip in South Lebanon, and Syrian troops who control much
of the rest of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It criticized tactics of the Lebanese government of Prime
Minister Rafik Al-Hariri in the arrest and handling of suspects,
and called for the release of political leaders, mainly those
Christians who used to be militia leaders during the civil war,
and the safe return of those in exile.
</P>
<P>
The Pope is expected to issue an Apostolic Exhortation (final
statement on the synod) later this year weighing in the synod's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Hariri reportedly will try to persuade the Pontiff to come out
with a moderate statement that would be acceptable to all the
Lebanese and help the government in its efforts to rebuild the
country and achieve national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Two spiritual leaders of Lebanon's biggest Moslem communities,
namely Sheikh Mohammed Mahdi Shamseddine of the Shiite Moslems
and Acting Mufti Mohammed Rashid Kabbani of the Sunni Moslems,
have already dispatched a common representative, Mohammed
Al-Sammak, to Vatican with a message to Pope John Paul, according
to An-Nahar.
</P>
<P>
The message included their observations about the synod's
statement, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Sammak had participated in the synod's deliberations as an
observer but had no role in drafting the statement, the daily
added.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Japan to Extend Coverage of Anti-Piracy Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has urged
Japan to amend its anti-piracy law in order to grant performers
and recordings the full 50-year intellectual property (IP)
protection to which they are entitled under new world trade rules.
</P>
<P>
Japan's newly-approved IP law provides a protection coverage to
recordings released since 1971, conflicting the Uruguay Round
principle of protection to all recordings after January 1, 1946,
the European Commission spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
All members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are required
to adjust their intellectual property legislation to protect
performers and producers for at least 50 years. A copy released in
1949, for example, would be protected until 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The commission has formally requested the Japanese Foreign
Ministry to change the new law," which cuts the IP backdating
coverage by 15 years and misses out some famous European hits like
the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, said the spokesman of the EU
executive body.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the commission may request WTO consultations, or
a full disputes panel, if Japan does not "adequately" solve the
problem.

<HEADLINE> Peres May Call Early Elections on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres might announce on Sunday his decision to hold early
elections, reports here today quoted Labor Party sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Peres's close associates advise he
make the early elections announcement everyone expects as soon as
possible, because his failure to do so at this point damages his
credibility.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Peres continues to maintain that his mind is not
yet made up, saying only that his decision will be announced by
February 15 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Peres Thursday night consulted at length with Labor Party
colleagues to weigh the feasibility of different alternatives.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were Labor Party Secretary-General
Nissim Zvilli, Interior Minister Haim Ramon, and Justice Minister
 David Liba'i. They discussed how to call for early elections and
when to schedule them.
</P>
<P>
Peres was advised not to postpone his early elections
announcement any longer, as it has become a laughing matter with a
public well aware that the decision for early elections had been
taken weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Ramon and Liba'i were each asked to prepare reports from
their ministries' perspective on the problems involved with
various election dates.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that there must be enough time to allow for new
parties to register, a procedure which takes 92 days itself. Any
election date which does not allow sufficient time could, in
Liba'i opinion, result in a High Court ruling against it.
</P>
<P>
May 28 has once again become the favorite date for early
elections as it was repeatedly mentioned in Thursday night's
meeting as the date with the least problems attached to it.

<HEADLINE> Iran Wants Good Ties with All Countries Except US, Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani has said that Iran's foreign policy is based on
friendly relations with all countries throughout the world except
the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He made the claim when he was addressing ambassadors and
representatives of foreign countries to Iran Thursday night, on
the occasion of the 17th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic
Revolution, according to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
On reasons behind Iran's refusal to recognize Israel and to
resume relations with the U.S., he noted that the Israeli regime
is "illegitimate."
</P>
<P>
As to the United States, he said, Washington's continued
hostile attitude against Iran and its all-out support for the
Israeli regime are among numerous obstacles on the way of
establishment of ties between Iran and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that moderate President Rafsanjani has got
tough in Iran's stand toward the United States. He has seldom
rejected the resumptions of the relations between Iran and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the 61-year-old president has to make his
statement strongly-worded because of anti-U.S. pressure at home
and the upcoming parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed Iran's policy of non-interference in other
countries' domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
He touched on the priorities given to establishment of
relations with Islamic states and neighboring countries, saying
the Iranian nation regards peaceful negotiations as the best
solution to settlement of regional disputes.
</P>
<P>
But, the Iranian president did not elaborate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on production of military equipments inside the
country, the president stressed, Iran does not need to purchase
arms from other countries any more.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani rejected that Iran's military exercises in the Persian Gulf
region pose a threat to other countries, saying they are
only due to the illegitimate U.S. presence in the region.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Few Palestinians For Charter Amendment Unconditionally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- In a post-elections poll,
only 6.3 percent of respondents expressed their support for
amending clauses in the Palestinian Covenant calling for the
destruction of Israel, according to JMCC, a Palestinian press
service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
30.5 percent stood against repealing the charter by the
elected 88-strong Palestinian Council while 49.1 percent said they
 would support doing so only in return for an independent
Palestinian State.
</P>
<P>
In the transitional agreement signed between Israel and the PLO
last September, Israel set conditions regarding the cancellation
of clauses in the Palestinian National Charter that call for the
destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by JMCC in cooperation with Jerusalem
Center for Women on Palestinian elections which took place on
January 20. A random sample of 1,255 people over the age of 18
were interviewed face-to-face throughout the West Bank and Gaza
Strip on February 1-2. The interviews were conducted in randomly
selected homes, and the subjects inside each home were also
selected randomly. The margin of error is 3 percent, with a
confidence level of 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 42.4 percent described the elections
as "fair" and 30.4 percent as "somewhat fair". 20.5 percent put
them as "not fair."
</P>
<P>
30.5 percent said they were optimistic about the performance
of the elected council in the future and 42.6 percent said
somewhat optimistic. 21.5 percent expressed pessimism.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 50.1 percent was optimistic about the
future of Palestine and 34.1 percent somewhat optimistic. Only
13.6 percent expressed pessimism.
</P>
<P>
On the question of whom is to be trusted most, PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat received 36.3 percent of approval, followed by
Haidar Abdul Shafi (7.8 percent), Ahmed Yassin (5.5 percent),
Hanan Ashrawi (4.1 percent), Faisal Husseini (2.1 percent) and
George Habash (1.4 percent).

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Rejects Statement of Iranian Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Government
categorically rejected a statement distributed by the Iranian
embassy in Kuwait to accredited embassies in Kuwait defaming the
State of Bahrain, it was reported today by Kuwaiti newspaper Al
Watan.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a senior Kuwaiti ministerial source, Al Watan further
reported that the Iranian embassy statement had attributed the
escalating disturbances in Bahrain to differences between Bahrein
and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The source also said that the very act of distributing the
statement was absolutely unacceptable, adding that the Iranian
embassy was duly informed that such act was contrary to diplomatic
norms.
</P>
<P>
The source indicated that the Kuwaiti government had
communicated to the Iranian embassy, through normal channels, its
strong protest against that act, reaffirming that under no
condition would it allow any acts or the distribution of any
statements touching on a sister or friendly state.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the Bahraini embassy in Kuwait had also issued a
statement contradicting that of the Iranian embassy, deeply
regretting the contents of the Iranian embassy statement which it
described as a pack of falsehoods, overt instigation and direct
interference in the internal affairs of an independent, sovereign
state.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, February 9 (Xinhua) -- World champion Chen Lu
took an easy lead after women's figure skating short progam with
three nice triple jumps on Friday in the Winter Asiad.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese girl, who won a title by fending off a close-up
challeng from Surya Bonaly of France in the world championships
last March in Birminham, Briain, topped other 11 skaters with 0.5
point edge following her excellent performance and firmly landing
on the ice.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident to win the gold medal," the 20-year-old Chen
said. "And satisfied with my skating today. I do think I have any
problem in claiming the title for my country if I skate normally
in the free skate on Saturday."
</P>
<P>
The predicted winner of the women's figure skating here skated
to a music from a Chinese song "Spring Breeze" and led her closest
rival by 0.5 point.
</P>
<P>
Tatyana Malinina of Uzebikstan finished second in the short
progam, followed by Hiromi Sano Hiromi of Japan. Hiromi's
countrywoman Fumie Suguri was fourth, with Chinese Liu Ying fifth
and Lu Meijia sixth.
</P>
<P>
Chen Lu will contest her first gold medal of the Asian Winter
Games after the free skate, which was worth two-thirds of the

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Employees and workers
engaged in Kuwait at present belong to 132 nationalities, the
biggest community of whom are the Egyptians whose number stands at
220,000, it was revealed by the Kuwaiti Minister of Social Affairs
and Labour Ahmed al-Klaib.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Kuwaiti Minister, the London-based
Arabic language weekly Al Hawadeth said in its Friday issue that
"there remain in Kuwait some 80,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Klaib said that it was difficult for the Kuwaiti citizens to
accept the return of the Palestinians who had left Kuwait after
the "stab directed against us by those brothers (Palestinians) who
had been sharing food with us."
</P>
<P>
There used to be about 400,000 Palestinians working in Kuwait
before the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Minister pointed out that the Palestinians had left
Kuwait with their own accord, underlining that Kuwait was still
fighting for the Palestinian cause.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
set up another panel today to draft a peace plan to settle the
Chechen issue, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The group, or commission, which was established after a meeting
of the Presidential Council earlier today, is to sum up all the
proposals voiced at the meeting over the Chechen solution.
</P>
<P>
Emil Paine, a member of the Presidential Council, was named to
head the 12-member panel.
</P>
<P>
"So many interesting proposals have been voiced at the meeting
of the Presidential Council which differ from those seven variants
that I have already mentioned," Yeltsin told reporters in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to create a panel of the Presidential Council
additionally to the commission of (Prime Minister) Viktor
Chernomyrdin," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Yeltsin said he had received seven variants of the
Chechen settlement and that he had set up a commission headed by
Chernomyrdin to handle them.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Television Pays Record Price for Nagano Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's broadcasting networks
will pay a record 37.5-million-U.S. dollar for the television
rights to the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics, organizers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The deal was made by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
and Japan Consortium (JC), consisting of the Japan Broadcasting
Corp. (NHK) and other major commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
It is the highest price paid by Japanese broadcasters for any
Winter Games and almost triple the 12.7 million U.S. dollars paid
for the Lillehammer Games in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"It's the sum that the Nagano Olympic organizing committee is
satisfied with," Makoto Kobayashi, director general of the
committee, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We still have negotiations for television fees with other
regions, including Asia, but with this agreement, we can almost
estimate the total income for the Games."
</P>
<P>
The price was far less than the 50 million U.S. dollars
requested by the IOC in negotiations since December however. The
consortium had originally offered 20 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Nagano organisers face financial problems because inflation
and the yen's appreciation against the dollar has taken the
expected cost of the 1998 Games from an initial estimate of 76
billion yen (716 million U.S. dollars) to around 100 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
"We are not satisfied with the broadcasting fees, but we
decided to agree," said Akira Saito of NHK. "Before we started
negotiations, the IOC had already agreed very high deals in the
United States and Europe. We did our best."
</P>
<P>
The sum includes 23.5 million U.S. dollars for television
rights, 12 million for a special fund and two million for a
technical fund.
</P>
<P>
NHK, which had sole television rights for Lillehammer, will pay
75 percent of the fees, 50 percent of the special fund and 100
percent of the technical fund.
</P>
<P>
The organising committee will receive 60 percent of the
broadcasting fees and the IOC 30 percent. The remaining 10
percent will go to the national Olympic committee.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has sealed a 375 million U.S. dollar deal with the
U.S. network CBS, a 72 million U.S. dollar accord with the
European Broadcasting Union and a 16 million U.S. dollar fee with
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. All are record fees.
</P>
<P>
Deals with other networks also reached the highest for any
Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Australian network Channel 7 will pay 9.25 million
U.S. dollars, the South African Broadcasting Corp. 1.25 million
U.S. dollars and the Organization of the Television Lbiero
Americana 985,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total so far of 511.9 million U.S. dollars beats the
previous record of 345 million U.S. dollars at the Lillehammer
Games.

BEIRUT, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese police have unearthed
a child-selling network and arrested seven persons in the
Palestinian refugee camp of Shatila in south Beirut, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut daily An-Nahar reported that the security forces
uncovered Wednesday a "network controlling the management of
selling children," and detained seven members of this network.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the network gained an income of 7,000
U.S. dollars from its last deal of business by selling a boy they
hided in the Shatila refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
A Beirut prosecutor has been studying the files and is
scheduled to start the interrogations Saturday, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, the seven people will be sentenced to
imprisonment to two or three years with hard labor.
</P>
<P>
It said that the interrogations to be conducted by prosecutor
Rimon Aweidat will be aimed at finding out how many children the
network had sold and the sources from which they obtained these
children.

<HEADLINE> UAE Joins WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) has been approved to be a member of the World Trade
Organization, WTO, today's Emirates News reported.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based WTO Thursday accepted UAE's membership in the
Organization after the Commodities Council approved its
obligations schedule.
</P>
<P>
The membership protocol which was distributed to the concerned
member states will either be sent directly to the UAE Government
or its representative in Geneva for signature.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, one of the world's main oil producer, applied for WTO
membership in 1995 but agreement was delayed because of taxes and
other restrictions imposed by the Emirates on foreign investment
and the import of services and goods, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
The organization gave its final approval after resolving
differences over a list of goods and services taxed by the UAE,
the official Emirates News Agency, WAM reported.
</P>
<P>
With a proven oil reserve of 98.1 billion barrels, accounting
nearly 10 percent of the world total, the UAE produces 2.16
million barrels per day of crude under the OPEC current
quota. The Gulf Arab country's imports stood at some 23.22
billion dollars and exports at 25.14 billion dollars in 1995. The
UAE has the lowest customs tariffs on imports in the Gulf, not
exceeding 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The UAE expects joining the WTO would open up new markets for
their non-oil products and petrochemical exports when a
1.5-billion-dollar chemical complex will be set up in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is a member country of the Gulf Cooperation Council,
which also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar are already members of the WTO while
Saudi Arabia is still awaiting reply on its application to join
the organization and Oman is expected to follow suit soon, it was
reported.

<HEADLINE> Fake-Gem Gripes Frustrate Thai Tourism Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The problem of tourists being
cheated by lapidary factories into buying fake gems is no new
story and seems to have been going on forever in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated crackdowns by the government's Tourism
Authority of Thailand (TAT) in cooperation with the tourist police
and Tourist Assistance Center, new swindles always manage to
surface.
</P>
<P>
The TAT receives a lot of complaints about fake gems but
expressed frustration that it has no real authority to deal with
the issue.
</P>
<P>
"If the TAT had the legal power to arrest these tricky gems
traders, none of them would remain," said TAT Governor Seree
Wangpaichitr.
</P>
<P>
He said those who sell artificial gems not only face criminal
charges for fraud, but can face civil suits for overcharging.
</P>
<P>
Complaints about cheating jewelry traders far outnumber those
who have faced legal action.
</P>
<P>
Up to 15 percent of the country's lapidary factories have been
the subject of complaints, some of them minor, at one time or
another.
</P>
<P>
It is no secret that tourist guides have lucrative commission
arrangements with jewelry stores.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Furniture Export To Be Further Promoted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian furniture
industry would be expanded markedly in the next decade with its
exports greatly promoted, Malaysia's Furniture Industry Council
(MFIC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
MFIC president Hans Oh Han Cheng said in a statement that
Malaysia's annual exports of furniture are projected to increase
by more than three-fold to 6.5 billion Malaysian ringgit (about
2.6 billion US dollars) by the year 2005, from the present two
billion ringgit (about 800 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Oh said that by the year 2000, the MFIC will achieve an annual
growth rate of about 15 percent with an export turnover of four
billion ringgit (about 1.6 billion dollars) and it expects to
sustain a growth rate of 10 percent the following year until 2005.
</P>
<P>
He said the annual target for furniture exports had been set at
400 million ringgit (about 160 million dollars). It actually
recorded a high of two billion ringgit last year, compared with
1.686 billion ringgit (about 674 million dollars) in 1994 and
1.175 billion ringgit (about 470 million dollars) in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Oh said the performance was attributed to the government's
foresight in pushing and promoting the rapid development of
downstream industries in the timber-based sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the appropriate adjustments by the authorities on
exports of raw materials have spurred the growth of the furniture
industry and provided excellent opportunities for its rapid
expansion.
</P>
<P>
However, the furniture makers would require further assistance
from the government to provide adequate industrial lands to
relocate the smaller enterprises in order to resolve environment
issues, Oh said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the manufacturers to undertake design and market
research of overseas markets to understand the trend and tastes of
the overseas consumers.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysian furniture will be able to fetch a higher price if
furniture makers increase their productivity by ensuring that the
stringent international requirements and standards are adhered
to," Oh added.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the MFIC would organize the Malaysian
International Furniture Fair 1996 (MIFF '96) to be held here from
March 7 to 11, 1996, with more than 200 furniture makers expected
to attend.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Gets Opinions on Government Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng presided over a
meeting here today where he solicited the opinions of people
outside the Communist Party on the draft of a Government Work
Report.
</P>
<P>
The draft report, to be submitted to 4th Session of the 8th
National People's Congress, China's top legislature, next month
for consideration, is on the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for
national economic and social development and the long-term goals
of the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of major non-communist parties attended the meeting and
put forward many constructive suggestions.
</P>
<P>
The draft report has made an analysis of China's achievements
and difficulties over the past five years, and provides feasible
and practical goals, principles, tasks, and policies for the next
15 years, they said.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the draft report pay more attention to the
issues of public order, farmland protection, the regional gap in
economic development, and education.
</P>
<P>
Li welcomed the opinions and suggestions, saying that the
central government will seriously review them and adopt the
suggestions in the report.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Violence Prevailing in Bangladesh  (by Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Violence is prevalent in
Bangladesh since the ruling party and the opposition have
different stands on the next parliamentary elections scheduled for
February 15.
</P>
<P>
After the country's duty-finished 5th parliament was dissolved
last November, the Election Commission (EC) decided to hold the
elections and finally fixed February 15 as the polling date.
</P>
<P>
While the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) government
is ready for the polls, all opposition parties insist on forming a
neutral caretaker government as prerequisite to the elections.
</P>
<P>
As the dispute remains unsettled, the programs of resisting the
polls have turned to bloody conflicts: electioneering processions
are attacked, election related posters and camps at different
places are set ablaze, candidates are harassed almost every day,
district offices of the EC or vote identity card project offices
are ransacked or set on fire.
</P>
<P>
Further more, the situation has taken on visible militant
features. On university campus, clashes are increasing. At the
end of last month, pro-opposition students in Dhaka University
traded gunshots with pro-government students and the police for
more than three hours, leaving over 100 students injured and
another 100 arrested.
</P>
<P>
Since then several campuses have turned into battlefields. The
Dhaka University authorities have had to advance the EID (a Muslin
festive) vacation by seven days to prevent more troubles during
the polling period.
</P>
<P>
The situation is worsening across the country. Hundreds of
people have been injured and hundreds of motor vehicles smashed,
damaged or burned during militant confrontations in different
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that one person was killed and at
least 50 others injured Thursday alone during clashes between the
supporters of the BNP and the opposition activists in Chittagong,
Rajshahi, Khulna, Comilla, Lalmonirhat and other districts. In
Dhaka, a ward commissioner of the City Corporation was gunned down
the same day.
</P>
<P>
Although law-enforcing agencies including the armed forces are
recovering illegal firearms, gunshots and bomb explosions surface
in every armed clash, causing many injuries and even deaths of the
people.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified gunmen fired shots at the residence of Britain's
Deputy High Commissioner to Dhaka Miriam Mcintosh at GN, a
diplomats-concentrated area. Malaysian High Commissioner's car
was also damaged by militant activists in downtown Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
As the polling date draws near, many people are worried about
more violence and bloodshed and blame both the ruling and the
opposition parties for the volatile situation.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties -- the Awami (people's)
League, the Jatiya (national) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami --
have announced a fresh agitation program to resist what they
called "one party farcical elections", which includes non-stop
48-hour countrywide strike on February 14-15, road, rail and
waterways blockade on February 13 and a mass procession towards
the prime minister's residence on February 10.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "people's curfew" will also be in force in the
country's 68,000 villages on the polling day.
</P>
<P>
But the BNP and its government are determined to conduct the
polls despite the opposition resistance. Everything has a limit
of tolerance and if it crosses the limit proper actions will
follow, warned Prime Minister and BNP chairperson Begum Khaleda
Zia.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the two sides show no sign of willingness to
retreat from their original stands and the political situation in
the country will remain very tense even if the BNP can go through
the February 15 polls, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Appeals For Unity Of Zimbabwean People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has urged the Zimbabweans to remain united to ensure
everlasting peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a presidential election campaign rally
in northern Zimbabwe on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people should remain bound by the 1987 Unity
Accord between the country's main political parties, ZANU PF and
ZAPU PF.
</P>
<P>
''If we remain united we will not have similar problems like
those of 1982 and 1985 which were finally eliminated by the Unity
Accord of 1987,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that the government would continue to extend the
hand of reconciliation to whites as long as they respected the
offer.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government would from 1996 resume its
development programs, which had been hindered by last year's
drought, which had resulted in resources being diverted to feed
the nation. enditem

<HEADLINE> PBoC, HKMA Sign MOU on Repurchase Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official of
the People's Bank of China (PBoC) today described a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) between the PBoC and the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) as "a New Year's gift to the people of Hong Kong,
especially those in the financial field".
</P>
<P>
The MOU for the repurchase of U.S. dollar government securities
was signed here today by Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the PBoC,
and Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA, in a move expected to
 strengthen the links between the two institutions.
</P>
<P>
"The MOU we signed here today demonstrates our confidence in
the prospect of Hong Kong and our determination and support in
maintaining Hong Kong as a financial center," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Hong Kong's economy, particularly finance, could
enjoy an ever larger development in the new year. And we shall
make efforts, together with the HKMA to maintain and safeguard the
economical stability in Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And the People's Bank of China fully supports the present
monetary arrangements in Hong Kong, especially the related
exchange rate system," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
The latest agreement is the sixth of its kind the HKMA has
signed with central banks in the region, Yam said. The HKMA has
already signed similar MOUs with the central banks of Australia,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very good way of demonstrating the mutual cooperation
that we can have among the central banks in the region.
</P>
<P>
"This is only one type of cooperation. Of course there are
other types of cooperation which we are talking each other. For
example, in the development of debt markets, the development of
paying systems, and in banking supervision, etc.," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the years to come, you will see a higher level of
cooperation among central banks in this region," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Entering these repurchase agreements with central banks, whose
credit standings are generally higher than those of private sector
banks, would improve the liquidity of the Exchange Fund under
minimal risk and strengthen cooperation among regional central
banks, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Yam said, "Our agreement with the PBoC is of particular
importance as it will improve liquidity of the Exchange Fund and
further strengthen our ties with the PBoC which will be of
long-term benefit to Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"This is another demonstration of China's commitment to the
implementation of the 'one country, two systems' principle," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges Zanzibar Govt To Talk With Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain today urged the
Zanzibar government to begin dialogues with the opposition Civic
United Front (CUF) to end the political crisis in the isles.
</P>
<P>
British High Commissioner to Tanzania Alan Montgomery made the
plea during talks with Tanzanian Vice-President Omar Juma.
</P>
<P>
Alan Montgomery said dialogue is "the only way out".
</P>
<P>
"Britain does not take sides in the Zanzibar conflict but it
is concerned about the growing polarisation between the Isles
government and the CUF," he said.
</P>
<P>
Juma said the precondition for the government to initiate the
dialogue is that the opposition recognizes the government led by
President Salmin Amour, saying the gesture was "essential" in
search of a political solution to the Zanzibar crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise no agenda can be established for the two sides to
talk in an environment of peace and mutual understanding," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-President refuted the idea of holding another
election before the year 2000, calling it "unconstitutional".
</P>
<P>
"The people of Zanzibar should be left to solve their own
problems without external pressures," he stressed.

BANGKOK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- An "unemployed" elephant which
went on the rampage squashed his mahout to death on Thursday in
south Thailand, local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old bull elephant ran away from its village in
Nakhon Si Thammarat province, and went on the rampage.
</P>
<P>
Its owner, Riab Phanpluek, 64, was trying to recapture it and
asked over 50 policemen and soldiers to shoot it in a bid to stop
it charging villagers and destroying their homes.
</P>
<P>
The elephant got angry and turned on its mahout, squashing him
to death and ruining five houses.
</P>
<P>
It took the police officers and soldiers 12 hours to kill the
elephant to prevent further damage.
</P>
<P>
The elephant used to be happy and liked to play with children
in the village.
</P>
<P>
It stayed at the village after losing a logging job when the
government ordered the forests closed.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) granted a banking license to the Iyo Bank
Ltd. (IYO) here today, according to an HKMA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It is the first banking license granted by HKMA since it became
 the licensing authority for all three types of authorized
institution after the Banking (Amendment) Ordinance 1995 came into
 operation on November 15 last year.
</P>
<P>
IYO is a Japanese regional bank founded in 1941 by the merger
of three local banks.
</P>

It operates 159 domestic branches mainly centered in Ehime
Prefecture and other areas of the Seto Inland Sea, with many other
 branches located in major Japanese cities such as Tokyo and Osaka.
</P>
<P>
It has an overseas branch in New York, three representative
offices in London, Shanghai and Hong Kong, and a deposit-taking
company subsidiary in Hong Kong, IYO Finance (HK) Limited.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, IYO has been operating a representative office
since June 1989 and a deposit-taking company since January 1992.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the continuing interest of foreign
banks in entering the local market reflected Hong Kong's continued
 importance and attractiveness as a major international financial
center.
</P>
<P>
There are now 185 licensed banks in Hong Kong, of which 154 are
incorporated outside the territory.

<HEADLINE> HK Property Transactions to Rise in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of Hong Kong's
property transactions in February is expected to rebound 15
percent to 10,500 despite a slowdown in the market in January,
according to today's Eastern Express.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper reported that local property analysts
attributed the climb in transactions to the improving secondary
market and sales of new developments, although last month's
transactions plunged 14 percent to 9,100 month-on-month.
</P>
<P>
Simon Cheung, a director at Centaline Agencies, predicted that
the number of property transactions this year will rise 2.5
percent to about 100,000 compared with 97,649 last year.
</P>
<P>
"The market will be more stable this year, with an average of
about 8,300 property deals each month," Cheung was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The report said the property market will be boosted by several
factors, such as the expected further softening of interest rates,
 the generous top-up mortgage finance being offered by developers,
 the banks' easing of mortgage policies and the government's
recent relaxation of the pre-sale period for incomplete flats
from nine months to 12 months prior to completion.

<P>
MAPUTO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Sosun, a Mozambican bottled
drinks firm, is being building a new production line to incease
its output.
</P>
<P>
When the new production line is put into operation next week,
the firm will increase its annual production to six million
crates from the present three million crates (each crate contains
24 bottles), said Jose Neves, a Sosun official.
</P>
<P>
Sosun, a major cold drinks supplier to the people in and
around the Mozambican capital Maputo, cannot meet the needs of
the people for cold drinks as their demand has been increasing
rapidly in recent years. Therefore, it began to build the new
production line last November.
</P>
<P>
The cold drinks market in Mozambique, especially that in its
capital, had been monopolized by the products of South Africa. It
is in recent two years that the products of the Mozambican firm
have begun to sell well in the domestic market. enditem

<HEADLINE> HK Needs More Skilled Personnel: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is in dire need of
production engineers, technologists and technicians, according to
today's Hong Kong Standard.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a recent survey conducted by the
Federation of Hong Kong Industries revealed that the largest group
 of job vacancies created from September 1994 to September 1995
was for production engineers and technologists.
</P>
<P>
The survey was done in September and October last year among
the federation's 2,008 manufacturing members.
</P>
<P>
Respondents to the survey indicate that it was most difficult
to recruit engineers and technicians mainly because applicants
generally lacked the right mix of training and experience.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next three years, we find a greater need for skilled
technical people with a decline in the demand for unskilled
operatives," director general of the federation Victoria Davies
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Results of the survey indicate that most of the new posts were
created by medium-to-large companies, with the majority
concentrated on electronic firms engaged in computer components
and telecommunications products.
</P>
<P>
The results also indicate a big demand for recruits with
China-related knowledge and experience, the report said.

<HEADLINE> hke020946 --China Has Final Say On Right of Abode In HK: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador Zhao Jihua, senior
Chinese representative on the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
(JLG), said here today that it is China that has the final say on
the question of right of abode in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"It is the business within the sovereignty of China. It is out
of the question to sign an agreement with the British side," Zhao
told a press conference after the 35th plenary session of the JLG,
which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
"But the Chinese side is willing to listen to the British side
in an informal way and at the experts level. Actually we have
taken into account some of the views from the British side," said
Zhao. "From the legal point of view, there is no need to sign a
formal agreement in the JLG on the issue."
</P>
<P>
Zhao reiterated the consistent stand of the Chinese side, which
is to seek a lenient approach while abiding by the Sino-British
Joint Declaration in 1984, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administration Region (SAR) and the Nationality Law of China.
</P>
<P>
"Since there are dozens of cases concerning the right of abode,
we need quite a long time to find a solution applicable to all,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
As to the issue of personal communication service (PCS)
licenses, Zhao Jihua said the Chinese side is still waiting for
the British side to provide comprehensive and detailed
information. Experts from both sides will exchange views on the
subject at their meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese side has always adopted a serious,
positive and responsible attitude to all economic contracts
straddling 1997.
</P>
<P>
He refuted the allegation that the JLG's discussion on
franchises is a threat on the high degree of autonomy of the
future Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
"Before July 1, 1997 when Hong Kong is still under the
administration of Britain, China has the responsibility to look
into the interest of the future SAR. Taking such a responsible
attitude, the Chinese side must exam the relevant grand
franchises, " Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
"But the Chinese side has no intention of intervening in any
economic affairs of the SAR," he added.

<HEADLINE> Rocketing Prices Brought Under Control in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Hotel chef Kamal Pandey has
found that lower prices are on the menu when he goes out shopping
in this Yangtze River city.
</P>
<P>
 Like many people in Chongqing, Pandey had to stomach
rocketing food prices in southwest China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
 The four-million urban population demanded action, saying
that a retail price index of almost 35 percent was unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
 So city officials introduced a feast of measures, all aimed
at bringing down prices.
</P>
<P>
 Now Pandey, chief chef of the Yangtze River Holiday Inn in
Chongqing, says that he is pretty impressed with the falling
prices in shops and markets.
</P>
<P>
 And the increased variety of foodstuffs is an extra sweetener.
</P>
<P>
 The view of the foreign executive has been shared by more
than four million urban dwellers who have also experienced the
steady fall in prices.
</P>
<P>
The price hike started in 1994 in Chongqing. In the first half
of last year, the price index climbed to 34.4 percent, topping
the prices list in 35 major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
High-rocketing prices became a hot topic among the local
people, who asked for tough measures to bring the prices under
control.
</P>
<P>
In the second half last year, city government officials brought
in price controls as a top priority. A price control group was
established, the emphasis being put on food grain, edible oil,
meat and vegetables which all have a direct bearing on everyday
life.
</P>
<P>
As well as shipping in vegetables and grain from other
provinces and cities, the city expanded its own vegetable
production area by 4,000 hectares. Several major wholesale markets
have also been built in the city.
</P>
<P>
As an important step to curb soaring prices, Chongqing set up
risk funds and increased reserves of grain, edible oil and
meat. Coupons have been introduced to maintain a steady supply of
grain, edible oil and meat.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have already paid dividends for local shoppers. By
the end of last year, retail prices had fallen by 10.2 percent,
the largest drop among the 35 major Chinese cities. The city met
designated goals of bringing price rises to within 18 percent. It
was still higher than China's average prices rise of 14.8 percent
in 1995 -- but half compared to less than a year ago. No wonder
chef Pandey is happy to toast city officials for their cost
cutting measures.

WENZHOU (Zhejiang), February 9 (Xinhua) -- A series of huge
jade carvings featuring Confucius (551-479 B.C.), the greatest
thinker and educationalist in ancient China, have been completed
and put on display in this city in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
It took local artist Wu Jinde, 53, three years to finish the
masterpieces, which are reported to be the first of its kind in
China.
</P>
<P>
The set of the works includes a miniature of the Temple of
Confucius in Qufu, Confucius' hometown in east China's Shandong
Province, a screen inlaid with colored-stone carvings featuring
scenes from Confucius's life and a jade carving featuring
Confucius' journey to visit all states in a wagon on which the
figure of Confucius is covered with gold leaf.
</P>
<P>
The screen is two m high and 40 m long. The reproduction of the
Temple of Confucius is 6.3 m long, 5.7 m wide and 3.45 m high,
which makes it one-tenth the size of the original. The other jade
carving is two tons in weight.
</P>

More than 600 dragons are carved on the pillars, passageways,
steps, ceilings and pedestals of the miniature temple, which

<HEADLINE> JLG Session Makes Progress Despite Difference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) made progress and achievements on a number of
important issues related to the smooth transition of Hong Kong at
its 35th plenary session, which concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference after the three-day meeting,
Ambassador Zhao Jihua, senior representative of the Chinese side
on the JLG, said that the two sides reached agreement in principle
on the framework of the mechanism, under which relevant
international conventions will be continuously applied in Hong
Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Yet both sides will continue to work hard on details of the
mechanism, so as to find a comprehensive solution to the entire
question.
</P>
<P>
Zhao added that agreement was also reached at this session on
the continued application of three more international conventions
in the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (SAR), to be
established on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
More progress was made on such issues as adaptation of laws,
air services agreements, franchises and contracts, and Hong Kong's
international rights and obligations.
</P>
<P>
Zhao touched on some questions, which he said need further
efforts from both sides. He blamed the British side for not giving
positive response to the proposal made by the Chinese side for
setting up two separate experts groups to deal with the transfer
of archives and the government assets. He urged the British side
to attach adequate importance to the issue, which, if dragged,
might affect the smooth transition as well as the confidence of
Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
As to the question of the franchise of the No 9 container
terminal, Zhao said the British side has not yet presented a
mature proposal to the plenary meeting for discussion. He urged
the relevant parties to speed up their efforts to find a solution
acceptable to all.
</P>
<P>
Differences still exist on the issue of personal communications
service licenses and the right of abode, he said.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Province to Step up Labor Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Fujian, a coastal province in
southeast China, will beef up labor reforms during the nation's
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) to make better use of
labor resources.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the provincial Labor Administration,
the booming local economy over the past decade has helped absorb
some four million surplus rural laborers. However, another three
million are still seeking jobs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 1.5 million rural laborers from outside
the province are adding more pressure to its labor market each
year, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years Fujian will step up labor reforms
featuring governmental overall management, coordination between
urban and rural areas, free recruitment of workers, labor market
adjustment, and related services by social organizations.
</P>
<P>
The province will expand employment channels by revitalizing
state-owned enterprises, boosting the collective economy, and
encouraging labor-intensive service trades and non-state-owned
economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
The flow of rural labor to cities will be put into good order,
official sources said. And the province will push forward reforms
related to labor contracting, social security and labor safety and
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to improve its labor market system, the province will
promote the establishment of labor service organizations which are
engaged in job recommendation, occupational training and
unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
These organizations will receive more favorable treatment from
local governments so that they can play a more important role in
expanding employment.

COLOMBO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka believes that the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) will be a
single market by year 2000, Sri Lankan Trade and Commerce Minister
Kingsley Wickremaratne said here today.
</P>

Trade Ministers in India said in such a market there would not be
any borders or barriers such as costs and duties.
</P>

Accordingly, Sri Lankan business and industry should get ready
for the new changes that were taking place and if they failed to
understand those changes those businesses and industries could not
survive.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the world economy was changing. The
global economy was taking a different shape. "We must be prepared
to receive orders in the morning and deliver the good in the
evening," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC, founded in 1985, groups India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and The Maldives.

demand discipline and unity among Tory MPs.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Eurotunnel board will today decide whether it should ask
a French court to appoint a mediator to help solve its financial
crisis. If it approves the move, the mediator is likely to hold
talks with Eurotunnel, its banks and the French and UK governments
in an attempt to solve the the company's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The first significant sign that the Conservative party's
political fortunes are on the turn after two years in the doldrums
comes in a Gallup poll published today. Labor's huge poll lead of
39.5 points has tumbled to 26.5 points.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The government ran into a hail of criticism by staging
above-inflation pay rises for most of Britain's 1.3 million public
sector workers but leaving nurses with a guaranteed national
increase of only two percent.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Unemployment in Germany has surged through the 4 million
barrier to a post-war high nudging 11 percent. The cost of coping
with the crisis is certain to imperil Chancellor Helmut Kohl's

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Deficit Drops in November 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today announced a
drastically smaller trade deficit of 40 million Malaysian ringgit
(about 16 million US dollars) in November 1995, 40 times lower
than the 1.6 billion ringgit (about 640 million US dollars) last
October.
</P>
<P>
However, the November 1995 figure was in contrast to a surplus
of 31.4 million ringgit (about 12.56 million dollars) recorded in
November 1994, said the Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Between January and November last year, the country's deficit
amounted to 9.8 billion ringgit (about 3.92 billion dollars),
seven times higher than that of the same period in 1994 because of
a faster growth in imports.
</P>
<P>
Imports grew 26.3 percent to 177.6 billion ringgit (about 71.04
billion dollars) from the same period of 1994, while exports rose
20.4 percent to 167.8 billion ringgit (about 67.12 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thermonic valves and tubes, photocells and other parts remained
Malaysia's leading export earner, amounting to 29.9 billion
ringgit (about 11.96 billion dollars) or 17.8 percent of the total
export earnings for the January-November period.
</P>
<P>
Palm oil was the second biggest earner, with an export value of
9.6 billion ringgit (about 3.84 billion dollars) or 5.7 percent of
the total export value.
</P>
<P>
However, major reductions were registered in exports of swan
timber, saw logs and cocoa beans.
</P>
<P>
According to the Statistics Department, machinery and transport
equipment was the largest contributor to the country's higher
imports, standing at 106.7 billion ringgit (about 42.68 billion
dollars) or 60.1 percent of the total imports for the same period.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's leading trade partners in the first 11 months last
year are the United States, Japan, Singapore, Germany, South
Korea, Thailand and Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China is scheduled to launch a
communications satellite for the International Telecommunication
Satellite Organization with a newly-developed rocket on February
15, 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the China Carrier Rocket
Technology Research Institute, the Long-March III B rocket,
and bonded with four booster rockets, is capable of carrying a
five-ton payload.
</P>
<P>
The new three-stage rocket, powered by liquid fuel, is a
modified version of the Long-March III A which registered two
successful launches in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary work on the "Intersate Seven A" satellite launch
has already been completed, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Reports Fewer Handicapped Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of handicapped
babies born in northeast China's Liaoning Province was fallen,
according to new figures.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, 7,150 fewer handicapped babies were
born compared with the previous five-year period (1986-1990), said
the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
An official with Provincial Public Health Department said the
drop in the birth rate of handicapped babies has been due to
advanced medical techniques and better awareness of legal
knowledge among parents-to-be.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, stations to monitor new-born babies have been set
up at 20 gynaecology and obstetrics hospitals in the cities of
Shenyang, Dalian, Fuxin and Chaoyang.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring has shown that the ratio of handicapped new-born
babies dropped from 1.2 percent before 1990 to 0.85 percent. The
decrease means that 1,430 fewer handicapped children are born in
the cities each year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988 newly-wed couples have been required to receive
medical checkups before getting married. Those found to have
serious hereditary diseases are required to take long-term
contraceptive measures or have birth-control surgery.
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women also have to undergo regular prenatal checkups
from the twelfth week of their pregnancies. Women in urban areas
usually receive such checks eight times before giving birth and
women in rural areas five times.
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women also have to receive ultrasound screening and
other medical checks to avoid giving birth to children with
serious congenital disabilities.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has carried out a publicity compaign
to spread knowledge about child-bearing and the bringing up of
healthier children. Pregnant women are being encouraged to have
blood tests to prevent them from contracting major diseases that
adversely affect their own health and fetus development.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial People's Congress has also formulated a number
of regulations and rules to promote the bearing and rearing of
healthier children, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Duty on Car Import Set to Rise in Thailand  (by Yu Zuncheng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Following a Thai cabinet order
earlier this week to curb passenger car imports, it seems certain
that Thailand's import duty on completely built-up cars (CBU) will
rise.
</P>
<P>
The import duty increase is part of the government's drive to
solve the country's trade deficit and the heavy traffic congestion
in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The rising number of imported cars is also feared to hurt
Thailand's plans to become a car export base in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The curbing of car imports is likely to benefit local Japanese
car assemblers as Japanese brands had dominated the local car
market in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
What the Thai Commerce Ministry is studying is how to control
the country's car imports without breaking the regulations of the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Thailand's import duty for passenger cars is now divided into
two rates -- 42 percent for cars with engines lower than 2,400 cc,
and 68.5 percent for cars with engines over 2,400 cc.
</P>
<P>
As the two categories of the CBU vehicles are also subject to
excise tax, value added tax and municipal tax, the total tax
imposed on them now stands at 136.5 percent and 209.8 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Although Thailand has been allowed by the WTO to increase
import duty to 80 percent, the figure has been kept below the
ceiling for the purpose of keeping the competitiveness of imported
cars.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Chucheep Hanwasat said that import duty
increase is almost certain and that in some cases the increase is
likely to be as much as 80 percent, as agreed by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The country's imports of vehicles have taken a large chunk of
trade deficit and have increased continuously since 1988, when
they were worth 31.5 billion baht (1.26 billion US dollars),
representing 6.1 percent of the import value.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, passenger car imports were worth 10.92
billion baht (437 million dollars). In 1994, they grew to 38.7
billion baht (1.55 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Between January and November last year, passenger car imports
amounted to 34.7 billion baht (1.39 billion dollars), while the
value of total imported vehicles stood at 119.3 billion baht (4.77
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figure represents 7.6 percent of Thailand's total import
value, or 3.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product.

<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called for the consolidation and development of relations
between China and the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The President was speaking at a meeting in Beijing with
visiting Congolese Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation in
charge of French affairs Arsene Tsaty-Boungou.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to the Congolese visitor, Jiang said that
China treasures its traditional friendship with the Congo.
</P>
<P>
During the 30-plus years since the establishment of diplomatic
relations, the two countries have had sincere and good cooperation
in political, economic and all other fields and the two peoples
have forged a deep friendship, Jiang said, adding that the
successful China visit by Congolese President Pascal Lissouba in
1994 helped promote bilateral relations onto a higher stage.
</P>
<P>
Boungou conveyed President Lissouba's regards to Jiang, saying
the President and the Congolese government attached importance to
the relationship between the two countries and sincerely hoped to
strengthen cooperation in broader areas.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said the Congo, as one of the earliest countries
in African to forge diplomatic relations with China, is one of
China's most trusted friends.
</P>
<P>
Jiang gave reciprocal regards to President Lissouba, saying
China will always be a friend of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We will develop friendly relations with all countries on the
basis of the Five-Principles of Peaceful Co-existence," Jiang
said, adding, "African friends have rendered great support to
China in international affairs."

<HEADLINE> Navigation Exchange to be Launched in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The largest sea port in north
China is to have its own exchange to bring port-related activities
under one umbrella.
</P>
<P>
The new navigation exchange is scheduled to be incorporated
in this port city of Tianjin in July. It has been described as the
largest exchange of its kind in north China.
</P>
<P>
The exchange will formulate shipping regulations, organize
shipping-related transactions and provide services and
information. This will include telecommunications, shipping
consultancy and information on price structures, supply, demand
and storage. It will also help mediate disputes concerning service
quality and accidents.
</P>
<P>
Relying on a membership system, the exchange will initially
have 100 transaction seats but will eventually have 200 seats in
three years.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin was chosen because of its status as the largest sea
port in north China. At least 70 percent of the cargo handled by
it comes from 11 provinces and cities in north and northwest China.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the exchange, to be incorporated by the
Ministry of Communications and the Tianjin shipping authorities,
will help boost the shipping market in north China and improve the
area's overall management.

YANGON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,764 kilograms of
narcotic drugs, including 83 kilograms of heroin and 1,484
kilograms of opium, were set ablaze by the Myanmar authorities in
Yangon today.
</P>
<P>
It is the first such incident in Yangon since drug warlord Khun
Sa and his 12,690-strong Mong Tai Army (MTA) started to surrender
to the government on January 5.
</P>
<P>
It is also the 10th destruction of narcotic drugs in the city
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
First Secretary of the Myanmar State Law and Order Restoration
Council (SLORC) Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, ministers, foreign
diplomats and representatives of the UN agencies attended the
destruction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Other drugs destroyed today included 197 kg of marijuana and
1,919 liters of phensedyl.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, a total of 17,030 kilograms of narcotic drugs have
been burnt in Yangon, which included 1,537 kilograms of heroin,
11,347 kilograms of opium, 4,082 kilograms of marijuana and 25,171
liters of phensedyl.
</P>
<P>
Destruction of narcotic drugs was also carried out at the
country's border areas, which burnt 510 kilograms of opium and 380
kilograms of heroin, a Myanmar official said at the ceremony.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that Chinese and French statesmen should handle
Sino-French relations from a strategic perspective.
</P>
<P>
He called for the maintenance of the developing trend in good
bilateral links to effect a long-term, stable and friendly
cooperative relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at a meeting with visiting French
Foreign Minister Herve De Charette in Zhongnanhai, the site of the
Central Government.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, has always attached importance to Sino-French
relations. The country is willing to strengthen friendly
cooperation with France in various fields, Jiang added. Both
China and France are major influential countries in the world and
have the same or similar views on major international issues. Both
countries hold important responsibilities in maintaining world
peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
The current world is at a critical period in the run-up to the
21st century. On one hand, the trend of internationalization is
being strengthened while on the other hand new and uncertain
factors are increasing. Therefore, "Statesmen should handle
Sino-French relations from a strategic perspective, particularly
as the new century approaches. This way many problems can easily
be solved," Jiang Zemin stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the economies of China and France are strongly
complementary and both have huge potentials to be tapped with
bright prospects for the two countries. A greater development in
bilateral relations through joint efforts not only accords with
the fundamental interests of the two countries but also benefits
the peace, stability and development of the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
Charette said French President Jacques Chirac pays much heed to
the role of Asia and maintains that in this aspect China holds a
vital position. China's ancient civilization and rapid economic
development in recent years have exerted and are exerting an
important impact on the world, he said. Therefore, the
strengthening of bilateral relations benefits the interests of
both countries. A healthy development of the bilateral relations
is of strategic significance, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the new period of the world today, he noted, it is necessary
for the two countries to continuously enhance political dialogue
and closely consult on international affairs while improving
economic links, based on the profound foundation of the
relationship.

<HEADLINE> Back to School For All Jilin's Girl Drop-Outs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- All of the girl drop-outs in
northeast China's Jilin Province, totalling 6,645, have returned
to school over the past two years with the help of a charity
program, "China Social News" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Bud Plan was initiated by the China Children's
Foundation in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It received about 9.69 million yuan (about 1.16 million
U.S. dollars) in donations last year, and has helped as many as
100,000 girl drop-outs return to school across the country .
</P>
<P>
Each year the girls each receive 300 yuan from the foundation
to pay for their books, board and school meals.
</P>
<P>
Major progress was made last year, as 7,808 girl drop-outs
returned to school in east China's Jiangsu Province; the number of
girl drop-outs who returned to school in Sichuan, Hebei and Anhui
provinces topped 10,000 each; and a primary school financed by an
entrepreneur from Hong Kong was established in Yan'an, in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Every year about two million Chinese children are forced to
leave school because their families are too poor to afford their
education, and two-thirds of them are girls.
</P>
<P>
Another charity program with a similar aim is the Hope Project,
which has aided more than one million children.

<HEADLINE> Croatia, EU to Propose Joint Solution to Mostar Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 9 (xinhua) -- Croatia and the European Union
will make a joint proposal to end the dispute in the divided
Bosnian town of Mostar, according to Italian Foreign Minister
Susanne Agnelli, the current holder of the EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli made the remark after a meeting with Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
She said that Hans Koschnik, the EU administrator of Mostar,
will send his deputy Klaus Metscher back to Rome Friday for
further consultation on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"After that we will again meet President Tudjman and make a
joint proposal on the settlement of the situation in Mostar ... We
would like to reach an agreement acceptable to both sides."
</P>
<P>
She also ruled out the possibility that the EU would make any
change in Koschnik's plan for the new municipal boundaries within
Mostar.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which was announced after Muslims and Croats
failed to settle their disputes, Mostar will be divided into seven
districts, three Croat, three Muslim and one mixed.
</P>
<P>
The plan was strongly opposed by the Croats, who argued that
the mixed district violated the Dayton accord and would be a
Muslim-dominated area.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic conflict between the Muslims and Croats in Mostar,
which started in 1993, has been intensified after the Dayton peace
accord was formally signed in Paris last December.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims insisted on a total unification of the city, while
the Croats wanted to divide it into two parts to be separately
administrated ethnically.
</P>
<P>
The Croats plan to make Mostar the capital of the Bosnian Croat
entity.

<P>
HARBIN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- There were only 80 joint
ventures in 1991 in this capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, but, by the end of 1995, the number had climbed to over
1,800, involving a total contractual foreign investment of three
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Makes Marked Progress in IPR Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Pirated compact discs, laser
discs and other types of software have been dramatically reduced
this year in south China's Guangdong Province, as a result of the
governmental crackdown and efforts to root out illegal producers.
</P>
<P>
In this area, where the intellectual property rights (IPR)
violations were once the most rampant in the country, far fewer
pirated CDs, LDs and other illegal software can be seen on the
streets today.
</P>
<P>
"This major change is owed to the strengthened governmental
management system over audio and video producers and sellers
alike, and intensified crackdowns on law-breakers," an official
with the provincial government said today.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a provincial conference on IPR protection, many
cities, such as Shenzhen, Fushan and Maoming, as well as this
provincial capital have set up IPR protection offices.
</P>
<P>
The province has formed a complete network of copyright
management, with designated departments responsible for the
examination, confirmation and registration of copyrights, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The local legislature has also issued regulations on the
control of audio-video publishing and duplication activities.
</P>
<P>
The CD, LD production factories in the province have been
checked for registration. Only the qualified ones have been given
production permits. Government supervisors have been stationed on
every production line since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Besides the routine work of inspection of the audio-video
markets, the province has organized five special large-scale
crackdowns. Over 15,000 stores were checked and 280,000 pieces of
pirated CDs and LDs and over 200,000 cassettes were confiscated,
crushed or burned, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial Industry and Commerce Bureau, in
November last year alone, 59 printing enterprises were checked,
and copyright violators severely punished.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,800 trade mark cases were handled, and in 470 of
them foreign parties were involved. Some 250 million items bearing
fake trade marks were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The courts in the province handled 189 IPR cases and finished
129 of them, about 20 percent and 60 percent up over last year,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 service bodies have been set up in Guangdong to protect
intellectual property rights, among which are the branch office of
the State Patent Bureau in Guangzhou, which went into operation in
August last year, and a provincial association for software
protection set up in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The association has already conducted technical examinations of
10 items of software alleged to have infringed upon others'
copyrights so far, and helped to quicken the pace of solving the
disputes.

BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers in the Chinese
capital increased their vigilance against smuggling last year,
investigating 430 smuggling cases and seizing 190 million yuan
(about 22.9 million US dollars) worth of smuggled goods.
</P>
<P>
According to customs officials, the smuggled goods included 190

Local customs officers have tightened their checks on motor
vehicles, their import certificates in particular, and the actions
have proven fruitful.

according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Chinese Urban Taxi Association,

<HEADLINE> West Lake Made More Attractive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The West Lake, a world-famous
scenic spot in this capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, is
poised to become a tourist paradise as years of efforts have made
it more lovely.
</P>
<P>
Each day an average of 41,095 visitors feast their eyes on the
charm of the lake.
</P>
<P>
The city government has taken a series of steps to preserve and
beautify the lake's picturesque landscape since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Its first move was to get rid of buildings on the shores,
including high walls and a number of villas, to make the resort
more spacious. About 45,000 square meters of such buildings have
been cleared.
</P>
<P>
Following the opening of Lakeside Park, Children's Palace
Square, Lake-Watching Pavilion, Mirror Lake and Lakeside Villa,
the city set up a green belt around the lake.
</P>
<P>
Long Bridge Park, Prince Bay Park, Guo Garden Village, and
South China Famous Stone Garden were built or renovated. Over 40
other tourist attractions were refurbished, including Yuefei
Temple, Lingyin Buddist Monastery, Hupao Spring, Ruangong Island
and Yellow Dragon Cave.
</P>
<P>
The traditional Ten Sights of the West Lake were re-opened to
tourists, except for the Leifeng Pagoda.
</P>
<P>
To date, 94 sights have been opened to visitors, boosting the
scenic areas of the lake to 50.1 ha.
</P>
<P>
Today's West Lake is something more than a famous tourist spot
under state protection. Added to it are an atmosphere of culture,
humanism and natural grandeur, which could be felt in the
newly-built "China Grottoes Art Park" and the "China Ancient
Pagoda Exhibition Garden" in the Lingyin and Liuhe pagoda zones,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The aroma of flowers permeates the lake throughout the year,
with peony, lotus, osmanthus, azalea, plum, tulip and oriental
cherry blossoming.
</P>
<P>
Memorial halls for such famed historical figures as General Yue
Fei and poet Su Shi of the Song Dynasty have been set up in the
West lake.
</P>
<P>
Tourists can also view the Forest of Stele, the Wax Figure
Hall, and the museums of tea, silk, porcelain and traditional
Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou has improved the environment around the West Lake by
building dams and purifying the water by tightening limits on the
discharge of sewage into the lake.
</P>
<P>
Technical renovation has been adopted to cleanse the air, and
water has been diverted from the Qiantang River to the lake to
improve the water quality.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Pledges Radical Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga today pledged radical and far-reaching political,
economic and infrastructural reforms in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremonial opening of the third session of the
Parliament this morning, Chandrika said that she had not given up
the quest for peace although her earlier efforts had been
frustrated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, demanding a separate Tamil state, reneged the
cessation of hostilities and renewed the ethnic war last April.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the government forces had defeated the
LTTE troops in their heartland in Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
She said that to resolve the ethnic issue and to allow every
citizen to live with respect and dignity, her government came up
with a political package of devolution last August.
</P>
<P>
The political package, which seeks the establishment of a Union
of Regions, will devolve some power enjoyed by the central
government to regional administrations.
</P>
<P>
Describing the country as being well on the way to economic
prosperity, Chandrika said that her government recognized the
private sector as the engine of development and extended to it
encouragement and generous incentives.
</P>
<P>
She noted that foreign investors had come in and started new
ventures that have achieved tremendous success.
</P>
<P>
While earlier industrial development was mainly in the sphere
of textiles, now the scene has shifted into other areas and soon
Sri Lanka will be in the hi-tech business as well, she added.
</P>
<P>
The president said that a National Development Council has been
established to promote medium and small industries in backward
areas.

<HEADLINE> France Calls on Bosnian Serbs to Reopen Dialogues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- France today appealed to Bosnian
Serbs to comply with the Dayton peace accord and reopen dialogues
with all parties as stipulated in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday suspended all contacts with the
Muslim-Croat Federation after Muslim police detained two senior
Serb officers and six Serb soldiers on January 30 when they
crossed a Muslim-held area to meet international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Muslims accused the eight arrested, including a
general and a colonel, of committing war crimes in the
three-and-a-half year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb military later cut off all relations with the
NATO-led peace implementation force (IFOR) to protest the IFOR's
failure to guarantee freedom of movement for the Serb negotiators.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters that France
called on the Bosnian Serbs to restart dialogues and proposed some
"action principles" to help implement the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
France suggested that war criminals be brought to trial as soon
as possible; that each party's freedom of movement, particularly
for negotiators, be respected; that every party has the right to
regard a negotiator as a suspect in war crimes, and that all
parties should fully cooperate with the International Court of
Justice at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
The smooth implementation of the Dayton peace accord, which
does not empower the Bosnian factions to arrest suspected war
criminals, will become impossible without the Serbs' active
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, Richard Goldstone, the chief prosecutor of the
International Court of Justice, asked the Bosnian Muslim side to
hold the Serb general and the colonel till the court gathers more
evidence against them.
</P>
<P>
The two Serb officers are not among the 44 Serbs listed by the
court as war criminals. The court has also brought charges of war
crimes against a number of Bosnian Croats.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Benefit from US Tariff Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will benefit
extensively from tariff cuts on 2,187 export lines to the United
States under the World Trade Organization agreements, the Thai
Business Economics Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The cuts apply to 99 percent of Thailand's exports to the US in
1994, worth 238 billion baht (9.5 billion US dollars), said the
department. Only products under special business arrangements are
excluded.
</P>
<P>
The US will collect no duty on 14 of the 2,187 items.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports of the 14 items in 1994 were worth just over
30 billion baht (1.2 billion US dollars) and included frozen
shrimps, smoked and natural rubber, natural gas, precious stones
and coffee.
</P>
<P>
The US has widened its abolition of duty to include 27 items on
which it earlier collected levies. These include integrated
circuits, computers, tape and toys.
</P>
<P>
Thai exports of these products in 1994 were worth 56 billion
baht (2.24 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition to the preferential tariffs for some products under
the generalized system of preferences, the latest US commitment
will lead to more benefits for Thai exports, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The US has cut duty on small quantities of some products, such
as children's garment made from cotton, gems and jewelry, travel
gear and silver products.

BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Peng Peiyun
has asked the entire nation to give more attention to population
problems over the next few years to help bring family planning
work to a higher level, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>

in the national economic and social development program.
</P>
<P>
The family planning program is intended not only to slow down
rapid growth of population, but also to enhance the quality of the
nation's life and it should be integrated with work to improve
living standards and with promotion of women's social status in
the country, she said.

The final goal is to co-ordinate population development with
sustainable development of economic, social and natural resources,

<HEADLINE> Beijing Handles More Imports, Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing scored a nearly 55
percent increase in imports and exports in January from the same
month of 1995, according to the Municipal Commission of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
During that period the city's total imports and exports were
worth 250 million US dollars, an official of the commission said.
</P>
<P>
He said that imports soared by 260 percent to 98 million US
dollars-worth and exports climbed 13 percent to 153 million US
dollars-worth.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase in exports to efforts to broaden the
global market, the stepped-up restructuring of state-owned
enterprises and efforts of manufacturers to become market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
The 450 major foreign-funded companies in Beijing exported 35.2
million US dollars-worth of goods last month, up nearly 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now exports goods to 130 countries and regions, and
imports technology and equipment from 40 countries, the official
said, adding that it plans to export 2.6 billion US dollars worth
of goods this year, a 13 percent increase over last year.

<HEADLINE> China Urges EU to Eschew Discriminatory Trade Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that the European
Union (EU) will entirely abolish its discriminatory and
unreasonable trade policies with regard to China to build up a
healthy and stable Sino-EU economic and trade relationship, said
Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is to pay a week-long visit to Britain, made the
statement in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The EU, China's fourth-largest trade partner, is playing a
significant role in China's foreign trade, and Sino-EU economic
and trade ties have been smooth over the past two years, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese customs statistics, the trade volume
between China and the EU in 1995 reached 40.38 billion US
dollars-worth, an 18.7 percent increase over 1994, Wu noted,
adding that the EU nations are also expanding their investment in
China, with the total number of projects reaching 5,499, involving
a contracted investment of 17.1 billion US dollars and actual
investment of 5.3 billion US dollars by the end of last September.
</P>
<P>
The EU is also the major supplier of China's technology import,
Wu continued, noting that China introduced 2,374 items of
technology from the EU countries up to last September, with a
contracting capital of 20.7 billion US dollars, which accounts for
40 percent of China's total technology import and leaves the US
and Japan behind in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In financial co-operation, EU nations have up to now provided
China with government loans of more than 10 billion US dollars, Wu
said, citing that the two sides have had good co-operation in the
fields of science and technology, and development aid as well.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there still exist many "dissatisfactory factors" and
even some barriers in Sino-EU economic and trade relations, mainly
the unilateral limits imposed by the EU on quantities of some of
China's commodities, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the EU has frequently made discriminative
"anti-dumping" investigations into certain Chinese products,
causing big losses to China's export-oriented enterprises, Wu said
</P>
<P>
The EU has also made use of so called "graduation" system in
its new Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), keeping seven
major China's export commodities out of the GSP, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned actions by the EU smack of trade
protectionism, indicating that EU trade policies discriminate
against China and are irrational, Wu stated, stressing that the
EU's unilateral trade restriction measures aimed at China are not
in line with Sino-EU agreements on trade and economic
co-operation, nor do they conform to the World Trade Organization
regulations and international practice.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the plan mapped out in the long-term policy
for EU-China relations issued by the EU last year, which proposed
enhancing bilateral economic and trade co-operation, Wu said. She
added that she hoped that more European entrepreneurs would come
to China for fair competition and co-operation on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
China and the EU are strongly complementary in their economies,
the minister said. She expressed her belief that Sino-EU economic
and trade ties can be brought to a new high with the efforts made
by both sides.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Says Guangzhou Subway Funds Ample </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu has
ruled out rumors that the city lacks funds to complete ongoing
subway construction as scheduled in 1998, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the city's mayor as saying that "the local
government has had no problems collecting enough money to finish
the project on time."
</P>
<P>
The capital of south China's Guangdong Province started to
construct Metro Phase 1 at the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The 12.7-billion-yuan (about 1.5 billion US dollars) project
was funded mostly by the local government and foreign government
loans.
</P>
<P>
Of a total of 540 million US dollars in foreign loans already
set to be used in the first phase, the paper said, Germany
provided 414 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
For the seven billion yuan shouldered by the local government,
the mayor said land sales and mandatory charges are main funding
sources.
</P>
<P>
He said one-third of the land-sale income from real estate
development of Pearl River New City will be used to build the
subway.
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, 20 billion yuan is expected to be generated from
property development for metro use.
</P>
<P>
Mandatory measures have been enforced to charge five percent of
hotel bills from customers to add to the metro funding.
</P>
<P>
Also, part of the income from outdoor advertisement at bus
stops, funds collected from the city's 15 foundations and income
from public housing sales support the city's largest project
construction.
</P>
<P>
So far, workers have started digging at 30 of the 33
construction sites along the Metro Phase 1 Line.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said six stations of the metro network should be open
for public use by July 1997 and are expected to start full
operation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Metro Phase 2 is designed to start construction after the
completion of Phase 1 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
New forms of co-operation with foreign companies are being
mapped out by a group to take care of the Phase 2 project and it
may take the joint venture form, with both domestic and foreign
sides responsible for the construction.

<HEADLINE> Chile Has 29 Investment Protection Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Chile has signed 29 agreements
to promote and protect investments since 1991, two of them with
Cuba and Britain this year, the Chilean Foreign Investment
Committee said today.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Chile has signed eight agreements with Latin
American countries, 18 with European nations and three with
Asia-Pacific countries including China, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
Juan Banderas, vice president of the committee, said that the
agreements were additional incentive to foreign investors by
making the country safe for foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
He added that these agreements "are signed not only to promote
foreign investments, but also to guarantee the security of Chilean
investments abroad."
</P>
<P>
Although about 50 percent of foreign investments in Chile in
1990-1995 came from the United States and Canada, there are no
plans to negotiate agreements with those two countries.
</P>
<P>
Banderas said this was because the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) which Chile wants to join "contains a special
chapter on investments, the subject will be included in the
negotiations with the Nafta bloc."
</P>
<P>
According to Chilean Central Bank data, Chile attracted 4.32
billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign investments in 1995, of
which 3.43 billion dollars were direct investments, while Chilean
capital abroad amounted to 644.2 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Join US Shrimp Ban Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will hold talks with
55 other countries and regions to discuss a US ban on certain
shrimp exports beginning May 1, Boontipa Simasakul, deputy
director-general of the Thai Foreign Trade Department, was quoted
as saying by the Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
The ban ruling was made by the US Court of International Trade
late last year after the Earth Island, a non-governmental
organization (NGO), accused the 56 countries and regions of not
using proper fishing gear.
</P>
<P>
The NGO told the court that the 56 countries and regions used
fishing gear that was harmful to turtles.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Boontipa as saying that the countries, which
say that they use the same gear as American shrimpers, may
petition Washington.
</P>
<P>
Exporting countries must now prove to the US that most of their
shrimp exports are from aquaculture rather than from sea fishing.
The US has asked that an agency from each country be given the
authority to certify the origin of the shrimp products.
</P>
<P>
Boontipa said that the move to block products from other
countries was a non-tariff barrier and that the court's methods in
reaching its ruling did not conform to US commitments to the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Thailand produces about 300,000 tons of shrimp a year, mainly
from aquaculture, and is the world's largest shrimp exporter. In
1995, exports reached 270,000 tons, about 30 percent of which were
exported to the US.
</P>
<P>
According to Prodprasop Suraswadi, director-general of the Thai
Foreign Trade Department, the US ruling will hurt both the Thai
shrimp industry and American consumers,
</P>
<P>
Prodprasop plans to lead a delegation to the US on March 13-15
to submit reports detailing Thailand's moves to protect turtles in
the shrimp industry.
</P>
<P>
Also included on the US list are India, Indonesia, Malaysia and
China.

<P>
HAVANA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Cuba today uttered its concern
about the 11 U.S. pacifists detained by American police and 325
computers confiscated by U.S. customs officials on January 31.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso told a press
briefing that his country considers the incident a U.S. violation
of the rights of the Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
He said that by blocking the transportation of computers to
Cuba, the American authorities are also blocking their own
citizens' "rights of access to information."
</P>
<P>
A group of U.S. pacifists belonging to a religious organization
called "Pastors for Peace" were stopped in San Diego on their way
to Mexico on January 31.
</P>
<P>
The pacifists were carrying in their cars 325 computers which
would be delivered to Cuba. Pastors for Peace periodically sends
assistance to the Caribbean island nation through Mexico.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo today said he would continue to demand the lifting of the
decade-long tuna embargo imposed by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue firmly demanding the U.S. government lift the
tuna embargo that unjustly affects our fishing industry," the
Mexican president said during the presentation of a program for
fishing and agricultural development in the southeastern state of
Campeche.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said that on the pretext of protecting some marine
species, governments had imposed unfair and incongruous trade
restrictions against Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The United States has argued that Mexican tuna fishing methods
kill hundreds of dolphins caught in the same nets.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Mexico promoted the concept of
responsible fishing which entails clear standards for the
sustainable exploitation of sea and inland water food resources.
</P>
<P>
Responsible fishing also requires the transparent
administration of fisheries and the promotion of investment in the
industry, Zedillo added.

HELSINKI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma said here today that his country is willing to close
the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuchma, who arrived here on Wednesday for a
three-day official visit, said the shutdown of the technically-ill
nuclear plant depends not only on Ukraine itself, but also on the
attitude of the outside world.
</P>
<P>
He added that Ukraine hopes Western countries could provide
loans and credit for the shutdown of the plant, which caused the
world's worst nuclear power plant accident in 1986, in which
thousands of people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the G-7 Western countries to make decisions
on the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant in their summit meeting to be
held in Moscow in April.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Kuchma met with his Finnish counterpart,
Martti Ahtisaari, on the political and economic situation in
Ukraine and its relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also participated in the signing of two
agreements on quick notification of nuclear accidents and nuclear
safety technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- New Polish Foreign Minister
Dariusz Rosati reiterated today that his country will continue to
list its entry into the NATO and the European Union as the top
priority of its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
No matter what changes are made in the Polish government, the
target remains the same, Rosati told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz was sworn in and
reshuffled the cabinet Wednesday after former Prime Minister Jozef
Oleksy resigned amid allegations that he had spied for Moscow for
13 years.
</P>
<P>
Poland's entry into the NATO is part of the effort to establish
a new European order and will not pose any threat to any other
country, Rosati stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said his country hopes to develop friendly ties
with Russia, noting that it is of importance for Poland to develop
relations with other central and east European countries,
</P>
<P>
The NATO's eastward expansion is a process which will change
the nature of the organization, Rosati said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Poland will maintain and develop its traditional
friendly relations and conduct effective cooperation with China,
which is full of economic potential and has a rapidly developing
economy over recent years.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two countries will continue
to exchange high-level visits.
</P>
<P>
Poland has been promoting economic cooperation with East
Asia, which enjoys the most rapid economic growth in the world,
Rosati added.

<HEADLINE> German Jobless Rate Hits Post-War High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Germany reached a
post-World War II record in January, reflecting a worrying
slowdown in Europe's leading economy.
</P>
<P>
Federal Labor Office figures today showed that 4.159
million people, or 10.8 percent of the active population, had
registered as jobless, against 9.9 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase of 368,300 over the December figure was
also the highest recorded.
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Jagoda, head of the Labor Office, said that the sharp
increase in the jobless figure was largely due to persistent cold
weather, which affects particularly the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
But Jagoda conceded that faltering economic growth was also
responsible.
</P>
<P>
He forecast an even worse unemployment situation in February,
saying it would take a favorable turn in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt described
the figures as worrying, saying that "extraordinary measures"
should be taken to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the minister predicted the economic growth will pick
up this year and average 1.5 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
The jobless figures came after the government presented a new
package of medium-term measures to stimulate the economy. The
previous record high unemployment figure was reached in February
1994, when it was 4.042 million as a result of the 1993
recession.

Brazauskas today signed a decree to fire Prime Minister Adolfas
Slezevicious, who has been accused of involvement in a banking
scandal.
</P>
<P>
In another decree, Brazauskas ordered Slezevicious' cabinet to
resign and named L.M. Stankiyvichus, a cabinet member in charge of
administrative reforms, acting prime minister to form a new
cabinet, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas told reporters that there would be no major changes
in the lineup of the new cabinet and that Lithuania would continue
its reform policy and its drive to integrate with western Europe
economically, politically and militarily.
</P>
<P>
Slezevicious, who has come under a barrage of criticism for
drawing all his deposits from the Investment Bank just days before
its bankruptcy, was ordered to leave his office shortly after the
parliament voted for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas had asked the embattled premier to resign, but his
demand was brushed off by the latter, whose ruling party enjoys a
majority in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Search for Plane Crash Victims Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Rescue teams from the
United States, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic today
continued the search for victims of the plane crash that occurred
Tuesday night off the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Dominican Navy said that rescue work resumed at 5
a.m. (local time), but the number of corpses retrieved from the
sea remains unchanged, according to reports received here from
Santo Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
When rescue work was suspended Wednesday night, 130 bodies had
been recovered from the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 757, with 176 passengers, most of them German
tourists, and 13 crew, plunged into the sea a few minutes after
taking off from Puerto Plata International Airport. The cause of
the accident has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of finding survivors is very slim as the plane
plunged from an altitude of 2,100 meters into shark-infested
waters.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard Commander Thomas Niels said there was no hope
of finding more remains. Some corpses could be inside the fuselage
of the submerged plane.
</P>
<P>
The plane, bound for Frankfurt and Berlin, was owned by a
Turkish company, Birgen Air, and leased to the Dominican airline,
Alas de Transporte Internacional.
</P>
<P>
Search teams are continuing to look for the plane's black box
and another device that recorded the conversation of the crew in
the plane's cockpit.
</P>
<P>
Alas de Transporte Internacional and the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration have sent investigators to Puerto Plata.
</P>
<P>
The air crash is the worst in the history of the Dominican
Republic. It is also the second crash in two months involving a
Boeing 757. An American Airlines Boeing 757 crashed December 20 as
it approached Cali, Colombia, killing 160 people.

MOSCOW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Yakhyo Azimov, 48, was appointed

</P>

Azimov, born in the north of the central Asian country, was
acting president of the biggest carpet company in the north of the

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian PM on Black Sea Fleet, Chernobyl Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Evgeni Marchuk
today said that Ukraine's dispute with Russia over the Black Sea
Fleet can be resolved soon conditional on Russia's understanding
that Ukraine could not accommodate certain Russian demands.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk told a press conference that Russian President Boris
Yeltsin could go ahead with his scheduled visit to Ukraine even if
the dispute was not completely resolved.
</P>
<P>
"He (Yeltsin) can still sign the Russian-Ukrainian peace accord
during his visit," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk noted that Ukraine could only allow Russia to use
Ukraine's Crimean port of Sevastopol for the period of its lease.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed on a 50-50 split of the Black Sea
Fleet and the Russians are ready to purchase 32 percent of
Ukraine's share of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
But Russia insists on basing its part of the fleet in
Sevastopol and moving the Ukrainian Navy's headquarters out of the
port.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said that his country will not get
loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) if Ukraine could
not pass its 1996 budget before the IMF board meeting slated for
early April.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ukraine is burdened with single-handedly dealing
with the Chernobyl nuclear power plant which has cost the country
12 percent of its annual budget over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk said that Ukraine and the Group of Seven industrialized
nations (G-7) have reached agreement on shutting down Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine says it needs 4 billion U.S. dollars to shut down the
two reactors still functioning in Chernobyl and modernize its
inefficient energy industry.
</P>
<P>
However, the G-7, comprising Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Canada, Japan and the United States, insists that the shutdown
requires only 3.2 billion dollars, of which 900 million should be
contributed by Ukraine itself.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian prime minister said that most Western countries
were concerned only with closing down Chernobyl, seldom taking
into consideration the implications of the shutdown for Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> hke020902--Australian Banks to Line Up Automatic Telling Machines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian banks are to set up
a uniform automatic telling machine (ATM) network that enables
bank card users to withdraw money at any ATM throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
The local banks are facing fierce competition from global
credit card giants such as Visa and Mastercard. The banks are
disadvantaged by their closed ATM systems that are incompatible
with each other's.
</P>
<P>
More and more Australian consumers are shifting to Mastercard
and Visa, through whose global ATM systems they can conduct
international transactions in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Customers found it inconvenient that they are restricted to
machines owned by their own bank.
</P>
<P>
There are about 6,300 ATMs run by banks, building societies and
credit unions in Australian. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia
dominated the market with 1,900 machines throughout the country.
It had been reluctant to open its ATM system to other banks,
because it wanted to retain its market dominance.
</P>
<P>
But increasing competition from international credit card
associations posed greater threat to local banks than they did to
each other, today's Australian Financial Review reported.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of the electronic fund transfer on spot of sales
(EFTPOS) technology also broke down the barriers between different
banks.
</P>
<P>
Customers can use any card to pay the bills at any EFTPOS
outlet in places such as supermarkets and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are expected to take place soon among the
country's three major ATM networks, namely the Commonwealth
Bank-Westpac alliance, the ANZ Banking Group-National Bank of
Australia alliance with connections to state banks and Cashcard,
an alliance of small banks, building societies and credit unions.
</P>
<P>
Technical staff from the banks said that necessary technical
changes could be made quickly to standardize the ATM systems.
</P>
<P>
An intra-bank agreement on universal ATM access would be
reached by the end of the year, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank spokeswoman Lyndell Deves said that while
negotiations were not yet under way with other banks, the issue of
an open ATM network was being treated very seriously.

<HEADLINE> Serb Official Accuses Muslims of Violating Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Parliament speaker of the
Bosnian Serb state Momcilo Krajisnik today accused the Muslim
side of doing its utmost to undermine the Dayton peace accord by
arresting Serb officers.
</P>
<P>
"By arresting Serb army officers, including Gen. Djordje Djukic
and Col. Aleksa Krsmanovic, the Muslims have seriously jeopardized
the entire peace deal" agreed upon in Dayton, Ohio, in November
last year, Krajisnik said in Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in
northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Serb officers and six soldiers were arrested by Muslim
police in the IFOR-controlled area near Sarajevo on January 30 for
allegedly committing war crimes during the three-and-half-year
civil war that ended two months ago.
</P>
<P>
"A great responsibility now lies with the peace Implementation
Force IFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina," the Tanjug news agency quoted
Krajisnik as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs have urged the IFOR to pressure the Bosnian government to
release the detained Serbs, but IFOR officials said the case is now
in the hands of the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik noted that the Serb authority has been more concerned
over the Dayton agreement than the Muslim-Croat federation, although
the beginning of its implementation has raised hopes that peace would
finally prevail in these territories.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authority has decided to suspend all contacts and meetings
with the Muslim-Croat federation and the IFOR to protest against the
arrest. It has also called off meetings with international chief
envoy on civilian affairs in Bosnia Carl Bildt and British Prince
Charles scheduled for later this week.
</P>
<P>
The war crimes tribunal at the Hague for the former Yugoslavia
on Wednesday asked the Bosnian government to keep the two arrested
Serb officers in detention for more questioning over war crimes.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Says Arrest of Serb Officers Untimely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations spokeswoman in
Belgrade Susan Manuel said today the arrest of eight Serb officers
and soldiers in Sarajevo had come at a wrong moment.
</P>
<P>
The action taken by the Bosnian government was untimely
"because the relations among the population of the former
yugoslavia have become to improve," Manuel told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
She said a team of experts of the Hague war crime tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia had arrived in Sarajevo last week at the
request of the Muslim government and another team was expected to
arrive next Tuesday to assess the cases on the basis of
documentation.
</P>
<P>
Muslim authority arrested eight Bosnian Serb officers and
soldiers, including Gen. Djordje Djukic and Col. Aleksa
Krsmanovic, in an IFOR-controlled area on charges of committing
war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim government informed the Hague tribunal about the
arrest of the two officers and their driver on February 2 and
about the arrest of another five on February 6, Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
Although all Bosnian sides have committed themselves to the
Dayton peace agreement to cooperate with the tribunal, the arrest
of the Bosnian Serb officers makes a serious precedent because
they were captured before they were charged by the international
war tribunal, the U.N. spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The Hague Tribunal on wednesday decided to investigate six
cases and asked the Muslim government to keep in custody two
senior Serb officers.
</P>
<P>
"Although they are held by the Muslim government, they are in
fact under international investigation," Manuel added.
</P>
<P>
The Serb leadership has reacted angrily to the arrests and
accused the Bosnian government of violating the peace agreement.
The Serb authority has severed all contacts with the Muslim-Croat
federation and with IFOR to protest against the seizure of the
Serb officers.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Release of Detained Serb Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev today urged the Bosnian government to release the Serb
officers arrested on allegation of committing war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Grachev, who is in Belgrade on a two-day official visit, told
reporters after his arrival from Bosnia that "Gen. Djordje Djukic
is a respected general, who did not take part in combat operations
as he is in charge of security." "What's more, he is very sick,"
Grachev said.
</P>
<P>
Djukic, in his seventies, and Col. Aleksa Krsmanovic were
arrested by Muslim authorities on January 30 in an IFOR-controlled
area in Sarajevo while on their way to a meeting with IFOR
officials. The Bosnian government has accused them and some other
detained Serb soldiers of killing civilians during the three and
half year civil war.
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Djukic, whose name is not on the list of alleged war
criminals indicted by the Hague international tribunal, should
receive medical treatment," Grachev said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister also said he had met Wednesday with
Bosnian Serb leaders who had expressed serious concern for this
incident. He will also submit a report to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to inform him of the issue.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decides Not to Expand B-2 Bomber Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has decided not to expand the U.S. Air Force's fleet of B-2
stealth bombers, the White House announced today.
</P>
<P>
"The administration believes that no additional B-2s are
required," U.S. National Security Council staff member Robert Bell
told reporters. "The president concluded that the B-2 is a highly
capable long-range and stealthy bomber, but that additional B-2s
would be too costly."
</P>
<P>
The advanced stealth plane costs over 1 billion U.S. dollars
and the U.S. Air Force has ordered 20 B-2 bombers. But the
Republican-controlled Congress has been insisting that the
Pentagon should order other 20 B-2 stealth planes to meet the
potential security threat.
</P>
<P>
"We do not rule out the possibility the study could come in and
provide the basis for buying additional B-2s, but we don't presume
that," Bell said.
</P>
<P>
Buying and operating 20 more B-2s would cost an estimated 30
billion dollars, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
The decision comes as a disappointment to California, a key
state in Clinton's re-election bid, where Northrop Grumman Corp.
employs some 9,000 workers in the B-2 program.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Juvenile Crime Tops Cities' Problem List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Youth crime tops the list of
worsening problems in cities, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
The National League of Cities' 12th annual opinion survey
released Thursday also found an increased percentage of local
officials who believe race and ethnic relations are deteriorating,
from 28 percent in the 1994 survey to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
The race issue also made its first appearance this year as a
top issue to be addressed in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
There were encouraging findings, too.
</P>
<P>
Violent crime was seen as less of a problem, and
community-police relations got better. So did the quality of life
and local economic conditions, according to the responses of 406
officials from cities with more than 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials warned that failure to deal with issues
involving teens -- crime, gangs, drugs, school violence, family
stability and the overall quality of life -- would hurt the nation
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Youth crime and quality of education were most frequently
mentioned as important issues to address in the next two years,
followed by city fiscal and economic conditions and unemployment,
the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Sends U.S. Envoy to Bosnia for Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher has sent chief American mediator Richard
Holbrooke to the Balkans to resolve the crisis in implementing the
Bosnian peace treaty, the U.S. State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a press briefing here
that Christopher, who is visiting Finland, made the decision after
talking to the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia aboard his
plane flying to Helsinki earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"There is a general problem on some implementation issues,"
Burns said. "The United States is sending a strong signal to all
the parties that the United States wants the Dayton accords fully
implemented."
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Muslims have reportedly seized two senior Bosnian Serb
officers and six other soldiers alleged to have committed war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Bosnian Serb army today suspended all contacts
with the NATO-led peace implementation forces. In addition, there
have been more tensions over the city of Mostar in southern
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who brokered the peace agreement to end the 43-month
war in Bosnia in Dayton, Ohio, last November, is on a visit to
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
He will be accompanied by other senior U.S. officials on his
new mission, Burns said. The officials will include Robert
Gallucci, who is in charge of implementation of the peace accord,
and John Shattuck, the assistant secretary of state for human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Burns stressed that the disposition of the prisoners should
be decided by the International War Crimes Tribunal based in the
Hague, the Netherlands. Those not suspected of war crimes should
be released, he added.

<HEADLINE> Serbian President Meets with Russian Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic held talks here today with visiting Russian Defense
Minister Pavel Grachev on political and military situation in the
Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed the implementation of the peace
agreement in Bosnia and bilateral cooperation in the military
field, a statement issued by the Serbian presidential office said.
</P>
<P>
It is essential that all sides in Bosnia make constructive
cooperation with the multinational peace implementation force, and
the latter must maintain an impartial attitude and ensure a
continued compliance of the peace agreement by the parties in the
country, it added.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Milosevic and Grachev also talked about several
initiatives for further development of cooperation between the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Russia, including scientific
and technical cooperation and exchange of expertise in military
industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President of the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro
Momir Bulatovic also held talks with Grachev today in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"The talks dealt with the current stage of the peace process,
and Grachev informed us about his visit to the Russian contingent
in Bosnia," Bulatovic said after meeting with the Russian defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the arrest of a group of Bosnian Serb officers
and soldiers, Bulatovic said that "IFOR has a duty to act more
resolutely in such cases."
</P>
<P>
He said that he and Grachev had hoped that this was an isolated
incident which would have no serious consequences on the peace
process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Grachev arrived here earlier today to pay a two-day official
visit to Yugoslavia after a one-day visit to Bosnia where he
visited the Russian contingent enforcing the peace agreement with
NATO-led multinational peace force.

<HEADLINE> UN, Iraq Discuss Details of Oil Export Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 8 (Xinhua) - The United Nations and
Iraq today started to talk about details on how to ship Iraq's oil
and how the revenues from the oil export would be managed based on
the oil-for-food formula for the first time in five years.
</P>
<P>
Sylvana Foa, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said the
two sides discussed distribution of medicine and foodstuffs, oil
export and banking details following Security Council Resolution
986.
</P>
<P>
The talks to implement the resolution began Tuesday. Iraq's
chief negotiator Abdul Amir-al Anbari said discussions for Friday
would be limited to technical aspects and full-fledged
negotiations would resume Monday.
</P>
<P>
After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the United Nations
imposed economic sanctions, including an oil embargo on Iraq,
which earned some 10 billion U.S. dollars before the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions have crippled Iraq's economy and brought tremendous
sufferings to the Iraqi people. A World Food Program report showed
that more than 4 million people, or one fifth of the population,
suffered from malnutrition, which caused many deaths among the
children and infants.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted Resolution 986 in April 1995,
which allows Iraq to export oil worth 2 billion dollars in six
months, and the revenues would go into an escrow account. Iraq
then purchases necessary humanitarian supplies which have to be
distributed equitably.
</P>
<P>
Foa said the Iraqi team briefed the United Nations on its
current food rationing system and urgent medical and electricity
needs.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is also expected to ask for the permission to import
materials to boost its electricity, needed to pump oil again.

<HEADLINE> Top Greek Military Officer to Be Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government today
decided to replace the armed forces' Chief of Staff Admiral
Christos Lymberis following his refusal to resign.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the Government Council for Foreign
Affairs and Defense at a meeting attended by inner cabinet members
and chaired by Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
Lymberis, the top military officer of the country, has been
accused of making public a conversation he had with the prime
minister during the critical hours of the recent Greek-Turkish
stand-off in the eastern Aegean over the dispute of the
sovereignty of Imia Island.
</P>
<P>
In a statement earlier this week, Lymberis said that plans to
recapture the disputed Imia's adjacent Rock, briefly taken by
Turkish commandos, had been turned down by the government to avoid
a military clash.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas termed the general's
statement as "unethical," adding the act "damages the prestige and
moral standards of the armed forces."
</P>
<P>
The replacement is expected to be finalized on February 18 when
promotions of high-ranking military officers are made.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Seeks Support For Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Louis Farrakhan, a black leader
in the United States, has urged Nigerians to be patient and give
the Sani Abacha administration the chance to evolve a viable
democratic system for Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan was quoted today by the News Agency of Nigeria as
saying here on Wednesday that he believed Nigerian Head of State
Abacha would keep his 1998 promise to hand over to a
democratically-elected government.
</P>
<P>
"To ask for three years for democracy is not too much," he
said, adding that the present Nigerian administration should be
supported by all Africans because of its commitment to the
emancipation of black people.
</P>
<P>
The Abacha military government announced in last October a
three-year transition-to-civil-rule political program.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan said the current Nigerian government was keeping to
the Nigerian tradition of being independent and not allowing it
to be pushed around by those members of the international
community who did not wish Nigeria well.
</P>
<P>
He praised the administration for its independent posture,
saying the government's refusal to take foreign loans in the last
two years attested to its independence and resolution to use and
manage its local resources for development.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigerians were a strong willed people and natural
leaders and urged Nigerians to solve their internal problems so
that they could contribute their quota to the development of
humanity and the black man.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan, who was on a five-day fact-finding mission to
Nigeria, visited detained Moshood Abiola, and toured Rivers, Edo,
Osun and Borno states and capital Abuja during his visit.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Army Suspends Contacts with IFOR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb Army command
decided today to suspend all contacts with the NATO-led
Implementation Force IFOR until the Bosnian government releases 11
Serb soldiers and officers arrested in Sarajevo on January 30.
</P>
<P>
The command said in a statement that Army commander Gen. Ratko
Mladic had also ordered the suspension of all contacts between the
army of the Bosnian Serb state Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Djordje Djukic, Colonel Aleksa Krsmanovic and a group of
soldiers have been arrested by Muslim-Croat authorities in a
IFOR-controlled area in Sarajevo on the allegation of killing
civilians during the war.
</P>
<P>
The order "bans the Serb citizens and army personnel from
crossing into the territory of the Muslim-Croat federation,"
Tanjug news agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Mladic's order was made in line with
government decision on Tuesday to severe all contacts with the
federation in the wake of the arrests. The Serb government has
also called off meetings with E.U. High Representative Carl Bildt
and Britain's Prince Charles scheduled for later this week.
</P>
<P>
The army command further cancelled the participation of the
Serb army's representatives in all scheduled military and civilian
meetings with representatives of the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authority has also blamed IFOR in Bosnia for not
pressuring the Muslim government to release all Serb detainees.
The IFOR explained that the case was now in the hands of the Hague
tribunal for war crimes in former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Hague Tribunal asked the Bosnian government on Wednesday to
arrest the two Serb officers provisionally.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier Says NATO Expansion Can split Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin stressed today that the North Atlantic Treaty
organization(NATO) eastward expansion may result in Europe's
split.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing after his meeting with Danish Prime Minister
Poul Rasmussen, Chernomyrdin emphasized that Russia is against any
initiative to expand NATO eastward.
</P>
<P>
"This will result in Europe's split. We should think about how
to strengthen Europe and organize European security, not how to
put up new obstacles," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen arrived here on Wednesday for his first visit to
Russia. During his three-day stay, he is expected to meet a number
of Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Danish premier said, "Our countries held different views
upon the matter. Yet we do not treat the NATO issue as an isolated
problem, but regard it in the context of cooperation with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) and
Partnership for Peace Program."
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen told reporters that he discussed the problem of NATO
expansion with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Says Investment Critical for S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Increased local and
international investment are critical if south africa is to
realize its full potential and ensure a better life for all its
people, President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Columbus Stainless Steel Plant in Middelburg,
Mpumalanga province, Mandela said the plant should become an
integral part of national industrial strategy aimed at moving
South Africa from a third-world exporter of primary commodities
to a first-world exporter of manufactured products.
</P>
<P>
The Columbus Stainless Steel Plant is believed to be the
largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the government is committed to assisting in the
removal of constraints to South Africa's international
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The department of trade and industry is promoting industrial
clusters in which the large capital-intensive "upstream"
producers would come together with small labor-intensive
"downstream" producers to manufacture internationally competitive
finished products, said the president.
</P>
<P>
He added that the manufacturing sector would need
competitively priced raw materials if it wants to survive and
expand into export markets.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has the world's largest chromite ore reserves and
huge iron and nickel reserves, the basic constituents of
stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
Instead of exporting these raw materials, the Columbus plant
would turn them into value-added material that could provide
other manufacturers with the raw material for their own products.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela said the plant's plans to increase the
proportion of its locally used product would be more successful
if carried out in cooperation with the department of trade and
industry.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, about 100,000 jobs could be created in 10
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The plant would also offer immense potential for small, medium
and micro-scale enterprises that tend to be labor-intensive,
especially for the black community previously denied such
opportunities, the president noted.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Cannot Afford Lip-service To Change: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela, while addressing the 1996 opening session of
Parliament in Cape Town today, called on all South Africans to
become "builders and healers" in transformation of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africans should not wallow in the notions of the
past, nor could the country afford to have influentially powerful
people who paid lip service to affirmative action, black
empowerment and emancipation of women.
</P>
<P>
"We can neither heal nor build, if such healing and building
are perceived as one-way processes, with the victims of past
injustices forgiving and the beneficiaries merely content in
gratitude," said the president.
</P>
<P>
in this regard, the rich should not see the poor as "hordes of
irritants", while the poor should not sit back expecting charity,
Mandela said, adding "all of us must take responsibility for the
upliftment of our conditions, prepared to give our best to the
benefit of all".
</P>
<P>
In his over-an-hour-long State of the Nation speech, Mandela
stressed that South Africa would not be transformed, if there
were still people in positions of influence and power who, at
best, paid lip service to affirmative action, black empowerment
and the emancipation of women, or who were in reality opposed to
these goals.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all South Africans to work together to ensure
the equitable distribution of wealth, opportunity and power in
society.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, South Africa was well on its way to a new better
life, which would ultimately be achieved only if South Africans
shed the temptation to proceed casually along the road, added
Mandela.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President Receives Russian Defence Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
and Russian Defence Minister Gen. Pavel Grachev held talks here
today on the implementation of the Bosnia peace agreement and
promotion of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Grachev said the arrest of Bosnian Serb
officers and soldiers was a direct violation of the peace
agreement, according to a statement issued by the Yugoslav
presidential office.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government has arrested eight Serb officers and
soldiers, including Gen. Djordie Djukic and Col. Aleksa
Krsmanovic, accusing them of committing war crimes during the war.
The Serb side has suspended all contacts with the Muslim-Croat
federation to protest against the arrest.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defence Minister also said the international
community should lift the sanctions against the Bosnian Serb state
because all conditions for the lifting had been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Lilic said Yugoslavia could be a guarantor of
peace if it was fully reintegrated in international political and
financial institutions and if conditions were created for its
economic restoration and strengthening of social stability.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.N.-imposed sanctions were suspended last
November, Yugoslavia was still yet to be a full member of the
international community. Under the Bosnian peace agreement, the
sanctions against Yugoslavia will be completely ended by the first
week of the elections in Bosnia which is scheduled in summer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Grachev also held talks with his Yugoslav
counterpart Pavle Bulatovic over the military and political
situation in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that Yugoslavia and Russia should coordinate
their activities in the consistent realization of the Dayton
agreement, said a joint statement issued at the end of Grachev's
two-day official visit to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Grachev confirmed Russia's efforts to
continue playing a major role to ensure that the Balkan peoples
overcome the consequences of war and restore peace in the region
with their own efforts.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped to see Yugoslavia to become a full-fledged member
of all international organizations soon, it added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania To Host Refugee Donor Conference (By Pei Shanqin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A one-day donor
conference for rehabilitation and sustainable development of
refugee affected communities in Kigoma Region, Western Tanzania,
will be held next Wednesday in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
A senior Official in the Prime Minister's office told Xinhua
here today that the conference, to be presided over by the
Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation,
Jakaya Kikwete, would be opened by Prime Minister Frederick
Sumaye.
</P>
<P>
The conference was in response to a request by the government
to the donor community to assist in the reconstruction and
sustainable development of the region.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the conference, a team of the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) consultants visited the Kigoma
Region recently to assess the impact of the influx of refugees
and to propose programs of intervention.
</P>
<P>
In its report headed with "Reconstruction and Development of
Kigoma Region", five main areas have been identified for
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
They are the road infrastructure, environment and natural
resources; the social sector including water supply and
sanitation, education and health, and district and regional
administrative capacity.
</P>
<P>
Kigoma is one of the two most hit regions by the influx of
refugees from Rwanda and Burundi over the past three years. At
present, there are about 400,000 refugees, most of whom are from
Burundi, in the region.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Train Collision Kills Three in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Two commuter trains
traveling in opposite directions collided in eastern U.S. this
morning, killing at least three people and injuring more than 100
others, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
One train carrying 600 rush-hour commuters and the other with
about 100 people aboard collided in a switching yard in Secaucus,
a New Jersey town about five miles from New York City.
</P>
<P>
Both engineers and a passenger were killed and more than 100
others were hurt, including 16 people suffering severe injuries
such as fractures and cuts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue crews treated some of the injured on site and rushed the
rest to nearby hospitals by a helicopter and ambulances. But some
of the injured had to walk to the nearest paved road because the
site is in a marshland and only accessible by dirt road.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey Transit officials said the cause of accident might
have been human error, because one of the trains past a stop
signal.
</P>
<P>
"The train that was moving east went three and a half car
lengths past the signal and then sideswiped the other passenger
train moving west," said Robert Randall, general manager of rail
operations.
</P>
<P>
"There was a loud bang and sudden jerk," passenger Richard
Hirtler was quoted by the Associated Press as saying. "I could see
the Main Line (train) as it went by the other way, and I could see
the engine as it was torn up."
</P>
<P>
The crash disrupted service on two New Jersey Transit lines.
The uninjured commuters at the crash site were sent to their
destinations by buses and another train.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Peace Process not in Danger: UN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Angola General Philip Sibanda said today
Angola's peace process remains on the track.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks to reporters here on his return from
Huambo after inspecting the assembly work of troops of the
opposition Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Sibanda admitted that among those sent by UNITA to the four
UN-supervised assembly camps are old men and teenagers, but Most
of them are between 18 and 30 and those under 18 or over 40 are
just a few.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not think the peace process in Angola is now in
danger and people should wait and see how things further develops.
</P>
<P>
He went there today to check why UNITA had not sent 16,500
fighters to four assembly camps as scheduled on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
What is more, at the 31st regular session of the joint
commission on peace process Thursday, Chief General Staff of the
government Joao de Matos blamed UNITA for sending teenagers with
useless and scrapped arms to quartering points.
</P>
<P>
There are two assembly camps in central Huambo province, one
each in Bango and Uige provinces. And UNITA has sent more than
9,000 former fighters to these four camps so far.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that three more assembly camps will be opened
on February 15 in order to accommodate more former UNITA
fighters.
