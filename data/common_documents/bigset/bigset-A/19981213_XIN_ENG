<HEADLINE> Taliban Will Not Extradite Osama bin Laden: Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
will not extradite Osama bin Laden to any country even if charges
against him are proved, a senior Taliban representative in
Islamabad said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have no extradition treaty with any country and will not
hand over Osama to third country even after charges are proved
against him," Maulvi Saeed-ur-Rahman Haqqani told the media after
the launching ceremony of a book on Kashmir held here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that no country or individual has produced any evidence
of Osama's involvement in terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
"In our view Osama bin Laden is cleared of charges of
terrorism," Haqqani said.
</P>
<P>
However, he denies that the Saudi national had been granted
Afghan citizenship, saying he would continue to stay in
Afghanistan as a guest of the militia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said "Osama has given us a written assurance that
he will not work against any country from the land of
Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Osama has been accused of sponsoring terrorism against the
Americans, for which the Unites States has asked the Taliban to
extradite him.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Offer No Further Enlargement Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders turned
down Saturday a European Commission proposal to promote Latvia,
Lithuania and Slovakia on to the fast track of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government from the 15-nation union
agreed at the Vienna summit to maintain the current pace of the
bloc's proposed enlargement.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the commission should only submit its next
interim report on accession progress to the Helsinki summit at the
end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the bloc, proposed in its
first annual progress report in November that the three countries
should be rewarded for their accession-oriented reform efforts by
promoting them to the fast track.
</P>
<P>
Sweden was the lone member state that during the summit uttered
the desire to promote the Baltic states and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Austria, that now holds the rotating union presidency, has
pressed for consideration of its eastern neighbor Slovakia
following the change of its government in autumn.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel told the press that
Slovakia has been so courageous as to choose a different regime as
one of their efforts for accession.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, the European Union opened membership talks
with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Slovenia and
Estonia.
</P>
<P>
Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria were also
admitted to the membership process but at a slower pace while
Turkey is also applying for membership but was not invited.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Says PNC Not to Vote on Revising Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat reiterated Saturday that
the Palestinian National Council (PNC) will not conduct an actual
vote when it meets to amend the Palestinian charter next week,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Gaza after meeting with
visiting Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez Tarwanah, Arafat said a
vote by the PNC is not required by the latest deal he signed with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Wye Plantation in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye River Memorandum, the PNC, the Palestinian
parliament in exile, will convene in Gaza Monday to annul the
articles calling for the destruction of Israel in the Palestinian
national charter.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 PNC members, as well as representatives from
other Palestinian bodies, will at the meeting reaffirm a letter
sent to U.S. President Bill Clinton by Arafat in January
declaring those anti-Israel articles void and null.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has insisted that the PNC conduct a vote when it
amends the charter, but Arafat contended that how the PNC will
reaffirm the nullification is an internal Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to the gathering, to be addressed by Clinton, the
Palestinian Central Council, a 124-member body consisting of PNC
members, PLO legislative council representatives and other
Palestinian officials, voted to annul the anti-Israel clauses by
an overwhelming majority Thursday. Israel has welcomed this move.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will arrive in Israel at mid-night Saturday for a
three-day visit to Israel and Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Widespread violence in the West Bank and renewed
recriminations, however, have cast a shadow over the visit, the
first by a sitting U.S. president to areas under Palestinian
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Reports said at least five Palestinians and one Israeli
soldiers were wounded Saturday in clashes in the West Bank town of
Bethlehem, where Palestinians resumed demonstrations to protest
Israel's refusal to release Palestinian political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the prisoners issue has sparked a week-long
violence in the West Bank, leaving four Palestinians killed and
more than 150 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Israel accused the PNA of encouraging violence and suspended
the pending phase of troop redeployment until the Palestinians
meet a list of new demands.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians rejected the fresh requests, accusing Israel
of violation of the peace accord by including common criminals
into the first band of 250 Palestinian prisoners released last
month.
</P>
<P>
The Wye accord asks Israel to set free 750 Palestinian
political detainees from its jails. Some 3,000 Palestinians are
now held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Washington has proposed a compromise that
a three-way committee to be established to examine the list of
prisoners due to be released in the remaining two stages of the
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
But Israel said it would never release those who had killed
Israelis. It denied the proposed compromise and insisted that the
issue is not for negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Causeway Built in Mecca to Facilitate Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A causeway in Mecca, the
holy city in Saudi Arabia, has been built to ease traffic jams as
the kingdom made preparations for the pilgrimage seasons.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Press Agency said Saturday that the causeway, which
costs 3.7 million U.S. dollars, will further facilitate traffic
and distance worshippers.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims would be strolling between Mount Safa and Mount
Marwa, two holy shrines, during pilgrimage and mini-pilgrimage
(Umra) seasons, said Sheikh Mohammad Al-Sbeyyel in charge of
affairs of the holy shrines.
</P>
<P>
The causeway will be benefited from during the month of
Ramadan, expected to open next Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the presidency of the holy shrines said it has made
a comprehensive plan to provide all needs, like fixing extra loud
speakers, lights and over 700 free-of-charge wheelchairs for the
elderly, in and outside the mosque.
</P>
<P>
The plan, put to serve around 2 million Muslims, also includes
more police patrols, it said.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Skirt Divergence, Eye Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders
pronounced a four-point strategy for the future development of
Europe Saturday at the end of a divergence-laden summit.
</P>
<P>
Having skirted the trickiest issue of budget reform, the heads
of state and government of the 15-nation bloc gave employment the
top priority in the strategy that also includes improvement of the
quality of life, institutional reform and Europe-wide stability
and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Federal Chancellor Victor Klima, whose country is
holding the rotating presidency of the union, said at the end of
the two-day summit that the strategy maps out the basic course for
the future development of the continent and lays groundwork for
the next presidency.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of employment by saying that the
union faces with employment, employment and then again employment
and that employment contributes toward both macroeconomic growth
and social stability.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the EU started focusing on the issue
of employment in 1996, verifiable targets will be set out for the
improvement of employment.
</P>
<P>
Germany was commissioned by the Vienna summit to draft by next
June a European Employment Pact within the framework of the
previous Luxembourg employment guidelines. Quantification will be
the key to the employment pact.
</P>
<P>
The EU stressed freedom, security and justice as the keys for
improving the quality of life of its citizens while institutional
reforms are aimed at rendering the European Commission and the
European Council of Ministers more effective and efficient.
</P>
<P>
Last but not least, the European Union called for effective
application of a common foreign and security policy that is
expected to offer the bloc a bigger role to play on the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
But such a common policy cannot be expected before the Treaty
of Amsterdam is finally ratified by all the member states.
</P>
<P>
As the next presidency, Germany is left with the urgency of
taking care of the immediate future of the union. A frenzy of
activities were packed into its six-month tenure with the
conclusion of an internal reform package in March, as well as an
employment pact and a tax harmonization deal both in June.
</P>
<P>
None of the tasks, however, is easy. They are actually so
complicated and explosive that the EU leaders had to leave them as
they had been before the start of their summit.
</P>
<P>
The thorniest issue in the aspect of internal reforms concerns
how the EU gets and spends its money. The rich countries of the
union prefer to pay less while the poorer countries prefer to keep
their share if not ask for more.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna strategy with a vision on future will shortly be put
to severe test in the nearest future when the single currency is
launched on January 1 and all member states strive for stability
and development union-wide as well as in their own courtyards.

<HEADLINE> WFP Assists Drought-Hit Tanzanian Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program
(WFP) has allocated 21,000 tons of emergency food supply for
Singida and Dodoma regions in central Tanzania which suffered
from a drought this season.
</P>
<P>
WFP country director, Irene Lacy, told reporters in Dar es
Salaam Saturday that the food supply is mainly maize purchased
from South Africa and will cost a total of six million U.S.
Dollars upon delivery to the drought-affected regions.
</P>
<P>
Lacy said that the WFP has made the move in response to the
two region's plea for food assistance to feed more than 300,000
people.
</P>
<P>
She said the maize is being distributed under a two-phase
special operation. The first phase which started in the first
week of November will end toward the end of this month while the
second phase will begin in January.
</P>
<P>
Lacy said Dodoma has been allocated with 12,000 tons while
Singida Region will get 9,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lacy said that WFP's reaction to the nationwide
food crisis is to wait for a report by three government
assessment teams which are currently investigating in various
parts of this east African country.
</P>
<P>
She said when the report is ready, WFP representatives will
sit with the government and representatives from the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) to discuss how to handle the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of the country have reported food deficit following
an unusually dry season linked to La Nina. So far, only Mbeya,
Rukwa and Kagera regions have been saved from the drought.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye Thursday visited
several markets in Dar es Salaam and was shocked by higher prices
of various foodstuffs caused by shortage of supplies. He has
pleaded for emergency measures against such a situation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Beefs up Massive Security for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- About 15,000 Israeli
policemen have been deployed to ensure security for the United
States President Bill Clinton who was scheduled to arrive in Tel
Aviv at midnight Saturday, Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
The police and the Shin Bet Security Services took up positions
in various parts of Jerusalem, the center of police protection,
Saturday to prevent any possible terrorist attacks, a police
officer told Xinhua on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
First Lady Hillary Clinton, First Daughter Chelsea, and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright are accompanying President
Clinton on the visit, along with a team of about 1,000
technicians, security personnel, media people and others.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Hilton Hotel, where the Clintons will stay, was
guarded by about 500 policemen, while thousands of police began
patrolling the streets of Jerusalem Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, roadblocks on the roads leading to Jerusalem were
beefed up and snap roadblocks were also set up.
</P>
<P>
As part of the strict security measures, all streets where the
president's convoy will pass will be cleared of cars hours before
his arrival and completely sealed off as the convoy goes through.
</P>
<P>
The security measures are not only aimed at the Palestinians in
East Jerusalem, but also at possible spontaneous violent
demonstrations by Israeli extremists, the officer added.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian
territories, Clinton is to hold talks with Israeli leaders on
Sunday and pay his historical visit to Gaza on Monday during
which he will meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and attend a
meeting of the Palestinian National Council.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Opposition Rejects Charter Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian opposition groups
here Saturday rejected the decision of senior Palestinian
leadership to cancel the anti-Israel provisions from the
Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
These hardline groups opened a conference here to voice their
opposition the decision to nullify the clauses calling for
Israel's destruction in the Palestinian covenant.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Palestinian Central Council, a 124-member body
consisting of mainly Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO)
legislative council representatives and officials, voted by an
overwhelming majority to make the clauses null and void.
</P>
<P>
This paves the way for the 600-member Palestinian National
Council (PNC), regarded as the Palestinian parliament in exile, to
meet next week to reaffirm the significant move.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation of anti-Israeli provisions was called for in
the Wye river accord signed by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in October.
</P>
<P>
However, there are Palestinians who oppose the changes and are
committed to the national charter. The speakers at the meeting
here agreed that the charter is a constitution and a source of
might for the Palestinian people to achieve their goals and
national aspirations.
</P>
<P>
The session, chaired by chief of the Palestine National
Salvation Front (PNSF) Khaled Al-Fahoum, will deal with the latest
developments of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict following what he
called PLO decision to revise charter.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 Representatives of all Palestinian opposition
factions as well as some PNC members attended the meeting. Also
present at the session were envoys of Arab liberation movements
and parties in Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, Algeria and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Anticipates Rising Foreign Investment in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment
(FDI) in China is expected to reach 45 billion US dollars for
1998, or roughly same as last year's figure, according to the
China Economic Herald.
</P>
<P>
China has a great potential for absorbing even more foreign
investment during 1999, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Economic development in southeast Asian countries is expected
to take a favorable turn by the middle of the year, with
investments from the region expected to fall below this year's
level. However, the decline will exert slight influence on China's
overall investment plan since the region accounts for a mere two
percent of the nation's total foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Investments from Germany, Britain and the United States are
expected to increase considerably.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is currently the main source of foreign
direct investments, with funds from member countries expected to
grow during 1999.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Falls In India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Annual rate of inflation in
India fell below eight percent for the first time in six months to
7.85 percent for the week ending November 28.
</P>
<P>
Provisional figure showed that inflation rate, based on the
wholesale price index, fell 0.28 point to 7.85 percent from 8.13
percent in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, official statistics showed, annual inflation was
at 4.40 percent during the correspondent week last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has been going down ever since it touched a 163-week
high of 8.85 percent in the first week of November as the upsurge
in food prices continued to ease in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the decline would only mean that the price of food
articles, particularly that of vegetables and edible oil, have
started easing from its previous high.
</P>
<P>
During the week ending November 28, vegetable prices eased by
eight percent while that of edible oil were cheaper by about one
percent.
</P>
<P>
The index for all commodities during the week declined by 0.1
percent to 358.5 percent against 358.9 percent in the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
Indices of primary and manufactured articles moved marginally
up and down respectively, while index for the third major group of
fuel, power, light and lubricants remained unchanged for the
second consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
But inflation based on consumer price index for industrial
workers ruled at a record high of 18.6 percent in October compared
to the wholesale price index of just eight percent in the same
month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign currency assets in India have increased by
23 million U.S. dollars to 26.554 billion U.S. dollars during the
week ending December four.
</P>
<P>
However, the weekly statistical bulletin released on Sunday by
the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank of the country, said
gold reserve held with the bank declined by 21 million U.S.
dollars to 3,041 million U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Ha'erbin Hess won the 1998
Chinese ice hockey  league for the first time since the
home-away tournament started three years ago by beating
Qiqiha'er Blackdragon 4-2 Sunday night in the second leg of the
two-game final series.
</P>
<P>
Hess humiliated Blackdragon, the winner in the preliminary
round, with an aggregate 9-4. It triumphed 5-2 in the first game
of the finals on Saturday in the Capital Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Hess opened the mark 2-0 before Blackdragon stormed back to
level the score.
</P>
<P>
Though the capital audience were consistent on the side of
Blackdragon throughout the games, Hess played more calm and solid
in defence at the third period and found the net twice to seal
the victory.
</P>
<P>
The two northeast teams met four times in the preliminary
double round-robin stage and won two each.
</P>
<P>
Blackdragon coach Chen Danian sung high of Hess' three Russian
players, Fertikov Sergey, Voroliev Oleg and Kondratenko Egik,
saying "They have better understanding of the game and played the
crucial roles in Hess' victories."
</P>
<P>
The three Russians were recruited by Hess, who were runner-up
at the last three seasons, in the late time of the preliminary
round.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jingang of Hess' head coach, however, said: "It's our
players who played a great game tonight. the Russians didn't
score in the two games and I played only one of them tonight."
</P>
<P>
Jimusi Amet and Jilin Zhiyao finished third as both scored
three points with one win and one draw in the three-five-place
playoff in earlier matches. Zhuhai Landi lost both.
</P>
<P>
The league in the season began in September with five teams
played home-and-away matches in northeast cities in China before
they came to Beijing for the finals.

<HEADLINE> Great Hall Joins Opening Effort (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- "Stark steel railings
prevented common citizens from entering the Great Hall of the
People until 1978, with the facility virtually 'off-limits' during
its first 20 years of operation," according to Su Chengqiu, an
employee from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
However, the Great Hall, located on the west side of the
Tian'anmen Square in downtwon Beijing, has hosted more than 44
million visitors from both at home and abroad since opening its
doors to the public on July 15, 1979. This was regarded as a major
signal marking the introduction of China's reform and opening
drive.
</P>
<P>
Su, 56, director of Administration of the Great Hall, exhibits
great emotion about the huge building which Deng Xiaoping called
the "national emblem". He pointed out that the Great Hall has
played a big part in China's reform and opening efforts over the
past two decades.
</P>
<P>
"China maintained contacts with a few Asian, African and Latin
American countries prior to the introduction of reform and
opening, with only a limited number of state receptions held in
the Great Hall in a year," said Su.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders from numerous countries have visited China along with
expanded opening in pursuit of joint economic development. The
Great Hall now hosts dozens of state receptions each year,"
according to Su.
</P>
<P>
He added that discussions during receptions center on
investment and economic cooperation, in addition to politics and
assistance.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, Kazakhstan Split Golds in Wrestling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Kazakhstan
split the four Greco-Roman wrestling golds in stake here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the 54kg class final, Sim Kwon-Ho of South Korea tied with
teammate Kang Yong-Gyun at 5-5, but he finally won the gold for
having more positive charges. The bronze went to China's Wang Hui,
who held off Dilshod Aripov of Uzbekistan 7-0 in the third-place
playoff.
</P>
<P>
South Korea wrestler came on strong again in the 63kg class
final when Choi Sang-Sun edged Bakhodyr Kurbanov of Uzbekistan 4-3
for the gold. Yi Shanjun of China claimed the bronze.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan proved they are mightier in the heavier class as
they bagged the 76kg and 97kg class golds.
</P>
<P>
Bakhtiyar Baiseitoy beat Japan's Takamitsu Katayama to win the
76kg-class gold while Sergey Matviyenko of Kazakhstan overpowered
Mohamad Al Haek 3-0 to prevail in the 97kg class final.
</P>
<P>
China's hope to win a gold was dashed when Zheng Zetian lost on
his way to the final in the 58kg race. The 25-year-old Olympic
bronze medallist was dispatched by Uzbekistan's A. Hudoyberdiev
3-0 in a second-round race.
</P>
<P>
Sheng was the last Chinese wrestler to be ousted in the
Greco-Roman competition.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make a short work of the competiton. But it
backfired on me finally," said Sheng, who won a bronze both in
Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics,
</P>
<P>
"I was just too eager to win, " he added.

<HEADLINE> China Encounters Ups and Downs in Asiad Daylight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- As strongwomen backed off the
scene with 13 world records, runners and jumpers stepped in on
Sunday to grab for the five out of 45 golds put at stake in the
Asiad's track and field competitions.
</P>
<P>
Despite a haul of nine golds, China still encountered ups and
downs in the daylight as its strongwomen swept all seven golds
with 12 world records while its shooters had an empty-handed note
in the last-day shooting finals and a 2-3 defeat by Japan in the
track and field.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 world records were broken in the women's
weightlifting, all by the Chinese as each of their seven entries
becomes world record holder, with a lone exception of DPR Korean
Ri Song-Hui in the 58-kg class.
</P>
<P>
"We are the best and are very proud of the achievements," said
Chinese weightlifting head coach Han Guihua,"We do have a little
sense of pity for missing one record, but it was good for and in
the interests of the development of the sport."
</P>
<P>
China's monopoly in the women's weightlifting was broken, "and
we recognized it as a healthy sign for the sport," said Han.
</P>
<P>
Women's weightlifting will be more interesting with surprises
in the future after the participation of strongwomen from Myanmar,
India, Thailand and with DPR Korea in particular.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it was not all cheers for the Chinese athletes as they
still had to cope with a poor start in the athletics wherein Japan
who beat China 15-13 in the swimming pool, again established a 3-2
lead in the first-day competitions.
</P>
<P>
Yu Guohui, 22, claimed the first athletics gold for China from
the men's 20-km walking in a new Games record of 1:20:25 before
Luan Zhili threw to 63.43 meters to take the women's discus.
</P>
<P>
However, Japan accumulated three golds from men's hammer throw,
women's high jump and the 10,000 meters through Koji Murofushi,
Yoko Ota and Kenji Takao.
</P>
<P>
"It's no surprise for me to win and I could walk faster if the
wind was slower," said Yu whose only rival was Valeriy Borissov of
Kazakhstan, bronze medalist at the Asian Championships last July,
who finished second in 1:23:52.
</P>
<P>
But it was not an easy case for Japanese Koji Murofushi as he
had to beat former Olympic and twice world champion Andrey
Abuvaliev of Uzbekistan in the hammer throw.
</P>
<P>
Murofushi, 24, son of former Asian hammer legend Skigenobu,
heaved a winning toss of 78.57 meters in his third attempt,
leaving a silver medal to Abuvaliev, Barcelona Olympic champion
and world champion in 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Abuduvaliev is a great teacher of mine," Murofushi said. "I
never expected I can win here. I think he has not prepared well
for the Asian Games."
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ota Yoko beat China's Asian record-holder Jin Ling to
take the women's high jump as "it is the second win for me in big
international competitions."
</P>
<P>
In the athletics heats and semifinals, Li Xuemei of China and
world 200m silver medalist S. Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka proved they
are top two sprinters of Asia as both made the finals of women's
100m by topping their semi-final groups with Li clocking 10.99
seconds and Jayasinghe in 11.30.
</P>
<P>
For Hong Kong, China, Lee Lai-Shan again became the savior by
awarding its frist gold medal in the women's windsurfing mistral.
</P>
<P>
After her victory in Atlanta, the only Olympic gold for Hong
Kong, Lee nowsdays increased her collection of the Asian, European
and World Championships, and indicated that she may not to compete
as a 34-year-old woman in the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In the battle for 16 yachting golds, South Korea collected the
most of six, while China and Thailand each won three, with two to
Singapore and remaining one to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Thus, South Korea overtook Japan to rank in a distant second
place with 35 golds against Japan's 32, both lagging far behind
China which tops the gold tally with 79 as the competitions go
halfway in the fortnight Asian Games.

The Great Hall of the People was listed as one of China's "Ten
Largest Buildings" in the 1950s, with its floor space of 172,000
sq.m. far surpassing the total area of the nearby Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
The hall has not only served as an important venue for China's
political and foreign affairs, but is also the home of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Su, a "steward" of the Great Hall, is not only busy in running
the hall's daily affairs, but also attempts to secure greater
profits for the facility.
</P>
<P>
"Meeting halls are available to enterprises seeking venues for
business meeting," said Su, adding that related activities
accounted 20 percent of over 3,000 events held in the Great Hall
during 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hall operates various hotels, companies and golf
courses to make full use of its advantages in terms of personnel
and facilities. Related ventures employ over 1,300 people and pay
taxes of some 40 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Projections call for the Great Hall to earn more than 100
million yuan during 1998 in spite of the financial crisis sweeping
Asia," said Su.
</P>
<P>
The facility is currently undergoing the first large-scale
renovation project since its establishment. The Great Hall and
Tian'anmen Square will offer visitors a new face in advance of
next year's ceremonies to mark China's 50th anniversary.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A noted Chinese economist
said today that China's refort and opening efforts are entering a
new and more rational stage following two decades of effort.
</P>
<P>
Jin Bei, deputy director of the Institute of Industry and
Economy under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), made the
remark during a forum on China's reform over the past 20
years. The event was jointly sponsored by the CAS and the Factory
Directors and Managers News.
</P>
<P>
"The concept that 'poverty gives rise to a desire for change'
has served as the basis enabling China's reform effort to gain
momentum over the past two decades," said Jin, adding that "the
great changes in all aspects are obvious".
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Chinese citizens exhibited greater respect
than foreigners for the country's reforms in the late 1970 and
early 1980s, but added that the opposite is true today.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that China's reform efforts are entering a new and more
rational period," said Jin.
</P>
<P>
Fang Sheng, a professor at People's University of China, said
the achievements China has scored in its reform and opening drive
will require further efforts to emancipate the mind.

Song Yangyan, a professor with the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
presented an address on state-owned enterprises and cited the need
for a good grasp of Maxist theory. Introducing the shareholding
system will perhaps will be the "great challenge" to the
restructuring of state-owned enterprises, said Song.
</P>
<P>
Jin said it is only natural that a number of state-owned
enterprises have faced difficult situations resulting from
increasingly fierce competition. The increasing number of
redundancies has been the direct result of the former planned
economy, said Jin, adding: "we must pay a price to reform
state-owned enterprises."
</P>
<P>
Chen Dongsheng, deputy director of the Chinese Society for
Regional Economics, said the new regional economic structure
formed during the reform and opening drive has promoted the
further development of the economy and enhanced
the nation's capacity to avoid and overcome risk.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that 20 of the nation's provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities enjoy the fastest economic
growth rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 economists and scholars attending the
meeting reviewed the monumental achievements scored in reform and
opening over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
They discussed wide-ranging issues related to the reform
process, including the reform of state-owned enterprises,
financial restructuring, rural industrialization and providing
reemployment to laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Economists expressed their belief the coming age of a
knowledge-based economy and perfection of the nation's socialist
market economy will offer both opportunities and challenges.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers Agree on Draft Documents for Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN foreign and economic
ministers ended their one-day joint meeting here Sunday afternoon
after agreeing on three draft documents to be submitted for
consideration and approval to the Sixth ASEAN Summit scheduled for
later this month.
</P>
<P>
The ministers from the nine members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed on the drafts of the Hanoi
Declaration, the Hanoi Plan of Action and the report on the
implementation of the decisions made by the Fifth ASEAN Summit in
1995, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing after the meeting, Cam said the
minister had adopted the three major documents and achieved "a
very high degree of uniformity."
</P>
<P>
The spirit of those documents "stand as a strong message sent
by the ASEAN as a whole from Hanoi to the world outside," he
declared. It indicates "the strong determination of ASEAN to
promote unity and cooperation in order to quickly put behind the
economic difficulties caused by the current economic and financial
crisis and hasten its economic recovery, strengthen peace and
stability and develop further the efforts in order to achieve
sustainable and equitable development in the region."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the documents focus on three areas: strengthening
and promoting of amity and solidarity within the ASEAN; measures
to promote further economic integration and overcome the current
economic crisis and to enhance functional cooperation; and
measures to increase the ASEAN's role and standing in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese foreign minister stressed that the documents
indicate the ASEAN determination to further develop the ASEAN
tradition of unity in diversity and address all outstanding issues
in "a very ASEAN way," which means consensus through consultation,
and in conformity with international law and practice.
</P>
<P>
They also call for dialogue among ASEAN members and non-ASEAN
members in order to strengthen unity and amity, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Cam said the documents will be made public after they have been
approved by the heads of state and government from the nine member
countries -- Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- at a summit to be
held on December 15 and 16.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Wye peace accord is a
good one and both Israel and Palestine must fulfill their
commitments to implement it, said U.S. President Bill Clinton
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference after his talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton said some progress
has been made so far in implementing the Wye agreement, but
the peace process needs both sides to do more.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side has began its troops withdrawal from the West
Bank, reached an agreement on opening the Gaza airport with the
Palestinians and started the difficult process of releasing
Palestinian prisoners. These were the progress made by the Israeli
side, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNC) has also taken some
important steps within their commitments to implement the
agreement, such as deepening its security cooperation with Israel,
starting confiscation of illegal weapons, dealing with incitement
and taking concrete steps to ratify the PLO charter, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he urged the PNA to do more in such field as preventing
the street demonstrations against Israel which the United States
regarded as important too.
</P>
<P>
On the final-status talks, Clinton said many issues remain
unsolved under the Oslo Accord and all those issues can be solved
through negotiations, urging both sides to regain more momentum
to speed up the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
But at the moment, it is important for both sides to
implement the Wye peace agreement, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the threats of weapons of mass destruction in
this region, he said the United States has security commitment for
Israel and will support it in developing the Arrow missile system.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions about his impeachment at home, Clinton
said he has no intention to resign despite the impeachment
process is going on.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's talks between the two leaders lasted for three hours
and Clinton said he and Netanyahu mainly focused their attention
on how to moving the peace process ahead.

WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The House Judiciary Committee approved a fourth and final
article of impeachment Saturday alleging that President Bill
Clinton abused his power by lying to Congress, and Republican
leaders immediately blocked a Democratic censure alternative from
being introduced when the full House takes up the articles this
week.
</P>
<P>
-- With Washington's impeachment storm now an ocean away,
President Bill clinton landed in Israel late on Saturday and was
immediately confronted with a bracing reminder that the political
weather here is scarcely more hospitable than what he left at home.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Representative Robert livingston, the speaker-designated,
vowed Saturday night to block any effort by the House to censure
President Bill Clinton rather than impeach him, and White House
allies promised to take the fight to the American public.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton's plan to visit Gaza on Monday during
a trip to the Middle East has raised hopes and increased a feeling
of legitimacy for Palestinians as they continue their struggle to
attain statehood. But many of those involved in building the
Palestinian state remain frustrated over Yasser Arafat's viselike
grip on power.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu Rongji Reviews 1998 Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved great
success in overcoming the negative impact of the Asian financial
crisis, combating devastating summer flooding and scoring steady
economic growth during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji made the remarks today at an
economic forum held in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
China has maintained stable exchange rates, improved the living
standards of its citizens and maintained social stability,
said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The achievements provide ample proof that the timely policies
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
and the State Council adopted to increase investments, pursue an active
fiscal policy, control the inflation rate, increase exports and
absorb foreign investment were absolutely correct, according to
the premier.
</P>
<P>
China will face arduous tasks related to reform, development
and stability during 1999, said Zhu, adding that people throughout
the nation implement tasks outlined during the central economic
work conference, and exhibit a united pioneering spirit to score
new achievements to mark the 50th anniversary of the nation's
founding.

<HEADLINE> Miao Bo Has Potential to Play WNBA: Scout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Shooting guard Miao Bo may
become the second Chinese women basketball to play in the WNBA
league next year, said Steve Aminoff, an Amercian scout who is
trying to find players in the Asian Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Steve, an Australia based free scout, said he would like to
bring the Chinese shooting guard to the WNBA free agents camper on
next April.
</P>
<P>
"I think Miao Bo is a special player because most Asian players
are very successful in their own team systems, but Miao Bo could
play on herself and that would make her feel comfortable to play
in a new team." Aminoff told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"She wishes to play and have the good vision. She runs the
floor with very good athletics abilities. She is always in the
game and makes things happen." Aminoff added.
</P>
<P>
But Aminoff said he still have two problems to bring Miao Bo to
the WNBA campers for her try-out. First Miao Bo needs a sponsor
for all the travlling and accomodations and secondly, Miao Bo does
not speak English and that may have problem in communicate with
her American coach and teammate.
</P>
<P>
China's 2.04-meter tall center Zheng Haixia is the first
Chinese cager to compete in the WNBA. The Los Angeles Sparkers
center was a basic player signed by the league and she has an
team-hired interprator for her matches and trainning.
</P>
<P>
"Miao Bo will be different from Zheng," Aminoff said. "Miao
will be a free agent so she has to pay all the money for her
try-out and trips. Maybe the Chinese team and I could find some
sponsors for her. If we could find five sponsors, each offers
2,000, that will be quite enough."
</P>
<P>
Miao Bo, 24, now playing for China's first division team
Shandong, made the national team two years ago. She averages 18
points and 6 assists in China's first division league WCBA.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Expanded Enterprise reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned
enterprises are expected to generate profits of 40 billion yuan
during 1998, according to Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo.
</P>
<P>
The industrial value-added for related enterprises is expected
to grow by nine percent and the sector continues to achieve
improved efficiency on a monthly basis, according to Wu's remarks
during a national economic and foreign trade conference held today.
</P>
<P>
He urged the state-owned sector to expand enterprise reform and
fulfill the arduous tasks set by the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council in order to
extricate enterprises from their current difficult situations
within three years.
</P>
<P>
The key to achieving related tasks is to eliminate losses and
increase profits. Loss-making enterprises must reduce losses, and
efficient firms must increase surpluses, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier called on all localities to eliminate
redundant production and close small coal, glass and cement firms,
as well as refineries and thermal power plants operating with
obsolete equipment which waste resources and create heavy
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The industrial structure must be optimized, said Wu, adding
that enterprises should stress technological upgrades to improve
quality and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Wu described overstaffing as a key reason for economic losses
facing enterprises. Effective measures must be adopted to reduce
the number of surplus laborers, and courses must be offered to
retrain laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Correct guidance is needed in the effort to reform small
state-owned enterprises. Selling small firms represents only one
factor needed to enliven them, and related ventures engaged in
exports and high-tech production should be encouraged to grow,
according to Wu.

</P>
<P>
In his statement, Netanyahu said for Israel, the Wye peace
accord is not a easy one, but the Israeli side has already
fulfilled its commitment in implementing the first part of the
accord such as troop pullout from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has so far not met with Israeli
demands and still insisted in declaring an independent Palestinian
state next May, carrying out incitement against Israel and asking
Israel to release those Palestinian prisoners with Israeli blood
on their hands.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side must take collective commitments to stop
such activities, otherwise Israel will not cede more territories
to them in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that the Palestinian National Council must
vote on the ratification of the clauses of the PLO charter
calling for Israel's destructions, not reaffirmation.
</P>
<P>
"If the Palestinian complies, the Israeli side will do its
part," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived Israel Saturday midnight for a three-day
visit to Israel and Palestinian territories, is scheduled to
address an Israeli youth gathering later Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan rallied strongly from a
7-point first half deficit to beat China 85-77 to top Group B of
women's basketball competition in the Asian Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Japan will take on Group A second placer Chinese Taipei while
China to meet defending champion South Korea in the semi-finals on
December 16.
</P>
<P>
Okazato Kumiko scored a game-high 20 points including 4
three-pointers, which lifted Japan from 10 points behind and led
all the rest 15 minutes for their second consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
Kumiko's three 3-pointers led a 20-2 run to stun their taller
but slower Chinese rivals with just five minutes into the second
half and the Japanese team never trailed behind after that.
</P>
<P>
Noriko Hamaguchi scored 18 and Taeko Oyama added 16 for the
Japanese team who were 8 of 15 from the three-point lines.
</P>
<P>
China had 15 from center Ma Chengqing in the first half where
they led all the way to build up a comfortable seven-point lead
but the 1.95 meters center, the tallest in the game, had only 3
points in the second half while China struggled with their
shooting percentage.
</P>
<P>
Miao Lijie sparked a later rally for China by scoring six of
China's last 9 points to narrow the gap at 81-77. But that was too
late as Japan used a free throw and a fastbreak layup to seal its
victory by 8 points.
</P>
<P>
In a later game between defending champion South Korea and host
Thailand, the four-time Asian Games gold medal winner won the
lopedside game with their backups in 94-51. Enditme

<HEADLINE> Nagano Mayor Denies Allegations of Bribe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of the Japanese city
of Nagano, site of the 1998 Winter Olympics, denied allegations
of buying and selling to win the right for hosting the Games.
</P>
<P>
Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada was responding to allegations by
Marc Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, that
his city officals bribed members of the IOC for staging right.
</P>
<P>
"I have never heard of such a thing," Tsukada was quoted by
the Associated Press as saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Nagano is concerned, we haven't done anything
wrong. We were selected as host of the Olympics through our
efforts. We can't believe that Mr. Hodler has made such a
statement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsukada was vice chairman of the Japanese committee to invite
the Olympics to Nagano.
</P>
<P>
Nagano has been criticized for spending a large amount of
money to win the games.
</P>
<P>
Sports Nippon, a leading Japanese sports newspaper, said more
than 2 billion yen (17 million U.S. dollars) of the money Nagano
spent to bring the games there has not been accounted for.
</P>
<P>
Nagano became the first Asian city to host the Winter Games
since Sapporo, Japan played host to the 1972 games.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight IOC members took part in a secret vote in 1991 to
decide who would host the 1998 games. Nagano led in each of the
five rounds, beating out Salt Lake city 46 votes to 42 in the
final ballot.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Earmarks 134 Million Bath to Alleviate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The labor Ministry has
allocated 134 million baht (3.7 million U.S. dollars) to deal with
anticipated severe water shortage in 35 provinces nationwide, Thai
News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Labor Minister Sompong Amornvivat as saying
that the ministry would use the 134-million-baht budget to run a
project to help 83,682 farmers in irrigated areas of 35
drought-hit provinces from December 28 this year until May 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said 17.98 million baht (480,000 dollars) would come from
the ministry's annual budget, 63.42 million (1.76 million dollars)
from a World Bank loan and the rest from a central emergency
budget.
</P>
<P>
The targeted areas are 12 provinces in the North, 11 in the
Northeast, six in the Central Region, two in the East, three in
the West and one in the South.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the Public Welfare Department will
cooperate with the Office of Accelerated Rural Development to
create community development projects in these areas, and to hire
jobless local people to work for a wage not exceeding 100 baht
(2.8 dollars) per day and for no more than 30 days.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also provide occupational training and a
50-baht (1.4 dollars) special allowance for the affected, while
the Employment Department will run a project to find jobs for
rural people.
</P>
<P>
Sompong said an ad hoc drought relief committee chaired by the
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai would work out measures to help
114,883 families in 44 provinces.

BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- China kept its winning streak
and marched into the finals in both men's and women's volleyball
matches in the 13th Asian Games as its two teams defeated their
respective rivals in Sunday's semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Chinese men's team proved that they are far more powerful than
Chinese Taipei as they smashed their opponents in straight sets
with two 15-11s and one 15-4.
</P>
<P>
The match was quite boring as the two teams were not in their
highest mood.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Wang Jiawei said his team, this year's new Asian
champions, were too eager to taste the victory.
</P>
<P>
"The great pressure makes them stiff in their moves," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he is confident that the gold will belong to China, which
will meet South Korea, the winner of another semi-final match
against Japan, in Tuesday's final.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Chinese Taipei will fight for the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
In the women's match, China trounced hosts Thailand 3-0 and
allowed only eight points in three sets.
</P>
<P>
Another match saw South Korea beat Japan 16-14, 15-6 and 15-7.
</P>
<P>
China will make its final confrontation with South Korea in
Tuesday's final. China overpowered South Korea 3-1 in Friday's
preliminary round match.

PARIS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Hermann Maier, winner
of double Olympic champion, won Sunday's men's World Cup super-g
in Val D'Isere, France, and returned to the top of the podium for
the first time since the season began.
</P>
<P>
"The Herminator" displayed the form which led him to the World
Cup overall, super-G and giant slalom titles last season.
</P>
<P>
He was shutout in North America then finishing a dismal 36th
in Saturday's downhill,
</P>
<P>
Sunday's victory was convincing, the 26-year-old finishing
over a second faster than his closest rival, teammate Stephan
Eberharter.
</P>
<P>
Maier charged down the wet, foggy Oreiller Killy course in 1
minute, 18.73 seconds, a 1.18 seconds faster than runnerup
Eberharter, who clocked 1:19.91.
</P>
<P>
The winner of Saturday's downhill, Lasse Kjus of Norway
returned to the podium for the second time this weekend,

<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Yu Guohui claimed the first
track and field gold medal for China from the men's 20 kilometers
walking event on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The walking race opened the competition of track and field,
which will offer a total of 45 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
Japan and China split the five gold medals at stake on Sunday
with Japan winning three from men's hammer throw, women's high
jump and 10,000 meters while China taking men's 20km walking and
women's discus.
</P>
<P>
Yu, 22, who has a personal best time of 1:22:50, clocked
1:20:25, beating the Asian Games record of 1:21:15 set by his
compatriot Chen Shaoguo in the Hiroshima Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Valeriy Borissov of Kazakhstan, bronze medalist at the Asian
Championships last July in Japan, finished second with 1:23:52.
</P>
<P>
Li Zewen, who won the event in the Asian Championships, came in
third with 1:24:41, a far cry from his personal best of 1:18.32
set in the World Cup walking competiton in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"It's no surprise for me to win the race," Yu said. "If the
wind was slower, I could have run a better time."
</P>
<P>
Japanese Koji Murofushi defeated former Olympic and twice world
champion Andrey Abuvaliev of Uzbekistan to win the hammer throw
gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Murofushi, 24, son of former Asian hammer throw legend
Skigenobu, heaved a winning toss of 78.57 meters in his third
attempt.
</P>
<P>
Abuvaliev, Barcelona Olympic champion and world champion in
1993 and 1995, finished second in 77.14 meters.
</P>
<P>
Murofushi jumped to fame early this year when he broke the
national record of Skigenobu, a fifth-time Asian Games champion
since 1970.
</P>
<P>
"My father began to teach me hammer throw when I was 15, " he
said. "He is still my coach today."
</P>
<P>
Murofushi said it was hard to repeat his father's feat.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot imagine that. It's very tough. He retired at 41. I
think I cannot continue doing that at that age," Murofushi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was a big surprise to win the gold medal here
because Abuduvliev is a great man.
</P>
<P>
"Abuduvaliev is a great teacher of mine," he said. "I never
expected I can win here."
</P>
<P>
He said Abuduvaliev lost just because he failed to take the
Asian Games seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
"I know he is not in good shape since he missed serveral
times," he said. "I think he has not prepared well for it."
</P>
<P>
He said that he will continue his hard training to achieve good
results in next year's World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"The results here today showed that what I have done was right.
I will continue to do that, to do very well in everyday training
for the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ota Yoko won the women's high jump by clearing 1.88
meters against a headwind at the Asian Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jin Ling of China, who also jumped over 1.88 meters, had to
settle for the silver as she magnaged it in her third attempt but
Oto in the first.
</P>
<P>
Neither of them could clear the bar when it rose to 1.92
meters.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second win for me in big international
competitions, " Ota said. "I just took it as an ordinary match so
there is not a lot of pressure."
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel very happy with the win, and not very unhappy
with it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ota, who has a personal best of 1.93 meters, won the high jump
champion in the 1993 Asian Athletics Championships when she was
only a high school second grader.
</P>
<P>
"The wind is so heavy that I was nearly blown away," she joked.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Taipei, Japan Split Golf Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Taipei and Japan split
the four titles in the team and individual golf competitions which
came to an end in the 13th Asian Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lu Hsiao-Chuan of Chinese Taipei triumphed in the women's
individual event with 288 hits, spearheading her teammates for
the team title with 575 strokes, beating South Korea to second
with a comfortable 10-stroke margin.
</P>
<P>
The men's individual title went to Tomohiro Kondo of Japan who
had under-four par, one stroke less than Gerald Rosales of the
Philippines, as his country also ranked first in the men's team
event with 862 hits, four less than the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The women athletes of Chinese Taipei enjoyed their supremacy by
sweeping the top three places, but the bronze medal was still
awarded to fourth-placed South Korea's Jang Jeong according to the
Games' rules which allow a maximum of two medals to go to every
participating team.
</P>
<P>
Lu Hsiao-Chuan gained her one-shot victory with a birdie on the
par-4 16th and a last-hole bogey by teammate Wei Jun-Jye, who shot
73-289 for the silver.
</P>
<P>
Teammate Lin Yu-Ping, who bogeyed the par-5 17th but still
ranked third, missed an individual medal only due to the Games'
rules as South Korean Jang Jeong had one more shot in the event.
</P>
<P>
However, she still can cherish the team gold, which Chinese
Taipei won with 575 against 585 for South Korea and 596 for the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Kondo's victory, with a slim margin of one shot, came after
second-placed Rosales bogeyed the par-5 14th hole while he himself
birdied the par-3 15th. Japan's Hidemasa Hoshino took the bronze
with 286 strokes, one shot behind Rosales, after a final-round 70.
</P>
<P>
Japan won the men's team gold with 862 against 866 for the
Philippines and 872 for Chinese Taipei.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth Lower Than Expected in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Overall economic performance
in Zimbabwe this year will not be as good as it was originally
focused, a senior banker said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
David Zamchiya, Chairman of Barclays Bank of Zimbabwe,
predicted that zero growth of gross domestic product (GDP) was
now expected as compared with three percent growth achieved last
year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the bank's draw of the millionaire maker
competition in Harare, the chairman said the Zimbabwean Dollar
had been affected by poor export performance, weak commodity
prices and rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
He said the currency was now undervalued by more than 50
percent against the U.S. Dollar and over 54 percent against the
British Pound.
</P>
<P>
"The effects of the currency depreciation have been
widespread," he said. "Production costs of many companies have
soared while the prices of food and other basic commodities have
sky-rocketed, leading to the recent unfortunate incidences of
social unrest," he added.
</P>
<P>
Inflaion in Zimbabwe was pegged at almost 40 percent while
inimum bank lending rates had picked at over 40.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Quit Order to Be Given to Oil Companies in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- All the oil companies operating
in the Ijaw areas of oil-producing Niger Delta will receive a
quit notice from the host communities next Monday, the Sunday
Punch reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that a resolution adopted Saturday at the end
of a three-day meeting held in Kiama of Bayelsa State indicated
that the oil companies would face the wrath of the local people
if they do not comply at the expiration of a two-week ultimatum
issued to them.
</P>
<P>
The 24 Ijaw nationalist groups attending the meeting are
expected to hand over the resolution Monday to oil companies in
the Niger Delta region with a strict instruction that all of them
should abide by the resolution.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, an Ijaw youth council was set up at
the meeting to practically implement the quit notice.
</P>
<P>
The resolution affected multi-national oil companies which
include Shell Petroleum Development Company, Chevron, Mobil and
Taxaco.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the 24 groups, representatives of 500 Ijaw
communities from 26 clans in Ijawland were also present at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted spokesman for the meeting, Patterson Ogon, as
saying that intensive campaign was mounted in the rural areas and
all creeks of Ijawland for massive support to ensure the success
of the ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that protesting youth from Ogulagha
Community of the Delta State invaded and shut down Shell's
Forcados oil export terminal over a compensation dispute with Mobil
Producing Nigeria Unlimited. Mobil reportedly promised to pay
Ogulagha Community a compensation of about 750,000 U.S. Dollars
for its oil spill last year, but the community rejected it as it
considered as "inadequate".

<P>
The total transaction volume fell 25 percent to end the week at

<HEADLINE> LeMay Doan Wins Three of Four Golds at World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Catriona LeMay Doan, Canadian
Olympic gold medalist, failed to sweep the women's sprints Sunday
for a minor mishap in the final race and had to pocket three of
four possible gold medals at the Nagano World Cup speedskating
championship.
</P>
<P>
Reports said after winning the 500 in the second round of the
two-day event, LeMay doan had to slow down and missed a few
strokes, letting Japan's Eriko Sanmiya switch into the outside
lane in the women's 1,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Sanmiya admitted she was at fault after race.
</P>
<P>
"It happened either because I was too slow as the starter on
the inside lane or Catriona was too fast and almost caught me up
at the switching point," Sanmiya was quoted as saying. "I feel
very sorry that it might have cost her a medal," she added.
</P>
<P>
After the setback, LeMay Doan finished fifth in 1 minute,
18.88 seconds, 0.97 second off the pace. Sanmiya was 16th with an
unimpressive time of 1:19.94.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's 1,000 meters, the 27-year-old Canadian star
skated 1:18.07 for the gold and the Japanese skater 1:19.49 for
the silver. LeMay Doan also took the gold in the 500m on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tonny de Jong, a 5,000-meter specialist from the Netherlands,
set her personal best of 1:17.91 for the gold in her first ever
competition in a World Cup 1,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
But the Canadians won the team's fourth overall gold anyway.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Jeremy Wotherspoon took the men's 500 meters after
Olympic gold medalist and world record holder Hiroyasu Shimizu
fell while negotiating a corner.
</P>
<P>
Shimizu, winner of the event Saturday, had the day's fastest
lap time of 9.64 seconds for the first 100 meters before he fell
and slammed into the protective wall. Shimizu suffered minor
contusion on the elbow and the thigh, his staff said.
</P>
<P>
His race partner in the final twosome, Wotherspoon, sped alone
to victory in 35.85 seconds. The Canadian was the silver medalist
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Olympic silver medalist Jan Bos gave the Netherlands the day's
fourth gold with a victory in the men's 1,000 meters. He also won
the event on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day event was the first of five short-race World Cups
for the 1998-1999 season. Two rounds of 500- and 1,000-meter
competition were staged both for women and men.

JAKARTA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie said the Indonesian people must actively develop science
and technology as part of efforts to reduce the country's
dependence on foreign nations.
</P>
<P>
"As a developing nation, we could not fully depend on other
countries' inventions in technology and science," Habibie said
when opening a technology exhibition here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
To that end, the Indonesian nation needed to take various
steps. The development of science and technology would also reduce
the country's dependence on imported goods, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He further said the current prolonged economic crisis has
impeded the development of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"All of these are because we are very much dependent on
imported raw materials and technology. We must make efforts to
reduce this dependence so that we will be become self-reliant in
stages," he said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day exhibition is organized by the Agency for the
Assessment and Application of Technology and the Cooperatives
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is attended by 160 stands from various
government agencies, private and state-run companies. The

MACAO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Both passenger and cargo traffic
 at the Macao International Airport scored considerable increases
in November over the same month of last year, the latest
statistics from the airport show.
</P>
<P>
More than 181,000 passengers used the airport in November, up
by 24 percent over November of 1997. And the airport handled 6,600
tons of goods, an increase of 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the two figures dropped about 10 percent and 4.3
percent from the airport's passenger and cargo business in October

<HEADLINE> Yam Consumption Linked to High Fertility: Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A group of Nigerian
obstetricians have presented new evidence showing that yam
consumption is linked to high fertility and incidence of multiple
births, The Guardian reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by the Yale University School of Medicine
and the University of Benin shows that socio-economic and diet
remained significant factors in multiple births among the Yorubas
in southwest Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The study was carried out in Ile-Ife of Osun State inhabitied
principally by Yorubas, who have the highest recorded rate of
41.6 twin births per 1,000 deliveries in the world.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the group, Dr. K. Odunsi from the department of
Obstetrics and Gyanecology of Yale University School of Medicine
presented the study at the International Congress of the Society
of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria held recently in Benin
city, southwest Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Odunsi explained that there could be a substance in yam
similar to clomiphene cirate which is the drug used to stimulate
the ovary to produce more than one egg per cycle.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new evidence provided a platform for further
exmination of the role of yam in fertility and the research team
was further looking at the genetic aspect of the people of Yoruba
as regards to multiple births.
</P>
<P>
About 20 years ago, some obstetricians in Nigeria argued that
yam consumption could boost fertility but the argument was never
taken seriously.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Remains Major Killer of Macao Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Cancer has been a major killer
of Macao residents in recent years, claiming 1,662 lives from 1993
to 1997, the Macao Daily News reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cancer victims were 20 to 50 years of age, and few
passed 65 years old, the paper noted. The most deadly killer in
Macao is diseases in the circulation system.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Macao's population was
427,000 by the end of September this year.
</P>
<P>
Local medical experts have been expecting the government to
strengthen the end-of-life care for cancer patients. However, the
administrative program for 1999 of the Macao government neglected
rehabilitation treatment for cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
A government decree stipulates that cancer patients can enjoy
permanent free medical care, but this year many of them had their
medical cards lengthened for only one year or even three months,
the newspaper quoted one medical expert as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government absolutely should not save money from cancer
patients as it cuts expenditures, the expert added.

<HEADLINE> China Sweeps Women's Weightlifting Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese strongwomen had a
clean sweep of the seven gold medals at stake in Bangkok, a feat
attained for the third consecutive time in the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 world records were broken 17 times, all by the
Chinese strongwomen, with a lone exception in the 58-kg class
wherein Ri Song-Hui of DPR Korea jerked up 125 kgs to surpass the
fresh mark of 123.5 kgs set up by Chinese Chen Yanqing five
minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are very glad to award China its first gold medal in
Bangkok as our other athletes had their lukewarm shows in the
first day finals, a fact repeated third time since the 1990 Asian
Games," said Han Guihua, head coach of the Chinese Weightlifting
Association.
</P>
<P>
"Though we failed to claim all the records with a slight sense
of pity, but it was in the favor of the development of the sport,"
Han said, referring DPR Korean Ri's record in the 58-kg class.
</P>
<P>
China's monopoly in the women's weightlifting was broken in the
Asian Games, "and we recognized it as a healthy sign for the
development of the sport," said Hang.
</P>
<P>
Women's weightlifting will be more interesting with surprises
in the future after the participation of strongwomen from Myanmar,
India, Thailand and with DPR Korea in particular, the Chinese
coach said.
</P>
<P>
Tamas Agean of Hungary, general secretary of the International
Weightlifting Federation, extended his warm congradulations to the
Chinese athletes, saying "China has made great contribution to the
development of the women's weightlifting."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, super-heavyweight Ding Meiyuan cracked two world
records to complete China's sensational sweep of the women's
weightlifting titles, which was started by Liu Xiuhua in the 48-kg
category last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ding set two new world marks by snatching 120 kgs and lifting a
total of 270 kgs to emerge easy winner of the over-75kg category,
giving China all the seven women's gold medals on offer.
</P>
<P>
"The Bangkok Asian Games has showed that we are the best," said
the baby-faced Ding who surpassed the jerk mark of 118.5kgs and
the total record of 267.5 kgs, all set by her teammates.
</P>
<P>
A total of seven Chinese strongwomen have inked their names in
the book of world records, namely all the Chinese entries in the
sport.
</P>
<P>
These world records holders are surely to be accounted for in
the future competitions with Liu Xiuhua in the 48kg, Yan Xia in
53kg, Shen Yanqing in 58kg, Lei Li in 63kg, Sun Tianni in 69kg,
Wei Xiangying in 75kg and Ding Meiyuan in the over 75kg category.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Koji Ito broke the
Asian record by clocking 10.00 seconds in the semi-finals of men's
100 meters here at the Asian Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Koji's time was eight hundredths of a second faster than the
previous Asian record of 10.08 set by his comptriot Nobuharu
Asahara on July 13, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old also levelled the time of 10.08 in the national
championships last October.
</P>
<P>
Koji, who ran a wind-assisted time of 10.03 seconds in the
quarter-finals, was timed at the record-breaking time with a wind
of 1.9 meters behind his back. A wind inside two meters per
second is allowable for a record.
</P>
<P>
"I had expected that I can run about 10.10," he said. "The wind
was really helpful."
</P>
<P>
Koji, who will run the 200m and two relays tommorrow, said
winning the gold medals will be the priority for him.
</P>
<P>
"Today I'm very relaxed, I think I could run a good time. But
the most important thing for tomorrow is to win the race." he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he said there is also a possiblity to run inside 10 seconds
if he remained relaxed.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I could run a better time if I felt easy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese top sprinter Zhou Wei, 24, who was expected to beat
Koji to become the fastest human in Asia, admitted that it was
unlikely to win.
</P>
<P>
"His time was unblievable," he said. "There's no match between
us."

MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada will leave for Vietnam Monday to relay the Philippines'
call for "innovative approaches" to lift Southeast Asia from the
economic doldrums when he attends a summit of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
After the summit on December 15-16, Estrada will stay in
Vietnam for a two-day state visit, and then will proceed to
Bangkok, Thailand, for a three-day state visit, said Presidential
Spokesman Jerry Barican.
</P>
<P>
He said the president wants ASEAN to implement social, economic
and political measures to arrest the impact of the economic crisis
that has battered Asia since mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Such measures must also project ASEAN as a body with "able
mechanisms" to respond to pressing issues in the region, he quoted
Estrada as saying.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN should look beyond the crisis and adopt innovative
approaches, which will enhance its capabilities in dealing with
current and emerging regional problems," Barican added.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, he said, President Estrada may also drop by the
site of the ongoing 13th Asian Games to root for the Philippine
athletes competing there.

They also urged the citizens to use public transportation
services instead of their private cars in order to reduce air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The experts said earlier that due to its natural and
geographical location, Tehran faces the phenomena of inversion
and the accumulation of various pollutants in the air for 240
days every year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports showed that some 4,000 people every year died
of respiratory problems caused, or exacerbated, by pollution while
some 2,000 people died of cancer incurred by health-damaging
substances in the air, such as lead.
</P>
<P>
Lying in an area of 600 square kilometers between the southern
slopes of the Alborz Mountain range and the northern fringes of
the central Iranian desert, Tehran has a resident population of 7
million and a floating population of 3 million.
</P>
<P>
The experts believed that one of the most important sources for
increasing pollution in Tehran is the emission from dilapidated
motorized vehicles and improper combustion of fuel in those
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that motorized vehicles annually release 1,280,000
tonnes of carbon monoxide, 17,500 tonnes of sulfur dioxide, 21,000
tonnes of suspended particles, 105,000 tonnes of nitrogen oxides,
over 2,000 tonnes of lead and 115,000 tonnes of various kinds of
hydrocarbons into Tehran's air.
</P>
<P>
The serious air pollution in the capital has caused great
concern from the Iranian government and the Tehran municipality
has started a project of transforming fuel of buses and taxis to
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
However, with a population boom due to the immigration from
countryside and lack of budget, it is difficult for the local
government to take effective measures to control air pollution in
the capital.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's GDP Projected to Grow 2 Percent Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's gross domestic
product (GDP) is expected to grow by two percent in 1999, the
Ministry of Finance and Economy said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two-percent annual GDP growth is much more optimistic than
the negative one-percent growth forecast by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), said a ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The economy will grow some one percent in the first half of
next year and four percent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
"The recovery of the economy is expected to accelerate from the
second quarter in earnest to result in positive growth to a
considerable extent," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We think it will be able to attain a one-percent growth for
the whole of 1999, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry predicts that foreign direct
investments will amount to 15 billion U.S. dollars next year while
the current account surplus is to reach 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to hover around three percent on the back
of wage reductions and the stabilization of international raw
material prices. The inflation rate is also much lower than the
five percent agreed upon with the IMF in September this year.
</P>
<P>
To boost the weakened economy, apart from continued reform of
the financial and industrial sectors by improving their lending
practices and credit risk evaluations, the government will adopt a
strong stimulus package, including the stabilization of interest
rates at a lower level and the advancement of most fiscal spending
in the first half of 1999, the ministry added.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Beats Japan in Asiad Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea entered the final
of the Asian Games men's volleyball competition when they beat an
injury-hit Japan 3-1 here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It took the Koreans 110 minutes to win 15-11, 13-15, 15-3,
15-6. The south Koreans will meet China in the final. The Chinese
team beat Chinese Taipei 15-11, 15-4, 15-11 in the other
semi-final.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, with three key players missing including captain
Yuichi Nakagaiuchi because of injury, were never able to match the
South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
For South Korea it was their second straight win over their
arch-rivals. They beat them last month in the World championships.
</P>
<P>
"We have fully analysed the Japanese side after beating them in
the world championships," said South Korean coach Jun Taik-Jin.
"Today they seemed tired and lacking their normal fighting
spirit."
</P>
<P>
Japanese coach Futoshi Teramawari blamed the loss on injuries.
"We had registered only 11 players out of a maxium of 12 because
of injuries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The defeat was a major blow for Japan which has been the
dominant force in Asian volleyball. They won both men's and
women's volleyball at the Asian Games for five straight times
between 1958 and 1974. The Japanese men's worst Asiad result was
fourth place at the 1986 Seoul Games.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Calls Day-Long Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- the Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), the major opposition in the parliament, Sunday enforced a
dawn-to-dusk hartal (general strike) throughout the country to
protest what it said "massive rigging" in the Pabna-2
parliamentary by-election.
</P>
<P>
Other components of the BNP-led 7-party alliance including
Jatiya Party (Z-M) and Jamaat-e-Islami Party lent support to the
hartal program.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) candidate won the
by-election, which was held last Thursday in Pabna, about 200
kilometers northwest of here, with a comfortable margin, after the
death of a member of parliament from the BAL.
</P>
<P>
However, the BNP rejected the results of the by-election and
demanded re-polling alleging "massive rigging" by the BAL
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Ambulance, hospitals medicine shops and transports of the
press, law enforcing agencies and other utility services remained
outside the purview of the hartal program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the authorities took some special measures,
including deployment of para-military Bangladeshi Rifles and
additional police force to maintain law and order during the
hartal hours.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, there are no reports about clashes between the BAL
and BNP supporters.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Index Down in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence in
Kuwait continued to fall in November as people were still
pessimistic about the country's economic situation, according to
an opinion poll published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by Stat Ipsos, a local marketing
research company, showed that the consumer confidence index
stood at 52 points in November on a zero-to-100-point scale,
down 7 points from October.
</P>
<P>
The index was also 21 points less than that in June
when the first poll was done.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which is conducted among 1,000 randomly selected
persons, is aimed to reflect people's opinion on Kuwait's current
and future economic situation, the security situation,
expectations about future purchasing power and the level of
satisfaction with personal income.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, people were also dissatisfied with
their current personal income, with the index dropping 6 points
to 61 points compared to October.
</P>
<P>
The index showing expectations about purchasing power also saw
a decline of 7 points to 48 points in November, as compared with
67 points in June.
</P>
<P>
However, people showed confidence in the security situation in
Kuwait with the security index only losing 3 points to reach 72
points, despite a regional tension resulted from Iraq's
suspension of all forms of cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the poll in November, Stat Ipsos said the
continuing decline on Kuwait Stock Exchange, failed OPEC meeting
to shore up oil prices contributed to undermining consumers'
confidence.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Law Organ Opens File on President's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Criminal
Investigations Department (CID) has opened a file on President
Yoweri Museveni's brother Salim Saleh who had bought Uganda
Commercial Bank (UCB) fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
Some ministers named in the privatization probe report
released by a parliamentary select committee were also under
investigation, Sunday Vision newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a senior CID official as saying Saturday
that CID is to investigate whether they contravened the law and
how the money would have changed hands in the sale of UCB, the
country's biggest commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, also former senior presidential advisor on defense and
security, resigned from the post last Sunday following his
admittance that he secretly bought UCB by using a Malaysian
company as front.
</P>
<P>
The Saleh scandal, coupled with reports of four ministers'
improper involvement in the sale of other parastatals, heavily
tainted the government's image and triggered off a loud public
outcry for the president to take immediate and effective measures
against rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni forgave his brother when Saleh confessed
his conspiracy to get big commissions in a military helicopter
deal. The president explained that Saleh, despite his flaws, was
still a very useful cadre to the country.
</P>
<P>
As to the underhand UCB deal, Museveni told a press conference
last Friday that Saleh disobeyed his advice not to buy UCB and
pledged that he was ready to put any corrupt official into jail
if there is enough evidence.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Administration Target of Recent Killings, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The government of President
Mohammad Khatami was the target of recent political killings in
Iran, Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever their ill-omened motive and intention may be,
the short-term target (of the perpetrators) is Mr. Khatami's
administration and in the long run they aim at the entire system
of the Islamic Republic", Tajzadeh said.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a group of Tehran University students, the
deputy minister said that some clues of the recent killings of
dissidents and pro-freedom writers were found and a number of
people have been arrested in connection with the killings.
</P>
<P>
A special committee has been set up at the National
Security Council to investigate the recent political killings in
the country, Tajzadeh said.
</P>
<P>
The National Security Council convened Saturday night under
the presidency of President Khatami to review the recent
political killings in the country, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the past one month, a veteran opposition leader Darius
Forouhar and his wife were stabbed to death at home in Tehran and
several dissident writers were found killed near the capital.
</P>
<P>
Another famous writer Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh was reported
missing on Wednesday, the day when the body of dissident poet
Mohammad Mokhtari was found after he had disappeared in Tehran
last week.
</P>
<P>
Both the two were among the six prominent writers and
secular intellectuals questioned in October by an Islamic
revolutionary court for their activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Persian-language daily Iran reported on Sunday
that Pouyandeh's body has been found in the Tehran suburb.The
writer was choked and the killers did not take any of his
belongings away but his identity card.
</P>
<P>
Tajzadeh said that no doubt some people are conspiring to
make the situation bitter for the people at a time that the
system is moving toward political development.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent killings, a group of 50 writers
published an open letter to President Khatami, urging his
administration to immediately identify and bring the murderers to
justice, the English-language Iran Daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We, authors, wish to call on the chief executive who is
in charge of ensuring the safety of citizens, to put an end
to this offending situation by any means," the letter said,
calling for legal permission to establish the Iran Authors
Association which has been banned months ago.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Association of University Students and the
Educated recently also issued a statement, warning President
Khatami that the opponents have started to resort to terrorist
assassinations against his supporters.
</P>
<P>
The recent killings and missing of writers indicated that
the enemies of freedom have taken arms and martyred one by
one supporters of the civil society, freedom and people's rule,
it said.

<HEADLINE> Active Fiscal Policy Helps Push Up China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The series of fiscal measures
adopted this year by the Chinese government has made great
contributions to national economic growth, Xiang Huaicheng,
Minister of Finance, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a national fiscal conference opened here
today, Xiang said that in 1998 the central government issued an
additional 100 billion yuan in financial bonds to state-owned
commercial banks to raise funds for infrastructure construction,
which has not only effectively stimulated domestic demand, but
also created favorable conditions for restructuring the economy.
</P>
<P>
Another major steps the central government has taken was the
issuing of 270 billion yuan in special financial bonds to
replenish the capital of the state-owned commercial banks,
enabling their capital adequacy to the eight percent standard
required by the "Basel Agreement" and China's commercial bank
law.
</P>
<P>
This move has also increased commercial banks' capability to
prevent financial risks and is beneficial to a coordinated
execution of fiscal policies and monetary policies, he added.
</P>
<P>
To support the export sector, the central government has raised
the export tax rebates for a number of industries, including
textile raw materials and products, textiles machinery, coal,
cement, rolled steel, ships and some light industrial products,
which has played a significant role in promoting export.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ministry of Finance has abolished 727 items of
illegal or irrational funds and levies together with some other
related departments, cutting enterprises' burden by over 37
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of these active fiscal policies has played
a critical role in successfully warding off the consequences of
the Asian financial crisis and ensure a steady economic growth
and smooth proceeding of various reforms," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Some bronze drums
traditionally used to call ethnic groups in China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region together to work for the same purpose have been
resounding all day recently to celebrate Guangxi's 40th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The 46 million people of the region haved vowed to the
Communist Party Central Committee that they will work hard to turn
Guangxi into a region of unity between all ethnic groups and
advancement in all fields, one where people live a good life. They
also said they will contribute to the revitalization of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Bronze drums are still used for wedding, sacrificial, ritual,
and funeral ceremonies by ethnic minority groups like the Zhuang,
Yao, Miao and Yi. People here also use the drum shape to decorate
their homes and large buildings.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yanyu, curator of the regional museum, said that the
bronze drum originated in southern China during the Spring and
Autumn Period (770-476 B.C.). Archaeologists have discovered more
than 2,000 bronze drums, more than 1,000 of which are in Guangxi.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis has
severely affected the Philippines' overseas labor market with many
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) losing their jobs, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency Sunday quoted Labor Secretary
Bienvenido Laguesma as saying that at least 10 destinations for
OFWs have been affected by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The 10 destinations are China's Hong Kong and Taiwan, Japan,
Brunei, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, Britain and
the United Arab Emirates, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said OFWs in Brunei, Malaysia, Hong Kong and South
Korea were hit hardest by the ongoing financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma has directed labor attaches and other Philippine
overseas labor offices to keep on monitoring conditions in their
posts and to help laid-off workers find new jobs, instead of
repatriating them outright.
</P>
<P>
At least 2,262 OFWs were reported to have lost their jobs in
Brunei as of August 1, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, about 4.5 million OFWs are
working in Asia, the Middle East and other regions in the world
and they have infused about 6 billion U.S. dollars annually to the
Philippine economy in the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Asian Shooting Official Sings Praise on Organizing Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

By sportswriter Cao Li
</P>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Asian Shooting Confederation
Secretary General Fung Lok Nam has sung high praises for the
organizing work of the Asian Games shooting competition here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The venue here is among the best in the world and even rarely
seen in Europe," said Fung. "The staff here is well trained,
warm-hearted and very efficient."
</P>
<P>
Fung, who himself had trained in the facility 30 years ago,
said the fact that renovation of the venue was completed amid the
financial crisis that hit the South East Asia reflected the
determination of Thai shooting authority to host the event
successfully.
</P>
<P>
The renovation cost 6 million U.S. dollars, according to Thai
officials.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean added Thailand has progressed greatly during
the competition, grabbing three golds.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand has prepared the event for a long time," said the
81-year-old Fung. "The Thai people also have great interests in
the shooting events."
</P>
<P>
He noted that people paid as much as 200 bahts, which can buy
two meals here, to watch a final.
</P>
<P>
"That is part of the reasons behind their success story," Fung
said.
</P>
<P>
Fung said only when more competitions are held in Asia could
the continent make a further development in the sport.
</P>
<P>
There was no World Cup events in Asia this year but in 1999
there would be bigger events as South Korea will host a World Cup
meet while Malaysia stage the Asian Championships.

JOHANNESBURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Prospects for South Africa's economic growth in 1999 have been
snuffed out by a return of emerging market jitters and bearish data
that could put off interest rate cuts until well into next year.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- What could be the world's second largest nuclear disaster is
quietly happening in South Africa. Two severe cases of radiation
poisoning have been identified by analysts at the National Accelerator
Center and more than 20 other people may have been exposed to a
potentially fatal dose of radiation.
</P>
<P>
City Press:
</P>
<P>
-- South Africa's first free-to-air television station, E.TV, was
in a copyright row with a United States television company three days
before its launch last month. The U.S. company demanded more than
seven million Rand (1.17 million U.S. dollars) for the use of its logo
and its "E" name.

"The entry formalities became much simplified at that time, but
passengers had to wait in long line for border check for as long
as three hours because of too many people," said He, who has been
working in the Luohu Customs for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jianni and her fellow passengers now take only more than
ten seconds for border check, although the number of those going
across the border reaches 130,000, or 30 times more than the
figure 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"In the past 20 years, people's baggages have also changed a
lot," said He Liuchun.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Hong Kong people often brought food and old
clothes to their relatives due to the insufficient supply in
inland areas in the early 1980s. They then began to take local
agricultural products back and brought electronic appliance,
watches and cameras to their inland relatives as they had adequate
food and clothing several years later.
</P>
<P>
As some people did not made declaration at the customs, the
customs officers conducted very strict examinations to prevent
smuggling and they even tore open travelers' shoes to see whether
there were watches hidden inside, said He. Watches are now main
commodities that Shenzhen exports to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
When the inland areas bade farewell to the insufficient supply
of various goods in the 1990s, Hong Kong people seldom brought
goods to the inland areas, and instead return with something less
expensive, and even vegetables and meats.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen and Hong Kong have maintained close economic ties and
over the past two decades, the Hong Kong investment in the inland
areas has topped 9 billion U.S. dollars, constituting two-thirds
of Shenzhen's total overseas investment, while Shenzhen exports
more than 80 percent of its products to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
China's central government implemented the "one country, two
systems" policy toward Hong Kong after its return on July 1,
1997. The function of the Luohu Customs remained unchanged, but
the number of people across the border increases by more than 10
percentage points each month.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the stream of people crossing the border, He
Liuchun, the woman customs official, said with deep feeling: "You
see, now the people are happy and relaxed and calm, and that's
perhaps something few prophets could predict 20 years ago."
</P>
<P>
Changes at the Luohu entry have illustrated the success of
China's reform and opening-up and the growth of the comprehensive
strength of the country, she added.

<HEADLINE> Demand Stimulus Measures to Revive Import Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- China's import sector is
expecting a strong boost from the government's demand-stimulation
measures launched early this year, despite its lackluster show in
the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Chinese import volume slid 0.7 percent to 110.3 billion US
dollars in the first 10 months of this year, compared to the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Weak domestic demand, which the government measures have not
yet had time to affect, is regarded as the main reason for the
lukewarm imports, according to today's Business Weekly (China
Daily).
</P>
<P>
Although some new incentives implemented by the Chinese
Government, such as tariff cuts and the tariff exemption policy
for the import of overseas-invested capital goods, have had an
effect, capital shortages in many state enterprises have largely
offset their impact.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the General Administration of Customs indicate
that overseas-invested companies imported 61.9 billion
U.S. dollars worth goods in the January-October period, up 2.7
percent from a year ago, while the import volume of state
enterprises fell five percent to 45.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the fundamental change in the supply-demand
relationship on the domestic market had also contributed to the
decline in imports.
</P>
<P>
China has entered a buyer's market in recent years, which has
considerably reduced the demand for imports.
</P>
<P>
Many trade experts advocate increasing imports, but the central
government seems to be hesitating to spend more to achieve this,
said the Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
To upgrade domestic enterprises' equipment through imports is
an important and effective way to promote exports, the paper
quoted Qin Xuanren, a professor from University of International
Business and Economics as saying.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt Believes in Balanced Development: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina has said that her government believes in balanced
development of all parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
She said this on Saturday while addressing a foundation-laying
function of two bridges to be built within 33 months on a highway
linking the two less-developed southwestern districts of Barisal
and Faridpur, The New Nation English daily newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Economic development can't be ensured without a strong
communication system," she said, acknowledging that the country's
southern part, detached from the mainland by many rivers, could
not yet achieve the desired progress in this field.
</P>
<P>
The government attaches priority to quickening communication in
the southern part by constructing more river bridges, she
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Although Barisal was declared a division, it has not yet got
the required infrastructure, she stated, adding that the district
will be given city corporation status and an education board and
one of the planned 12 universities of science and technology will
be set up there.
</P>
<P>
Describing the communications network as a pre-condition to
socio-economic uplift, the prime minister said her government
wants to build a smooth communications link at all levels -- from
township to sub-district, sub-district to district and district to
capital.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the 950-million-U.S.-dollar mutipurposed Jammuna
Bridge in June this year has linked the northern parts with the
capital, she mentioned.
</P>
<P>
Initial work is also going on to facilitate construction of the
Padma Bridge, a long-cherished desire of the people of the
southern parts, she disclosed at the function.
</P>
<P>
Besides, construction of the Bhairab Bridge involving a cost of
4.53 billion taka (about 93.4 million dollars) on the Dhaka-Sylhet
(208 kilometers northeast of here) is progressing while work on
the 5.7 billion taka (about 117.5 million dollars) Paksey Bridge
over the Padma river has already begun, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the feasibility study is going on for the
construction of the Rupsa bridge in the southwestern district of
Gopalganj, she added.

<HEADLINE> Small Coal Mine Closures Mean Great Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central Government is
determined to close 25,800 small coal mines to bring annual
national output down by some 250 million tons by the end of 1999,
said a leading official, according to today's Business Weekly
(China Daily).
</P>
<P>
Wei Maohe, director of the office for reconstructing local
township coal mines under the State Coal Industry Bureau, noted
that the mines to be shut down are those which have been operating
without official approval, those operating on the sites of
state-owned mines, and those which have obtained official
certificates but are now regarded as irrationally.
</P>
<P>
There are 51,200 coal mines operating nationwide without
official approval, with an annual production capacity of 430
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the joint efforts of central and local
administrations, the mine-closure program has been proceeding
smoothly, said Wei.
</P>
<P>
"It is truly a very, very tough duty" to shut down small mines
that are operating illegally, said an official, for the mine
closure program will cause almost one million workers to lose
their jobs in the small coal mines.
</P>
<P>
And some local governments are probably reluctant to close
small coal mines because it will inevitably reduce local tax
revenues. However, Wei said there was no choice but to close small
mines to reduce coal production to help bail out the loss-stricken
sector.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of this year, the key coal firms
reported large deficits resulting from a huge oversupply of coal.
</P>
<P>
Wei attributed the glut to rampant production by small coal
mines, which produced 620 million tons of coal last year,
representing 46.6 percent of the country's total.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Witness of China's Reform and Opening-Up (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Walking in the stream of
passengers, an eight-year-old Hong Kong student Huang Jianni could
not help looking around at something new nearby, but she stood on
tiptoe at the border check desk and showed her certificate to the
police of inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Like Huang Jianni, groups of students in bright color dresses
have become a new landscape of this year in Luohu, the sole border
entry into inland areas from Hong Kong. Known as window of China's
reform and opening-up, the customs remain since the return of Hong
Kong 17 months ago.
</P>
<P>
"I go across the customs for school every day and I find no
trouble at all," said Huang, a Grade-II student in a Hong Kong
primary school. For the convenience of students like Huang, the
school now runs two buses going from Hong Kong to its neighboring
Shenzhen, the first of the five special economic zones in China.
</P>
<P>
Tentative statistics indicate that at least 400 students now
cross the Luohu entry in Shenzhen and go to school in Hong Kong
every day, because their parents, or just mother or father, are
Hong Kong residents but have housing in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, the Hong Kong residents had to go through
"political check" before they came back to inland areas to see
their relatives, let alone running real estate business.
</P>
<P>
He Liuchun, a customs officer at Luohu, said the Hong Kong
residents were regarded as "class enemies" during the "Great
Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976) and customs officers would impose
strict checks on them.
</P>
<P>
When China began its reform and opening-up policy at the end
of 1978, the Luohu Customs soon became crowded with an increasing
number of Hong Kong residents coming to inland areas for visiting
relatives or making investment.

China 3-2.

against their Japanese peers Naoko Higashi and Yuko Miyaji before
its singles player Kang Ji-Sook outpowered Shino Mizukami of Japan
4-1 for a comfortable advantage.
</P>
<P>
However, Japanese second double parters Satoko Ishikawa and
Tomoka Oku clawed one point back by defeating South Korean Yang
Kum-Yo and Lee Mi-Kyung 5-2.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth match, the Korean woman Yoon Sun-Kyung sealed the
victory against Naoko Higashi 4-2, awarding her country the top
honor.
</P>
<P>
In the third-place playoff, Chinese Taipei defeated China 3-2

Yet, the Chinese women players managed to level 2-2 by taking
the following doubles and singles through Yang Wei who partnered
with Liu Ya, and Cao Lei.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Case Opens Chile's Old Wound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The case of Chile's former
leader Augusto Pinochet has shaken every fabric of the country's
political life, pushing the civilian government to face its most
serious challenge since it assumed power four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Until Pinochet's surprise detention in London on October 16,
all had appeared well in Chile's transition to civilian rule from
a 16-year military regime led by General Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
President Eduardo Frei, Chile's second elected president in
post-Pinochet era, was sworn into office in March 1994 after a
smooth election hailed by many as restoring the country firmly
onto the track to democracy.
</P>
<P>
In September this year, Pinochet announced retirement from top
military post, which he had held for a quarter of a century, and
entered the parliament as a lifetime senator, mainly an honorary
title signaling he relinquished all political power.
</P>
<P>
Diverse political forces were working to patch up bitter social
wounds with the church as a mediator, trying to put behind the
memory of Pinochet's military junta that rose to power in a bloody
coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Political leaders were even talking of eventual national
reconciliation when the political landscape was changed overnight
by Pinochet's detention in London.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish judiciary's demand to try Pinochet on charges of
genocide and torture during his reign has cut up the nation into
two blocks, pitting Pinochet's supporters against those against
him.
</P>
<P>
Each decision in Madrid or London sent waves of both
humiliation and jubilation among the Chileans, who were constantly
forced to look back at pains of the military regime. "Pinochet
divides Chile," a political analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Disagreement over the Pinochet issue has fueled antagonism
between the right and left political forces, which will inevitably
threaten the transition process that had been going on for the
past eight years and described as "exemplary" even by Spanish
Foreign Minister Abel Matutes in his March visit.
</P>
<P>
It has also created a very complicated political picture ahead
of the presidential election scheduled for the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe that none of the four candidates of
the ruling coalition has, so far, emerged as a clear winner or
loser, as opinion polls do not show major tendencies toward any
of the presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the task of maintaining political stability in the
country, the government is struggling to bridge the gap between
conflicting views over the Pinochet case and seeking to overcome
uncertainties in the next presidential election.

<HEADLINE> China Tries to Gain Sustainable Economic Growth Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Whether China will launch a
new special treasury bond issue in 1999 will depend on the
country's economic performance in the first few months of next
year, analysts said, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released so far indicate that China's gross domestic
product will approach, if not reach, the 8 percent growth target
for 1998, which has been achieved thanks to the massive expansion
of state investment, economists said.
</P>
<P>
However, economists said that the economy cannot be viewed as
having been kickstarted unless consumers become active in buying
goods and the enthusiasm of private investors grows.
</P>
<P>
However, consumer confidence has not recovered, which is
reflected by 9 percent real growth in retail sales during the
first 10 months, as compared to 10.2 percent for 1997 as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Barring state bond issues, the government seems to have limited
weapons in its financial and fiscal armoury for the struggle for
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China's weak tax base does not permit it to cut taxes, and its
interest rates have been trimmed three times this year, with the
latest cut effective last Monday, and RMB rates are now almost at
the same level as the dollar's.
</P>
<P>
As China is undergoing industrial restructuring and trying to
develop more value-added products, its export sector, which has
grown enormously mostly on the back of labor-intensive
production, is also readjusting itself, said a researcher with the
China Academy of International Trade and Economic
Cooperation (UIBE).
</P>
<P>
He said that China's export sector should try to maintain a
growth rate equal to or slightly higher than that of gross
domestic product, which averages 9 percent over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
However, in the January-November period of this year, the
foreign trade sector reported negative growth of 0.2 percent, the
first time since the implementation of reform and opening-up
policy in 1978 due to the impact of Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hanlin at the UIBE was still optimistic about China's
foreign trade prospects next year.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's exporters will face a better international
business environment in 1999, which will be boosted by sustainable
economic growth in the European Union, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The EU absorbed 42 percent of the world's imports last year,
only 2 percent came from China.

<HEADLINE> Murofushi Wins Hammer Gold, Eyes World Chamionships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Koji Murofushi
defeated former Olympic and twice world champion Andrey Abuvaliev
of Uzbekistan to win the hammer throw gold medal in the Asian
Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Murofushi, 24, son of former Asian hammer throw legend
Skigenobu, heaved a winning toss of 78.57 meters in his third
attempt.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great, wonderful win here," said the jubilant
Murofushi.
</P>
<P>
He threw the hammer 74.32 meters in his first attempt and
overtook the 75 meters mark in all the other fives, with everyone
beating the Asian Games record of 72.24 set by Bi Zhong of China
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"I think I have a chance to win a medal in the World
Championships and the Olympic Games," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abuvaliev, Barcelona Olympic champion and world champion in
1993 and 1995, finished second in 77.14 meters.
</P>
<P>
The third place went to Nilolay Davydor of Kyrgyzstan with
68.10.
</P>
<P>
Abuvaliev's Asian record of 83.36 remained intact although it
appeared a mere matter of time for the Japanese star to conquer.
</P>
<P>
Murofushi jumped to fame early this year when he broke the
national record of Skigenobu, a fifth-time Asian Games champion
since 1970.
</P>
<P>
"My father began to teach me hammer throw when I was 15, " he
said. "He is still my coach today."
</P>
<P>
Murofushi said it was hard to repeat his father's feat.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot imagine that. It's very tough. He retired at 41. I
think I cannot continue doing that at that age," Murofushi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was a big surprise to win the gold medal here
because Abuduvliev is a great man.
</P>
<P>
"Abuduvaliev is a great teacher of mine," he said. "I never
expected I can win here."
</P>
<P>
Murofushi had trained together with Abuduvaliev several times
in the past five years. The latest one took place in March when
he went to Uzebikistan.
</P>
<P>
He said Abuduvaliev lost just because he failed to take the
Asian Games seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
"I know he is not in good shape since he missed serveral
times," he said. "I think he has not preparing for it."
</P>
<P>
He said he will continue his hard training to achieve good
results in next year's World Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
"The results here today showed that what I have done was right.
I will continue to do that, to do very well in everyday training
for the future," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Entrepreneurs Enter Foreign Trade Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Some private enterprises will
be granted foreign trade rights starting form January 1 next year,
announced the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC), according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that only firms with registered capital and net
assets totalling 8.5 million yuan (1.02 million U.S. dollars) or
above, and which have supplied commodities worth one million
U.S. dollars or more to trading houses for overseas sale over the
past two years, will be entitled to apply for export rights.
</P>
<P>
However, the requirements for manufacturers of machinery,
electronic and high-tech products are a little bit stringent.
</P>
<P>
A considerable number of private firms have already submitted
their applications to MOFTEC, according to sources close to the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Private firms' much lower operating costs, more flexible
trading means, and greater range of financial incentives to
stimulate the enthusiasm of their employees are expected to put
considerable pressure on the state-owned traders.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the new forces in the foreign trade sector are likely
to help ease the spreading undercutting practices in the export
sector, the experts predicted, adding that while the new trade
players may also bring some negative impact and even some chaos to
the sector in the short term.
</P>
<P>
The state firms will be forced to enhance their competitiveness
by upgrading management and cutting costs.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen Arrives in Hanoi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
arrived here Sunday morning for a two-day visit to Vietnam, during
which he is expected to have talks with leaders of ASEAN over his
country's entry into the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
This is Hun Sen's first trip abroad since he became the sole
prime minister of Cambodia at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnamese sources, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai and Hun Sen are to hold talks Sunday afternoon. Several
agreements are expected to be signed between the two neighboring
countries during Hun Sen's stay here.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of the nine members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), who will begin
their sixth summit on Tuesday, will hold talks with Hun Sen on
Wednesday morning. The talks are widely expected to focus on
Cambodia's admission to ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
When he arrived at the hotel in which he is to stay in Hanoi,
the Cambodian prime minister kept silent when asked by reporters
to make a comment on Cambodia's entry into ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the nine ASEAN member countries reached no
consensus on Cambodia's accession to the regional grouping in a
preparatory meeting for the summit on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN had agreed earlier last year to admit Cambodia together
with Laos and Myanmar but later deferred its entry after the
breakout of armed conflicts between forces of former Cambodian
First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen, which resulted in Ranariddh's ouster.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, founded in August 1967, now comprises Brunei, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Active Fiscal Policies to Continue: Financial Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Financial Minister
Xiang Huaicheng said here today that China will continue to
pursue active fiscal policies in 1999 to push forward various
reforms and the restructuring of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national fiscal conference opened here today,
Xiang said that, taking both domestic and international economic
conditions into consideration, China needs to continue with its
active fiscal policy in macro-economic regulation to maintain a
sustainable and stable economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the series of fiscal policies implemented
this year has contributed greatly to economic growth. However, it
should also be noticed that restrictive factors such as export
declines, stagnant enterprise investment and residents'
consumption and limited effects of monetary policies are unlikely
to have major improvements.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, if there is a cut in next year's central
fiscal expenditure, the achievements of this year's active fiscal
policies will be inevitably affected and it will be difficult to
maintain a stable economic growth for 1999.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the continuation of active fiscal
policies is a short-term measure adopted at a special period. When
the growth of economy slows down, the government stimulates social
demand through increased fiscal expenditure; when this goal is
achieved, the government should cut its expenditure accordingly,
or there will be risks of over-heated economic and inflation.
</P>
<P>
"From the medium- and long-term point of view, we must
implement a modestly tight fiscal policy and gradually realize the
target of a basically balanced revenues and expenditure. Otherwise
it's hard for the national economy and the finance to bear the
burden," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to active fiscal policies, Xiang also outlined a
number of issues that call special attention in 1999, and they
include the steady increase of revenues, optimizing expenditure
structure, standardizing levying management, deepening fiscal and
taxation reforms and reinforcing fiscal management supervision.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Warned of Foreign Attempts to Install Puppet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Sunday reminded his countrymen of the danger of
attempts by foreign powers to seek to install a puppet among the
local community to recolonize the country.
</P>
<P>
So far the foreign powers have failed but there is no guarantee
that such attempts would not be initiated again, Mahathir, who is
also the president of ruling United Malays National Organization
(UMNO), said at the UMNO special general assembly here.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign powers always wanted countries which were
once colonized including Malaysia to continue to look up to their
former colonial masters who were displeased over the progress
achieved by the independent nations.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, he said, it was clear that foreign powers wish to
destroy the country by creating disunity and rifts among the
Malays through various means.
</P>
<P>
When they (foreign powers) have identified their puppet, they
would use the weaknesses of their puppet to manipulate him and
adopt various means to ensure that the puppet was at their mercy
and eventually, they expect their puppet to take over the
leadership of the country and obey their orders, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "This is what is happening. It can be clearly seen
that attempts to colonize the nation have already been made."
</P>
<P>
The foreign powers would deny that they have an agenda to
retard the progress of the countries in the East, Mahathir said,
adding however it was common knowledge from the history of the
foreign powers in Asia and other regions that they certainly have
a conspiracy to ensure that they continue to dominate the world or
at the very least eliminate the possibility of being challenged.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the nations which were independent and
successful were in East Asia where economic growth and progress
posed a real challenge to their former colonial masters.
</P>
<P>
Citing historical facts compiled by an American author that
attempts to cause the downfall of leaders in newly-independent
nations were made in Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia and several
other countries, Mahathir said that no country was allowed to
remain peaceful and prosperous unless its leader could be
manipulated and installed as their puppet.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the foreign powers' aim was to see that the
leaders of the newly-independent nations become weak and could be
manipulated by them.
</P>
<P>
He said that although at first the world community felt that
nobody had the right to interfere in the internal affairs of
independent nations, the Western powers had managed to convince
the world that to monitor and curb human rights violation, they
were entitled to intervene in the domestic affairs of countries
not in their favor.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Beats Former World Champ to Win Hammer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Koji Murofushi
defeated former Olympic and twice world champion Andrey Abuvaliev
of Uzbekistan to win the hammer gold medal in the Asian Games here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Murofushi, 24, son of former Asian hammer throw legend
Skigenobu, heaved a winning toss of 78.57 meters in his third
attempt.
</P>
<P>
Abuvaliev, Barcelona Olympic champion and world champion in
1993 and 1995, finished second in 77.14 meters.
</P>
<P>
Murofushi jumped to fame early this year when he broke the
national record of Skigenobu, a fifth-time Asian Games champion
since 1970.
</P>
<P>
"My father began to teach me hammer throw when I was 15, " he
said. "He is still my coach."
</P>
<P>
Murofushi said it was hard to repeat his father's feat.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot imagine that. It's very tough. He retired at 41. I
think I cannot continue doing that at that age," Murofushi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was a big surprise to win the gold medal here
because Abuduvliev was a "great man".
</P>
<P>
"Abuduvaliev is a great teacher of mine," he said. "I never
expected I could win here."
</P>
<P>
He said Abuduvaliev lost just because he failed to take the
Asian Games seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
"I know he is not in good shape since he missed serveral
times," he said. "I think he has not been preparing for it."
</P>
<P>
He said that he will continue his hard training to achieve good
results in next year's World Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
"The results here today showed that what I have done was right.
I will continue to do that, to do very well in everyday training
for the future," he said.

BUDAPEST, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Hungary has experienced a
month-by-month decline in consumer price growth in the second half
of this year, said the Hungarian Central Statistics Bureau
Saturday.

Compared with the same period last year, it fell 12.3 percent
and 11.2 percent in October and November respectively, said the

</P>

Hungarian National Bank President Gyorgy Surani attributed the
decline to the strict legal and monetary measures.

As a result, inflation rate in the country dropped by seven
percentage points this year, Surani said, expected to remain at
the 10 percent level next year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Table Tennis Coach Rates Degrees of Difficulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- For Chinese table tennis
players, women's doubles is the most difficult to win, said
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the degress of difficulty rated by Cai, the
women's team was the least difficult event for China, followed by
men's team, men's doubles, mixed doubles, men's and women's
singles and women's doubles.
</P>
<P>
"My predictions were accurate since China had swept two team
titles with the men's team having met a bit more challenge than
women," said the Chinese coach.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men beat the South Koreans 3-1 in Saturday's final,
one day after its women lifted the team title with a 3-1 win over
DPR Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese are heavy favorites in the men's and mixed doubles
events. Liu Guoliang and Kong Linghui were the Olympic doubles
gold medalists, and Liu and Wu Na the mixed doubles world
champions.
</P>
<P>
The men's singles title will be decided among world No. 2 Liu,
No. 3 Kong and No. 11 Kim Taek Soo of South Korea with Kong
standing the best chance.
</P>
<P>
The women's singles gold will go to either world No. 2 Li Ju
or No. 3 Wang Nan, twice World Cup winner. The two Chinese have
equal chance.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is favored for the women's doubles title since
China's world top player Deng Yaping opted out of the Asian Games
to concentrate on her studies in Beijing's Qinghua Univeristy.
</P>
<P>
Deng, Olympic multi-gold medalist, has been in semi-retirement
since she completed a singles-doubles sweep in the world
championships in May last year.
</P>
<P>
"South Korean pairs have beaten the Chinese several times this
year," said Chinese coach Lu Yuansheng. "They aim to break the
Chinese dominance through women's doubles."

<P>
COLOMBO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will set up an
international medical college with an in-house teaching hospital,
the first of its kind in the country, a newspaper here reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Island said the new college will commence its first
semester in October next year. The college, located on a
two-and-a-half acre site at Colombo, will cost an estimated 4.5
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Asoka Jayasena, a member of its governing council, told the
paper that the college project has already received Board of
Investment approval and legal clearance from the Attorney
General's Department.
</P>
<P>
"Students passing out of our medical college will be awarded
degrees by the world renowned Aberdeen University in the United
Kingdom with whom we have tied up," Jayasena was quoted as saying.
</P>

Senior professors from Aberdeen will form part of the teaching
panel with the various departments headed by Sri Lankan medical

<HEADLINE> Kong Tipped to Be King of Asian Table Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- World No. 3 Kong Linghui of
China will very likely become the king of Asian table tennis if he
repeats his Asian Games team final win over South Korean Kim Taek
Soo in the singles semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Kong was drawn into the second half with the world 11th-ranked
South Korean, who lost to the Chinese in straight sets in the team
final Saturday, while dual Olympic gold medalist Liu Guoliang of
China topped the first half of the draw.
</P>
<P>
If competition goes as seeding, 1995 world champion and World
Cup winner Kong will take on current World Cup runner-up Kim in
the semifinals. The Chinese has better chance to make the final.
</P>
<P>
Liu, ranked second in the world, will very likely meet Japanese
Iseki Seiko in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Seiko, who won the 1988 Olympic doubles gold for China in his
Chinese name of Wei Qingguang and changed his allegiance in the
early 90s, had beaten Liu in the Asian championships in October.
</P>
<P>
"I lost to Wei because I took him easy," said Liu. "If I meet
him again, I will be very tough, and I will give him a lesson."
</P>
<P>
Neither Liu nor Seiko is able to stop Kong, who plays an
all-around game in handshake style.
</P>
<P>
Liu has never beaten his roommate Kong in either international
or domestic competitions. Kong, more often than not, intentionally
conceded one set to Liu in order not to embarras his close friend
too much.
</P>
<P>
If Kong meets Liu in the final, the score is set -- three
to one in favor of King Kong.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Might Withdraw Troops for Peace Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government might remove the remaining 130 solders from a neutral
zone for holding peace talks with rebels, El Espectador newspaper
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted official sources as saying that President Andres
Pastrana could order a withdrawal of the soldiers in San Vicente
del Caguan, one of the five demilitarized municipalities, to
prepare for talks.
</P>
<P>
The sources said this would be carried out after Chief of Staff
General Fernando Tapias returns from his U.S. visit.
</P>
<P>
The presence of soldiers in the zone has become an obstacle to
the peace process between the government and the biggest and
oldest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC), the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A neutral zone of 42,000 square kilometers was demilitarized on
November 7 for three months to prepare for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government has insisted that the soldiers are
unarmed and perform only administrative functions, and will not
abandon the barracks, because that will be the official seat for
the talks.
</P>
<P>
But reports said that the military forces oppose the withdrawal
of the soldiers on the grounds of "dignity."
</P>
<P>
However, the FARC demands the withdrawal and said that there is
in the military tunnels weapons and other things that threaten the
security of the rebel leaders who will take part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousand of people have died in the 36 year civil war
in Colombia.

<P>
DHAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's 5th National
Immunization Days will be observed on Sunday and on February 2,
1999 throughout the country to eradicate polio by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the immunization days, 20 million under
age-5 children will be immunized by giving oral polio vaccine,
irrespective of their previous vaccination status.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the children aged between one and five will also be
given Vitamin-A, and in the second round all under-5 children will
only be immunized through oral polio vaccine, press reports Sunday
quoted Health and Family Welfare Minister Salahuddin Yusuf as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed the hope that this year the success rate
of the immunization would be 100 percent against only 86 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
The immunization program will take place at a total of 0.12
million vaccination centers across the country, of which 0.108
centers will be in the rural areas and the rest will be in the
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the program, which is funded by Japan and several
international agencies as well the Bangladeshi government, is
estimated at about 305 million taka (about 6.3 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In order to make the first round of the immunization days
successful, the health minister called on the government,
non-governmental and international organizations as well as media
to play an effective role.
</P>
<P>
Only two polio cases were detected in the country this year,

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers to Finalize Documents for Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and economic ministers
of the nine members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) started their joint meeting here Sunday morning to
finalize documents to be presented to the ASEAN summit scheduled
on December 15 and 16.
</P>
<P>
Among the documents to be considered are the Hanoi Declaration,
the Hanoi Plan of Action, a report on the achievements made by the
regional grouping since the last summit in 1995 and a separate
document on what ASEAN officials called "bold measures" for
addressing the financial crisis which has been plaguing the region
since last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft obtained by Xinhua, the Hanoi Declaration
would pledge to "move ASEAN onto a higher plane of regional
cooperation in order to strengthen ASEAN's effectiveness in
dealing with the challenges of growing interdependence within
ASEAN and of its integration with the global economy."
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government would also "spare no efforts
to quickly restore financial and macroeconomic stability, bring
about early economic recovery and maintain sustained growth."
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN region, which saw the fastest growth in the world in
the 1980s and 1990s, has been bogged down in serious economic
difficulties and some ASEAN members had to ask for outside
assistance to overcome their problems.
</P>
<P>
The draft declaration said the ASEAN "will keep its markets
open as it recognizes that the key to strengthen and stabilize the
region's currencies and economies is to attract long-term
investments."
</P>
<P>
It also expressed the leaders' determination to implement, as
scheduled, the ASEAN Free Trade Area and all approved programs and
projects, despite the economic woes.
</P>
<P>
The leaders would urge concerned countries and international
financial institutions to continue to assist the affected
countries in their economic recovery through development
assistance, increased private investment flows, greater market
access of goods originating from the ASEAN region and increased
technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
The Hanoi Plan of Action will contain measures for implementing
the ASEAN Vision 2020, a program which will guide the ASEAN
countries in their cooperation and social and economic development
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Covering the period from now to the year 2004, the plan aims to
restore business confidence by maintaining regional macroeconomic
and financial stability through promoting closer consultations in
macroeconomic and financial policies and strengthening the
financial systems and capital markets of member states to insulate
the region from external disturbances.
</P>
<P>
The foreign and economic ministers at Sunday's meeting will
also discuss "bold measures" for restoring the region's economy
and submit them to the heads of state and government at the ASEAN
summit.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters Sunday
morning that some of the measures will be voluntary while others
will be mandatory. But he did not give any details.
</P>
<P>
But Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam told a press
briefing Saturday that the measures, "however bold," would take
into consideration the development levels and abilities of various
member countries.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, with
Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam being the poorest members.

<HEADLINE> Top Czech Leaders Meet on Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Czech's top leaders -- Prime
Minister Milos Zeman, Chamber of Deputies Chairman Vaclav Klaus,
National Bank President Josef Tosovsky and labor union boss
Richard Falbr, met Friday afternoon on the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
They all agreed that as Czech was suffering an economic slump
and a deteriorating credit, they should cool off inter-party
struggles and carry out definite political and economic measures
at an earliest date.
</P>
<P>
On the goal of tiding over the current crisis, Zeman, Klaus and
Falbr noted it was necessary for the country to redetermine its
economic priorities and adopt easy money policy. But they rejected
any policy that blindly pursues inflation curbing and trade
balance.
</P>
<P>
However, banker Tosovsky saw things differently. Stressing that
sound development would result from a stable economic foundation,
he said a series of reforms, not just measures of spurring demand,
were needed.
</P>
<P>
It had been a long time since Czech's top leaders holding
different views met on economic problems, a fact itself proving
the country is facing a very grim economic situation now,
according to analysts here.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will meet again at the beginning of next year to
work out details.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Blamed for Thailand's Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- As investigators were trying
to identify the cause of Friday's plane crash, survivors blamed
the pilot for making a wrong decision that led to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Some survivors said on Sunday over TV that if Captain Phinit
Vechasilp had not made the third attempt to land in heavy rain,
the accident would not have happened.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated flight TG261 of Thai Airways International,
coming from Bangkok with 146 people on board, crashed and burst
into flames while trying to land at the airport in the southern
province of Surat Thani during a tropical storm. A total of 104
people were confirmed dead while 42 others survived.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said the pilot made two attempts to land but
failed. The third attempt landed in a disaster.
</P>
<P>
Tearful survivor Vinai Uamnabtue, who lost his seven-year-old
son, said if the pilot had decided to take the plane back to
Bangkok without trying to land for the third time, he would not
have lost his son.
</P>
<P>
He said Captain Phinit had told passengers that poor visibility
was making it difficult to land the plane. After two attempts, he
again spoke on the intercom that he would make a final attempt and
if that failed he would go back to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
he said he had been sitting in the middle section of the
aircraft with his son to his left and his three-year-old daughter
on his right. When the plane crashed his legs were trapped under
some seats together with his daughter but he could not see his
son.
</P>
<P>
One middle-aged woman survivor said it had been a big mistake
not to have taken the plane back to Bangkok or at least to have
landed at a nearby airport.
</P>
<P>
"If the pilot had done that rather than deciding to go through
the storm, I would not be lying here in hospital. It was the big
mistake that caused the loss of so many lives," she said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Airways International (THAI) president Thamnnon Wanglee,
expressing condolences to the victims' families and pledging full
medical attention for survivors, declined to speculate the cause
of the crash.
</P>
<P>
Poor visibility caused by the storm was believed to have led to
the accident. Investigators said they hoped the black box, which
has already been found, would provide crucial information.

<TEXT>
<P>
-- The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
released its "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" on January 1,
1979, setting down the basic policies for settling the Taiwan
issue and for the peaceful reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The then minister of national defense Xu Xiangqian announced
that day that the mainland would stop bombarding Taiwan's Big and
Small Jinmen islands, which started in 1958.
</P>
<P>
That same day, China and the United States established official
diplomatic relations. Deng Xiaoping visited the
U.S. Jan. 29-Feb. 5, the first visit to the U.S. by a Chinese
leader since the People's Republic of China was founded, and the
first since the establishment of Sino-U.S. diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
A CPC meeting on ideological work was held Jan. 18-Apr. 3,
where those attending the meeting sharply criticized the
"Two-whatevers" and the rigid way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping made a speech at the meeting, "Adhering to the
Four Basic Principles", on March 30, and pointed out that the four
modernizations must be realized by taking the socialist road, and
adhering to the people's democratic dictatorship, to the
leadership of the Communist Party, and to Marxism-Leninism and Mao
Zedong Thought.
</P>
<P>
On July 15, 1979, the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council approved reports on special and flexible policies in
foreign economic activities submitted by the Guangdong Provincial
CPC Committee and the Fujian Provincial CPC Committee, and decided
to set up special zones in the cities of Shenzhen, Zhuhai,
Shantou, and Xiamen. The CPC Central Committee and the State
Council approved the "Minutes of the Meeting on Guangdong and
Fujian Provinces", changing the name of "special zones" to
"special economic zones".

<HEADLINE> Writethrough: Thailand's Plane Crash Death Toll Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in Friday's
plane crash has risen to 104 as rescuers called off their search
for survivors of Thai Airways' flight TG261.
</P>
<P>
Airways sources said on Sunday that 42 people survived the
crash, among them three crew, 28 Thais and 11 foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The figure, however, contradicted that provided by Sunday's
Bangkok Post which put the number of survivors at 45 and the death
toll at 101.
</P>
<P>
The plane, coming from Bangkok with 146 people on board,
crashed and burst into flames while trying to land at the airport
in the southern province of Surat Thani during a tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of soldiers, police and civilian volunteers worked
frantically through Friday night and Saturday to search for
survivors in heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
Workers had to wade waste-deep through muddy water and carry
bodies by hand to vehicles which were unable to drive to the site.
</P>
<P>
After having combed through the Airbus 310-200 wreckage,
rescuers confirmed that the death toll has risen to 104, dimming
the hopes of finding two missing passengers alive, as the
remaining fuselage section had been shoulder-deep in water for
more than a day.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said about 20 victims had been charred beyond
recognition and had still not been identified. A team of
Bangkok-based police forensic experts flew into the site on
Saturday to help with identification work.
</P>
<P>
Thai Airways International (THAI) president Thamnnon Wanglee,
expressing condolences to the victims' families and pledging full
medical attention for survivors, declined to speculate the cause
of the crash.
</P>
<P>
Poor visibility caused by the storm was believed to have led to
the accident. As the precise cause of the crash was still under
investigation, investigators said they hoped the surviving pilot,
who was injured, would be able to provide crucial information. The
black box has already been found.
</P>
<P>
Those identified among the dead were Dr. Kowit
Varapongsuttikul, this year's winner of Thailand's Oustanding
Rural Doctor Award and Boonchai Phongpetra, a senator in the Thai
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The passenger list indicated that there were at least 25
foreigners, mostly with British and German names, and some
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus company had released some details of the fatal
flight. The plane was an A 310-200, delivered to Thailand in April
1986.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October the twin-engine plane had wracked up
23,000 flight miles.
</P>
<P>
Friday's crash was the first major air accident in Thailand
involving the Thai Airways International for six years. On July
31, 1992, a Thai Airbus 310-300 smashed into a cloud-covered
Himalayan ridge in an attempt to land at Kathmandu, Nepal, killing
113 people on board.

Figure Skating Championships crow, even though she is not a
member of the pro ranks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The following is the chronicle
of the major events that have taken place since the Third Plenum
of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), as compiled by the CPC Central Committee's Party Literature
Research Center:
</P>
<P>
-- Those present at the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central
Committee, which was held on December 18 through 22, 1978,
criticised the erroneous "Two-whatevers" policy (firmly upholding
whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made and adhering to
whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave), and confirmed the
principle of completely and correctly understanding the scientific
system of Mao Zedong Thought and supported discussions about
practice being the sole criterion of truth.
</P>
<P>
They also decided a guiding policy for emancipating minds,
seeking truth from facts, and uniting as one to make progress.
</P>
<P>
They stopped the use of the slogan "taking class struggle as
the key link", and made a decision to shift the work focus to
socialist modernization drive and the implementation of reforms and
opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting marked the establishment of the second generation
of central collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping at the core,
and the beginning of the new era of China's socialist
modernization construction.
</P>
<P>
In December 1978, a secret agreement was signed by 18 farmers'
households in the village of Xiaogang in east China's Anhui
Province, whereby they would sign contracts on collective farmland
and start a contract responsiobility system of farming.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chinese Military's Diplomacy for Friendship, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the aftermath of the Cold War, international political,
economic and military relations have changed profoundly, and
peace, cooperation and development have become the theme of the
times.
</P>
<P>
In these new circumstances, China's armed forces have had
exchanges and cooperation in various fields and at different
levels.
</P>
<P>
In the professional and technical field, China's armed
forces have sent over 800 study and research delegations abroad in
the 1990s, with more than 20,000 people. And, they invited nearly
1,000 foreign specialists and scholars to China in 1996 alone.
</P>
<P>
These exchanges and cooperation for mutual benefit and common
development have helped improve quality in China's armed forces
with science and technology and have helped the high-tech
development of China's defenses and the modernization of the armed
forces of China's cooperative partners.
</P>
<P>
Since the reforms and opening up began, Chinese armed forces
have helped more than 70 countries in sports, culture, medical
care, education, and training, which has helped them guard their
independence and sovereignty and development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Russian defense ministries signed an agreement
on stopping dangerous military activities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and U.S. armed forces signed an agreement on
establishing a negotiation mechanism for naval security, and have
agreed to cooperate in sending personnel to inspect joint training
exercises.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chinese Military's Diplomacy for Friendship, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's armed forces have taken part seminars and dialogues on
international and regional security and defense, and international
arms control and disarmament negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, its armed forces have sent over 1,200 military
personnel to participate in six United Nations peace-keeping
actions and have gained greater recognition from the international
community.
</P>
<P>
They have held or participated in international conferences and
exhibitions, making a contribution to international military
medical science, equipment, technology, and military sports.
</P>
<P>
Its military diplomacy has increased mutual understanding,
trust, and friendship with foreign armed forces, bringing
friendship with their counterparts in neighboring countries to a
new level, further developing the traditional cooperation with the
armed forces of the vast majority of developing countries, and
improving relations with the armed forces of western developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
This diplomacy has made a contribution to a better
international and domestic environment for China's reforms and
opening up and its socialist modernization drive, and has proven
that the PLA is a disciplined peace-loving force and an
important force for guarding regional and world peace, stability,
and development.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Affairs official at China's National Defense Ministry
says that with the continued strengthening of the new security by
increasing trust through dialogues and consultation, military
diplomacy has got greater attention from other countries.
</P>
<P>
China's cross-century military diplomacy will undoubtedly be
even more active, the official concluded.

<HEADLINE> NBA Talks Break Off After Half Hour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The second secret
negotiating session in three days broke up after less than 30
minutes today, leaving the NBA season in serious jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Yet another bargaining breakdown on the same day that the
Houston Chronicle in New York -- citing unidentified sources on
both sides of the negotiations -- reported the sides were close
to reaching a deal. That notion was refuted by NBA deputy
commissioner Russ Granik, who has been in on both secret meetings.
</P>
<P>
"We're getting nowhere," Granik said upon exiting the meetings.
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's secret session, Granik expressed some guarded
optimism but cautioned he was unsure whether the sides could get
"on the same planet." Today's lack of progress pushed the NBA's
galaxy of star closer to an entirely lost season.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed general issues we thought were pertinent,"
Players Association executive director Billy Hunter said. "They
basically said they had nothing more to say and they thought it
was not necessary to continue to meet, and they bascially left."
</P>
<P>
The report in the Chronicle claimed the sides likely would
agree that 54 percent of basketball-related income would go the
the players, with modifications to the timing rules regarding the
signing of free agents udner the Larry Bird Exception.
</P>
<P>
It also said a 52-game season would start February 1, with the
playoffs potentially pushed into the early days of July. But
today's fallout again raises the distinct possibility of the
entire season being canceled.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese swimming team leader
Tsuyoshi Aoli claimed they won the Asian Games swimming by beating
China for the first time since the 1990 Games.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese head coach Zhang Xiong said China was the
eventual winner in the water despite taking 13 golds against
Japan's 15.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese swimmers broke seven Games marks while Japanese only
four. I think we are the winners in swimming," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The mere medal tally is not sufficient to decide who is the No.
1 Asian power in the sport," the Chinese coach said. "The Chinese
team was depleted by the absence of star swimmers while Japan sent
most of its best swimmers here."
</P>
<P>
Aoli said the Japanese victory in swimming boosted its chance
and morale to win a gold medal in the 2000 Olympic Games in
Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Olympic Organizers Deny Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Olympic organizers and
state officials angrily denied charges on Saturday that
International Olympic Committee members were bribed during
Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
"No payments, direct or indirect. No scholarships, direct or
indirect, " said Billy Payne, chief of the Atlanta Committee for
the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I have never heard of that and will state positively,
unequivocally, Atlanta did not do that."
</P>
<P>
According to a press report here, Marc Hodler, a senior member
of the IOC Committee executive board, said in Switzerland that
organizers in Atlanta and other host cities paid for the votes of
IOC members during the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
The 80-year-old Swiss lawyer said agents work on the behalf of
IOC members had asked for the best possible deal. He said the
payments were made in the form of collegae scholarships to
relatives of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
It was said that Andrei Smirnov, the stepson of Andrew
Jennings, a powerful Russion Olympic official then, entered the
University of Georgia in 1991, a year after Atlanta won the
Summer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
But Payne said the aid never went beyond offering contact
names and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
The Salt Lake Olypmic Committee has admitted that almost
$400,000 from a college scholarship fund it ran during its bid
helped children of six IOC members.
</P>
<P>
But Dean H. Propst, who was the chancellor of Goergia
University system at the time, said Georgia schools had no
involvement in a scholarship-for-votes deal.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta upset Athens in the bidding battle for hosting the
centennial Games in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Nestle Condemns ALF for Poisoning Cakes in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss-based multinational
food giant Nestle on Saturday strongly condemned a radical Italian
animal rights group for having poisoned the company's Christmas
cakes for sale in some Italian cities two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) sent two seasonal cakes to
Italian news agency ANSA with a note claiming several boxes of
cakes of the Nestle-made Motta and Alemagna brands had been
injected with rat poison at supermarkets in the central cities of
Florence and Bologna.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Duria, one of the ALF's leaders, said the organization
is not terrorist but saboteur trying to draw attention to the
group's fight against genetically-altered food products, saying
that "the conscience of consumers needs to be reawakened."

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Panel Rejects Democratic Motion to Censure Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee Saturday voted 22-14 to reject
a Democrats-drafted motion to censure President Bill Clinton for
his actions in the Monica Lewinsky affair rather than impeach him.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party is pushing the motion in hopes that it
will siphon votes from impeachment on the House floor next week.
</P>
<P>
The House panel approved four impeachment articles against
Clinton on Friday and Saturday, ignoring the president's
last-minute expression of being "profoundly sorry" for his words
and deeds.
</P>
<P>
The articles, including perjury, obstruction of justice and
abuse of power, were put forward by the Republican Party on
December 9.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives is expected to hold a meeting next
Thursday to cast votes on the four articles of impeachment, where
the outcome is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
The White House said Saturday that if the House floor impeaches
President Clinton, it would divide the country and the government
and "defy the will of the people."
</P>
<P>
White House special counsel Gregory Craig denounced the House
Judiciary Committee's approval on a party-line vote of impeachment
articles against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"While the goal of the partisan majority on the committee is to
impeach the president and remove him from office, the certain
result will be to divide the country, gridlock the government and
defy the will of the people," Craig said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Clinton said he was profoundly sorry for misleading
the country about his affair with former White House intern
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"Mere words cannot fully express the profound remorse I feel
for what our country is going through and for what members of both
the parties in Congress are now forced to deal with," Clinton
said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chinese Military's Diplomacy For Friendship, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- China is now practicing
military diplomacy as an integral part of its overall diplomacy
and has taken advantage of the reforms and opening up of the past
two decades for a new look.
</P>
<P>
In this time, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), which was
founded in 1927, has achieved much in exchanges and cooperation
with foreign armed forces by implementing China's independent
foreign policy of peace and Deng Xiaoping's diplomatic thought,
and following the principle that military diplomacy should serve
national diplomacy and the modernization of the country's defense
and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
China's armed forces have established relations with its
counterparts in over 100 countries, and opened 99 military attache
offices abroad, 1.3 times the number in 1978, the year before the
policy of reform and opening-up was introduced, and 65 countries
have military attache offices in China.
</P>
<P>
China's armed forces have sent more than 1,200 delegations to
more than 80 countries, and have received more than 1,900
delegations, at least 1,100 of which were led by defense
ministers, commanders-in-chief or chiefs of general staff.
</P>
<P>
China's naval forces have visited more than 20 countries in the
1990s and China has played host to naval ships from 17 countries.
The Chinese navy made its first trip across the Pacific in 1997 to
the United States and South America.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Leaves for Vietnam on State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen left here Sunday morning for Hanoi, Vietnam on a two-day
state visit at the invitation of his Vietnamese counterpart Phan
Van Khai.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's visit to Vietnam, his first trip abroad since forming
a new coalition government in Cambodia, is aimed at strengthening
and consolidating the friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The entourage of the prime minister includes his wife Bun Rany
and Minister of Cabinet Sok An.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen is expected to meet with some Vietnamese government's
senior officials and discuss with them measures to solve the
remaining problems related to their land and sea borders and
ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade between the two countries was about 130
million U.S. dollars last year, with about 100 million dollars
worth of Vietnam's rice exports accounting for the lion's share.
</P>
<P>
Saying that another aim of his Hanoi trip is to seek Cambodia's
seat in ASEAN, Hun Sen is also prepared to participate in the
ASEAN summit meeting if his country was admitted as a full ASEAN
member.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, whose entry into ASEAN was postponed after the July
1997 factional fighting, is eager to join the regional group.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN's foreign ministers Friday night held consultations
for more than four hours in Hanoi, but failed to agree on the
admission of Cambodia. Some said they wanted to see further
developments before they give full membership to Cambodia. One key
issue was the establishment of a senate in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen announced on Friday that after his Vietnam trip, he
will go to Beijing on December 17 for an audience with King
Norodom Sihanouk who is on a medical checkup there.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Beijing, he also plans to meet with some
Chinese government leaders.

<HEADLINE> IOC Will Not Rewrite Swimming History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic
Committee decided on Saturday that they would not change the
history of swimming results of past games.
</P>
<P>
Changes were requested by four American swimmers and British
swimmer Sharron Davies, all beaten by former East German
swimmers, but the IOC said that alterations would pose legal
problems.
</P>
<P>
"I would say that you have to rule out the withdrawal and
reallocation of medals," director general Francois Carrard said
after an IOC executive board meeting discussed the requests. "It
would create a lot of new juridical problems."
</P>
<P>
The decision was widely expected since the IOC has always
resisted the idea of applying retroactive legislation and
reopening cases from the distant past. But the requests had
attracted a great deal of publicity, especially in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The east German swimmers did not test positive for drugs at
the time they competed at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
But two trials in Berlin this year have highlighted the doping
abuse which help fuel the state's dominance in women's swimming
from the inaugural world championships in 1973 to the end of the
eighties.
</P>
<P>
The IOC considered other ways of solving the issue but decided
against any sort of recognition, although officials suggested
some athletes could give their medals back.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Formula-1 Grand Prix Cancelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Grand Prix
scheduled for 21 March next year has been cancelled, according to
the sport's governing body the International Automobile
Federation (FIA) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The FIA blamed problems "experienced by the organisers".
</P>
<P>
The Grand Prix, due to be staged at Zhuhai, has been switched
to Buenos Aires in Argentina subject to agreement being reached
between Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone and the Argentine
organisers.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai had been listed on a tentative schedule as the second
race of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
A decision as to whether it can take place towards the end of
the year will be made before the start of the season, but it will
definitely be included in the calendar for 2000, said the FIA.
</P>
<P>
"There remains the possibility that the FIA can secure an
agreement with the teams to run an additional race," the FIA said.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the Chinese Grand Prix will be held in the
autumn of 1999."
</P>
<P>
There were fears earlier this week for the future of the Be
lgian Grand Prix next year after it was reported that tax
officials are investigating the financing of it.
</P>
<P>
However, the race - which many drivers consider the best in
the world - has been included on the calendar for 29 August.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Ecclestone is already facing a tobacco advertising ban and
a European Union antitrust probe.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco sponsorship, which is crucial to Formula One, must end
by 2006.

<HEADLINE> Moravcova and Milosevic Set World Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Martina Moravcova of Slovakia
and Milos Milosevic of Croatia each set a world record on the
second day of the European short-course swimming championships on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Moravcova broke the world record of the women's 100-meter
individual medley event while Croatia's Milosevic beat Britain's
Mark Foster for a world record reward of 20,000 German marks
(12,130 U.S. dollars) in the 50m butterfly final.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic caught and defeated defending champion Foster on the
last stroke into the wall as both dipped below the world
short-course record in the men's 50 meters butterfly final.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic clocked 23.30 seconds to win the gold and Foster
23.34 for silver. Both beating the mark of 23.35 set by Denis
Pankratov of Russia in Paris on February 8 1997.
</P>
<P>
Foster was denied another jackpot by a whisker when he swam a
storming first leg in the concluding 4x50 freestyle relay in
21.55 seconds, a mere 0.05 of a second outside the world mark set
by the great Alexander Popov in Italy nearly five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch quartet of Mark Veens, Johan Kenkhuis, Stefan
Aartsen and Pieter van den Hoogenband went on to win that rarely
swum relay in a world best 1:26.99.
</P>
<P>
Moravcova's day started with a setback as Dutchwoman Inge de
Bruijn snatched her eight-day-old European record in the 100
meters butterfly heats.
</P>
<P>
De Bruijn, who twice lowered the European mark for the 50m
butterfly on Friday, hoisted her European record tally to four in
the morning's heats of the 100m butterfly (57.93) and 50m
freestyle (24.38).
</P>
<P>
But Moravcova turned the tables in the 100m butterfly final,
winning in 57.72, well clear of defending champion Johanna
Sjoberg of Sweden and De Bruijn.
</P>
<P>
But it became even better for Moravcova in the 100m individual
medley final as she raced away with the world record, her 1:00.43
beating the 1:00.60 set by China's Hu Xiaowen in Beijing last
February.
</P>
<P>
Britain's James Hickman collected his second win of the
three-day championships with a magnificent victory over world long
-course champion Marcel Wouda of the Netherlands and world
record-holder Jani Sievinen of Finland in the 200 meters
individual medley. Hickman also won Friday's 200m butterfly.

<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A 2-2 draw against Tottenham
Hotspur made Manchester United lead the English Premier League on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Down to 10 men before half time after Gary Neville was
dismissed for a second bookable offence, United held on for the
point that toppled Aston Villa from the top on goal difference at
the end of a week in which they also qualified for the
quarter-finals of the European Cup.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea missed their chance to go top when Dean Sturridge
grabbed a last-minute equaliser for Derby at Pride Park.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea remain third with 29 points, one behind United and
Villa on 30.
</P>
<P>
Villa can reclaim top spot when they entertain champions
Arsenal at Villa Park on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Southampton remain rooted at the bottom after they lost 1-0 at
Everton, Ibrahim Bakayoko scoring his first goal since joining
from Montpellier in October with a spectacular 35 yard effort.
</P>
<P>
Nottingham Forest remain just one point above Southampton on
11 when they lost 3-1 to Leicester while Middlesbrough moved up
into fourth place with a 1-0 victory over West Ham.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Clinton Arrives in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived here late night Saturday for a historic three-day visit to
Israel and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force One, carrying the Clintons and his entourage,
touched down at the Ben Gurion airport at 11:20 p.m. (2120
GMT). The president then flew to Jerusalem by U.S. helicopter
Marine One which arrived Israel several days ahead.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was accorded a red-carpet welcome upon his arrival at
the airport. Accompanied by President Ezer Weizman, Clinton
inspected the guard of honor of the three Israeli armed services
after the Israeli military band played the national anthems of the
United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Among others present at the airport to greet Clinton were Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and
other cabinet ministers as well as military leaders.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming address, Weizman said that Israel has gone a
long way for peace, but the Mideast peace process now has some
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process must be moved forward and it could not be
stopped on its half way," Weizman stressed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, in his turn, said that Israel wants to revive the
peace talks with the Syrians and Lebanese, and at the same time,
"we also wanted to extend our hands to our Palestinian neighbor to
continue our peace process."
</P>
<P>
But he accused the Palestinians of failing to honor their
obligations under the Wye accords and "reverting to old practice"
in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Israel wants to continue the peace process, but at the same
time Israel also wants the Palestinians to fulfill their parts of
the commitments, stop their anti-Israel incitement and fight
terror, he said.
</P>
<P>
What is remarkable is that calling for all problems to be
solved through negotiations and mutual consent, Netanyahu however
in his speech referred to Jerusalem, whose status is being
contended, as Israel's "eternal capital."
</P>
<P>
In his reply, Clinton tried not to be confrontational. He
stressed U.S. commitment to Israel's security, saying his visit to
Israel is to reaffirm the America's unshakable ties with Israel
and the U.S. commitment for regional peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. understands Israel's security needs, "at
the same time, we believe that for two peoples who are fated to
share this land, peace is not simply an option among many but the
only choice that can avert still more years of bloodshed,
apprehensive and sorrow."
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed the importance of implementing the Wye peace
accord signed in October in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and the palestinian sides now face the challenge
of implementing the agreement, and the agreement has to be
implemented in order to realize the regional peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's trip is part of the implementation of the
Israeli-Palestinian Wye peace accord signed in October in
Washington, and it is aimed at helping push forward the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Clinton is to hold talks with Weizman and Netanyahu
on the peace process and other bilateral issues, and address an
Israeli youth gathering organized specially for him.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was not scheduled to visit or address the knesset,
Israel's parliament. For this reason, the Knesset Speaker Dan
Tichon decided to boycott all official activities organized for
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Another big event during Clinton's current trip is his historic
visit to Gaza, a Palestinian territory along the coast of the
Mediterranean Sea on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He will be the first sitting U.S. president to visit areas
under Palestinian self-rule. During his one-day stay in Gaza,
Clinton will hold talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
address the Palestinian National Council meeting, which will
reaffirm the nullification of the clauses of the Palestinian
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side regarded Clinton's visit to Gaza as a big
political event, saying such a visit is in fact reflecting the
U.S. intention of supporting the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's Gaza visit caused some diplomatic flaps between
Israel and the U.S., and even several Israeli cabinet ministers
had asked Clinton to cancel his Mideast trip and stay home.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, Clinton agreed to go to Gaza by helicopter
instead of his special plane Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will also visit Bethlehem, another Palestinian
administrated city in the West Bank and Israel's historical site
of Masada by the Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
Facing impeachment at home for perjury and obstruction of
justice, the U.S. president will conclude his trip next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton visited Israel in late 1995 to attend the funeral of
late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by
an Israeli extremist opposing the peace-making with the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Ruling Coalition Settles Cabinet's New Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Radu Vasile
Saturday called on ruling coalition leaders, at Victoria
government headquarters, to pursue talks on the cabinet's long
proposed revamp.
</P>
<P>
The Vasile cabinet's revamp project is to be endorsed by the
parliament next week, in response to a letter Prime Minister
Vasile is supposed to send Monday to the parliament's two houses,
asking for a joint sitting due to acknowledge the new cabinet
formula.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet's members along with leaders of the ruling
coalition decided several weeks ago that the new cabinet was to be
reduced to 17 ministerial portfolios and the PM's office.
</P>
<P>
Following the cabinet's revamp, several portfolios would be
changed either into "independent agencies under the cabinet's
direction, or into departments within the government, with new
bodies to be in charge with issuing payment orders, but remaining
under responsibility of certain ministries."
</P>
<P>
Thus, the tourism and the communications ministries are to
become national independent agencies, while the department for
relations with the parliament will be maintained, although its
head will stop being a cabinet member, and so will the state
secretary at the Defense Ministry. The research and the
privatization ministries will turn into the Romanian Development
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The current coalition is mainly composed of the Christian
Democratic National Peasant Party, the Democratic Party, the
National Liberal Party and the Hungarian Democratic Union of
Romania.

UNITED NATIONS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Saturday that he was relieved to hear of the
release of Vincent Cochetel, head of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees office in North Ossetia, Russia.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Counts on Domestic Output, Not Western Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said Saturday that Russia counts on the development of its own
industry rather than loans from the West in tiding over the
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Why should we beg all the time," Primakov said in an interview
with the ORT television.
</P>
<P>
"We must revive the real economy in order to create a sound
foundation and build relations with people on this basis,"
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable sometimes when I hear that the most
important thing now is to strengthen the ruble, even by delaying
pensions and wages in the budget sector for six months.
</P>
<P>
"How can anyone manage the economy in such a way?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his cabinet's task of creating a "socially
oriented economy" rather than one that would benefit only a few.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the government plans to pay back wages within two
to three months, but it will need more time to clear pension
arrears.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Primakov also answered questions on the
country's press freedom and the 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
Chiding some television channels that present events "in a
distorted way," Primakov said he is against censorship, but
welcomes fair criticism.
</P>
<P>
"I am losing heart because events are presented to a large
audience in an absolutely distorted way," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Criticism can be sharp, but it has to be fair," Primakov said.
"It is a must."
</P>
<P>
On the 1999 budget, which was submitted to the State Duma, or
lower house of parliament, Primakov expressed the hope that
lawmakers will approve it before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will "do everything possible to
strengthen the ruble and prevent hyperinflation."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the government is prepared to consider "all
logical proposals" from the legislators.

<HEADLINE> White House Says Impeachment Would Divide Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The White House said
Saturday that if the House of Representatives impeaches President
Bill Clinton, it would divide the country and the government and
"defy the will of the people."
</P>
<P>
White House special counsel Gregory Craig denounced the House
Judiciary Committee's approval on a party-line vote of a fourth
article of impeachment against Clinton in connection with actions
resulting from the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
The full House is expected to vote on the articles Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"While the goal of the partisan majority on the committee is to
impeach the president and remove him from office, the certain
result will be to divide the country, gridlock the government and
defy the will of the people," Craig said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that "huge majorities" of Americans oppose impeachment,
Craig appealed to House members to "approach this grave and solemn
duty with an open heart, with an open mind, and with a full
appreciation of the desires of the American people."
</P>
<P>
In response, Paul McNulty, spokesman for the Republican
majority in the committee, said he was dismayed the White House
had turned to confrontation from the contrite message Clinton gave
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"By returning to the war room politics of partisan attacks, the
White House undermines the sincerity and credibility of the
president's words," he said.
</P>
<P>
Craig said Clinton's representatives have "provided a strong
and convincing defense, a defense based on the facts, based on the
law and based on the Constitution."

<HEADLINE> Vaccine Makes Control of Elm Tree Disease Easier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Elm trees can now be
"vaccinated" against Dutch elm disease, the blight which has wiped
out tens of millions of elms worldwide, the New Scientist magazine
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Martin Hubbes and colleagues, at the University of Toronto,
developed the vaccine by isolating a key protein from a mild
strain of the fungus that infects elm trees.
</P>
<P>
"Because this protein comes from a related fungus, the tree
thinks it's under attack," Hubbes said, "It therefore triggers a
cascade of defense reactions."
</P>
<P>
The researchers administered the vaccine to trees by drilling a
shallow hole four millimeters wide in the outer bark, then placed
a soluble capsule containing the protein into the hole and sealed
it with beeswax or plastic film.
</P>
<P>
They are working out the optimal dosage for different sizes of
tree in trials on elms. So far, the results have been impressive.
</P>
<P>
In one trial on saplings only one of 33 vaccinated trees died
when exposed to the fungus, whereas all the control trees died.
</P>
<P>
Hubbes said that trees would have to be vaccinated each year,
but that the treatment is much simpler to administer and less
damaging than fungicides.

<HEADLINE> Magnet Affects How Cells Divide, Study Finds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Powerful magnets can affect the
way that cells divide, U.S. researchers have found.
</P>
<P>
A team at Brown University in Rhode Island, the United States,
made the discovery by using magnets to levitate frog embryos, the
New Scientist magazine reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After levitating frog embryos using magnetic fields about half
a million times stronger than the Earth's, they found that the
direction of cell division was changed compared to that seen in
normal gravity without excess magnetism.
</P>
<P>
While the finding will make interpreting magnetic microgravity
experiments more difficult, it may also suggest new uses for
magnets in biology, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The team is now looking for precise causes involving long cell
components called microtubulles which, the researchers suspected,
may be forced to orient themselves according to the direction of
magnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
Magnets could be an entirely new tool with which to manipulate
that process, the researchers said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Clinton Arrives in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, December 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived here late night Saturday for a three-day visit to Israel
and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force One, carrying the Clintons and his entourage,
landed at the Ben Gurion airport at 11:20 p.m. (2120 GMT). The
president then flew to Jerusalem by U.S. helicopter Marine One
which arrived Israel several days ago.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was accorded a red-carpet welcome at the airport. Among
those present to greet him were Israeli President Ezer Weizman,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and other senior government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's trip is part of the implementation of the
Israeli-Palestinian Wye peace accord signed in October in
Washington, and it is aimed at helping push forward the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Clinton is to hold talks with Weizman and Netanyahu
on the peace process and other bilateral issues, and address an
Israeli youth gathering organized specially for him.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was not scheduled to visit or address the knesset,
Israel's parliament. For this reason, the Knesset Speaker Dan
Tichon decided to boycott all official activities organized for
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Another big event during Clinton's current trip is his historic
visit to Gaza, a Palestinian territory along the coast of the
Mediterranean Sea on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He will be the first sitting U.S. president to visit areas
under Palestinian self-rule. During his one-day stay in Gaza,
Clinton will hold talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
address the Palestinian National Council meeting, which will
reaffirm the nullification of the clauses of the Palestinian
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>

CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian satellite company NileSat has been
registered at the stock exchange recently with a capital of 525
million Egyptian pounds (154.4 million U.S. dollars), reported the
Cairo-based Al Alam Al Youm newspaper.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The First Arab Investment Fair will open on Sunday in
Addammam, Saudi Arabia. It will be attended by Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Sudan, Syria, Jordan, Tunisia
and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The fair, which involves meetings among officials of the
private and public sectors of the eight countries, is designed to
encourage the Arab and foreign investments and capital flows to
benefit the Arab economic development.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The 61st meeting of the Organization of Arab Exporting
Countries (OAPEC) Ministerial Council opened here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on the world oil price crisis and its
impact on the economies of the Arab states, heavily depending on
oil export revenues.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Trade and Supply Ministry released an instruction
prohibiting selling any imported commodities at fairs or
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
Fairs and exhibitions are designed only to display the
commodities, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development (AFESD) has agreed to extend 112 million
U.S. dollars in loans to Tunisia for an agricultural project in
the African country.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be used to finance a project to upgrade
an agricultural road network, facilitate land transportation and
improve agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
This brings total loans to Tunisia by the AFESD to nearly 1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The 4th international Afro-Asian electric power
conference opened here Saturday with the participation of 80
African and Asian states and some European countries.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting is to deal with regional electric meshing
between African and Asian countries, an action plan for a triple
continental electric meshing in the next century.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) ended its 61st ministerial
meeting here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The day-long meeting endorsed the 1999 budget of 2.447 million
Kuwaiti dinars (8.075 million U.S. dollars) for the Kuwait-based
organization and 1.188 million dinars (3.92 million dollars) for
its judicial body, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers of nine Arab countries reviewed a report on the
Arab energy meeting held in Damascus last May, the progress in
carrying out a data bank scheme and the developments of
environmental protection in the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
They also referred to the Arab Oil Investment Corporation a dry
dock project in Algeria for assessment.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Libyan Secretary for Energy Abdallah
al-Badri, who chaired the session, urged OAPEC members to
intensify efforts to shore up the sluggish oil price in the world
markets.
</P>
<P>
The constant drop in the oil price has seriously damaged the
economies of the Arab oil producers, al-Badri said.
</P>
<P>
The average oil price was 13.50 dollars a barrel in the world
markets, the lowest since 1976. The Arab world has lost 56 billion
dollars in recent years due to the continued fall of the oil
price, according to the Libyan official.
</P>
<P>
Oil or energy ministers of Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria and the United Arab Emirates took part
in the meeting.

Clinton, who left before dawn Saturday for a three-day trip to

wrong," he said. "I would give anything to go back and undo what I
did."
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives is expected to hold a meeting next

the outcome is too close to call.
</P>

WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton,
accompanied by more than a dozen members of Congress, left early
Saturday for the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He planned to meet Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in Jerusalem, address the Israeli people and light a

On Monday, Clinton is to see Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
in Gaza and speak to the Palestine National Council and other
Palestinian groups.
</P>

As specified in the Wye agreement, the council is due to
reaffirm earlier acts by lesser bodies that nullified clauses
demanding Israel's destruction contained in the 1964 covenant
of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Netanyahu is demanding
that it be done by vote of the council's membership.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Clinton will visit the Church of the Nativity and
Manger Square in Bethlehem, on the West Bank, and light a

<HEADLINE> Blue Train Carries 5 African Leaders to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A blue train carrying five
southern African leaders on its inaugural "African Renaissance"
journey arrived in Zimbabwe's second largest city of Bulawayo
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The five were presidents of Mozambique and Botswana, Joaquim
Chissano and Festus Mogae, South Africa's Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki and Prime Ministers of Swaziland and Namibia, Sibusiso
Dlamini and Hage Geingobo, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They were welcomed at the Bulawayo Railway Station by
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and senior government
officials as well as hundreds of residents in the city.
</P>
<P>
The luxurious train, which left Johannesburg Friday and went
through Botswana later, left Bulawayo on Saturday mid-morning
heading for Victoria Falls, a resort town in northwest Zimbabwe
carrying the five leaders from the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
In his welcome address, President Mugabe said the launching of
the blue train was a historic occasion because of the fact that
several SADC heads of state and government were traveling
together in regal style.
</P>
<P>
He said the inaugural journey would firmly cement Zimbabwe's
relationship with the blue train.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the railways have always played a historical role
in the development of economies of SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of all traveling leaders, Chissano said
that the launching of the blue train was an example of an African
renaissance which could be further developed to include other
countries of the region as well.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that people travel from one to another
country in southern Africa by train.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible to inter-connect all the African rails of the
region and even go as far as Cairo to facilitate the bringing of
more tourists in the continent," Chissano said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi here Saturday criticized a U.N.
resolution that disfavors the status of human rights in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the resolution was the product of "unrealistic
decision-making process" at the U.N. and also the result of
"unsavory objectives" of its co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The 53rd U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution on
Thursday, recognizing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as
"a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all
nations."
</P>
<P>
The resolution also criticized the human rights status in some
countries, including Iran.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the increased opposition by countries
to the issuance of such resolutions against Iran is indicative of
Iranian success to make known the realities of the country.
</P>
<P>
Increasing support for Iran also shows the international
community's objections to the political use of human rights
issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran considers itself duty-bound based on the Islamic teachings
to observe and honor human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Iran will not take lessons on the issue from anybody," he
added.

BAGHDAD, December 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. arms inspectors continued
their unannounced and routine inspections to suspected Iraqi
weapons sites Saturday but found no proscribed weapons or
activities, said an Iraqi official.
</P>
<P>
Hussam Mohammed Ameen, head of the Iraqi liaison with the
U.N. arms inspectors said that 11 inspection teams of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency inspected 24 sites Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, UNSCOM spokeswoman in Baghdad
Caroline Cross told reporters Saturday that surprise visits to
suspected Iraqi sites would come to an end on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She said UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler would submit a report
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan next Tuesday on whether Iraq
had kept its promise of full cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Arms inspectors started surprise inspections to Iraqi sites
earlier this week but so far found no banned weapons or activities.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM accused Iraq of blocking arms inspections twice in the
past week, saying they were prevented from entering one of the
ruling Baath Party's regional headquarters and an Iranian
opposition force base.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, Iraq announced unconditional resumption of
full cooperation with U.N. arms inspections that it suspended
three months ago, narrowly escaping a United States-led, punishing
air strike.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The regional summit set for
next Tuesday to seek a peaceful solution to the four-month-old
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been
postponed once again.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian Foreign Ministry confirmed this in a statement
issued Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that the regional summit has been put
off. At first, the Lusaka meeting was fixed for December 8.
</P>
<P>
Although the ministry did not disclose the reason for the
delay, analysts here asserted that the disagreement over the
participation of the anti-government forces fighting to overthrow
the government led by Congolese President Laurent Kabila has
blocked the planned meeting.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has invited to the summit
presidents of the DRC, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, Uganda, Rwanda,
South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Gabon, Mozambique and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have sent troops to fight on the
side of Kabila while Rwanda and Uganda, which helped him seize
power from late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, have been
accused of formenting the Tutsi-led rebellion.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, ahead of the planned summit, South Africa made it
clear that it will not attend the summit unless the rebel force
is allowed to participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said the rebels led
by Ernest Wamba dia Wamba are an important factor in the Congo
crisis and that ignoring them will be a political error.
</P>
<P>
"This is our clear and firm position, that talks without the
participation of the rebels would be useless and a waste of
time," Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
On December 9 and 10, Kabila made unannounced brief visits to
Zambia and Kenya, where he held talks with Chiluba and Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi to have explained his position on the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
During his visits, Kabila reaffirmed his stance that he will
not hold direct talks with the rebels, who rose up with arms to
oust him on August 2 this year.
</P>
<P>
Congolese Ambassador to Kenya Kyungu Wa-ku Mwanza told a new
briefing after Kabila left Nairobi for home that the Congolese
government will pull out of the planned talks if the rebels are
invited.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said they are going to Lusaka with two points.
The first is that there are no rebels and the second is that they
are going to sign a cease-fire on the condition that it is
accompanied by a calendar for the retreat of the Ugandan and
Rwandan forces from Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Until now the rebels, who have reportedly controlled half of
the territory of the third largest African country, have always
been turned back in any peace talks on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Recently, many African countries including those involved in
the Congo war repeatedly called for a withdrawal of foreign
troops from the war-torn country but the withdrawal of foreign
troops has different meanings.
</P>
<P>
The countries involved in the war are only demanding their
rival troops pull out while making excuses for a continued stay
of their own troops in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
If the countries concerned don't soften their hard stances
even if the Lusaka summit is held as planned, the hope of a
breakthrough will remain very slim, said the analysts.

<HEADLINE> EU Makes Compromise With S. Africa in Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A free trade agreement
between South Africa and the European Union (EU) is a step closer
as the EU made a landmark compromise over wines Saturday, South
African television SABC reported.
</P>
<P>
The EU has agreed to allow South Africa to continue using the
names "port" and "sherry" (names for wines) in domestic and
regional markets for 20 years pending a review.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will have to stop using the labels in its exports
to European countries.
</P>
<P>
South African wine producers said the sales of wines labeled
"port" and "sherry" were worth 750 million Rand (125 million U.S.
Dollars) a year, with 13 percent of which coming from exports.
</P>
<P>
Mandela wrote to EU leaders last week, asking for a
compromise. He said South Africa would stop using the names
"port" and "sherry" in exports, but should be allowed to market
fortified wines at home and in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, EU leaders had promised Mandela the
conclusion of a trade agreement by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, if reached, would phase out duties on 90
percent of bilateral trade between South Africa and the EU, which
is worth 120 billion Rand (20 billion Dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The trade talks, which have dragged on for four years,
suffered a severe setback in September when the EU raised the
question of "port" and "sherry".
</P>
<P>
The EU insisted that only Spain and Portugal could produce
"sherry" and "port" respectively and demanded South Africa stop
using the names completely.
</P>
<P>
But South Africa argued that these names had been used for
hundreds of years in the country. It backed down at the
beginning of November, agreeing to stop using the names on the
export market in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit in Vienna next week is expected to have a final
say on the agreement.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Chairman Calls for Further Oil Output Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Youcef Yousfi here Saturday
called for a further oil production cut of 1.5 million barrels per
day (bpd) to shore up the sluggish oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Yousfi, who is Algerian minister of energy and mines, made the
call on the sidelines of the day-long 61st ministerial session of
the Kuwait-based Arab Organization of t a further
production cutback, which he termed as "necessary in the light of
mounting oil reserves and the glut" in ts a day by both OPEC
and non-OPEC states," he said.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices have dipped below 12 U.S. dollars a barrel in
the world market, which is the lowest since 1976. The economy of
the oil-producing countries have been hit heavily.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC decided last June to slash 2.6 million bpd from its
production ceiling of 27.5 million bpd in a bid to prop up the oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
But the reduction has failed to stop the oil price free fall.
Oil experts maintain that the balance of oil supply and demand
will not be restored until oil-producing countries cut back their
production by a further production cut. "If
warranted, (the meeting would be held) even before next March's
scheduled ministerial conference," he said.
</P>
<P>
He denied any differences among the OPEC members over output
reduction.
</P>
<P>
But reports have said that some countries, including Saudi
Arabia, oppose further reduction but favor an extension of current
cut as a way out.
</P>
<P>
Yousfi urged the 11 OPEC members to respect the current
production ceiling of 24.9 million bpd, saying that Arab
oil-producing countries have been committed to their reduction
quota.
