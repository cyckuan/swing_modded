<HEADLINE> Thailand's Bad Loans Dip in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Non-performing loans (NPLs) in
the Thai
financial system totaled 2.07 trillion baht (55.09 billion U.S.
dollars) in December, or 38.54 percent of the total lending,
according to a press release of the Government House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amount represents a decline of 258 billion baht (686.7
million dollars), or 11.08 percent, from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The press release quoted a report of the Bank of Thailand as
saying debt restructuring, lower interest rates and improved
economic prospects helped reduce the level of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
NPLs in the Thai financial sector peaked at 2.73 trillion baht
(72.66 billion dollars), or 47 percent of the total loans, in May.
</P>
<P>
In December NPLs at private commercial banks dropped to 886.89
billion baht (2.36 billion dollars), or 30.65 percent of the total
lending, from 1.1 trillion baht (29.27 billion dollars), or 36.37
percent in November.
</P>
<P>
State banks had bad loans of 1.03 billion baht (27.41 million
dollars), or 61.58 percent of the total loans in December while
foreign banks had bad loans of 61 billion baht (1.62 billion
dollars) or 9.81 percent of their total lending.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.072 trillion baht (28.53 billion dollars) in loans had
been restructured for 1999. In December alone, 162 billion baht (4.
31 billion dollars) loans were restructured, an increase of 17.82
from the month before.

<HEADLINE> Britain Wants Angolan Rebel Leader to Go Into Exile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign
Affairs Minister for Africa Peter Hain said here on Tuesday that
Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi should go into exile to
accelerate the end of the Angolan conflict.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Savimbi, leader of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in fighting against
the Angolan government, should go to another country through a
safe passage.
</P>
<P>
Hain arrived in South Africa on Saturday to exchange views with
 its officials on the 25-year Angolan civil war.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he believed Savimbi should be offered immunity from
prosecution, Hain said: "It is a matter for other African
governments, but if the price of settling this devastating war
which has gone on for decades was to reach an agreement with
Savimbi where he had a future outside Angola ... all sorts of
things become possible."
</P>
<P>
While the UNITA movement would have to participate in
negotiations to ensure lasting peace, Savimbi is unlikely to be
part of a long-term peace settlement in Angola and should be
forced into exile, Hain stressed.
</P>
<P>
Although many people in the international community are
surprised at the success of the Angolan government's latest
offensive against UNITA, a guerrilla war is difficult to win, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the network of foreign suppliers supporting UNITA in
violation of the United Nations sanctions has to be closed and
UNITA's foreign assets have to be frozen.
</P>
<P>
"If you can starve Savimbi out of his supplies, you could
create the circumstances to force him into exile," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hain gave South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz
Pahad the names of three South Africans who were part of a strong
network allegedly involved in supplying equipment to Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The British government froze five of Savimbi's British bank
accounts last November.
</P>
<P>
During a summit in Mauritius in 1998, the Southern African
Development Community issued a resolution declaring Savimbi a war
criminal.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Hain earlier on Tuesday, former South
African President Nelson Mandela expressed support for efforts to
close down UNITA' s South African support network.
</P>
<P>
"We view seriously the fact that some South Africans are
helping him," Mandela said.

<P>
MAPUTO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Afonso Dhlakama, leader of
Mozambique's main opposition party Renamo (Mozambican National
Resistance), has threatened to proclaim a Renamo government later
this month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern Province of Cabo Delgado, Dhlakama
once again demanded a recount of the votes from the December 3-5
elections, Radio Mozambique reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If there could be no recount, he said, then fresh elections
should be held after the rainy season in April or May.
</P>
<P>
If the ruling Frelimo (Mozambique Liberation Fronte) refused
these demands, then Renamo would go ahead and set up its own
government in those parts of the country where it is the majority
party, he said.

<HEADLINE> PNA Criticizes Israel's Redeployment Maps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) on Wednesday criticized the Israeli government for endorsing
the maps of the third redeployment without consulting the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security cabinet has unilaterally endorsed the maps
without recourse to the PNA, said Nabil Abo-Rudainah, an advisor to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official position on the issue will be declared
after receiving an official notice from Israel, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning the Israeli security cabinet approved the
maps of redeployment in 6.1 percent of the West Bank territories,
mainly near the two towns of Hebron and Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Six Israeli cabinet members approved the maps, and two opposed
with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
The security cabinet decided that the third redeployment,
already delayed for about two weeks, should take place before
February 10, 20 days behind the set time in Sharm el Sheikh
memorandum the two sides signed in September.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian orange exporters decided to cut down their
exports to Saudi Arabia by 10 percent after the prices nose-dived
by more than 40 U.S. dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
The decision led to the retreat of orange exports to 70,000 tons
in the season from October 1999 to January 2000, from 78,000 tons
in the previous season.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was made as a result of the increase in orange
supply on the Saudi market due to large number of individual
contracts. The supply surge has cut the price for a ton of navel
orange from 250 dollars to 210 dollars. The prices of other types
of orange went down from 200 dollars to 160 dollars.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The number of joint ventures among members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) has hit 402 involving total investments
of 19.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates is a forerunner with 124 joint
ventures, followed by Saudi Arabia 108, Oman 59, Qatar 54, Bahrain
52 and Kuwait 4 joint ventures, according to figures from the
Riyadh-based GCC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi-French Bank (SFB) saw its profits jump by 13
percent in 1999 to 521 million riyals (138.9 million U.S. dollars)
from 460 million riyals (122.7 million dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bank's volume of assets went up by 6.6 percent to reach 32.5
billion riyals (8.7 billion dollars), said the bank.
</P>
<P>
The volume of investment portfolio rose by 34 percent to hit 13.
2 billion riyals (3.52 billion dollars) and the revenues of banking
services increased by 10 percent while foreign exchange went up by
19 percent.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Morocco spent 790 million U.S. dollars on oil imports
between January and November last year, up by 35.4 percent from 510
million dollars during the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The imports of refractories and energy products in the same
period accounted for 12 percent of the total imports of the
country, compared with 9 percent of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- The European Union (EU) has set aside 107 million
euros (109.9 million U.S. dollars) to help Syria implement 11
projects in the areas of vocational training and economic
development, said EU Ambassador to Syria Mark Burny.
</P>
<P>
However, the projects are still waiting to be approved by the
Syrian government, he said.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Iraqi Minister of Trade Mohammad Mehdi Salah said that
Jordan ranks the fourth among the countries that signed contracts
with Iraq under the U.N. oil-for-food program after France, Russia
and China.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's exports volume to Iraq under the six-phase of the
humanitarian program stood at 842.2 million U.S. dollars. The
figure does not cover the value of exports under the annually
renewable bilateral trade protocol or the competitive sales of the
Jordanian industrial private sector in Iraq, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Salah put the total value of Jordanian exports to his country at
750 million U.S. dollars so far.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to raise bilateral trade volume under
the renewable protocol to 300 million dollars annually from 200
million dollars in 1999 provided that the commodity quota account
for 50 million dollars and the remaining 250 million dollars be set
aside for services.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Lift British Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Berlin Wednesday gave green
light to British beef import, three years after its ban took
effect.
</P>
<P>
The red-green cabinet has passed a BSE report of the Health
Ministry and the ban will be lifted soon, the Health Minister
Andrea Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
But under the demand of Germany's upper parliamentary chamber,
the Bundesrat, imported British beef must be attached with a
special label.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry's regulation, British beef and beef
products should be sold in Germany only after they have been
specially marked with "XEL". The restaurant customers also should
be informed when they are served with cooked British beef.
</P>
<P>
The regulation is expected to face strong opposition of
Germany's federal states. Ministers of North Rhine-Westphalia
state and Hesse state have vowed to keep British beef outside.
</P>
<P>
The European Union banned British beef imports in year 1996,
after an outbreak of BSE, or mad cow disease. The EU ban was
lifted last year, but Germany and France had still kept their
national bans.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: U.S. Federal Reserve Raises Interest Rate By a Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
raised a key interest rate Wednesday by a quarter in an effort to
slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a closed-door meeting of the
Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate
policies.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said it was increasing its target for the federal funds
rate, the interest that banks charge each other on overnight loan,
to 5.75 percent from 5.50 percent. That is the fourth increase
since last June.
</P>
<P>
It also raised its mostly symbolic discount rate, the interest
that the Fed charges to make direct loans to banks by a quarter
point to 5.25 percent from 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a statement explaining its decision, the Fed said it
continued to be worried that the rapidly growing economy "could
foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's
record economic expansion."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Fuel Supply to Last for 12 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
discharged some more fuel from the holding vessel at Beira,
Mozambique to supply the country for another 12 days, a senior
Zimbabwean official said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The discharge of about 23 million litres of diesel, 10 million
litres of petrol and two million litres of Jet Al would add to at
least 12 days supply of the products at the daily normal
consumption rates, said Christian Katsande, secretary of the
Transport and Energy Ministry, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has made some progress in seeking funds
from Belgium, Libya, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
other countries to procure fuel.
</P>
<P>
"This should bring about considerable relief and allow the
country to bring stock levels back to normal," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is also considering to re-establish a
Stabilization Fund for the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that these efforts, together with the cooperation
of everyone involved including the general public, should result
in the fuel supply getting back to normal soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Katsande, the diesel shortage in the country arose
from an inadequate supply of foreign currency on the market and
constraints in the distribution system.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean fuel shortage started in December last year and the
situation has reached critical levels with several industries
grinding to a halt. Long queues eager to buy fuel can be seen
everywhere in most of the towns.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of foreign exchange is expected to return to
normal in April when the tobacco selling season begins.

Israelis, said secretary general of Palestinian presidential office
Al-Tayb Abdul-Rehim here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after the session of the Central Council of
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that the talks made no
progress and the Israeli position was still unclear so far.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis have not received specific decisions in this regard
from their political leaders, said Abdul-Rehim.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli side demanded that a framework agreement on the
final status should be reached when signing the Sharm el Sheikh
memo but they disregarded this issue later on. This shows that
Israel is not serious in the talks that should be in line with the
peace process principles and the U.N. Security Council Resolution
242," he added.
</P>
<P>
The resolution provides that Israel should withdraw to the
borders of June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians offered specific and clear suggestions rather
than papers on the final status to settle the long-standing
conflict and serve the historic interests," he noted, pointing out
that suggestions were based on the sincere and accurate
implementation of the Resolution 242.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
will meet U.S. coordinator of the Middle East peace process Dennis
Ross later Wednesday to discuss ways of pushing forward the current
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross is scheduled to take part in the final status talks after
meeting Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Erez
checkpoint on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PLO Central Council will resume this evening discussion on
the final status talks and date for declaring a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the council Salim Za'noun said 110 out of 129 council
members attended the session which would end on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Calls for Grasping Chances for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said on Wednesday that Turkey should seize the opportunities
which the economic globalization offers to develop its national
economy, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the appeal to parliament members from his Democratic
Left Party (DSP) while assessing the just-concluded World Economic
Forum meetings at Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions during the meetings mostly revolved around the
effects of globalization on economy, politics and social issues,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that globalization is an irreversible trend which
results from technological developments created by human
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that "Globalization, while rapidly increasing
the total level of prosperity in the world, is also worsening the
injustice in income distribution."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister brought to the forum a total of 58 projects
in a bid to woo foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey was the focus of interest at the first Davos
meeting of the new millennium and the European Union countries
consulted Turkey on development in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that major businesses and financial institutions have
turned their eyes on Turkey. "If Turkey can make use of this
growing interest and technological opportunities, it can become a
leading country in the 21st century," he stated.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Meets Top Saudi Military Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein Wednesday met with Chief of Staff of Saudi armed forces
Saleh Bin Ali al-Mahia to discuss defense cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks touched upon ways of promoting bilateral ties,
especially in the military fields, including training and exchange
of military expertise, Jordan's official news agency Petra
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch is also the supreme commander of the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh on Friday, Mahia said his country was ready to cooperate
with Jordan and other Arab countries in defense and its related
fields.
</P>
<P>
Mahia is the highest-ranking Saudi military official to visit
the kingdom since the 1990 Gulf Crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. The trip marked a step forward in the warming up of
relations between the two countries, which had been severely
damaged by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had been isolated by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Arab
countries for its sympathy with Baghdad in the early 1990s. Saudi
Arabia, once the largest donor country to Jordan, suspended its
financial aid and oil supplies to the kingdom following the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ice in relations thawed after Abdullah assumed the throne
last February following the death of his father, King Hussein Ibn
Talal, of cancer.
</P>
<P>
However, it takes time to restore ties to their original levels
prior to the Gulf Crisis, as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have not
opened their lucrative markets to the Jordanian labor force.
</P>
<P>
Currently Jordan has to strike a delicate diplomatic balance
between Iraq and Iraq's Arab foes - Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, as
Jordan depends on Iraq as its sole supplier of crude oil and oil
products.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Policy on Nuclear Weapons Unchanged: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- There has been no change in
Israel government's policy on nuclear weapons, Minister in Prime
Minister's Office Haim Ramon said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the government when the Knesset plenum held its
first ever open debate on the question, Ramon declared that Israel
will not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons into the
Middle East region, according to Israeli Channel Three live
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Ramon added that Israel supports in principle non-proliferation
of nuclear weapons and a Middle East environment free of nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Israel believes the current Nuclear Non-
proliferation Treaty is not the proper answer to the question in
the region, which was proved by the cases of Iran and Iraq, its
bitterest foes.
</P>
<P>
Ramon charged Issam Mahoul, an Arab legislator who initiated
Wednesday's unprecedented Knesset debate, with hurting Israel's
interests.
</P>
<P>
Mahoul, a member of the left-wing Hadash party, had appealed to
the Supreme Court to force the discussion. Rather than letting the
court rule, Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg changed his reluctance and
allowed the debate to go forth.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at Wednesday's 45-minute session, Mahoul revealed
that Israel has 200 to 300 nuclear warheads. He accused Israeli
government of threatening its own citizens by developing nuclear
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Mahoul's remarks, nearly two dozen Knesset members from
the right-wing Likud and Shas party walked out of the plenum in
protest, claiming that they were opposed to the open discussion of
Israel's top secrets.
</P>
<P>
The debate itself also quickly turned into a shouting match
between Arab and Jewish legislators, with five Arab lawmakers
expelled for heckling.
</P>
<P>
Although it reportedly has the world's sixth-largest nuclear
arsenal, Israel traditionally adopted a strategy of ambiguity on
the issue, with neither acknowledgment nor denial.
</P>
<P>
However, the strategy was undergoing a gradual change in recent
years, with government officials inching closer and closer toward
placing the nuclear issue back on public agenda.
</P>
<P>
Last November, local daily Yediot Aharonot published excerpts
from transcripts of the trial of "atom spy" Mordechai Vanunu, who
is serving an 18-year prison term for revealing information on the
country's nuclear capabilities to the British newspaper, The Sunday
Times.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Judiciary Chief Urges Judicial Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Judiciary Chief Ayatollah
Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi on Wednesday called for drastic changes
in the country's judicial system to resolve problems in the areas
of laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
"Judicial development (reform) is an inevitable requisite for
administration of justice and establishment of security in the
Islamic community," Shahroudi told a nationwide meeting of judicial
officials.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the main objectives of reforms are administration
of justice, protection of and support for legitimate freedom,
insurance of all general and private rights, and crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
"Strength and independence of the judicial system is an
undeniable necessity in a bid to bring about drastic changes in
structure of the judiciary," the Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shahroudi underlined that strength does not mean setting tough
rules, but rulings should be issued based on the law and Islamic
rules without any other influence.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian judicial system is in need of judges to
help speed up the development of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The official also called for extensive and serious cooperation
between judicial experts at seminaries and universities to solve
problems facing the country's judicial system.

<HEADLINE> Britain Committed to Kuwaiti, Regional Stability: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Defense
Secretary Geoffrey Hoon reaffirmed here Wednesday his country's
support to Kuwait, saying London remains committed to stability of
Kuwait and the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Hoon, who arrived here Tuesday on his first visit to Kuwait
since his appointment last year, made the remark at a press
conference after meeting with top Kuwaiti officials.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kuwaiti people can count on the support of
Britain in the event of any further threat from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
British soldiers joined in the multi-national force in the 1991
Gulf war that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. In December 1998,
British warplanes also took part in the U.S.-led massive air
strikes against Iraqi targets for what they claimed Iraqi non-
compliance in U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Hoon urged Iraq to accept the newly-adopted U.N. Resolution 1284
in order for Baghdad to return to the international community.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council passed the British-proposed resolution
late last year, which favors a lifting of international sanctions
on Iraq on condition that Baghdad allows the return of the U.N.
weapons inspection mission and displays verifiable cooperation with
the weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The British defense chief met earlier with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh
Jaber, Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad, Foreign
Minister Sheikh Sabah, and held talks with his Kuwaiti counterpart
Sheikh Salem.
</P>
<P>
On the meetings, he said the two sides discussed a wide range of
issues of mutual interest, including means of cementing bilateral
military cooperation between Kuwait and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Britain has been sharing the desire with Kuwait to strengthen
bilateral cooperation in all fields, he said. Kuwait signed a
defense cooperation agreement with Britain following the end of the
Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Hoon also visited Kuwait's Ali Al-Salem Air
Base, where British air force troops and about a dozen British
Tornado jet fighters are based. His visit was scheduled to last for
two days.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Urges Unity for Parliamentary Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Wednesday called for unity and solidarity among
various political factions to create tranquil atmosphere for the
coming parliamentary elections on February 18.
</P>
<P>
"The people's aspirations and wishes will be realized only
through solidarity and unity," Khamenei told a group of people who
visited him on the occasion of the 21st anniversary of the 1979
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
He termed the prevalence of calm and tranquility in the country
as a prerequisite for holding the elections and called for a "
massive and enthusiastic" turnout of eligible voters in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader also called on the moderate Interior Ministry
to abide by the law and prevent betrayal of the people's trusts and
votes and the conservative Guardians Council to refrain "ill-
wishers" from being elected, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Iranian rival political parties have kicked off their election
campaigns with white-hot quarrels against each other aiming at
grasping more seats in the country's powerful legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Factional struggles reached the peak in recent weeks as a sharp
split erupted inside the moderate coalition between the leftists
who support the reformist President Mohammad Khatami and the
central-rightists who are followers of former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The central-rightists led by the Party of Constructive
Executives of Iran (PCEI) strongly support Rafsanjani in his
efforts to win the parliamentary poll, which is believed to create
a new power balance in the country.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who had served as the Majlis (parliament) speaker
for 10 years before he was elected president in 1989, is widely
believed to be the next Majlis Speaker if he wins a seat in the
parliament. However, the leftists, who were isolated during
Rafsanjani's presidency, considered his nomination as a hindrance
for Khatami's reform course because of his close links with the
conservatives, particularly his relations with Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Resalat said on Wednesday that the crack might
encourage the leftists to form a new coalition by excluding the
central-rightist groups.
</P>
<P>
The powerful conservatives, who dominate most of the country's
important state organs and had ever put grave pressures on
Rafsanjani's government, lined up in recent weeks behind Rafsanjani
by blaming the leftists as "extremists."
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that the chaotic factional struggles
might disappoint the people who hope the new parliament will help
President Khatami push forward his reform programs.
</P>
<P>
The result of the elections will be unpredictable with the
spiraling quarrels and possible emergence of new coalitions, they
said.

<P>
TEHRAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Wednesday dismissed as "baseless" the
allegations made by some Japanese media that an Iranian businessman
was arrested in Japan for purchase of double-purpose lenses.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that all Iranian companies have the legal rights to
do business under international rules and regulations.

<P>
He said that purchases made from abroad including a limited
number of lenses were not an exception to this rule, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Japanese press reports claimed that the Japanese police
have issued arrest warrant for an Iranian businessman who has
allegedly been involved in sending double-purpose lenses to Iran in
cooperation with two Japanese nationals.
</P>
<P>
Such allegations were made just to mar the expansion of Tehran-
Tokyo relations, said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Decrease Contacts With Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Belgium said on Wednesday that
it had decided to decrease bilateral contacts with Austria that is
to incorporate the far-right Freedom Party into the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel said that the decision
was made in that his country deemed it "unacceptable" to have
extreme rightists in the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable to all democracies and to all convinced
European citizens," said the foreign minister who added that it
would be shocking to see any government incorporating a party that
champions the ideas of xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
All the European Union member states excluding Austria
threatened on Monday to isolate Austria politically should the
country take the far-rights in the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The conservative People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party
already reached agreement on Tuesday on the formation of a
coalition government which, however, still needs the approval of
Austrian President Thomas Klestil who is scheduled to give his say
later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian foreign minister earlier described chief of the
Freedom Party Joerg Haider as a dangerous man. He said that
Europe had to know if Joerg Haider got a place in the coalition,
the extreme rightists would cease to be something unusual in the
European political scene.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Cem's Statements on Solution to Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday criticized the
remarks by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem concerning the
resolution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cem reportedly said that there could be no resolution of the
Cyprus problem without a recognition of the northern Cyprus-led by
Rauf Denktash as a separate state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that such statements not only did not
facilitate the efforts of the international community to resolve
the Cyprus issue but undermine them.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the statements should not stand as a
hindrance to efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of failed coup seeking union with Athens
</P>
<P>
Northern Cyprus was illegally declared in 1983, and has been
only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash demands that northern
Cyprus be recognized internationally as a prelude to reunification
in the form of a two-state confederation, but The Cyprus Republic-
led by Glafcos Clerides and Greece maintain that a federal
solution to the Cyprus issue is the only basis for discussion in
line with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Reppas' comments came just a day before Cem begins his official
three-day visit to Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cem will hold talks with Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos,
Prime Minister Costas Simitis and sign with his Greek counterpart,
George Papandreou, five agreements for bilateral cooperation on
science and technology, shipping, customs, education and economy.
</P>
<P>
It seems that no breakthrough will be made during Cem's visit
here because Papandreou said Wednesday that he expects no more
than the signing of low policy agreements from Cem's visit.

BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The long-peddled European
Security and Defence Identity (ESDI) is to show its teeth as the
first Western European Union-led joint exercise was scheduled for
mid February.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, codenamed CMX/CRISEX 2000, will be held in
conjunction with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from
February 17 to 23 to mimic a peace support mission.
</P>
<P>
It will be conducted in both the WEU and NATO headquarters, in
NATO strategic commands as well as in the capitals of the 30 WEU
and NATO member countries. But no troops will be actually
deployed.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official said on Wednesday that the exercise was
designed to rehearse WEU-led crisis management capability so as to
see what the European defence arm needs in dealing with real-life
crises in future and how to improve its capability.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis will be placed on logistical and financial
coordination in the early stage of development of a crisis and on
crisis consultation between the institutions in the coming
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated in 1996, the ESDI got a boost when France and
Britain jointly demanded that the pace of ESDI development be
quickened.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Rebels Left 500 Bodies in Grozny in Last Two Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops killed up
to 500 rebels in the past two days of fighting for Chechen capital
of Grozny and stopped several attempts by militants to tear open
the federal trap, said the Russian General Staff Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels incurred these heavy losses after a large group of
them was surrounded under an overpass and caught in a crossfire by
the federal troops, said Colonel-General Valery Manilov, deputy
chief of the General Staff.
</P>
<P>
Manilov attributed the imbalance in the losses suffered by the
two sides to the Russian troops' "having full initiative in their
hands."
</P>
<P>
However, Chechen rebels are still struggling to break away from
Grozny by all means, said Colonel-General Viktor Kazantsev,
Commander of the Russian Combined Grouping in the North Caucasus,
Wednesday, cited by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
A rebel unit up to 150 made a strong escape attempt Tuesday
night. They ran into a minefield on the southern outskirts of
Grozny and about 70 of them were killed. "The remaining rebels are
staying in the area of Alkhan-kala and will be destroyed,"
Kazantsev said. The police are combing that district, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are around 2,000 rebels in Grozny, the General said. The
figure was 7,000- 10,000 at the beginning of the anti-terrorist
campaign, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chechen capital would be free from rebels in coming
few days since the federal army has controlled all strategic sites
in the city.

<HEADLINE> EU Starts Final Publicity Campaign on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union started on
Wednesday the last stage of the single currency publicity campaign
against the backdrop of the euro plummeting against the U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the European Commission, the executive
body of the 15-nation European Union, called for a substantial and
concentrated campaign for the final phase of the launch of the
single currency before the changeover to the money system.
</P>
<P>
The two-year campaign up to January 2002 will train three
particular target groups of small and medium-sized enterprises,the
general public and non-participant countries.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the single currency on January 1, 1999, was
hailed as a total success. Banks, debt, share and foreign
exchange markets all changed over to the euro in an orderly and
well-prepared manner, the statement claimed.
</P>
<P>
The euro immediately established itself as one of the world's
leading currencies with euro-denominated bond issues matching
those in dollars, it added.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Solbes, European commissioner in charge of financial and
monetary affairs, proposed to the commission to update the
priorities and strategy of the information campaign and to
encourage the introduction of close monitoring arrangements in
order to ensure a successful changeover to the euro.
</P>
<P>
As from January 1, 2002, banks will only issue euro notes and
coins and the bulk of cash transactions will be made in euro by
the beginning of March 2002 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, 11 European Union countries have joined the
single currency mechanism. They include Germany, France, Italy,
Belgium Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria,
Ireland and Finland.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New-Home Sales Set Record in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. new-home sales rose to
an all-time high in 1999, helped by a strong 4.5 percent gain in
December, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In December, because of better-than-normal weather, people
purchased new single-family homes at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 900,000, the Department reported.
</P>
<P>
The 4.5 percent increase in the month, bigger than many
analysts predicted, followed a 6.3 percent decline posted in
November.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1999, new-home sales jumped 2 percent to a record
904,000. That surpassed the previous record of 886,000 set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Existing-home sales tracked by the National Association of
Realtors also set a record in 1999 of 5.2 million despite the
upswing in mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
Plentiful jobs, tame inflation, rising incomes and stock market
gains fueled the buying mood in the year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Demand for homes remained brisk last year even as interest
rates were on an upswing. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate
mortgage was 7.9 percent in December, up from 6.7 percent a year
earlier. Last week, rates on the 30-year mortgage stood at 8.25
percent.
</P>
<P>
Home sales grew in all parts of the country in December. the
Northeast posted the biggest gain with sales rising a whopping 93
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 104,000.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home was 160,900 dollars in December,
down 5.35 percent from November's price of 170,000 dollars. For
the year, however, the median home price rose 4.78 percent from
1998 to a record 159,800 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Strongly Opposes U.S. Anti-China Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A handful of American politicians, who are holding Cold War
mentality, have pushed the House to pass the act in an attempt to
provide a legal basis for the buildup and expansion of military
contacts and exchanges between the United States and Taiwan, and
for the sales of advanced weapons and technologies to Taiwan," Li
said when meeting with some representatives of the U.S. House and
heads of large enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"This is a dangerous move, not representing the aspirations
and interests of the American people," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On February 1, the U.S. House disregarded the repeated solemn
representations made by China, and passed the so-called Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act.
</P>
<P>
The anti-China act passed by the U.S. House is "a complete
violation of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, a serious
encroachment on China's sovereignty, a gross interference in China
's internal affairs, and an attempt to make 'two Chinas', or 'one
China and one Taiwan'," Li said.
</P>
<P>
If this act becomes law, Li said, it will undermine the cross-
strait relations, infringe upon the peace and stability of the
Asia-Pacific region and bring serious damage to Sino-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador strongly demanded that the U.S.
government take an immediate action to prevent the anti-China act
from becoming law.

<HEADLINE> EU to Continue Participation in KEDO Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
recommended on Wednesday to the European Council of ministers that
the 15-nation union continue to participate in the nuclear program
in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been participating in the program for
the past five years up till this year, contributing a total of 75
million euro (73.2 million U.S. dollars) toward the program run by
the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO).
</P>
<P>
But the union still has to negotiate with its KEDO partners
from the United States, Japan and South Korea to decide on the
future role of the union and the level of its financial
contribution after the council approves the continuation.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, believed that the union's participation in the KEDO program
will contribute toward the stability and security in the Korean
Peninsula and the Asian region as well.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, the United States, Japan and South Korea
have been providing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with
interim energy supplies and two light-water reactors in return for
the country's freeze and ultimate dismantle of its existing
nuclear facilities and its remaining a party to the Treaty on Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
</P>
<P>
The two reactors are budgeted to cost 4.6 billion U.S. dollars
with the bulk of finance coming from Japan and South Korea while
the finance for interim energy supplies come mainly from the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Promises Incentives For Greener Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema said Wednesday that more needed to be done to ensure that
Italy's economic recovery did not aggravate the country's
environmental problems, and pledged incentives to encourage
greener ways of production.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the presentation of the Environment Ministry's
report on its 1999 activities and spending, D'Alema said that "we
are in the middle of economic recovery and this will have a big
impact on the infrastructure of the country and its transport
system. But we are poorly prepared, with the risk that the
recovery will affect the environment."
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth will be a test of our environmental policies.
We must avoid a negative impact on the environment and growth must
be of a quality kind, quality in terms of the environment, the
land, the country and its products," D'Alema continued.
</P>
<P>
He said that fiscal and economic incentives could encourage
smaller firms to turn to more environmentally-friendly systems of
production, adding that "the measures we adopt cannot be of a
punitive kind."
</P>
<P>
He said that protecting Italy's countryside and heritage, and
improving the nation's hydrogeological situation would form the
cornerstones of future environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
But D'Alema also warned that Italy still lagged behind in the
transport sector, with too much reliance on cars for getting
around instead of public transport systems.
</P>
<P>
Italy is working on measures aimed at encouraging motorists to
leave their cars in the garage and improving urban air quality,
with some 120 cities set to join an initiative whereby cars will
be banned from city centers for one Sunday every month.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, Italy has failed to respect a European
ban on leaded petrol, which was supposed to become effective in
all European Union states at the beginning of last month and would
significantly reduce pollution levels.
</P>
<P>
Italy, Greece and Spain were all granted an extra two years to
get rid of the fuel, and it is estimated that Italy has 15.2
million cars currently running on leaded petrol.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Index Rise In December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. leading economic
index rose 0.4 percent in December, after a strong 0.3 percent
rise in November, indicating that the nation's economic expansion
will continue to set record, The Conference Board said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a prominent research group, said in a
survey that the Composite Index of Leading Economic Indicators
rose to 108.7 in December from 108.3 in November. The index is a
barometer for U.S. economic activity in the next three to six
months.
</P>
<P>
The survey said during the six-month span through December, the
leading index rose 0.9 percent, and seven of the ten components
advance, with one component holding steady.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the ten indicators that make up the leading index rose
in December, the survey said, adding that the most significant
increases are money supply, interest rate spread, manufacturers'
new orders of nondefense capital goods, stock prices, and
manufacturers' new orders of consumer goods and materials. One
indicator, measuring average workweek in manufacturing, showed no
change.
</P>
<P>
"The strong performance at the end of 1999 is consistent with
the expansion's power, which will deliver continued strong
economic conditions in the first half of 2000," said Conference
Board Economist Ken Goldstein. "There remain some risks,
especially as the Federal Reserve Board is poised to raise rates
again , but this expansion will very likely set a new record
monthly through at least mid-year, if not year-end."
</P>
<P>
The United States celebrated Tuesday its longest economic
expansion in history, that has lasted 107 months as of February 2,
beating the old mark of 106 months set during the 1960s.

<HEADLINE> Fischer: Berlin Worries About Austrian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The speculation that Austria's
right-wing Freedom Party and its leader Jorg Haider may
participate in next government has caused the worry of Berlin and
the European Union, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The program of the FP is hostile to foreigners and prettifies
the Nazi past," said Fischer in Berlin, adding, "I will be
worrying about the process of European integration, if the party
is really included in new Austrian government."
</P>
<P>
Fischer said he "fully supported" the European Commission's
declaration to Austria, saying, "We have made it clear that we are
deeply concerned with Austria. It is the duty of EU."
</P>
<P>
The European Commission passed a statement earlier this week,
saying Austria will be isolated politically if FP and Haider enter
its government.
</P>
<P>
Fischer declined to project how Germany would deal with an
Austrian cabinet with Haider, but vowing, "the (German) federal
government has by no way any relationship with Haider now, nor
will it have any such plan in future."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this day, a key aide to German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder indicated the EU would exclude Austria from its
important decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
Michael Steiner, Schroeder's advisor for foreign and security
policy, told the ARD television that the EU would not discuss
important issues with Haider and his FP.

<HEADLINE> Putin, Albright Discuss Bilateral Ties, Chechnya, Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin and U.S. State Secretary Madeleine Albright
discussed bilateral ties, Chechen conflict and disarmament issue
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Russia and the United States is of a"
global character" and Russia views the U.S. as a partner, Putin
told Albright at the beginning of their talks in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
However, Putin said Russian-U.S. Relations have experienced
ebbs and flows over the past 18 months, noting that "We have been
under certain pressure from the U.S. administration over the
operation in the North Caucasus lately."
</P>
<P>
The three-hour talks continued behind closed doors. Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called the meeting "very frank,
benevolent and constructive despite certain natural differences
between the sides".
</P>
<P>
The meeting confirms "a special significance attached to the
Russian-U.S. relations that are bound to play a key role in the
21st century," Ivanov told a briefing after the talks.
</P>
<P>
The sides paid great attention to disarmament problem and
discussed the Anti- Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty as well as the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty-2 (START-2), he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia views major changes in the ABM treaty as unnecessary and
favors armament cuts to be written into the future START-3."We
will work towards ratification of START-2 by the State Duma," said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
The role of Russia and the United States in the non-
proliferation of nuclear weapons was another item on the agenda,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Albright also discussed bilateral trade and economic
relations. The Russian side noted the readiness of the U.S.
administration to promote positive tendencies in these relations
for making the Russian market more attractive to foreign investors,
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Albright praised the outcome of the Moscow conference
on the Middle East, which took place on Tuesday. The conference
was another confirmation of the abilities of Moscow and Washington
as co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The acting President informed the U.S. State Secretary in
detail of the Russia's measures in the North Caucasus. He stressed
the Russian leadership "is open to a search for a political
settlement," according to Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Moscow plans to pay more attention to humanitarian problems in
Chechnya and the whole Northern Caucasus, Putin said. "We are open
for humanitarian cooperation with international organizations" in
that sphere, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"A policy of double standards applied to conflicts in various
parts of the world has always existed and will remain," said
Ivanov, calling for joint efforts to abandon such practices.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Russia have enough common interests to
overcome their differences and to meet the greatest challenges
together, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russia continue to disagree over Chechnya,
Albright admitted, describing Russia's military operation in
Chechnya as "riding a tiger."
</P>
<P>
She said Putin reaffirmed to her that Russia is fighting
terrorism in Chechnya, which is threatening the regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Moscow on Monday to attend the ministerial
conference of 15 countries on the Middle East peace progress.
Earlier She met with Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
She wound up her three-day trip here and left for Zagreb late
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Faces Massive Labor Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 2 (Xinhua) --The Central Bank of Lesotho
on Wednesday warned that the authorities may declare a state of
national disaster as a result of retrenchments of large numbers
of Lesotho workers from South African gold mines.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Lesotho Central Bank researcher Manneko
Monyau at the opening of a two-day national forum in the country's
capital of Maseru on the implications to Lesotho of the
downscaling of South Africa's mining industry, according to the
South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Monyau said massive retrenchments in the South African gold
mining industry had led to a major drop in miners' remittances as
a share of Lesotho's gross national product.
</P>
<P>
The remittances had dropped from a range of 40 percent and 45
percent in the early1980s to a range of 30 percent and 35 percent
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the year 1999 migrant labor remittances were
 estimated at 1.26 billion rand (230 million U.S. dollars) but a
further downscaling was expected to bring that down to about 800
million rand (133 million dollars) in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, number of the country's mine laborers was estimated
at 68,404, a substantial drop from 80,424 at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Monyau said Lesotho should seek assistance from its trading
partners, the donor community and the world in general, to help
create jobs for the retrenched miners.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police chief urged
local governments to increase capacity of local defense units to
help the police force improve the security situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Inspector-General of Police John Kisembo made the appeal at a
seminar on security in Masindi district, 200 km north of Kampala,
Radio Uganda reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities should help the central administration to
ensure security and stability in the country because Uganda's
police force is not strong enough to do the job, Kisembo told
participants of the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Local defense units play a big role in security matters and are
greatly complementary to the police force, he said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has 15,000 police officers with 230 vehicles. Their
communications equipment is relatively backward.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 2 (Xinhua) --South African President
Thabo Mbeki said on Wednesday that his government is committed to
upgrading education in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking at a graduation ceremony of
disadvantaged students from the Ithuteng Trust at Johannesburg's
Standard Bank Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Addressing more than 1,000 guests and pupils, Mbeki pledged
government support for the trust -- which has transformed the
lives of over 1,500 disadvantaged pupils.
</P>
<P>
Forty pupils from the black township of Soweto, who were
considered impossible, unmanageable and "school criminals" by
their teachers and principals, received awards for passing matric
exams last year.
</P>
<P>
They have also been admitted to various tertiary education
institutions with the help of corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
Lawlessness and crime could be addressed through education,
the president said, adding that the project could act as an
example to be reproduced elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank Foundation echoed Mbeki's commitment to Ithuteng
by donating 200,000 rand (33,300 U.S. dollars) for the start of
the trust's 2000 academic year.
</P>
<P>
The trust was opened last April by Mbeki's predecessor, Nelson
Mandela.

<HEADLINE> S. African Defence Minister Criticized for Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces Union of
South Africa Wednesday warned of heightened racism in the military
following Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota's statement that white
officers would continue dominating top ranks for the time being.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Press Association, Lekota last
December told a British military magazine that the top ranks of
the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) would, for the
foreseeable future, be dominated by white officers of the former
South African Defence Force because the transformation process in
the army would take time.
</P>
<P>
"We fear that he is reinforcing racism in the SANDF,"
secretary-general of the union Nare Makgakga said in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"Lekota should choose the wise lane by making politically
correct statements," Makgakga said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Lekota had no reason to question the
competence of former liberation army soldiers currently serving in
the SANDF.

<HEADLINE> S. African Banks Lose Millions of Rand to Robberies, Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- South African banks lost
more than five billion rand (830 million U.S. dollars) in 1999 to
theft and fraud, South African Banking Council chief executive Bob
Tucker said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This amount was equivalent to more than 60 percent of banks'
1999 profits of eight billion rand (1.33 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tucker said banks' losses to fraud alone could be as high as
four billion rand (670 million dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The five-billion-rand loss in 1999 included the one billion
rand (166 million U.S. dollars) banks spent on security equipment
and personnel.
</P>
<P>
Only 6.5 million rand (1.08 million U.S. dollars), or ten
percent of the cash taken in robberies, was recovered, Tucker
said.

LUANDA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The registered AIDS cases in

destroyed many medical institutions, a large amount of people lost
their opportunity to go to the hospital for inspection.
</P>
<P>
The official estimated that among the11 million population in
Angola, 300,000 people are either AIDS patients or infected with
AIDS virus, mainly in the northwestern province of Cabinda and the
capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that since the first AIDS patient was
diagnosed in Angola in 1985, about 3,000 have died of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Leprosy Remains Public Health Problem in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Leprosy is still a public health
problem in Mozambique, where more than four people out of every
10,000 are infected with the Hansen bacillus, that causes the
disease, Mozambique News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Alcino Ndeve, a dermatologist and national assistant with the
leprosy program at the Health Ministry, said that although cases
of leprosy are reported countrywide, the most affected provinces
are Nampula, Cabo Delgado and Niassa in the northern region, and
Zambezia in central Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Ndeve said that the launching of a Leprosy Eradication Campaign
(LEC) by the health authorities is part of a program defined by
the World Health Organization (WHO) in the context of the
international efforts to fight against this disease.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the campaign took place between April and
July 1999 in Nampula, Cabo Delgado and Niassa, and in some
districts of Zambezia.
</P>
<P>
The second stage, to start in April this year, will last 11
months, and will also cover the provinces of Tete, Manica and
Sofala, in addition to those covered by the first stage.
</P>
<P>
In these campaigns health workers make an active search for
leprosy cases and give the necessary counselling so that patients
take the treatment to the end.
</P>
<P>
Ndeve made a point of stressing that taking the full treatment
is important because it is the only way to ensure that the
bacteria is eliminated and its spread is stopped.
</P>
<P>
He urged local communities and government authorities to help
in the efforts to eradicate this disease.
</P>
<P>
WHO has set the year 2000 as the year for the eradication of
leprosy worldwide, but only 98 of the infected countries have
managed to reach this target.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique and other 28 countries, where the program failed
either because of war or for other reasons, have had their
deadlines extended to 2005.

HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Wednesday urged its
people to find ways of conserving fuel as the oil stocks in the
country have reached extremely critical levels and are running out
fast.
</P>
<P>
The fuel shortages would continue and current imports are
inadequate to meet the country's daily requirements, said
spokesman for the oil industry Tom Walter in a statement.
</P>

He said the oil companies are working with the government to
put in place fuel allocations to ensure that key users in the

<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe needs a minimum of 500
million U. S. dollars to deal with an acute shortage of foreign
exchange which has resulted in lack of fuel, a business leader
said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
President of Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce Nhlanhla
Masuku was speaking at a meeting on the foreign exchange crisis
jointly organized by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and the National
Economic Consultative Forum.
</P>
<P>
"We now need to request that in the short-term there is need
to facilitate a big injection of foreign exchange in the system
because there is nothing we can do without getting an
International Monetary Fund agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that the government must speed up
privatization, stamp out corruption and plug foreign exchange
leakages in some sectors.
</P>
<P>
Participants said foreign exchange was being wasted through
importation of luxury goods which the locals could not afford.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Finance Ministry Charles Kuwaza said his
ministry needed to look at the whole issue of tariffs and surtax

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King to Visit Israel on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein said Wednesday he will visit Israel in the coming two weeks
to hold talks with Prime Minister Ehud Barak on obstacles standing
in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Israeli leadership to manifest courage to
carry on peace talks with its Arab neighbors despite the complexity
and difficulties in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
This will be Abdullah's first visit to Israel since he acceded
to the throne last February after his father King Hussein, the
longest serving ruler of the region, died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
The trip will be a return visit to Israel as Barak is scheduled
to visit Amman on Sunday to discuss with Abdullah about bilateral
ties and developments of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of Sunday's summit meeting would be the
developments and obstacles confronting the peace talks between
Israel, Syria and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak's visit to Amman comes at a time when Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators are conducting intense talks to meet the
February 13 deadline to lay down a framework for a final peace
scheduled for September.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks resumed in Washington last
December
after a 45-month hiatus, but the talks broke down again after Syria

said Israel should submit a written commitment for the handback in
full of the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a key peace broker in the region by trying to
bridge differences between Israel and Arab countries since it
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the second Arab country
next to
Egypt to strike a peace deal with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Before the resumption of the Syrian-Israeli peace talks in
Washington, Jordan had played a constructive role in ferrying
messages between Damascus and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Jordan took peace as its strategic option in dealing with
regional
affairs, and said it supported all efforts by all parties which
could lead to a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Two Libyans Plead Not Guilty to Lockerbie Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Two Libyans accused of the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, which killed 270
people in 1988,pleaded not guilty on Wednesday at a pre-trial
hearing in the High Court in Edinburgh, the Scottish capital.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters report monitored here quoted "legal sources" as
saying that the two suspects' pleas were entered at a pre-trial
hearing in the High Court in Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa
Fahima, are scheduled to stand trial on May 3 in the Netherlands
on charges of bombing the flight on December 21, 1988, killing all
259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi handed the two men
over after eight years of delay, following a U.N.-brokered deal to
hold the trial under Scottish law, on British soil in a neutral,
third country.
</P>
<P>
The two men will be tried under Scottish law at Camp Zeist, a
former military base in the Netherlands, to ensure a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
The hearing will be Scotland's first criminal trial without a
jury, held instead in front of a panel of three Scottish judges.
</P>
<P>
The proceedings are expected to take more than a year.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Wednesday's court hearing was a continuation
of a pre-trial hearing which began on December 7 in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects were not in court on Wednesday, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Grave Violation Against Chinese Sovereignty by Liu Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives passed the so-called Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act on Tuesday in disregard of China's solemn representations.
</P>
<P>
This is another attempt by the U.S. congress to boost the U.S.-
Taiwan military ties and create barriers to China's reunification
cause following its endorsement of the "Taiwan Relation Act" in
1979.
</P>
<P>
The move, a grave violation of China's sovereignty and a gross
interference in China's internal affairs, has aroused strong
indignation and firm opposition from the Chinese government and
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue, which concerns China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, has always been the most important and most
sensitive core issue in the Sino-U.S. relations. The passage of
the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act has breached the three Sino-U.
S joint communiques, particularly the principles set forth in the
China-U.S. August 17 Communique that governs the U.S. arms sales
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, since the signing of the August 17
Communique in 1982, the United States has never stopped its
military sales to Taiwan. In recent years, it has not only
drastically increased the amount of arms sold to Taiwan, but
constantly upgraded the performance and quality of the weapons.
Some Americans have even tried to include Taiwan into the "Theater
Missile Defense" regime.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the Taiwan Bill by the U.S. house was designed
to create "legal justification" for the U.S. bid to sell more
advanced arms facilities, to conduct and expand the U.S.-Taiwan
military cooperation, and thus to create "one China, one Taiwan"
or "two Chinas."
</P>
<P>
Although a handful of U.S. legislators claim that the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act was aimed at "protecting" Taiwan's "
security", their real motive is to split China, and prevent China
from becoming stronger.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, as facts have shown, the Taiwan straits have
witnessed repeated occurrence of crises as aggressive independence-
seeking forces on the island stir up troubles, who felt assured of
U.S. military support and intervention once war breaks out across
the straits.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act will inevitably puff up
the arrogance of the independence seekers once it becomes law,
intensify the tension in the Taiwan straits, further harm the
peace and stability in the Asia and Pacific region, and at the
same time have a grave damaging impact on the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter and the international norm, territorial
security falls into the sphere of state sovereignty and is
entirely an internal affair of a country which cannot allow
interference of others. As Taiwan is an inseparable part of China,
this issue is an internal affair of China, and no foreign country
is allowed to poke its nose into the issue. But regrettably, some
U.S. lawmakers have ignored International Law and tried to make
legislation on the "security" of another country's territory, and
this has fully exposed the arrogance of the U.S. hegemonists.
</P>
<P>
After the passage of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act by the
U.S. House of Representatives, the Chinese government has lodged
solemn representations to the U.S. government. Meanwhile, the bill
was criticized by the members of insight in both houses of the U.S.
Congress. The U.S. government also expressed its explicit
opposition to the deliberation and passage of the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act. The Chinese government strongly demanded that the
U.S. government attach great importance to China's solemn stand,
fully understand the serious harm brought about by the bill, and
strictly abide by the principles of the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques and keep the promise made by the American side.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also urged the U.S. government to take
immediate steps to prevent the bill from becoming law and stop
its sales of advanced weapons and technology to Taiwan to create a
congenial atmosphere and conditions for the continued, stable and
healthy development of the Sino-U.S. relations in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The reunification of China is the common wishes of the Chinese
people including the people in Taiwan. And any move to disrupt
China's reunification will not be allowed and are doomed to end in
failure. The Chinese government and people have the resolve,
confidence and ability to solve the Taiwan issue as soon as
possible and eventually realize the complete reunification of
China.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Minister Urges Rebels in Grozny to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev Wednesday urged rebels remaining in Chechen capital of
Grozny to lay down their weapons and surrender to the federal
troops, warning there is no alternative for them to survive.
</P>
<P>
As the Russian forces have kept close surrounding of Grozny and
held firm control of its liberated parts, it is impossible and a
meaningless life risk for the exhausted militants to break out of
the federal grip, Sergeyev said before flying from Mozdok,
Northern Ossetia to Chechnya for a visit.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Sergeyev said he was
satisfied with the final stage in the counter-terrorist operation.
</P>
<P>
"Conditions have been created for a successful and early end to
the operation," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
A Wednesday Russian NTV television live showed that fierce
fighting is going on in the battered streets of Grozny after the
federal troops Tuesday took full control of the key Minutka Square
in the city center, a decisive breakthrough in the month-long
bloody operation to liberate the city.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 24 hours, Russian troops killed nearly 40 rebels
and took 110 captive, the Interfax quoted the Russian federal
forces' headquarters in North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
A field commander of the Chechen rebels said he is forming
small mobile groups of rebels to find escape routes from Grozny,
the headquarters said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Arsenal striker Alan
Smith has poured scorn on rumours that Manchester United's David
Beckham is to move to Highbury in the summer.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports suggest the Gunners are willing to hand over
a fee of 25 million pounds and pay the England midfielder a
massive salary that would dwarf even the 52,000 pounds a week
given to Old Trafford skipper Roy Keane last December.
</P>
<P>
But Highbury insider Smith, who picked up league, FA Cup and
European winners' medals during his time at the club, said: "I
think it is complete nonsense.
</P>
<P>
"David's happy at United and I would not be surprised if he
signs a new contract along the lines the club gave to Roy Keane.
And Arsenal simply do not pay that sort of money."
</P>
<P>
He added: "If Beckham ever does decide to leave Old Trafford I
think he will go abroad. I don't think he would want to go to
another club in this country.
</P>
<P>
"He believes United are the biggest and the best. He obviously
is a great player but it's not worth speculating on what would
happen at Arsenal because I do not believe it would happen."
</P>
<P>
Beckham has two years of his current contract to run and United
are believed to be working on a new deal which would give him up
to 60,000 pounds a week.

LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- English first division soccer
club Tranmere Rovers are one match away from their European debut.
</P>
<P>
The Giant-killers were boosted today by confirmation that the
League Cup winners will qualify for next season's UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Tranmere meet either Leicester or Aston Villa in the final at
Wembley on 27 February.
</P>
<P>
"If they were to win the final, they could be nominated by the
English Football Association as an entrant for the 2000-2001 UEFA
Cup," said a UEFA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But the beaten finalists of the Cup will not get the chance to
play in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"UEFA would like to clarify that, if the winner of the domestic
League Cup has already qualified for a European club competition,
the beaten finalists would not be eligible to enter," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"This is different from the situation in the FA Cup, where the
beaten finalist can gain access to the UEFA Cup if the winner has
already qualified for the UEFA Champions League," he added.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Buddhists on Annual New Year Pilgrimage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Tibetans made their
annual pilgrimage to the Sera Monastery today to take part in a
Buddhist prayer ritual three days before the Tibetan New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
The annual religious event is the most important one held
before the dawning of a new year. In their prayers, Tibetans
believe they can ward off disaster and hardship in the year to
come.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony began at 5:00 a.m. at the third largest monastery
in Tibet, and was officiated over by Qamba Nagwang, a living
Buddha, who gave head-touching blessings to believers one by one.
The long queue waiting for him stretched for one kilometer by noon.
</P>
<P>
After bowing his head before a statue of a Buddha at the main
temple, a Tibetan herdsman said that he appreciated the relaxed
religious environment created by the Central Government for
Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Many of the pilgrims traveled a long way from Sichuan, Qinghai
and Gansu provinces in the western region. The ritual is expected
to end at 10 p.m. tonight, with some 50,000 people participating,
according to the local sources.
</P>
<P>
The religious ritual attracted a large number of tourists as
well, who came to enjoy the winter scene in the high plateau.
</P>
<P>
The Sera Monastery was built by disciples of Zong Kaba, founder
of the yellow sect of Tibetan Buddhism, between 1403 and 1424.
Many of the lamas maintaining the temple will return home for
family reunions during the Tibetan New Year, which will be an Iron
Dragon Year according to the Tibetan calendar.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC National Committee Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Indignant over U.S. Anti-China Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A leading official of the
Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee today expressed
"utter indignation" over an anti-China act passed by the U.S.
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here this evening, the official said that
his subcommittee considers the move "a violation of the three Sino-
U.S. joint communiques, a grave encroachment on China's
sovereignty, and a gross interference in China's internal affairs.
"
</P>
<P>
The official said that the act is intended to "offer a legal
framework for the U.S. to conduct and expand military
communications and contacts with Taiwan, and sell all kinds of
advanced weapons to it, in an effort to impede China's
reunification."
</P>
<P>
"It is known by all that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the
Chinese territory. It is an internal affair of China to decide how
to resolve the Taiwan issue and realize the complete reunification
of the country," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot help expressing our absolute opposition to and
strong condemnation of this hegemonist act taken by the U.S. House
of Representatives," he said, adding that the move also violates
the basic norms of international law.
</P>
<P>
The official also rebuked the US House for disregarding the
overall growth of Sino-U.S. relations by the passage of the act.
</P>
<P>
"If this act becomes a law, it will inflate the arrogance of
Lee Teng-hui's 'two-state' statement and of Taiwan's independence,
thereby leading to a tension across the Taiwan Straits,
undermining the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region,
and triggering a situation that all the peace-loving people oppose,
" he pointed out, adding that it will also have a damaging impact
on China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The official strongly demanded that people in the legislative
and executive branches of the US government pay great heed to the
solemn stance of the Chinese government and people, become fully
aware of the deviousness of this act, observe the three Sino-U.S.
joint communiques and relevant commitments made by the U.S., and
prevent this act from becoming a law.

<TEXT>
<P>
If this act becomes law, the statement said, it will definitely
undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and even
peace and stability in the entire Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Also, it will bring additional difficulties to the resolution
of the Taiwan issue and have an incredibly negative impact on
China-U.S. relations, which have been improving, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese government has repeatedly stressed, the Taiwan
issue is related to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity
and remains the most vital and sensitive core issue of China-U.S.
relations, it said.
</P>
<P>
"If the Taiwan issue is properly handled, China-U.S. relations
can move forward; if improperly handled, bilateral relations will
see turns and twists, even setbacks," it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Considering that China and U.S. are both influential powers in
the world, the statement said, the two countries should steadily
improve and strengthen their relations and join hands for world
peace and stability and for the progress and prosperity of mankind.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the U.S. Congress to proceed from the overall
situation of Sino-U.S. relations, consider the peace and stability
of the Asia-Pacific region, and do nothing against the tides of
history," it said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the U.S. government should not just oppose this act
with words, but it should also take effective actions to prevent
it from becoming law, the statement concluded.

<HEADLINE> NPC Foreign Affairs Committee Bashes U.S. Anti-China Act (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the act passed by the House of Representatives, with the
ulterior motive of splitting China, uninformed and unreasonable "
evidence" was put forth stating that "Although on January 1, 1979,
the United States government withdrew diplomatic recognition of
the government on Taiwan as the legitimate government of China,
neither at the time nor since has the United States government
adopted a formal position as to the ultimate status of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
This is an extremely absurd and ridiculous fallacy, the NPC
statement said, adding that the U.S. government, as early as in
the communique on the establishment of Sino-U.S. diplomatic
relations, clearly acknowledged that there is only one China in
the world, that Taiwan is part of China, and that the government
of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate
government of China.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has repeatedly reiterated that the
U.S. abides by the one China policy and the "three no" commitment
on the Taiwan issue, namely, no support for Taiwan's independence,
no two Chinas, nor one China, one Taiwan, and no Taiwan
membership in any international organizations where statehood is
required.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. government did not take such a stance on the status
of Taiwan, the two countries would not have forged formal
diplomatic relations two decades ago, nor would the United States
government have withdrawn diplomatic recognition of the government
on Taiwan as the legitimate government of China.

The U.S. House of Representatives turned a blind eye and a deaf
ear to the facts, and even presented the nonsense, and once again
put forth the fallacy, that the status of Taiwan is not decided,
inflating the attempts of the Taiwan authorities to create two
Chinas, or one China, one Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The motives behind the scenes were made clear to all," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
As everyone knows, Taiwan has been part of China's territory
since ancient times, and the so-called Taiwan issue is an internal
affair left over by the civil war in China half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people across the Taiwan Straits fully share this
same view, and they can rely on themselves to solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Solving the Taiwan issue has been the greatest wish of the
entire Chinese people since the successful settlement of the Hong
Kong and Macao issues by the Chinese government, the NPC statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been and will continue its efforts
to solve the Taiwan issue peacefully as soon as possible and to
accomplish the country's complete reunification.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people will never tolerate foreign countries and
external forces meddling in China's internal affairs, and any
attempts to split China will be doomed in failure, it said.

According to the statement, the core of the act passed by the U.
S. House of Representatives calls for reinforcing Taiwan's
military strength and all types of military links between the U.S.
and Taiwan, and to legalize the increase of U.S. arms sale to
Taiwan, according to the so-called the Taiwan Relations Act, and
under the pretext of a so-called China military threat against
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely dangerous act of hegemonism," the
statement said, adding that the Taiwan Relations Act itself goes
against the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the U.S.
government's commitments.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has continually increased its arms sale to Taiwan in
recent years according to the Taiwan Relations Act, undermining
China's reunification and hindering the growth of Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the U.S., in the August 17 joint
communique between the two countries, said it "intends gradually
to reduce the sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of
time, to a final resolution."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the quantity and capability of weapons sold to Taiwan
by the U.S. have largely exceeded that of its commitments since
the signing of the joint communique 18 years ago, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Now, the House of Representatives, based on the Taiwan
Relations Act, passed the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act in an
attempt to reinforce U.S. military support for Taiwan, the
statement said, adding that the real aim is to inflate Taiwan's
independence forces and support Lee Teng-hui's "two-states"
remarks.
</P>
<P>
People have to ask what some pro-Taiwan and anti-China members
of the U.S. House of Representatives intend by placing the Taiwan
Relations Act above the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and
relevant U.S. commitments.
</P>
<P>
"We have to tell such representatives that arbitrary people do
harm to both others and themselves, and in the end, lift a rock
only to drop it on their own feet," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Inner Cabinet Approves Next Stage of Land Hand-over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel's security cabinet
Wednesday approved the maps of an overdue hand-over of 6.1 percent
of the West Bank to Palestinian control under an interim agreement
signed last September.
</P>
<P>
Six ministers of the security cabinet, or inner cabinet, voted
in favor of the maps. Two voted against and one abstained, Israel
Radio report said. The cabinet decided that the withdrawal will be
carried out within the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The hand-over, which comes as the third and last stage under the
Sharm el-Sheikh agreement signed last September, should have taken
place on January 20. However, Israel delayed the withdrawal over a
dispute on which areas to be handed over.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians reportedly are expecting the hand-over to
include land in and around the Arab village of Abu Dis in suburb
Jerusalem, but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Abu Dis is
unlikely to be included in the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians began intensive talks Sunday in an
effort to meet the February 13 target date for reaching a framework
agreement on final-status issues, to be detailed in a full peace
treaty in September.
</P>
<P>
The talks deal with thorny issues such as the final-status of
the Palestinian entity, the final border, the fate of Jerusalem,
Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the talks, Barak will hold talks with Arafat
Thursday at the Erez border crossing between Israel and the
Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East special envoy Dannis Ross is to arrive in the
region later Wednesday to help push forward the talks.

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua)-- An Israeli court on Wednesday
remanded two Israelis suspected of selling arms and military
equipment to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The magistrate's court in Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, remanded
Eli Cohen, 50, for further eight days and his business partner
Avihai Weistein, 32, for further five days in custody.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Weistein were arrested by police Tuesday in Binyamina,
a town between Tel Aviv and Haifa, on suspicion of purchasing
surplus U.S. and German armored personnel carriers, 250 engines and
hundreds of other items via intermediaries in various countries for
millions of U.S. dollars and selling them to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Police in Europe detected the sales trail and alerted Israeli
police, Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
Their arrests marked the culmination of a year-long police
investigation that involved security officials in the U.S., Europe
and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said Tuesday that Cohen had been questioned seven
years ago on suspicion that he had been involved in similar
offences.
</P>
<P>
Both Cohen and Weistein denied the allegations and have not been
charged so far.

<HEADLINE> CGI Pledges 4.7 Billion U.S. Dollars for Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Donor countries grouping in the
Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) ended here on Wednesday its
two-day meeting, agreeing to extend a new loan package for
Indonesia amounting to 4.7 billion U.S. dollars within the current
year.
</P>
<P>
The new loan includes 520 million U.S. dollars worth of grants
for the fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, World Bank
Vice President for East Asia Jean-Michel Severino, who chaired the
meeting, said the amount of the new loan package shows the CGI's
trust on Indonesia's new government.
</P>
<P>
It was aimed to boost the country's state budget for the fiscal
year 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a new sense of optimism that Indonesia can indeed
resume the path of real development and yet, events in the past
six months have shown us that stability is fragile and that
optimism can quickly fade," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The new loan package is lower than last year's loan package of
5.9 billion dollars and 6.8 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Japan, as usual, provided the biggest loan in the package (1.56
billion dollars), while the World Bank, the leader of the CGI,
pledged 1.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The other donors were Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark,
Germany, Italy, South Korea, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
International monetary institution donors were the Asian
Development Bank, the United Nations, the European Union and the
Nordic International Bank.
</P>
<P>
Severino said the donors would focus on the macroeconomic
stability, debt and corporate restructuring and good governance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Economic,
Finance and Industry Kwik Kian Gie who also attended the
conference said Indonesia needs help from donor countries in
achieving its macroeconomic stability.
</P>
<P>
"What we now have achieved is macroeconomic stability but that
is not enough. Our government has an ambitious agenda that we
cannot accomplish alone. But we can begin to move in the right
direction with the help of all involved and look forward to
creating a country where the people believe anything is possible,"
Kwik said, adding that the commitment made by the donors was a
sign of support from the international community to the government
's economic recovery program.
</P>
<P>
On the new loan, the minister said that in fact, Indonesia only
needed 4.1 billion dollars to boost its 2000 state budget. So, the
total of 4.7 billion dollars is "higher than we expected before.
It is higher than we need."
</P>
<P>
The two days' meeting, CGI's ninth, was the first held in
Jakarta instead of Paris.
</P>
<P>
It was attended by 168 participants who represented 20 donor
countries and 14 international institutions while the Indonesian
delegation consisted of 19 individuals representing various
institutions.

SHANGHAI, February 2 (Xinhua)-- The Baoshan Iron and Steel

limited company here today which will sell stock on overseas
markets this year.
</P>
<P>
Baoshan Iron and Steel Ltd., now the group's largest subsidiary
company, now holds total assets of over 37.8 billion yuan (about 4.
5 billion U.S. dollars), according to company officials.
</P>
<P>
The new limited corporation has set the goal of developing the
iron and steel industry and its technologies, and enlarging its
business share in overseas markets this year.
</P>
<P>
Since China adopted the reform of its iron and steel
enterprises in 1993, some 30 companies in this industry have sold
their stock on overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Baoshan began its plan to sell stock to overseas investors
recently, and the establishment of the new limited corporation is
expected to push this effort in the first half of this year,
Baoshan officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Baoshan Group, China's iron and steel giant, has increased
its total assets from 20.5 billion yuan (about 2.5 billion dollars)

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Affairs Committee
of China's National People's Congress (NPC) today expressed its
utmost indignation at and firm opposition to the passing of the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act by the U.S. House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by a leading official of the
NPC Foreign Affairs Committee this evening, the act absolutely
disregarded the strong aspirations of the entire Chinese people
for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and completely
runs counter to the principles set out in the three Sino-U.S.
joint communiques and commitments made by the U.S. on the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
It wantonly demands that the U.S. government "make every effort
to ensure the maintenance by Taiwan of forces adequate for defense,
" in an attempt to provide a legal basis for U.S. sales of all
types of advanced weapons to Taiwan and engage in and expand
cooperation between the armed forces of the U.S. and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We are utterly indignant at and firmly opposed to such an act,
which is in defiance of the norms governing international
relations, severely violates China's sovereignty, flagrantly
interferes in China's internal affairs, and attempts to disrupt
the cause of China's peaceful reunification," the statement said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
asked the non-communist parties of China to actively participate
in the formulation of the tenth five-year plan for national
economic and social development (2001-2005) and work for the
rejuvenation of China.
</P>
<P>
They are encouraged to bring into full play their role of
political consultation, democratic supervision, and participation
in political and government affairs, Jiang said at a forum here
today marking the upcoming Spring Festival, which falls on
February 5.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee, extended New Year's greetings to China's 8 non-
communist parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce, and people without party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China must adhere to the system of multi-party
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no ambiguity in this political principle, and it
complies with China's actual conditions," Jiang said, stressing
that "the Western-style multi-party system should never be copied
in China."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that China will continue to advance its
democratization process, improve its legal system, and perfect the
leadership of the Party and the government, in order to ensure the
lasting stability of the nation. He said that 1999 was of special
significance in China's development because the nation
successfully celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of
New China and resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the forum were Party and state leaders Li
Ruihuan and Hu Jintao, and leaders of the central committees of
China's 8 non-communist parties, the All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce, and people without party affiliations.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the non-communist parties put forward various
suggestions for strengthening China's system of multi-party
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the
CPC, speeding up the exploration of the country's vast inland
areas, maintaining Chinese cultural traditions in the course of
modernization, heeding the influences of the Internet, and
studying tactics relating to China's expected accession to the
World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Iran Releases on Bail 3 Jews Arrested on Espionage Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Judiciary announced on
Wednesday that three of the 13 Iranian Jews arrested on espionage
charges last year have been released on bail.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary's spokesman Hussein Mir Mohammad Sadeqi told the
Islamic Republic News Agency that the three Jews, whose names would
be announced later, were released from prison in Shiraz, southern
Fars province, because the charges leveled against them were "less
serious" than those of others.
</P>
<P>
The court hearings for the arrested Jews will be held within the
next few weeks, IRNA added.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Iranian Jews, along with a few Muslims, were arrested
last April in the Iranian capital city of Tehran and two other
major cities, Shiraz and Isfahan, on suspicion of spying for Israel
and the United States
</P>
<P>
They were accused of sending information to Israel through "
advanced communication devices," sending members of their network
abroad for training, and assisting Iranians to illegally leave the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, both Israel and the U.S. rejected any links between
their intelligence services and the Iranian Jews and urged Tehran
to release them.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have claimed that Iranian authorities would
guarantee a fair trial of the Jews and the accusations leveled
against them have nothing to do with their religion or political
background.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Asks for More Commitment on Illegals' Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Wednesday asked
foreign missions in the country to show more commitment in
providing citizenship confirmation of illegal immigrants to
expedite their deportation.
</P>
<P>
If more commitment was shown, the Immigration Department could
shorten the deportation process which at present takes three weeks
or a month, Deputy Home Minister Zainal Abidin Zin said.
</P>
<P>
The government has to spend 15 ringgit (about 4 U.S. dollars) a
day per person on the detainees in the detention depots, he said
when briefing reporters on the reopening of the immigration
detention depot in Semenyih, some 20 kilometers south of here,
Bernama News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government spent 14 million ringgit (about 3.684
million dollars) last year on feeding the detainees, he said,
adding that the sooner they could be sent back home, the less the
cost will be.
</P>
<P>
The depot in Semenyih was closed on April 25, 1998, after about
200 Indonesian detainees, mostly Achenese, who were due to be
deported, rioted, resulting in the death of a policeman and eight
rioters.
</P>
<P>
There are presently 12 depots run by the country's Immigration
Department, accommodating 4,200 illegal immigrants nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Approves National Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- After a long wait, the
Philippine Senate ratified Wednesday the bicameral conference
committee report, which set this year's national budget at 629
billion pesos (15.7 billion U.S. dollars), Philippine News Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Voting 15-5, the chamber is set to send the 2000 General
Appropriations Bill to President Joseph Estrada to sign into law
this month.
</P>
<P>
Under the bicameral report, the administration's proposed 651
billion-peso (16-billion-dollar) national budget for the year 2000
has been drastically cut down by at least 22 billion pesos (550
million dollars) to maintain the budget deficit ceiling to a
manageable 62.5 billion pesos (1.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the 22-billion-peso cuts, some 7 billion pesos (175 million
dollars) will be considered as "real cuts" while the remaining 15
billion (375 million dollars) will be "contingent cuts" that may
be restored to the 2000 national budget once government revenue
collections pick up.
</P>
<P>
The 7-billion-peso real cuts would be slashed in the
intelligence funds of various government agencies, while the 15-
billion-peso contingent cuts include 10 billion pesos (250 million
dollars) from the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA).
</P>
<P>
The remaining 5 billion pesos (125 million dollars) is the
preferred cuts of national government agencies submitted to the
Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the yearly general appropriation bill is enacted
before the start of every fiscal year or on the last day of the
session of the congress prior to the Christmas recess.
</P>
<P>
However, the debate between the House of Representatives and
the Senate over the cut in the IRA delayed the process.
</P>
<P>
The delay in the passage of the budget has led to the deferment
of the implementation of a 10-percent increase in the salaries of
all civil servants.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada promised last year to give government workers
the salary increase as a relief from the rising cost of living.
</P>
<P>
However, Senate Majority Leader Franklin Drilon assured all
government workers of the 10 percent across-the-board salary
increase amounting to some 2.8 billion pesos (320 million dollars)
that shall be made retroactive starting from Jan. 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Oilseed Acreage Increases Markedly in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The acreage of sunflower crop
increased by three times to 427,000 acres during 1998-99 from 185,
000 acres in 1994-95 in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"This is due the efforts of the Pakistan Oilseed Development
Board for cutting the import bill of the edible oil through
increasing the domestic oilseed production," a spokesman of the
board was quoted by the Associated Press of Pakistan as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the acreage of canola increased from 8,000 acres in
1994-95 to 175,000 acres in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
Due to the increase of domestic oilseed production, Pakistan's
import of edible oil showed a downward trend, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The country imported 509,000 tons of edible oil worth 173
million U.S. dollars during the first half of the current fiscal
year, markedly lower than the 697,000 tons during the
corresponding period of the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Pump 17 Million Tons of Crude Oil in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam Oil and Gas Corporation (
PetroVietnam) plans to pump about 17 million tons of crude oil in
2000, a year-on-year increase of 2 million tons, Vietnam News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Vietnam tapped 15 million tons of crude oil, an rise
of 19 percent over 1998, and brought ashore 1.4 billion cubic
meters of gas.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country is the fourth biggest oil exporter in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Last year, it exported 14.7 million tons of crude oil, a year-
on-year increase of 21.4 percent; earned 2 billion U.S. dollars
from the export of oil, a year-on-year increase of 62.3 percent,
accounting for 17 percent of the country's total export turnover.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has mainly exported crude oil to Singapore, the United
States and Japan. It plans to expand crude oil outlets to
Australia, the Republic of Korea, Britain and Holland.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Lanka Free Trade Pact to Take Effect in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- India and Sri Lanka agreed on
Wednesday to bring into effect a free trade pact between the two
countries in March this year, said an official release by the
Indian Ministry of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, India will phase out tariffs on a
large number of Sri Lankan export items within three years while
Sri Lanka will do the same to Indian items in eight years, said
the release.
</P>
<P>
It added that Indian Commerce Secretary P P Prabhu and Sri
Lankan Finance Secretary P B Jayasundera had exchanged letters
about the enforcement of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Though the agreement was signed more than one year ago by
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Kumaratunga, its implementation was delayed as
the two sides differed on many issues, such as extending
concessional duty on tea and garments.
</P>
<P>
If the free trade agreement takes effect, New Delhi needs to
exempt 1,351 items from duty while Colombo will provide duty free
access to 320 items, said sources with the Ministry of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
India will also give a 50-percent duty concession on nearly 2,
800 items which would become duty free in three years. On the
other hand, Sri Lanka will extend a 50 percent duty rebate on 889
items and the duty will also be phased out in three years.
</P>
<P>
However, India will maintain a negative list of 429 items
against Sri Lanka's 1,180, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the timing of the pact's enforcement, the sources
said it has to wait until the central budgets of the two countries
are passed by the respective parliaments.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan budget is slated to be presented on February 14,
while India's union budget is scheduled for February 29.

ATHENS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece, Albania and Macedonia
declared Wednesday a "Balkan Park of Prespes," the first cross-
border nature reserve in the region, at an official meeting in the
northern Greek town of Florina.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made coinciding with the World Wetlands Day to

<HEADLINE> FIFA Gives Azerbaijan Federation Monday Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- FIFA has given Azerbaijan a
Monday deadline to settle its internal disputes or be banned from
all international competition, a spokesman for the Azeri Soccer
Federation (ASF) said in Baku, Azerbaijan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Azeri soccer has been rent by a rebellion against the current
ASF chief led by the powerful presidents of two leading clubs who
want to set up a rival body to the ASF.
</P>
<P>
The Spokesman said: "We have received a letter signed by FIFA
secretary-general Michel Zen-Ruffinen, which states that if by
1200 GMT on February 7 we do not settle our differences, then
Azerbaijan will be suspended from all FIFA activities.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, FIFA continues to recognise the ASF and its head
Fuad Musayev as official representatives of Azeri soccer but they
want us to hold a nationwide conference by April 1 and have a
democratically elected ASF president."
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan are in World Cup qualifying European group four with
Sweden, Turkey, Slovakia, Macedonia and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to solve the row, FIFA has sent similar letters to
Azeri Prime Minister Artur Rasizade, Sports Minister Abulfas
Garayev and the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
FIFA President Sepp Blatter said his body would have no choice
but to ban Azerbaijan if the standstill continued.
</P>
<P>
"The solution to the Azeri problem can only be found in
Azerbaijan itself," he said last week.

ATHENS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuban high jump world record
holder Javier Sotomayor will compete at an indoor meeting in
Greece later this month, his first appearance since testing

Sotomayor has been in limbo since testing positive for cocaine
following his gold medal win at last year's Pan American Games in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban faces a two-year suspension and exclusion from this
year's Sydney Olympics if the IAAF's arbitration panel finds
against him later this year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which will take place at the western port city of
Patras, will also feature American Olympic high jump gold
medallist Charles Austin.

<HEADLINE> China Indignant over U.S. Anti-China Act (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and
people today expressed their "utmost indignation over and firm
opposition to" an anti-China act passed by the U.S. House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi
summoned U.S. Ambassador Joseph Prueher to lodge "serious
representations" for the passing of the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act.
</P>
<P>
On February 1, the U.S. Congress disregarded the repeated
solemn representations made by China and passed the so-called
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act.
</P>
<P>
Yang slammed the anti-China move as an attempt to "provide a
legal basis for the buildup and expansion of military contacts and
exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan, and for the sales of all
manner of advanced weaponry equipment and technologies to Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Yang said the anti-China move by the U.S. House of
Representatives is "a complete violation of the three Sino-U.S.
joint communiques and relevant commitments made by the U.S. side,
a serious encroachment on China's sovereignty, a gross
interference in China's internal affairs, and an attempt to make '
one China, one Taiwan', or 'two Chinas'."
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed out that the Taiwan issue is related to China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and therefore is closely
linked with the national sentiment of the entire Chinese people.
Also, the Taiwan issue has remained the most important and
sensitive core issue in China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"In the communique on the establishment of diplomatic ties
between China and the United States, the U.S. government has
clearly stated it recognized that the government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing
the whole of China. There is only one China, and Taiwan is an
inalienable part of the Chinese territory," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people will never agree to any
attempt or move to damage China's reunification," Yang said,
adding that such a move is doomed to fail.

<P>
"The Chinese government and people are determined, confident
and capable of resolving the Taiwan issue and realizing the
complete reunification of the motherland," the deputy foreign
minister stated.
</P>
<P>
Yang described the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act as another
document, following the Taiwan Relations Act, "intended to impede
China's reunification."
</P>
<P>
After the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act became known, Yang
said, the Chinese government lodged a solemn representation with
the U.S. government and demanded the U.S. take resolute measures
to prevent it from becoming law.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. government is committed to preventing this
document from becoming law. Far-sighted members of the U.S. Senate
and House of Representatives also expressed their clear opposition
to the act, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, with the promotion of anti-China and pro-
Taiwan forces in the House of Representatives, the House passed
this act aimed at splitting China.
</P>
<P>
If this act becomes law, Yang said, it will encourage the
bluster of Lee Teng-hui who has described cross-strait relations
as "state-to-state relations" and the forces advocating "the
independence of Taiwan," thereby undermining the peace and
stability of the Asia-Pacific region and bringing serious damage
to Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Yang stressed that the Chinese side strongly demands that the U.
S. government pay great heed to this solemn stance and request of
the Chinese government, be fully aware of the harmfulness of this
act, observe the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and relevant
commitments made by the U.S. side, and take immediate action to
prevent it from becoming law.
</P>
<P>
Yang also requires that the U.S. abide by the China-U.S. August
17 (1982) Communique and immediately stop selling advanced
weaponry and technologies to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Prueher told Yang he will report the above stance by China to
the U.S. government immediately, and said the U.S. government
strongly opposes the passage of the Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act by the House on February 1.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Blasts Barak's Visit to Occupied Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss on Wednesday condemned Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
visit to south Lebanon, saying the visit showed Israel's "utmost
defiance and insolence."
</P>
<P>
Barak's visit Tuesday to the Al Azieh post in the security zone
in south Lebanon, where three Israeli soldiers were killed and four
others injured by Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas Monday, represents
an attack that is tantamount to the intensified Israeli raids on
the region, Hoss told Lebanese newspaper Anahar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel has recently pounded suspected guerrilla positions in
villages, towns and valleys in the region in retaliation for the
killing.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said Barak's visit to the region is part of the "
incarnation of terrorism," referring to the Israeli occupation of
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a so-called security zone in southern Lebanon
in 1985 with the claim to protect its north from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is spearheading a war oust the 1,500
Israeli occupation troops and the 2,500 pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army militiamen out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Party Cancels Plans to Appeal Against Heavy Fines: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's Labor party Wednesday decided not to appeal to the High
Court against the heavy fines imposed by State Comptroller Eliezer
Goldberg for alleged violations of the Campaign Finance Law in the
1999 elections.
</P>
<P>
Labor party Secretary-General Ra'anan Cohen said Wednesday
morning that the party had reversed an earlier decision on appeal
after consulting a team of prominent legal advisers, Israel Wire
reported.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who had a soured personal relationship with Barak, stated
that party leaders believed that a petition would be interpreted as
a lack of respect for the State Comptroller's office and it was not
a move the party will make at the moment.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak was reportedly determined to file the petition
because he was convinced that he did not break the law, claiming
that the election laws are too vague, leaving too much room for
subjective interpretation, which in this case have led to the
damaging results.
</P>
<P>
It is still unknown whether Barak's office will issue statements
contradictory to Cohen's stand.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Barak's spokeswoman Meraf Parsi-Zadok said that
Barak ordered to prepare the petition because he believes the
current law is impossible to apply to direct elections of a prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The decision is a reaction to the criminal investigation
launched by Attorney General Eliyakim Rubinstein last Thursday
immediately after Goldberg submitted to the Knesset (parliament) a
report on party funding in last year's elections which brought
Barak to power.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg asserted in his report that Barak and his One Israel
coalition, in which the Labor party is the backbone, used a variety
of so-called non-profit organizations to illegally channel large
sums of money from foreign donors to fund Barak's election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg levied on One Israel a hefty fine of 14 million shekels
(about 3.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fine would aggravate the finance balancing of the coalition
and the Labor party, since the party had already been on the brink
of bankruptcy with a debt of 110 million shekels (about 28.2
million dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy have decided to recall
Israel's ambassador from Vienna if Austrian President Thomas
Klestil approves the planned coalition agreement that will bring
the far-right Freedom Party into the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Levy made this decision Wednesday after studying the
political developments in Austria.
</P>
<P>
"Israel views with utmost gravity with the inclusion of the
extreme right-ring Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider in the
Austrian government and calls on the international community not to
accept this worrying phenomenon," Barak and Levy said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that the inclusion of an ultra-right
party, whose leader has previously made serious remarks regarding
the Nazi regime, in the Austrian government must arouse the
suspicion of the entire world.
</P>
<P>
Haider has been notorious for his sympathy with the Nazi regime
and has called for a complete ban on immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"The entire Jewish people, led by the state of Israel, will not
allow the world to ignore events in Austria and their possible
implications," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Levy also said that starting from Wednesday they will
be in contact with European leaders in order to try to coordinate
comprehensive international measures.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the European Union has warned to cut off ties with
Austria, an EU member, if the far-right party was included in the
Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
The two also emphasized that the residents of Europe must
remember the message of the Holocaust and the hard lessons left
behind by World War II, during which over 6 million Jews were
killed by the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
If President Thomas approved the coalition which includes the
Freedom Party, Israel will recall its ambassador to Austria for an
unlimited period, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> AIADMK Chief Jaya Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Tamil Nadu Chief
Minister and AIADMK General Secretary Jayalalitha was Wednesday
sentenced to one year rigorous imprisonment in a hotel corruption
case.
</P>
<P>
Special Judge-II V. Radhakrishnan in Madras held Jayalalitha
and a former ministerial colleague of hers guilty of hatching a
conspiracy in the grant of the illegal permission amounting to "
procuring pecuniary advantage for a private person without public
interest."
</P>
<P>
Three other officials were also sentenced to one year
imprisonment in the same case.
</P>
<P>
The sentences were suspended till March 3 to enable them to go
on appeal on their executing bonds for 5,000 rupees (116.28 U.S.
dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
This is the first corruption case against Jayalalitha out of
the many instituted against her, that has ended in conviction.
</P>
<P>
She has been discharged from a coal import scam case and two
cases pertaining to a land deal, while she is facing trial in the
105 million rupees (2.44 million dollars) color TV case, and the
666.5 million rupees (15.50 million dollars) "disproportionate"
wealth case.
</P>
<P>
However, according to PTI, the sentence will not have any
bearing on her right to contest elections as it would need a
minimum of two years sentence for a person to be disqualified from
fighting elections.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Women Entrepreneurs Get Special Grant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Three companies owned by
women in Malaysia are to receive special grants under the Special
Assistance Scheme for Women Entrepreneurs under agreements signed
with the grant provider Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Technology Development Corporation (MTDC), which
manages half of the total 20 million ringgit (5.263 million U.S.
dollars) allocated for the special scheme, signed agreements with
the three companies, providing a grant worth 4.1 million ringgit (
1.078 million U.S. dollars) for them.
</P>
<P>
Aquasis Engineering (M), a petrochemical industry service
provider, was granted 1 million ringgit (0.263 million U.S.
dollars); Le'Wangi De'Wangi Traditional Collection, a natural
health and beauty care manufacturer, received 1.9 million ringgit
(0.5 million U.S. dollars); and Custommedia, which develops
software for industry, government agencies and educational
institutions, 1.2 million ringgit (0.315 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to a MTDC senior officer, as of January 24, MTDC had
approved about 6.632 million ringgit (1.745 million U.S. dollars)
under the special scheme, of which 2.322 million ringgit (0.611
million U.S. dollars) had been disbursed.
</P>
<P>
The officer said MTDC had to date received approximately 300
inquiries and 22 formal applications, of which six had been
approved.
</P>
<P>
MTDC group chief executive officer Anuar Md Nor told a press
conference later that due to the encouraging response from women
entrepreneurs, MTDC would probably apply to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry to increase the 10-million
ringgit (2.631 million U.S. dollars) grant ceiling for the scheme.

<HEADLINE> Regional Workshop on Rural Development Held in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Rural development in Asia has
become increasingly linked to a rapidly integrating world economy
and is facing new opportunities and challenges in the new
millenium, according to a report presented by the Asian
development Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
While presenting the report on Workshop on the Transformation
of Rural Asia held here Wednesday, Shahid Zahid, senior sector
specialist of ADB, said that the transformation of rural Asia has
also been accompanied by some troubling developments and new
challenges.
</P>
<P>
While poor people in rural Asia are declining, more than 670
million rural people (one third of the rural population) are still
living in abject poverty, Zahid told a gathering of more than 80
experts, scholars and governmental officials mainly from South
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, in the process of rural transformation yet to be
completed, a key challenge for policymakers of the region is to
continue to promote rapid growth in rural areas while making the
growth more pro-poor and more environmentally sustainable, said Dr.
Zahid.
</P>
<P>
Resident Representative of UN Food and Agriculture Organization
Winston Rudder said that the South Asian countries should
strengthen cooperation in countering the frequent disasters in the
region in order to achieve a faster development.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Agriculture Minister Chakra Prasad Bastola said that as
an agrarian country in which 85% of the population live in rural
areas, agriculture development in Nepal is the only key to rural
development which needs to be linked with infrastructure
development like irrigation, rural roads, rural electrification
and so on.
</P>
<P>
He said the Nepali government has formulated a 20-year
Agricultural Perspective Plan aimed at reducing poverty in Nepal
down to 20 percent by 2010 and to 14 percent by 2015 from the
present 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
With an aim to examine the achievements and prospects of rural
Asia and to provide a vision for the future strategies, the one-
day workshop was jointly organized by UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, Asian Development Bank and the Agriculture Ministry
of Nepal.

<P>
DHAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A 36-hour countrywide hartal (
destructive strike) called by the opposition parties which began
from 6 a.m. Wednesday went on peacefully in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its
allies Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikya Jote (Islami
Solidarity Front) have called the shutdown program to protest the
passage of Public Safety Act by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
BNP leader Khaleda Zia told a press conference on Tuesday
evening that the ruling party framed the Public Safety Act to
throw the opponents into jail, and hold general elections
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday morning, just before the hartal, one man was
killed and four injured in an explosion at the BNP central office
in Dhaka. Police suspected the blast took place when the BNP
activists were making bombs.
</P>
<P>
BNP leaders claimed that the blast was a "police conspiracy,"
and they had no involvement in the incident.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Pompously Celebrate 1st Carnival in New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Angola will spend some 2.2
million kwanzas (366,700 U.S. dollars) in organizing and realizing
the first carnival in the new millennium, the Angolan National
Commission of Carnival said.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary of the commission Diogo Colombo said here
Tuesday that his commission and its provincial branches will raise
funds in the current month as preparation for the realization of
the four-day carnival which is scheduled to start on March 4.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a grand parade organized by the government and
various pageant shows offered by the folk groups in Luanda, the
Angolan merchant groups will held a carnival fair in the capital's
cultural center.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in the country with a total population of
11 million, over one million of people and some 650 social groups
will participate in the activities to be held in early March.
</P>
<P>
In contrast with this year's elevated ardor, the Angolans in
1999 had no grand parade and carnival fairs as the government and
population paid too much attention to the development in the
battle field, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm for carnival also showed that the Angolan
government is now light-hearted as the government troops have
gained great advantage over the rebels in the central highlands,
east and north parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The civil war between the government troops and the National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi has lasted for over 25 years, severely hindering the
social and economic development of the country rich in natural
resources.

headquarters of the UNITA rebels, Angolan official newspaper
Jornal de Angola said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration ceremony, Angolan Minister of

"The government will begin fasten the programs of recovering
the economy and giving assistance to the population" in the city
in the south of central Huambo Province, said the minister.

CANBERRA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games received a rescue package that
will help it out of its budget problems.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee said Wednesday it has
reached an agreement in principle with the Australian Olympic
Committee to each forgo about 7.15 million U.S. dollars from their
respective shares of the SOCOG budgeted surplus.

<P>
The IOC said the agreement is conditional on the New South
Wales state government agreeing to forgo its own budgeted surplus
of about 19.5 million U.S. dollars from the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement will alleviate SOCOG's budget deficit of about
34 million U.S. dollars towards reaching a balanced budget for
staging the Games.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the Games has always been foremost in our minds.
" said Jacques Rogge, chairman of the IOC co-ordination commission
for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
He added that "It is proper that any consideration of profit
distribution should be dealt with after the Games. We are very

<HEADLINE> Customs Sees More Passengers Across Mainland-HK Control Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Passengers across the
mainland-Hong Kong control line through Luohu Customs of the
People's Republic of China reached 76.66 million in 1999,
representing an increase of 10 million over a year before, a
Chinese customs officer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers across the control line through Luohu
Customs has increased by more than 10 million annually over the
past three years, Ye Binpei, deputy director of Luohu Customs,
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The considerable increase in the number of passengers indicates
that the ties between mainland and Hong Kong are becoming closer,
especially after Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Economic development of the Chinese mainland is another factor
that contributes to the increase in the number of passengers, Ye
added.
</P>
<P>
Luohu Customs is located in the south of China's Shenzhen city.
Linked by a bridge with New Territory, Hong Kong, Luohu Customs
has been a major gateway of South China to Hong Kong and the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
Luohu Customs tops all its domestic counterparts in terms of
the number of passengers it handles, Ye said, noting that it now
handles forty percent of the total of passengers going into and
out of the mainland of China.
</P>
<P>
To meet the increasing need of passengers, Luohu Customs has
innovated its devices and improved its services, such as using
high-tech devices in the crackdown on smuggling and taking
measures to shorten the passengers' waiting time, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Two passenger channels have been broadened to make passing more
convenient and its innovated computer system has made customs
inspection more efficient.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 alone, Luohu Customs had thwarted 7,286 cases of
smuggling and other forms of offenses, with a value of 245 million
RMB yuan (29.88 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
With the approaching of the Chinese Lunar new year, more
passengers are expected to go through Luohu Customs into and out
of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Ye said all the customs officers have been fully prepared for
the new year holidays and will do their best to provide good
services for passengers.

<HEADLINE> China's Wetland Natural Reserves Increase to 260 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics offered by
the National Administration of Forestry (NAF) indicate that the
number of China's wetland reserves has risen to 260, covering an
area of more than 16 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
NAF Vice-Director Ma Fu said today, which is the World Wetland
Day, that China plans to build more wetland reserves in its
northeast and northwest regions, and will work to get more of
China's wetlands added to the list of Wetlands of International
Importance this year.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 65.9 million hectares of wetlands,
accounting for some ten percent of the world's total. Since the
country signed the Wetlands Convention of International Importance,
Especially in Waterfowl Habitats, in 1992, seven of the country's
wetland sites have been included on the international list.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands area has been declining in China, especially in recent
years, due to population growth and rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
NAF Statistics show that in the past 40 years, the country lost
some two million hectares of wetlands or one half of the acreage
of the country's coastal wetlands.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China has set up its first
national air pollution forecasting system to let local residents
know the level of contamination in some 36 hours and one week
ahead, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The system, developed by Yang Yuanqin, a senior engineer of the
China Meteorological Center, and her colleagues, is capable of
providing such forecasts for 50 of the country's major cities.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Proposal Stirs Up Diplomatic Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's initiative to form a so-
called Turkic commonwealth in Central Asia has evoked a protest
from Russia, reported Turkish Daily News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Abdulhaluk Cay said on January 19 that
Turkey stands for an ethnic-based commonwealth with Turkic
republics in Central Asia, plus Azerbaijan in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Cay, who is responsible for Ankara's ties with the Turkic
republics, said that a future community could be based on the
principles of the Arab League and Russia could be invited to join
the organization.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on January 28,
underlining that Cay's proposal was not parallel with the improving
friendly relations between Turkey and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The statement also held that efforts to create a closed, ethnic
community would be against the spirit of cooperation and mutual
understanding in Central Asia and the Caucusus.
</P>
<P>
Russian diplomats in Ankara told the English-language newspaper
Tuesday called on the Turkish Foreign Ministry to clarify Ankara's
position.
</P>
<P>
Cay reacted Tuesday indifferently to the Russian anger,
describing Moscow's reaction as "unreasonable and over-reacted."
</P>
<P>
"We are the heirs to the Ottoman Empire, and some 22 countries
were carved from Ottoman lands. We never intervened in the domestic
affairs of countries such as Syria, Egypt or Bulgaria. We got used
to it, and Russia should as well. These Turkic republics are
independent and sovereign states," argued Cay.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, an unidentified Foreign Minsitry official tried to
play down the diplomatic quarrel, claiming that Cay's remarks were
exaggerated as there was no concrete proposal, reported the paper.
It was just a brainstorming exercise and an issue not even worth
commenting, the official put it.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Bombard South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes fired three
air-to-surface missiles Wednesday morning at the region between
Shaitiya and Zabkeen in the western sector of south Lebanon,
lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese army ground defence systems repelled the raiding
aircraft, the sources added. But they did not make mention of
subsequent damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
After the raids, Israeli warplanes flew in reconnaissance
sorties over Nabatiya and Iqlim al Toffah in the central sector,
mounting mock raids and dropping flares, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's gunboats patrolling the southern coast also opened fire
wednesday morning at the Lebanese shores, but the attack did not
claim any casualties, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Tentions have mounted recently in south Lebanon after three
Israeli solider and a commander of Israeli-allied South Lebanon
Army were killed by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas. The
killings came amid a recently stalled Syrian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a war to oust the Israeli
occupation troops, who carved out a border zone in 1985 with a
claimed aim of protecting Israel's north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks, out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Russia Offers to Sell Spy Satellite Photographs to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua)-- Russia is offering to sell to
Israel photographs taken by Russian spy satellites while orbiting
over the Middle East country, the local daily Ha'aretz reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made last week by Russian Deputy Director for
International Cooperation Alexander Medvedchikov when he met with
Israeli Space Agency chief Aviv Har-Even in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Israel was somewhat surprised by the Russian offer because the
United States has consistently refused to allow other countries to
have access to photographs taken by its satellites.
</P>
<P>
A degree of concern has also been voiced by those who fear that
Russia may have agreed to sell the aerial photographs of the
Israeli territory to other states.
</P>
<P>
The Russians have said they will open up their archives to
Israel, making available for the first time all photographs taken
of the country in variety of resolutions, ranging from one meter to
20 meters.
</P>
<P>
At a resolution of one meter, vehicles moving along roads can be
identified.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli source said the shots were taken by Russian spy
satellites on a systematic basis, with many dating back to the days
of the Soviet Union, when satellites were used by the hostile
regime to monitor Israel's advances in defense and weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The photographs up for sale are all in black-and-white and the
sale of such shots can fetch several thousand U.S. dollars on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Russia is making no secret of the fact that the offer is being
made to raise desperately needed funds for its space program.
</P>
<P>
Israel is seriously considering the offer, since it does not
have a complete set of space photographs of its territory.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Ofek-3 satellite does not photograph the Israeli
territory.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Opposition Parties Blast Annan Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Opposition parties in Cyprus
have expressed outrage at the comments by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan that all issues, including the demands of the Turkish
Cypriot side, are on the table of Cyprus peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side, backed by Turkey, has demanded the
recognition of its regime in northern Cyprus, now only recognized
by Ankara, and equal basis for its talks with Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Nicosia government, dominated by Greek Cypriots, have
repeatedly rejected the demand and insisted on a bizonal,
bicommunal federation settlement to reunite the island.
</P>
<P>
The second round of proximity talks on the Cyprus issue started
Monday in Geneva under the auspices of the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the talks, Annan said the parties will be
discussing all the core issues, as well as issues added by the
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish Cypriot press reports quoting U.N.
resources, there are seven core issues on the table: confederation,
security, sovereignty, constitution, freedom of settlement, freedom
of movement and confidence building measures.
</P>
<P>
Demetris Christofias, general secretary of the left wing AKEL
party, criticized Annan's statement as unacceptable "because we
consider the Secretary-General to be the one most responsible for
defending U.N. resolution and the principles of these resolutions."
</P>
<P>
These resolutions condemn the breakaway regime in the north, he
said, adding that the Secretary-General should have made this
clear.
</P>
<P>
Christofias also blamed the United States and Britain, saying
they have influenced Annan.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cyprus government's stance over the issue was
disappointing and called on it to defend the Greek Cypriot side's
position.
</P>
<P>
Nicos Cleanthous, deputy of Democracy party, said the procedure
being followed allows Denktash to have his unacceptable demands
presented and discussed.
</P>
<P>
He said his party is not proposing that the government pull out
of the talks, but said they should have reacted differently.
</P>
<P>
Nicos Anastassiades, acting president and leader of the ruling
Democratic Rally party, said he felt Annan's comments could have
been avoided.
</P>
<P>
Some local newspapers also took a critical stance, claiming that
Annan "opened the window of recognition for the pseudo-state."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third after a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.

<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Cold weather continues throughout
Turkey with heavy snow leading to the closure of traffic and
reports of people frozen to death, Turkish Daily News reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Hakkari province of eastern Anatolia, snow accumulated to a
depth of two meters, causing authorities to evacuate the entire
village of Doganli for fear of avalanche.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow has led to the closure of a number of roads in inland
Anatolia. Six village roads are still closed in Cankiri, and
transport has been seriously affected in Sivas with 654 village
roads blocked.
</P>
<P>
Two-meter-deep snow has led to the closure of the popular
tourist sight of Nemrut Dag, in the same region.
</P>
<P>
In Aksaray province of central Anatolia, a 45-year-old man was
frozen to death on his way home in the village of Yanyurt. In
Kayseri, police also found the frozen body of a man who left his
house three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
Crops were gravely hit by the latest freeze, the report added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Family members and associates of
victims of Kenya Airways' crashed Airbus A310 in Nigeria will fly
later on Wednesday to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, to identify the
dead.
</P>
<P>
Friends and relations of the victims besieged the airline's
office at Lagos Murtala Muhammed International Airport Tuesday
for details of their relatives, reported the Guardian, a leading
Nigerian newspaper Wednesday.

the living when it plunged into the Atlantic on Sunday evening.
It was carrying two human remains in its cargo hole as well.
</P>
<P>
But the paper said the destinations of the bodies were not
clear.
</P>
<P>
The airline officials said the relatives must first identify

 international airport as the bereaved Nigerians wept
uncontrollably Tuesday.

Meanwhile, divers from the Kenyan Navy are expected to arrive
in Abidjan this morning to continue with the rescue operations.

A trauma team from England and another from Kenya Airways
arrived in Lagos Tuesday to talk with the bereaved.

<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The eight-week-old power-sharing executive in Northern
Ireland was facing collapse Tuesday after the IRA failed to hand
over any guns.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's Office of Fair Trading and Competition Commission
are set for a radical overhaul as part of the government plans to
reduce the political involvement in approving takeovers and
mergers.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Strict new rules requiring all family doctors to disclose
criminal convictions and report deaths in their surgeries are to
be introduced by the British government in an attempt to reassure
patients in the wake of Harold Shipman's conviction for 15 murders.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Japan's Parliament Enacts Bill to Cut Lower House Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Diet, or parliament, on
Wednesday enacted a bill to reduce the number of House of
Representatives seats in the absence of opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The House of Councilors approved the bill with the support of
the three parties of the ruling coalition, the Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP), the Liberal Party (LP) and the New Komeito party.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the
Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and the Social Democratic Party (
SDP) boycotted the upper house plenary session to protest against
what they called the coalition's railroading of the bill.
</P>
<P>
The legislation will reduce the number of lower house members
chosen by proportional representation from 200 to 180.
</P>
<P>
Japan's opposition camp has been boycotting Diet sessions since
last week to protest against the ruling bloc's handling of the
bill, which cleared the lower house last Thursday, also in the
absence of opposition legislators.
</P>
<P>
The ruling bloc took the unusual step of skipping debates at an
upper house committee before the plenary session voted on the bill.
</P>
<P>
Bills are usually debated and voted on in a committee before
being sent to a plenary session.
</P>
<P>
The enactment is certain to further antagonize the opposition
camp and will probably make it even more difficult to put the
derailed current Diet session back on track, political observers
said.
</P>
<P>
The seat-cut plan was part of a set of policy agreements
reached between the LDP and the LP when they joined forces in
January 1999.

</P>
<P>
Yang slammed the anti-move of the U.S. congress, lambasting it
as "a complete violation of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques
and relevant commitments made by the U.S. side, a serious
encroachment on China's sovereignty, a gross interference in China
's internal affairs, and an attempt to make 'One China, One Taiwan
', or 'Two Chinas'." The Chinese government and people express
their utmost indignation at and firm opposition to such acts.

<HEADLINE> No Choice on Nuclear Power Station Bid Yet: Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is appearing to be still
wavering on which consortium to be chosen to build its first
nuclear power station, according to a report of the Antolia News
Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Cumhur Ersumer
announced Tuesday a new deadline of March 1 for the final decision
on the tender winner. The original deadline was January 31.
</P>
<P>
Energy shortage has oblige the Turkish government to build the
country's first nuclear power plant in Akkuyu on the Mediterranean
coast, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Three international consortia bid in 1977 for the 3 billion U.S.
dollars project. The bidders included companies from the U.S.,
Japan, Germany, Canada and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The project was postponed again and again due to a controversy
both at home and abroad over the impact on environment. Greenpeace
activists expressed their strong opposition. The delay this time,
however, was reportedly caused by failure in completing tender
procedures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are signs indicating that the Canadians may be
favored. Ersumer Tuesday met with visiting Canadian Minister of
Economic Development and National Income Martin Cauchon.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed current and potential joint energy investment
projects. We are negotiating with Canadian firms to construct five
hydroelectric power plants -- the Rize Derekoy, Erzurum Laleli,
Sirnak Cizre, Gumushane Tasova and Hallari Cetin dams," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we can start to construct these five dams and hydroelectric
power plants, we will discuss new projects. We also talked about
the latest developments over the Akkuyu nuclear power station bid.
The Canadians openly explained their position."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Canadians reportedly offered the Turkish
side financial support if they were to win the nuclear plant bid.
An official from the ministry said privately that the offer had
increased the chances of the Canadian consortium.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Exports to Arab World Decline in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli exports to the Arab
world fell by 6.1 percent last year to 101.1 million U.S. dollars
due to the stalled Middle East peace process and ensuing chilly
bilateral commercial relations.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post daily quoted Wednesday Moshe Nahum, head of
the foreign trade division of Israeli Manufactures Association, as
saying that the cold diplomatic relations between Israel and the
Arab states affect their economic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Saudi Arabia alone fell by 31 percent to 854,000
dollars in 1999 while those to other Gulf states down by 47 percent
to just 735,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The reports also listed that exports to Jordan fell by 19
percent to about 21 million dollars and to Morocco by 31.6 percent
to 7.1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although exports to Egypt grew by 1.8 percent to about 54
million dollars, Nahum said it was apparently thanks to a
turnaround towards the end of the year. In the first nine months of
1999, exports to Egypt had been down by 3 percent comparing to the
same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, exports to Tunisia grew by 4.5 percent and to Lebanon
went steady last year.
</P>
<P>
Nahum expressed hopes for a renewed process to facilitate
economic ties between the Arab world and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Israel Delays Deal with U.S. on Apaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel is delaying a deal on
buying Apache "Longbow" attack helicopters from the United States
because U.S. has rejected Israeli access to the software of the
main onboard computer, a local daily said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal, estimated to cost 415 million U.S. dollars, is
expected to be followed by the purchase of 48 more Apache
helicopters for a total cost of 1.6 billion dollars, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Air Force Chief Major General Eitan Ben-Eliahu
as saying the main obstacle to the signing of the deal is the U.S.
refusal to release the information on the helicopter's central
computer.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Eliahu said access to the program's secret code is essential
in order to perform continuous maintenance and continuous
adjustment of the helicopter's defenses to the development of new
threats, such as new anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Among other functions, the computer runs the Apache's fire-
control system and its electronic warfare suite which protects the
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Air Force (IAF) has decided to upgrade a dozen of
the Apache attack helicopters in its fleet with the advanced "
Longbow" system, which was developed by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The "Longbow" combines a radar system with advanced "Hellfire"
anti-tank missiles, giving the helicopter enhanced target
acquisition capabilities and increased firepower.
</P>
<P>
The IAF has made it clear that it is unwilling to purchase
advanced attack helicopters if it is not granted access to the
central computer.
</P>
<P>
A senior defense source said that there will be no progress on
the deal until the United States releases the necessary data to
Israel.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Educational Inspection System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China has renamed the
Educational Inspection Group under the Ministry of Education as
the National Educational Inspection Group, in a bid to strengthen
education inspection over primary and middle schools across the
country.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Education (MOE) said here
today that the group's duty is to check for quality-oriented
education, and also to inspect local governments' enforcement of
national education policies, including education investment and
classroom and school building environments.
</P>
<P>
The organization is also charged with creating education
inspection policies and educational appraisal system, and
directing local governments in ways of improving education.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Jinhui, an official from the National Educational
Inspection Group, said her people will review education practices
and programs in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
China has promulgated the Compulsory Education Law in 1986, and
also resumed the education inspection system in the same year. Its
Education Law set the education inspection system and education
appraisal system as two of the country's basic law systems in the
field of education.
</P>
<P>
China set up its modern education inspection system at the end
of Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), but it was suspended for over two
decades after the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, China had formed education inspection
groups at four government levels -- central, provincial, city and
county governments -- which have helped push forward education
reform and development of middle and primary school education.
</P>
<P>
China's 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities
have set up educational inspection organizations, with 24,800
staff members. Liu Bin, a former vice-chairman of the State
Education Commission, is the country's Educational Inspector-
General.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM to visit Jordan on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
is scheduled to visit Amman on Sunday to meet King Abdullah Bin
Hussein on bilateral ties and developments of the Middle East peace
process, Jordanian officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the summit would be the developments and
obstacles facing the peace talks between Israel, Syria and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The meeting follows talks Barak held in Cairo last weekend with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt are the only Arab countries that have signed a
peace treaty with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Barak`s visit to Amman comes at a time when Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators are conducting intense talks to meet a
February 13 deadline to lay down a framework for a final peace
scheduled for September.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks resumed in Washington last September
after a 45-month break, but the talks broke down again after Syria
said Israel should submit a written commitment for the handback in
full of the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been an active peace broker in the region by trying
to bridge differences between Israel and Arab countries since it
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Before the resumption of Syrian-Israeli peace talks in
Washington, Jordan had played a constructive role in ferrying
messages between Damascus and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has described peace as its strategic option in dealing
with regional affairs, and said it supported all efforts by all
parties which could lead to a just, durable and comprehensive peace
in the region.

JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestine Liberation Organization's 120-member central
council is to convene in Gaza Wednesday to decide whether to set a
new date for the declaration of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian officials said it is unlikely the PLO's mini-
parliament will set September as the deadline for the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel has promised the Palestinians and Egypt to
implement the 6.1 percent pullout from the West Bank within 10
days.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Russia is offering to sell to Israel photographs taken by
Russian spy satellites while orbiting over Israel. The offer was
made last week by Russian Deputy Director for International
cooperation Alexandr I. Medvedchikov when he met with Israeli Space
Agency chief Avi Har Even in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Israel is seriously considering the offer, since it does not
have a complete set of space photographs of its territory.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Two Israeli businessmen were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of
selling surplus U.S. military equipment, including armored
personnel carriers (APCs) to Iran via an intermediary in the Far
East.
</P>
<P>
The arrest was preceded by a year-long secret investigation by
the police national unit on international crimes, launched at the
request of the police forces of Germany and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak traveled north Tuesday,
meeting with Israel Defense Forces and South Lebanon Army soldiers
and officers. Barak said he will not allow the desire to strike
back at Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas to blind him to the country's
larger goal of resuming talks and reaching peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak's tone was much more conciliatory than that of some of his
cabinet ministers, including Deputy Defense Minister Efraim Sneh,
who blamed Syria for the escalation of violence, and demanded a
cease-fire in south Lebanon before the talks are resumed.

<HEADLINE> Too Many Banks in Gulf: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries have become saturated with banks and despite their
strong economies, not a single Gulf bank was among the top 100
global banks, a study said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of banks and financial institutions in the GCC
countries has been put at 950, with total assets amounting to 197
billion U.S. dollars, according to the study by the GCC Federation
of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, which was published on the
local Gulf News daily.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia accounts for 46.2 percent of the total assets,
followed by the United Arab Emirates with 26 percent, Kuwait 17.8
percent, Qatar 4.8 percent, Oman 2.7 percent and Bahrain 2.5
percent, the study said.
</P>
<P>
As the biggest bank in the Gulf, the National Commercial Bank of
Saudi Arabia, ranks the 116th worldwide, followed by Bank of Riyadh
at the 166th and the Arab Banking Corp. at the 175th.
</P>
<P>
The study said the more the number of banks in Gulf countries,
the less the volume and efficiency. Too many banks only result in
high operating costs, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested the banks should merge so as to improve
efficiency and strength.
</P>
<P>
It urged the banks to play a key role in national stock markets
and to make use of the investment opportunities which may result
from liberalization, locally and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Manila Steps Up Measures to Lessen Dependence on Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
intensified its efforts at developing indigenous and renewable
sources of power in a bid to lessen the country's dependence on
crude oil for its energy requirements, a senior official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui said in a press statement that
this is also part of the long-term measures being pursued by the
government to shield consumers from the impact of changes in the
prices of crude oil in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Tiaoqui said that as of efforts to raise the country's energy
self-reliance level, dependence on imported oil has been reduced
to roughly half of the national energy requirements.
</P>
<P>
The significant reduction on oil dependence can be attributed
to the successful efforts by the government to harness indigenous
sources of energy, such as hydro sources, solar, wind and mini-
hydro power.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to make progress on our efforts to further raise
our energy self-reliance level," Tiaoqui said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, he pointed out, new and renewable energy resources
contributed to 28.6 percent of the country's total energy
requirements, while geothermal power accounted for 7 percent,
hydro power for 3.7 percent and coal for 13.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Child Labor Increases in Most Sectors in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Child employment is
increasing rapidly in most sectors in Tanzania and becoming a
serious problem in the east African country, "The African"
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Plantations, mining, petty business, commercial sex and
domestic work as the main fields attracting child labor in
Tanzania, according to Festo Muzee, an official of the Tanzanian
Ministry of Labor and Youth Development.
</P>
<P>
Muzee attributed increasing child labor to poverty, lack of
parental care, inadequate school facilities and other social ills.
</P>
<P>
But he did not give the exact number of child labor in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Children worked in very difficult conditions which could lead
to retarded growth and make them miss some basic rights, Muzee
noted.
</P>
<P>
The labor official called for change of attitudes by employers
and urged media institutions to expose the dark side of child
labor in the country so as to put to an end the unwanted
situation.
</P>
<P>
The International Labor Organization (ILO) prohibits the
employment of children below the age of 18.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya police are looking for
businessmen Akasha Abdalla Ibrahim and his son Baktash Akasha
over the 4.8-ton hashish haul seized in Kenya's southeastern port
city of Mombasa last week.
</P>
<P>
Anti-narcotics police said that they believed Akasha Ibrahim,
the Palestinian national, was in Holland while his son could be
hiding in Mombasa, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, the Kenyan police recovered 4,715 kilograms of
hashish from a house leased to the Akashas in Nyali Estate in the
north coast.
</P>
<P>
The seizure is the largest drug bust with a street value of
over 13.6 million U.S. dollars in Mombasa since 20 tons of
hashish was found at the south coast hamlet of Bodo in 1996, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said police had held a director of a clearing and
forwarding firm said to have handled the consignment at the port.
</P>
<P>
Senior Superintendent Michael Jackobam, head of Kenya's
Anti-Narcotics Squad, said every effort was being made to trace
and arrest the two.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya police have appealed to the public to volunteer any
information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Export Undermined by Marketing Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Liberalization of cash
crops marketing has partly undermined Tanzania's export
performance, the Tanzanian central bank said in its latest
economic report.
</P>
<P>
On an annual basis, Tanzanian export for the year ending in
December 1999 decreased by 8.1 percent to 541 million U.S. dollars
from 588.5 million dollars recorded during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Tanzania said in its review for December 1999 that
earnings from traditional export crops, namely coffee, cotton, tea
and tobacco, were dwindling mainly due to decline in export
volumes.
</P>
<P>
The fall in export volumes is partly attributable to weak
procedures and systematic arrangements guiding procurement and
marketing of commodities after liberalization of crop marketing.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania liberalized cash crop marketing some five years ago,
in a move aimed at widening the opportunity for farmers to sell
their produce, "The African" newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was anticipated that with more buyers in the market, farmers
would bargain for better prices and terms, as opposed to a system
where cooperative union and marketing boards bought crops on
credit.
</P>
<P>
However, there had been complaints from various parts of the
country that many private traders were inexperienced in cash crop
procurement, while others reportedly bought crops at very low
prices.

BELGRADE -- The Joint Interim Administrative Council,
established by Yugoslavia to govern Kosovo together with the U.N.
special mission, issued a statement Tuesday slamming the U.N.
mission's plan for a separate census in the ethnically troubled
province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner proclaimed that
the mission will conduct a census in Kosovo next month, one year
ahead of the date of a nationwide census announced by the National
Statistics Bureau of Yugoslavia. In the statement, the council
said the U.N. mission's plan violates the U.N. Resolution 1244,
which requires the safe and free return of all refugees and
displaced persons of Kosovo to their homes, and constitutes an
infringement upon Yugoslavia's sovereignty. (Yugoslavia-Kosovo)

TOKYO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Ai Sugiyama of Japan became the
first seed to be eliminated in the Pan Pacific Open tennis
tournament as she lost to Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia in the
first round here on Wednesday.

<P>
The eighth seed, who reached her first quarter-finals in a
Grand Slam event last week in Melbourne, fell victim to the 1998
Wimbledon junior champion, losing 3-6, 3-6 in 58 minutes.

in the first game of the second set against 18-year-old Srebotnik.

"I really wanted to show a good performance on my home ground,
because I reached the last eight in the Australian Open. I was
rushing too much mentally and put pressure on myself," said
Sugiyama

herself on course against a probable quarter-final meeting against
Pierce, who received a first-round bye and plays American Lilia

<HEADLINE> 14 Myanmar Pirates Sentenced to Death, Life in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A local court in south China
has handed down sentences ranging from imprisonment to death for
14 Myanmarese pirates charged with raiding a Taiwanese cargo ship
and setting its 19 crew members adrift in the Andaman Sea.
</P>
<P>
The head of the pirate gang, Maung Htay Aung, was given the
death sentence. Two other principals, Kwaw Soe and Kyaw Soe Lin
were sentenced to life in prison, according to information from
the Intermediate People's Court of Fangchenggang, a port city in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Eleven other pirates were also sentenced in the court's first-
instance trial to prison terms from five to 13 years, were given
varied fines and were deported from China, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the pirates hijacked the Marine
Master cargo ship in the small hours of March 17, 1999, which was
sailing through the Andaman Sea south of Myanmar, heading from
China's eastern port of Zhangjiagang to Calcutta, India, when the
pirates boarded the ship.
</P>
<P>
Armed with guns and knives, the pirates ransacked the ship,
stole and seized cargoes of alkali, and crew members' valuables
with a total value of 1.32 million yuan (160,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The crew was forced into a lifeboat, which floated for 10 days
before being rescued by fishermen from Thailand. Meanwhile, the
pirates disguised the cargo ship and sailed it to the port of
Shantou in south China's Guangdong Province, where they sold the
cargo.
</P>
<P>
When the ship arrived at the city of Fangchenggang for repairs
on April 8, local police spotted it and arrested the pirates.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar pirates have all appealed their convictions to the
Supreme People's Court of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
said the sources.

<HEADLINE> No El Nino Event Before This Fall: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese oceanographers expect
no major climatic repercussions from El Nino before this fall, as
surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean remain
unusually cold.
</P>
<P>
Experts, including those with the National Marine
Environmental Forecasting Center, have made the conclusion after
their analysis of the tropical Pacific marine situation and global
climatic change.
</P>
<P>
The temperature of the surface waters of the eastern
equatorial Pacific Ocean, the home of El Nino, has remained below
the average since June 1998, said the experts participating in a
State-funded program on the issue.
</P>
<P>
El Nino normally leads to global anomalies in weather and
climate, including heavy summer rains in China that can cause
devastating floods. (

Railway official confirmed.

<P>
Diesel worth 1.2 billion kwacha (about 4.6 million U.S.

Probably if policemen were not involved in the scam, the racket

Nine railway workers were caught red handed decanting diesel

Zambia, he said.

They have been sacked and 18 others suspended, the railway
official said.

Erbacher confirmed that the suspects had been stealing diesel
systematically and investigations are still going on.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese across the country are
doing the holiday hustle to get ready for Spring Festival, the
traditional Chinese New Year which this year falls on February 5.
</P>
<P>
It's the most important Chinese holiday and a time of mass
migration as people nationwide travel home for week-long family
reunions and partying.
</P>
<P>
Chinese will display in windows and on doors Spring Festival
couplets, Chinese characters for peace and prosperity written in
black ink on red paper. On Pingan Avenue in Beijing Tuesday,stores
and apartments buildings were decorated with bold Spring Festival
couplets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, regional and local governments are contributing to
the New Year celebrations. The government of central China's Hunan
Province bought 7.5 million yuan-worth (about 0.9 million U.S.
dollars) of rice for its laid-off workers. Altogether, Hunan has
allocated 60.5 million yuan (about 7.3 million U.S. dollars) for
food for its poor residents at Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Jiangxi Province, 21,214 flood-stricken
residents have moved into new homes. And new roads and bridges
have been completed in the flood-hit areas to make travel more
convenient for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
People in Yongchang Village of Tianyang County in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region received special New Year's
presents: their first trade company started operation and the
first computer in the village has been connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The computer was donated by the Nanning Tobacco Corporation,
which also will send some performance troupes and medical teams to
the village during the festival.

<HEADLINE> Legal Assistance Hotline To Cover All of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government-employed legal consultants took 1.35 million phone
calls in 1999 from the hotline.
</P>
<P>
The hotline, first initiated in March 1998 by the Dongming
County Justice Bureau of Shandong Province, has since been
extended to link up the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The phonetic pronounciation of "148" --"Yao Si Fa"-- means "
seeking justice" in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary citizens can dial the number for legal consultation,
hiring a lawyer, requesting notarization, and other kinds of free
or paid services.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the widespread popularity of the hotline, and to
promote the rule of law in China, the Ministry of Justice decided
to make such a hotline available nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Now, the 148 hotline is available in 2,938 counties, or 96.2
percent of all counties in the country, and soon the entire nation
will be covered, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
More than 31,000 people across the country are working in these
hotline operations.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that the hotline
office workers provided legal consultations to 1.35 million people
and received 400,000 visitors with legal problems last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, justice bureaus across the country handled a
total of 220,000 legal cases transferred from the hotlines,
mediated in 140,000 disputes, and provided legal assistance to
more than 20,000 people who could not afford lawyers.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.9 billion yuan of economic losses were avoided or
recovered for hotline users last year.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenal success has drawn the attention of foreign legal
experts, with Australia, Vietnam, Canada and Chile governments
sending judicial delegations to China to review the practices, the
ministry said.

HANOI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bad weather and low temperatures
have hit farmers hard in several parts of Vietnam over the past
few weeks, the local daily Vietnam News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 km of dykes in the central province of Quang Tri's
Hai Lang District broke last week during flooding caused by
unusually heavy rains for January and high tides.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,000 hectares of newly-transplanted rice seedlings are
now underwater and 200 hectares were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
And in the Sa Pa District of the northern mountainous province
of Lao Cai, hail and up to 50 cm of snow fell on Sunday and Monday.
Schools in the province were closed and many cattle and horses
were reported to have died during the cold snap.
</P>
<P>
In the northern and central coastal provinces of the country,
the long cold spell and accompanying hoarfrost have damaged
thousands of hectares of coffee and tea crops.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit areas in the country were Son La, Lai Chau and
Nghe An provinces. In Son La alone, 2,753 hectares of coffee and
tea crops have been destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Speaker Urges Wiranto to Be "Non-Active" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Indonesian House
of Representatives (DPR) Akbar Tandjung on Wednesday urged
Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Gen. Wiranto to be
temporarily "non-active" to make sure that the investigation into
his alleged involvement in human rights abuses in East Timor goes
on well.
</P>
<P>
"To allow the investigation to proceed smoothly, it would be
better, I think, if Wiranto is non-active from his cabinet post,"
Tandjung told reporters at the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who was then Indonesian Military (TNI) chief when
riots and atrocities took place in East Timor, was put by the
National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) in the list of
those who have to be responsible for human rights abuses in the
breakaway province of East Timor before, during and after the U.N.-
sponsored direct ballot in August last year.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto along with five other high-ranking TNI officers have
been under fire since the Komnas HAM announced on Monday that they
were believed to have been involved in human rights violations in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
However, Tandjung expected that the investigation into human
rights abuses in East Timor would run without any constraint.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that such an investigation will run smoothly,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman has said that
after receiving the report from the Komnas HAM, his office would
soon establish a coordinating team to launch further
investigations into human rights abuses in East Timor and bring to
justice those allegedly directly or indirectly involved in what
the Komnas HAM said is a crime against humanity.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, President Abdurrahman Wahid, who is currently on a
European tour, reportedly said he would sack Wiranto on his return
in Indonesia if the court finds him guilty.
</P>
<P>
But Wiranto Tuesday dismissed calls for his resignation, saying
he was determined to defend himself against charges of wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Eyeing Early Exit From IMF Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is eyeing
an early exit from the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) support
program, arguing that the economic recovery makes it unnecessary
for either Thailand or the IMF to commit to the ninth letter of
intent, the Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmannahaeminda was quoted as saying
that the Thai government is still in talk with IMF officials over
the possibility of not having to commit to the ninth letter of
intent because most of the major stabilization and reform works
have been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, we have found it no longer necessary to draw down any
money from the support program," he added.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials are presently in Bangkok reviewing Thailand's
financial and economic reforms under the 17.2 billion U.S. dollar
support program.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the IMF's financial support, Thailand is
obliged to follow policy conditions approved by the IMF's
Executive Board in order to correct macroeconomic imbalances and
deal with financial woes.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government was forced to seek a bailout from the IMF
in August 1997 after depleting most of its foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
However, with the baht stable, interest rates falling,
inflation low, exports higher, and strong domestic demand boosting
economic growth, Thailand has stopped drawing down IMF funds after
May 1999.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials are quite positive about Thailand's plan to exit
the IMF program earlier than this August, Tarrin said. Ultimately,
however, the IMF's Executive Board would make the final decision.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches War on Saboteurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
launched an all-out war on saboteurs and stern action has been
taken against them, the official Daily News said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of public sector employees who were found to be
engaged in acts of sabotage to bring the government and the
president into disrepute had been interdicted or sacked, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Offenses committed by these employees ranged from intimidation,
negligence of duty, corruption, retarding development and engaging
in political activities against the government.
</P>
<P>
In a bus company alone, several hundred employees had been
transferred for attempting to sabotage transport during the recent
presidential election, said the report, adding that the war on
sabotage would not be restricted to the public sector alone.
</P>
<P>
Those in the private sector who engaged in unfair trading
practices and under-the-counter deals including large scale tax
evasion and drug smuggling and treason would also be hounded out,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that strict action is to be taken against offenders
irrespective of the rank and posts they hold or their connections.

<HEADLINE> hke020218--Compulsory Licensing of AIDS Drug Unlikely in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Ministry of Public
Health is unlikely to opt for a compulsory licensing of the AIDS
drug didanosine (DDI) due to concerns on the impact on
international trade agreements, the Bangkok Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry would prefer negotiations rather than enforcing
compulsory licensing, said the newspaper, quoting Somsong Rukphao,
head of the ministry's communicable diseases control department.
</P>
<P>
DDI, produced by the U.S.-based pharmaceutical giant Brystol-
Myers Squibb, is sold at 41 baht (1.09 U.S. dollars) a tablet, a
price which the HIV/AIDS network claims the majority of patients
cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
AIDS activists and HIV/AIDS patients have been pushing the
government to enforce compulsory licensing on the drug by using
Article 51 of the intellectual property rights laws of the World
Trade Organization, which permits compulsory licensing of products
which will benefit the masses.
</P>
<P>
However, the Public Health Ministry is still not convinced that
the enforcement of compulsory licensing will not result in trade
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry is also against enforcing compulsory
licensing, according to the Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a letter has been sent by a U.S. trade representative
to the chairman of the Network of People with HIV/AIDS in Thailand,
saying they will not interfere with Thailand's internal law
enforcing procedures provided it does not violate international
trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
However, the Public Health Ministry considered the letter
merely "a diplomatic way of answering such issues."
</P>
<P>
The two ministries are yet to officially respond to the letter.
</P>
<P>
The Post said talks on a compromise would be initiated, which
is likely to bring down the price of the drug from 41 baht a
tablet to 31 baht (82 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Thailand has one million people with HIV,
the virus that could lead to AIDS, and 128,000 with full-blown
AIDS.

substantially reduced. The Deskpro EP Series with an Intel Pentium
III processor at 650 MHz, 128 MB RAM, a 10 GB hard drive, CD-ROM,
choice of Microsoft Windows 95/98, and a S710 17-inch monitor (16.
0-inch viewable), sells for 1,949 dollars, a drop of 13 percent.
All prices are based on estimated U.S. selling prices. Reselling
prices may vary.
</P>
<P>
Compaq said the nine new Deskpro EP Series PCs have been
designed to ease the installation of computers on office networks
by eliminating older internal set-up technology.
</P>
<P>
The new models feature Intel Corp. Celeron chips running at 466
MHz or 500 MHz or Intel Pentium III at 550 MHz or 600 MHz and a
choice of Microsoft Corp. operating systems.
</P>
<P>
Those running Windows NT can be upgraded to Microsoft's next
generation operating system as it becomes available later this
month.
</P>
<P>
Prices beginning at 989 dollars with a 15-inch monitor and the
products will be available this month, said the company.
</P>
<P>
Compaq has been hard hit in its commercial PC business by
competitive pressures in recent quarters and lost nearly 250
million dollars in the unit during the second half of 1999. It has
set a goal to return to profitability in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Compaq's rival Dell, the world's No. 2 largest PC
maker, said it cut U.S. prices on selected models of its Dell
Precision brand workstations up to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Workstations are high-powered PCs used by engineers and product
designers to handle complex data-crunching tasks. Dell is the
leading maker of workstations sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Today, a Dell Precision WorkStation 210 with a Pentium III
processor running at 650 MHz will sell for 1,740 dollars, a 17.1
percent reduction. Dell workstations begin at 1,423 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dell also cut prices on its mid-range Dell Precision
WorkStation 410 up to 15.5 percent. Total prices have not been
disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Sharply on Confidence in U.S. Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose
sharply Tuesday on investor's belief that the U.S. economy will
continue its growth this year despite a possible hike in interest
rates by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 100.52 at 11,041.05,
extending its gain of 201.66 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard and
Poor's 500 index rose 14.82 to 1,409.28 and the technology-
dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 111.63 to 4,051.98.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 3.11 at 624.84 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 12.83 at 873.08. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 7.52 at 503.75.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,699 up, 1,335 down and 494
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 974.38 million shares from 968.15
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied as the current expansion of the U.S. economy
became the longest in American history at 107 months today,
beating the old mark of 106 months set during the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
A report on strong corporate earnings in the final quarter of
1999 also encouraged investors to purchase well-known technology

raise interest rates to cool off the U.S. economy at a two-day

<HEADLINE> New Study Expects Huge Growth of Business-to-Business Software Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Sales in business-to-
business (B2B) software are expected to explode worldwide in the
next few years as electronic commerce grows, a U.S. research firm
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Delphi Group, the worldwide market for
software that companies use to develop their businesses online is
expected to grow from 5 billion U.S. dollars today to 40 billion
dollars in 2002.
</P>
<P>
These software tools represent the foundation for the 5
trillion dollars in global trade that Delphi has projected will
flow through vertical portals by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The market for software is just one part of the larger B2B E-
commerce industry. Such software tools are used to build systems
that handle Web transactions, track inventory, or collect other
business information.
</P>
<P>
In a separate survey last week, U.S. research firm Gartner
Group predicted that the volume of nonfinancial goods and
services sold through B2B E-commerce worldwide will grow from 145
billion dollars to 7.29 trillion dollars in 2004, or 7 percent of
the forecast total global economy of 105 trillion dollars. E-
marketers, the key catalysts in this transformation, will capture
37 percent of these transactions or 2.7 trillion dollars.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Gore Win in New Hampshire Primary in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator John McCain
scored a thumping victory over Republican presidential front-
runner George W. Bush in the nation's first primary in New
Hampshire State while Vice President Al Gore survived a toe-to-toe
challenge from his Democratic rival Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary results of the vote, McCain rolled up
49 percent of the vote compared to 31 percent for Bush.
</P>
<P>
Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes was a distant third at 13
percent and former Ambassador to the U.N. Alan Keyes was fourth at
7 percent. Social conservative Gary Bauer was struggling to
survive with only 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We have sent a powerful message to Washington that change is
coming," Arizona Senator McCain told cheering supporters.
</P>
<P>
McCain credited his agenda of political and campaign finance
reform for his victory. The Arizona senator invested most of his
pre-primary time and money in New Hampshire and won the support of
independent-minded voters.
</P>
<P>
"The Republican Party recovered its heritage of reform. And
it's beginning of the end of the truth-twisting politics of Bill
Clinton and Al Gore," he said.
</P>
<P>
The primary result has threatened to damage Bush's aura of
invincibility and made the competition for nomination of the
party's presidential candidate more tense. Analysts said Bush now
faced a tough new challenge to prove himself worthy of the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who was surprised at the results, acknowledged his defeat
and described it as "a bump in the road."
</P>
<P>
"The road to the Republican nomination is a long road. Mine
will go through all 50 states," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among Democrats, Gore had 52 percent of the vote against former
New Jersey Senator Bradley at 47 percent, solidifying his
Democratic front-runner status on Tuesday with his second victory
in the primary season.
</P>
<P>
"This was a hard-fought campaign. Senator Bradley was a tough
competitor who made us fight for every vote," Gore said, adding
that the tough fight has made him a better candidate.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Bush earned easy victories in their parties' January
24 caucuses in Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
"We've made a remarkable turnaround, but there is still a tough
fight ahead," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
After New Hampshire, the next big test for Gore and Bradley
comes on March 7, when 16 states hold presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
Republicans will compete in several states before March 7,
including Delaware, South Carolina, Arizona and Michigan.

<P>
Another major event this month in Thailand's sports circle is
picking the team which will fly to the IOC headquarters in
Lausanne on February 21 to attend the briefing of all bidding
cities for the Games of the Olympiad in 2008.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government had given go-ahead to the Thai National
Olympic Committee (TNOC)'s proposal to bid for the 2008 Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Other cities expressed their willingness to bid for Olympic
2008 include Beijing, Osaka, Paris, Istanbul, Toronto, Serville
and Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
TNOC President General Chettha Thanajaro said the TNOC is
confident to make a very strong case when the time comes.

<HEADLINE> AmericaOne Levels America's Cup Challenger Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, February 2 (Xinhua) -- AmericaOne came from behind to
win the sixth race of the America's Cup challenger series on
Wednesday as Italian Prada Challenge committed a series of errors.
</P>
<P>
Paul Cayard's AmericaOne, with retired tennis great Steffi Graf
on board, won the sixth race by nine seconds to level 3-3 in the
finals of the Louis Vuitton Cup.
</P>
<P>
The first boat to win five races will go on to challenge
holders New Zealand in the America's Cup from February 19.
</P>
<P>
The Italians looked set to open a decisive advantage in the
series after winning a tense start against Cayard with a lead of
20 seconds at the first mark, but disaster struck when its poor
crew who tried to lower the spinnaker, only saw the boat's huge
white sail drag in the water.
</P>
<P>
The boat slowed almost to a stop as the crew pulled the sail
back on board and skipper Francesco de Angelis watched helplessly
as the sail tore over the 24-metre yacht's bow.
</P>
<P>
Prada rounded the second mark 17 seconds ahead but was soon in
deep trouble with a piece of the spinnaker snarled around its
rudder.
</P>
<P>
The Italians dangled one crew member upside down over the side
of the boat, two crew mates holding him by the feet as he worked
furiously but with little success to free the cloth.
</P>
<P>
AmericaOne charged past to open a lead of 16 seconds by the
third mark.
</P>
<P>
Prada worked tirelessly to make up lost ground over the final
three legs, narrowing AmericaOne's lead to seven seconds at the
fourth and fifth marks.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Gore Win U.S. Leadoff Primary in New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Arizona Senator John McCain
scored a thumping victory over U.S. Republican presidential front-
runner George W. Bush on Tuesday in the leadoff primary in New
Hampshire State.
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, Vice-President Al Gore defeated rival
former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest unofficial returns from 41 percent of
New Hampshire's 300 Republican precincts, McCain had 48 percent of
the vote compared with 31 percent for Bush.
</P>
<P>
Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes was a distant third with 13
percent, and former Ambassador to the U.N. Alan Keyes got 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Social conservative Gary Bauer barely registered and was
struggling to survive with only 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among Democrats, in returns from 42 percent of the 300
precincts reporting, Gore had 54 percent of the vote and Bradley
had 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bradley, staggered by a big defeat in Iowa caucuses, sought to
recover his footing against Gore. Advisers said he planned to
challenge Gore to weekly debates through March 7.
</P>
<P>
"We've made a remarkable turnaround, but there is still a tough
fight ahead," Bradley said, congratulating Gore's victory.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the New Hampshire victory, McCain said, "We beat
him amongst everyone, men and women, Republican and independent,
young and old."
</P>
<P>
"It's remarkable," McCain said, "I never expected anything like
this."
</P>
<P>
He credited his agenda of political and campaign finance reform
for his success, and said New Hampshire voters provided the
momentum he needs to head toward South Carolina and other states
that vote later.
</P>
<P>
The Arizona senator invested most of his time and money in New
Hampshire and won the support of independent-minded voters there.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who was surprised at the results, acknowledged his defeat
and described it as "a bump in the road."
</P>
<P>
"New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners and this year will be no exception," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
"The road to the Republican nomination is a long road. Mine
will go through all 50 states," he added.
</P>
<P>
On January 24, Gore and Bush easily passed their parties'
caucuses in Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
After New Hampshire, Democrats face an unprecedented mountain
of primaries from New York to California on March 7.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned With Possible Far-Rightists' Entry in Austrian Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that its relations with Austria will be affected if the
far-right Freedom Party enters the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is concerned about the possibility of the
Freedom Party entering the government in Austria," Deputy State
Department spokesman James Foley told reporters at a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is attending a
Middle East peace conference in Moscow, earlier in the day
discussed the matter with Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel over telephone, Foley said, but refusing to give any
details about the conversation.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, the European Union (EU) announced it will cut back
diplomatic ties with Austria if the Freedom Party joined a
government.
</P>
<P>
"As of now, Austria has not formed a new government, however,
if the Freedom Party were to enter the Austrian government, this
would affect our relations and we would consider what steps to
take in that event," Foley stressed.
</P>
<P>
Joerg Haider, leader of the Freedom Party, is best known for
his remarks playing down the crimes of the Nazis during the Second
World War. The party is reportedly going to be invited to join the
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter ... that we consider seriously. It's
something that concerns us and, therefore, we're continuing to
keep the situation under review," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
Austria is a member of the 15-member EU and a close ally of the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Labor Talks End in U.S. With Differences on Allocations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Two-day talks on
compensating forced and slave labor under the Nazi regime ended in
Washington Tuesday, but differences remain on allocating 10
billion Deutsche marks (about 5 billion U.S. dollars) which
Germany has agreed to pay.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Israel, the U.S., Germany, Poland, the
Czech Republic, Ukraine, Russia and Belarus spent Tuesday
discussing a "concrete proposal" by the five East European
countries, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat told a
closing press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the "quite specific and detailed proposal," 8.8
billion marks (about 4.4 billion dollars) would be used for slave
and forced laborers, and 138 million marks (about 6.9 million
dollars) will be used for a category that is called "catch-all
category," Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
The category includes other atrocities, such as medical
experimentation, the deportation of children who were with parents
forced to work as slave laborers, and other claims that do not fit
within the slave or forced labor categories.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators agreed to meet again in Berlin on February 17.
"We hope at that session we can complete or come close to
completion of the allocation issue," Eizenstat told reporters.
</P>
<P>
After marathon talks, the German government and companies
agreed last month to pledge 10 billion Deutsche marks to build the
German Foundation Initiative.
</P>
<P>
In the latest round of talks in Washington, the negotiators
resolved a dispute over offsets, the technical term for deductions
from the compensation for money already paid.
</P>
<P>
"The most important breakthrough was on the issue of whether
payments made to those making claims from the foundation should be
offset by payments that may already have been received under prior
German compensation programs," Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
German negotiator Otto Lambsdorff agreed that Germany will
revise draft legislation that would have deducted compensation
money in cases of victims who had already received other payments
under those previous programs.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said that draft legislation by the German Finance
Ministry had permitted such offsets "would have been a potential
deal-breaker for a number of those on the victims' side."
</P>
<P>
"The breakthrough was ... we were able to reach a full
agreement that there will be no offsets of any public programs,
except for those private payments made by German companies to
their individual victims for which those victims performed slave/
enforced labor," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, the federal German government has paid
100 billion Deutsche marks (about 50 billion dollars) in
reparation and compensation to Holocaust survivors.

<P>
YANGON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has designated 80 roads
with a total length of 24,659 kilometers as the country's union
highways.
</P>
<P>
The number of highways is up from 11 in the past when it was

<HEADLINE> Nepali Officials to Visit Bhutan On Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A high-level Nepali
government delegation is to visit Bhutan this month to continue
the bilateral dialogue on refugee repatriation, The Kathmandu Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The English daily quoted Foreign Minister Dr. Ram Sharan Mahat
as saying Tuesday that the delegation to be headed by Foreign
Secretary Murari Sharma will be visiting Bhutan from February 14
to 17.
</P>
<P>
"Bhutan recently sent us an invitation for the talks and our
delegation will be going to Thimpu," Dr. Mahat said.
</P>
<P>
Bhutan's invitation was long overdue. It was originally slated
to invite a Nepali ministerial-level delegation in December, 1999,
but the invitation never materialized.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary level talks will prepare the grounds for the
ministerial level talks," said Dr. Mahat.
</P>
<P>
Eight rounds of ministerial talks between the two countries
have failed to reach any agreement on the repatriation of the
Bhutanese refugees. The last ministerial talks was held in
Kathmandu in September, 1999.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees who were evicted from Bhutan
around the 1990's are now living in eastern Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Seizes 68.5 Kilos of Heroin in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 68.5 kilograms of
heroin was seized by law enforcement officers in Sri Lanka last
year, a 40 percent rise over the previous year, the Police
Narcotics Bureau (PNB) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The PNB said in its annual report that the biggest haul of 12.
95 kilograms was made at the Bandaraniake International Airport in
suburban Colombo last November.
</P>
<P>
Other significant hauls were individual seizures of 9.05
kilograms, 5.85 kilograms, 5.25 kilograms and 4.5 kilograms by the
PNB, the Customs and the police.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 10,742 men and 111 women who were
involved in heroin trafficking and peddling were also arrested
last year.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling of heroin in Sri Lanka has been on the rise due
to its strategic location between two main drug producing areas --
the Golden Triangle of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos and the Golden
Crescent comprising Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, plagued by the drug problem at home, has also been
used by major drug traffickers as a transit point to transport
large quantities of heroin to Europe and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Rejects U.N. Mission Plan on Separate Census in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Interim
Administrative Council, established by Yugoslavia to govern Kosovo
together with the U.N. special mission, issued a statement Tuesday
slamming the U.N. mission's plan for a separate census in the
ethnically troubled province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner proclaimed that
the mission will conduct a census in Kosovo next month, one year
ahead of the date of a nationwide census announced by the National
Statistics Bureau of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the council said the U.N. mission's plan
violates the U.N. Resolution 1244, which requires the safe and
free return of all refugees and displaced persons of Kosovo to
their homes, and constitutes an infringement upon Yugoslavia's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The statement charged that by announcing a separate census in
Kosovo, Kouchner attempts to show that Belgrade, capital of
Yugoslavia, has nothing to do with Pristina, capital of the Kosovo
province, in order to pave way for its breakaway from the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement also noted that by the time of the national
census next year, about 350,000 non-Albanian Kosovo refugees would
have likely returned home and 200,000 illegal immigrants from
neighboring Albania and Macedonia would have been forced out, a
situation which surely would not favor the separatists.

<HEADLINE> Study Predicts Booming Logistics Industry in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Logistics, the process of
moving goods from suppliers to vendors and to customers, has been
the missing link in many E-commerce business plans, but now is
creating an emerging market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
New research from U.S. market analysis firm International Data
Corporation (IDC) has identified a burgeoning opportunity to
create and optimize a logistical business process.
</P>
<P>
Using information technology, the IDC said in a report released
Tuesday, an emerging group of service providers are offering:
ordering, fulfillment and transportation services that go beyond
the physical flow of the products and encompass the process and
information necessary to optimize a customer's logistics function.
</P>
<P>
According to the IDC, the increasing popularity of E-commerce
and E-business solutions is fueling tremendous opportunities in
the logistics business process outsourcing (LBPO) market.
</P>
<P>
"In a world of at-home delivery, the logistics industry makes E-
commerce possible," said the report. "Many dot-coms will very soon
realize that building a cyber business involves much more than
spending millions of dollars on marketing and advertising and will
very shortly shift their focus to actually delivering value,
rather than merely positioning to deliver it."
</P>
<P>
E-commerce demands will drive growth in the LBPO market well
into the new millennium. The IDC forecasts LBPO in the United
States will grow from 67 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 to 114
billion dollars in 2003.
</P>
<P>
During that time, the IDC said, the logistics industry will
undergo a transformation from an asset-driven business model to an
information-driven business model. To be successful, logistics
service providers will not only need experience in transportation
management, warehousing management, order fulfillment, freight
forwarding and reverse logistics, but will also need the ability
to help engineer their clients' business processes, according to
the IDC.

<HEADLINE> French Rower Gears Up for Epic Voyage across Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Marathon French rower Jo Le
Guen was Wednesday finishing preparations for his epic voyage,
rowing across the South Pacific from Wellington to Cape Horn in
Chile.
</P>
<P>
The journey has been delayed by several days due to southerly
winds that would blow against him as he sets off in a custom-built
rowboat. The 9,000-kilometre voyage, which is the first human
attempt to row across the Pacifi, is expected to take about four
months.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old told AFP that he aimed to leave here on
Thursday morning if the wind changed direction.
</P>
<P>
Le Guen has already traversed the Atlantic twice in rowboats.
</P>
<P>
He planned to row a maximum of eight hours a day in his nine-
meter French-made, plywood boat named Keep It Blue. He will spend
nearly all of the next few months in a sitting position while he
rows, lying down to sleep, with a scheduled 10 minutes a day
standing to maintain blood circulation in his feet.
</P>
<P>
And to gain enough energy for rowing about 75 kms a day, he
would have to eat up to 350 kilograms of food, consuming up to 6,
000 calories a day.
</P>
<P>
Through a satellite phone powered by solar cells, Le Guen will
send daily updates to friends who will log his adventures on
Internet site www.keepitblue.net.

<HEADLINE> Holiday Air Travel Likely to Set Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China's air passenger traffic
is expected to hit an all-time high this week, as millions of
travelers are rushing home for family reunions on Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
All major airports have reported busy but smooth operations
since the festival travel boom began more than a week ago, a
spokesman for the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)
was quoted by China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 6.8 million travelers are expected to fly during this
year's Spring Festival holidays that would be a new record in
China's airline service.
</P>
<P>
While most passengers are holiday travelers, there has also
been an increase in the number of other types of travelers, such
as businessmen and domestic tourists, said airline booking
officials.
</P>
<P>
Some domestic airlines have scheduled special night flights to
handle the surge in traffic for Spring Festival, which falls on
Saturday this year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's new International Airport is expected to carry 1.9
million passengers during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
On January 25, aircraft taking off from Guangzhou's Baiyun
International Airport reached a record 202, carrying a total of 23,
000 passengers. The flights included 32 charters and seven newly
scheduled departing flights.
</P>
<P>
In Sichuan Province, the Chengdu Shuangliu International
Airport is expected to see 6,700 airplane arrivals and departures
during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
The airport's passenger count during Spring Festival is
expected to reach 700,000 - five percent more than the
corresponding period last year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Wiranto Ignores Resignation Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Coordinating
Minister for Political Affairs and Security General Wiranto has
dismissed calls for his resignation over East Timor's human rights
abuses, saying he was determined to defend himself against charges
of wrongdoing, the local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I will decide based on a position that is clear and not based
on assumptions," Wiranto said when asked about his response to
President Abdurrahman Wahid's call for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said he would refuse to take any action before he gets
clarification from the president.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, who is currently on a European tour until February 13,
insisted that Wiranto step down from the post.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in London on Tuesday, the Indonesian
president said it was in Wiranto's interest to temporarily resign
from the cabinet, noting that it would ease pressure on Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
"There will be an ad interim minister, it means he will be
replaced by another person, then if the court, in its verdict,
finds him guilty, he will be removed," the president was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who was the Military (TNI) commander when East Timor
was in the throes of conflict, and other five generals were
incriminated on Monday in a report unveiled by the government-
sanctioned Commission of Inquiry into Human Rights Violations in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The report accused Wiranto and the other generals of backing up
anti-independence militias in a campaign of terror that saw
massive killing and burning in East Timor prior to and after the
August 30 United Nations-led ballot on the future of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto deplored the report, saying it disregarded his efforts
to prevent violence. He said both himself and TNI had made serious
efforts to ensure the ballot was a success.
</P>
<P>
"As a soldier, I am going to continue to fight to reveal the
truth," he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> World Trade System Against Australia: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia would continue to
fight unfair trade rules affecting agricultural and other
industries, Prime Minister John Howard said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Australia had a lot to gain from free trade but world trading
rules were loaded against his country, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Howard criticized U.S President Bill Clinton's performance on
trade issues, saying it was inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
"I would be the last person to defend the consistency of the
Clinton administration's performance on trade matters after what
they did to us over lamb," he told Sydney radio 2UE.
</P>
<P>
"We were not overly impressed with the Americans' position at
the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed damaging tariffs on Australian lamb
imports in July last year and has refused to ease them despite
appeals from the Australian government.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization (WTO) finding late last year
against Australia's 22-million-Australian dollars (14.52 million U.
S. dollars) in export assistance to the leather company Hoewe
Leather in the Victoria state highlighted inequities in the system,
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO ordered the Australian government to retrieve the money
or face penalties.
</P>
<P>
"And that illustrates the inequity of the world trading system,
" Howard said. "We will continue to fight that as strongly as we
can."
</P>
<P>
"But it illustrates the point that the world trading system is
loaded against countries like Australia and it's therefore very
important that these sort of inconsistencies be pointed out," he
added.

YANGON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's domestic production of
edible oil is not meeting its demand and it still has to import a
large amount of such oil from abroad, according to the latest
figures released by the country's Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar imported a total of 75.6 million U.S. dollars' worth of
edible oil in the first 10 months of 1999, a 27.51 percent drop

</P>
<P>
Myanmar annually imports 120 million dollars' worth of edible
oil.
</P>
<P>
As part of its efforts to gradually reduce the import of edible
oil, Myanmar has leased out large plots of vacant and virgin lands
to private entrepreneurs and provided the oil crop growers with
agricultural loans.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Thirty police officers, with
ranks ranging from captain to second sergeant, have been detained
in police internal affairs' cells in Jakarta, the Jakarta Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officers were detained in connection with criminal cases
that include murder, blackmail, violence, robbery and car theft,
according to chief of city police internal affairs Lt. Col.
Mustofa.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the way this year has started, there will

officers being caught," Mustofa was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The year 2000 has just begun, and already we have 30 police
officers waiting in line," he said.
</P>

In comparison, Mustofa said, dossiers of 73 police officers
were handed over to the Military Police in 1997, 45 officers in

</P>
<P>
But he added that the dossiers of some of the 30 officers being

"Still, it's an increase. Nevertheless, I urge city residents
to contact city police internal affairs if they are caught in a

<HEADLINE> McCain Beats Republican Front-Runner Bush in U.S. Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Arizona Senator John McCain
scored a convincing win over Texas governor George W. Bush in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to 4 percent of precincts reporting, McCain won 48
percent of the vote while Bush got 32 percent. Millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes is the third with 14 percent, and former U.
S. ambassador to the UN, Alan Keyes, stands fourth with 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The result surprised Republican national front-runner Bush and
weakened his drive to be the inevitable Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore beat former New
Jersey Senator Bill Bradley with 53 percent of the vote. Bradley
got 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
McCain said his showing was "remarkable." He said, "I never
expected anything like this. It has got to give us momentum."
</P>
<P>
McCain invested most of his time and money in the New Hampshire
primary and got the support of the state's independent-minded
voters.
</P>
<P>
His strategy was to score a victory in a primary that
historically has supported political mavericks, then use the
momentum to move on to South Carolina later this month.
</P>
<P>
"New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners and this year will be no exception," Bush said in
reaction to the result.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated McCain and pledged to campaign hard against
him in follow-up primaries. "The road to the Republican nomination
is a long road," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bush predicted his loss in the leadoff primary would be no more
than a "bump in the road" on the way to the White House.

Austria's 14 EU partners on Monday threatened to cut diplomatic
ties with Vienna if the far-right Freedom Party, led by Joerg
Haider, known for remarks of playing down the crimes of Nazis,
joins the new government headed by conservative leader Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic crisis, potentially the worst since the end of
World War II, is looming over the Republic of Austria. On Tuesday,
the United States followed the EU's step by announcing that it
will take similar moves if the rightist party enters the ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Despite fierce overseas opposition, Schuessel told reporters at
a joint news conference with Haider that the two parties had
agreed on the cabinet's program and their proposals will be
presented to the president for approval Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel's People's Party and Haider's Freedom Party each won
52 seats in the 183-seat parliament following elections last
October. Austria's biggest party, the Social Democratic Party led
by Chancellor Klima, with its 65 seats, have tried twice in vain
to form a joint government with Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel and Haider then started negotiations to form a
government without mandate from the president. Klestil did not try
to prevent them, saying that he will wait for the results before
making his own decision.
</P>
<P>
Openly opposing the far-rightists, Klestil is surely unwilling
to give approval to the coalition proposals. He has stressed that
what Austria needs is a stable government enjoying both majority
in parliament and good reputation in the international community.
</P>
<P>
If Klestil does not give his approval to a rightist-included
government, the only other way out is another election.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Group 7 Qualifiers Schedule Decided by Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The 2002 World Cup qualifying
schedule for Group Seven was decided by a draw here on Tuesday as
group members Spain, Israel, Austria, Bosnia and Liechtenstein
failed to reach an agreement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The result of the draw will see favorites Spain begin and end
their World Cup qualifying campaign with matches away against
Bosnia on September 2 this year and Liechtenstein on September 5
2001.
</P>
<P>
But Spanish coach Jose Antonio Camacho was more concerned about
a schedule that will see his side travel to Israel on June 6 next
year. "Our league will have finished when we take on Israel and
it will be very hot.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to play against the stronger teams in September
and June. The other teams didn't agree with that so we had a draw
and that's that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Austria, beaten 9-0 and 3-1 by Spain in Euro 2000 qualifiers,
will get the chance of revenge when they host the Spanish side on
October 11, with the return September 1 2001.
</P>
<P>
Israel, who finished runners-up to Spain in qualifying for the
European championships, begin their competitions with a home game
to Liechtenstein on September 3 and then travel to Spain on
October 7.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Crack Down Racism at Soccer Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian authorities will suspend
football matches if supporters unfurl banners containing racist
slogans, Interior Minister Enzo Bianco and deputy sports minister
Giuovanna Melandri warned here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move by Bianco and Melandri followed what happened last
Sunday at the Serie A match between Lazio and Bari when far-right
"ultra" fans of Lazio unfurled a banner glorifying a late Serb
militiaman and which also bore a portrait of Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to take tough action to ban all forms of violence at
sports venues be it physical, verbal or comprising the deployment
of banners inciting racism or anti-semitism," Bianco said.
</P>
<P>
Bianco said he was determined to crack down on the violent
minority and urged the public to back his campaign, which includes
plans to increase security personnel at matches and increase
security checks.
</P>
<P>
He added that if the problem persisted some matches would have
to held behind closed doors.

SHANGHAI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai set a record to earn
more than 10 billion yuan (more than 1 billion U.S. dollars) in
advertising sales last year, making the city the biggest
advertising market in China, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's yearly advertising sales accounted for about 18
percent of the nation's total. Advertising has become one of the

Thanks to the recovery of Asia's economy, the city's
advertising sales rebounded in 1999 and reached 10.67 billion yuan,
a 12.3-percent rise on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Among the 2,326 local advertising companies, 62 are backed by

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Oil Income Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican state oil
company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) said Tuesday that its oil
exports totaled 8.859 billion U.S. dollars last year, a 37 percent
increase over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the increase to the good price on the
international oil market.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's crude oil exports were quoted in 1999 at an average
price of 15.62 dollars per barrel, five dollars higher than in
1998.
</P>
<P>
International prices for crude oil, which bottomed in 1998,
went all the way up after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) and other independent nations agreed to cut daily
oil production starting April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Pemex said that since the crude oil price rose to 21.75 dollars
per barrel in December 1999, its export income reached a record
when it exported 1.061 billion barrels during that month.
</P>
<P>
The company said it earned about 10 billion dollars in 1999
from its oil exports and derivative products.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's oil exports account for at least 25 percent of its
fiscal income.

<HEADLINE> China Saving World's Oldest Dam (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 2 (Xinhua)-- Dismantling work is now underway
on numerous restaurants and hotels around the 2,256-year-old
Dujiang Dam here, as part of China's efforts to protect this
ancient site by cleaning up the environment.
</P>
<P>
Dujiang Dam (Dujiangyan), 40 kilometers northwest of Chengdu,
capital of Sichuan Province in southwest China, is the world's
oldest water conservancy project that is still operating to serve
local agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Pulling down over 1,200 tourism-related structures and
profitable entertainment facilities, closing polluting plants,
moving residents to other places in the province, and afforesting
the surroundings, are all part of the provincial government's
primary task, according to Hou Xiongfei, the secretary of the
Dujiangyan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The entire project is scheduled to be completed by the end of
February this year, with government investment of some 180 million
yuan (about 21 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The enormous Dujiangyan water conservancy project was built on
the upper reaches of the Minjiang River in 256 B.C. during the
Warring States Period (476-221 B.C.) in ancient China.
</P>
<P>
The dam separates the turbulent river into outer and inner
channels, the former serving as a drainage system to prevent

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial
city of Shanghai, which aims to become an international
information center, generated 80 billion yuan (about 1 billion U.S.
dollars) in output value from the information technology (IT)
industry in 1999, an increase of 23.8 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The city reaped a total of 4.341 billion yuan in profits from
the industry last year, up some 40 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has listed the IT industry as one of the key growth
areas of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, the city has turned out integrated
circuits, computers, mobile telecommunications facilities and a
series of other profitable IT products.
</P>
<P>
Today, Shanghai produces one-fifth of China's integrated
circuits, one-third of telecommunications equipment, and 30
percent of IC cards, according to latest statistics.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Attracts More Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial center, has attracted increasing numbers
of domestic as well as foreign investors in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that about 2,500 enterprises from across
China have either moved their headquarters or established
subsidiaries in Shanghai over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
This brings the city's total number of businesses funded by
investors from other parts of the country to more than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Legend Group, one of China's leading computer
manufacturers, established its Shanghai operation in 1998. The new
subsidiary helped the group increase its output value in east
China from 1.28 billion yuan in 1998 to two billion yuan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that enterprises funded by investors
from outside Shanghai have contributed as much as one percentage
point to the city's annual economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Local experts attribute the trend to the improving business
environment in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has launched a series of preferential
policies for entrepreneurs from other parts of the country,
including a policy which grants related individuals and their
dependents residence status.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's SOE Managers Face Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Heads of badly-managed state-
owned enterprises (SOE) will find themselves out of position and
in three years they can not head other SOEs, according to a new
decision by the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, company officials who lost their
positions due to their inefficient management cannot be employed
in an equal post elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's push to link individual performance
with the success of company operations is a new challenge facing
heads of SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Under the old planned economy, company officials in state-owned
firms were not necessarily promoted on the basis of their company'
s profits; some advanced even when their companies were debt-
ridden.
</P>
<P>
However, the modern enterprise system, which appeared in the
1990s, introduced the concept of competition to company employees
as well as the leadership. In this system, work performance
evaluations are required before employees at any level can advance
on the job.

<HEADLINE> China Saving World's Oldest Dam (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The facility still irrigates some 670,000 hectares of lands and
provides water for daily use and local industries. The Dujiang Dam
area deserves an exceptional project of this kind, because it is
unique, said Professor Luo Zhewen, an expert of ancient buildings
with the State Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its irrigation functions, the Dujiang Dam is
also a state-level tourist attraction under state protection.
China has applied to have the Dujiang Dam site included on the
World Heritage List of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
As many local residents opened tourist businesses in recent
years, newly established restaurants, hotels, and other tourist
structures, along with long-existing mining sites here, are posing
severe threats to the environment of the dam.
</P>
<P>
To ensure success, the provincial government of Sichuan has
employed experts to map out an environment protection and
administration plan for the scenic spot. Local residents are also
being mobilized to follow their decision, though many may have to
endure financial losses.
</P>
<P>
"The Dujiang Dam is a precious legacy from our ancestors. I
made profits with it but brought damage to it as well," said Wang
Guangyun, who took the lead in dismantling his ten-year-old
restaurant in response to the government's command. "I will make a
living with the help of our government", he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Dujiang Dam is not only a treasure of the Chinese people,
but also a precious legacy for everyone in the world, and China is
doing everything possible to save this antiquity for future
generations, said Hou.
</P>
<P>
Since China joined the UNESCO in protecting the world's
cultural and natural heritage 15 years ago, some 23 scenic sites
and cultural relics in China, including the Great Wall and the
terra-cotta warriors in Xi'an of northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, have been added to the World Heritage List.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA) Wednesday lifted the official interest rate by 50 basis
points to 5.5 percent because of faster world growth and rising
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The half a percentage point increase is a major surprise for
financial markets, which had been expecting another modest rise of
0.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
But in a positive sign, the Reserve Bank said the rise had
moved interest rates to a neutral stance, indicating further rate
rises may now be unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
"In the bank's view, a rise of a half a percentage point makes
sense, both in light of the economic outlook, and of the
opportunity it gives to signal that monetary policy has been moved
to a neutral stance," Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
The RBA said it was not acting to halt economic growth, but to
head off any threats to inflation.
</P>
<P>
The rise was good news for the Australian dollar, which jumped
three tenths of an Australian cent within 10 minutes of the
announcement.

GENEVA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian club of Vasco de Gama
were punished by soccer's world governing body FIFA with heavy
fines and a ban on the son of one of the club's top officials on
Tuesday for incidents after a match at last month's World Club
championship in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
The club was fined 70,000 Swiss francs (42,500 U.S. dollars)
and vice-president Eurico Miranda 50,000 Swiss francs (30,360 U.S.
dollars) for his part in an accident with organizers and FIFA
officials after their match with Mexican champions Necaxa on
January 11.
</P>
<P>
Miranda's son, Mario, was banned for two years from all
official matches and all team functions.
</P>
<P>
The incident was triggered when Vasco de Gama players refused
to use the official exit from the stadium after their match.
Players and club officials attempted to force their way through,
pushing over female volunteers in the media area.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said that later their officials and organizers were
insulted and physically assaulted by Vasco personnel and their
bodyguards after asking the players to apologise.

<HEADLINE> Thai Tennis Ace Targets Top 20 in Rankings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Fresh from her fine performance
in the Hopman Cup and a spactacular third-round appearance in the
Australian Open, Thai tennis player Tamarine Tanasugarn has set
herself a target of reaching the world's top 20.
</P>
<P>
She is hoping to first climb back up the rankings from the
current 72nd place to at least the 33rd she held at the beginning
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Full of confidence after a rousing start to the season, she
will head into this week's Toray Pan Pacific Open tennis
tournament in Tokyo, where she faces a tough opener with 28th-
ranked American Lisa Raymond.
</P>
<P>
If she gets over, she will be up against world number one
Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Tamarine, better known as Tammy in Thailand,
received a special award from Deputy Prime Minister Korn
Dabbaransi.
</P>
<P>
She said that one area she must work on is her concentration
when she is leading.
</P>
<P>
In the Hopman Cup final, Tammy had match points against South
Africa's Amanda Koetzer but failed to push home her advantage.
Then in the Australian Open, she had three match points against
Sandrine Testud of France and once again was unable to finish off
the match.
</P>
<P>
However, despite these lapses, Tamarine feels her game is much
better now, especially her serve and return of serve.
</P>
<P>
Of her target of reaching the world's top 20, Tamarine admitted
that there was still plenty of room for improvement and she vowed
to keep on learning. For example, she felt that she still lacked
experience when it comes to big matches.
</P>
<P>
For her immediate future, Tamarine said she hoped she could
maintain the form she displayed in the Hopman Cup, which is the
best she has ever played. Tamarine and her partner Paradorn
Srichaphan were the losing finalists.
</P>
<P>
Her ultimate aim though is the same as every good player -- to
win a Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
"I know it's a long and tough road but I'm determined to do my
best and who knows?" she said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Sets Staricase Backward Walking Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysian Tuesday set a
record in backward walking on a staircase, which was the first
such attempt in the country.
</P>
<P>
G. Deo earned him a name in the Malaysia Book of Records when
he successfully climbed backwards non-stop 2,058 steps of the
Kuala Lumpur Tower in the downtown sector. He completed the
attempt in 24 minutes and 15 seconds against his targeted time of
one hour, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth time Deo has carved his name in the
Malaysian Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
Deo's three previous feats are walking non-stop from Kuala
Lumpur to Ipoh covering a distance of 222 kilometers in 51 hours,
walking backwards at the Kampung Pandan Sports Complex over a
distance of 30 kilometers in five hours and walking from Padang
Besar, Perlis in the north to Tanjung Puteri, Johor in the south,
covering a distance of 912 kilometers in 13 days.
</P>
<P>
Deo, 41, a security assistant, said he walked up and down his
six-storey office building 10 times after work every day in the
last three months to prepare for Tuesday's event and he was happy
because his feat proved that determination could make anyone
achieve his goal.
</P>
<P>
Deo said he would attempt to make a backward climb of the
Petronas Twin Towers in downtown Kuala Lumpur, the world's tallest
building, in either mid August or December.
</P>
<P>
Deo, who came from an ophanage, said he had been staging
charity walks from the age of 19 with the proceeds going to
orphanages.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1(Xinhua) -- Guards Ray Allen of the
Milwaukee Bucks and Michael Finley of the Dallas Mavericks joined
future Hall of Famers John Stockton and Karl Malone of the Utah
Jazz when reserves were named on Tuesday for the 2000 NBA All-Star
Game.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, Allen, who was selected to
the Eastern Conference squad, and Finley, who was picked for the
West, are two of the seven reserves who will make their All-Star
debuts on February 13 at The Arena in Oakland, California.
</P>
<P>
"I have said all year that Michael is deserving of being an All-
Star and now it has happened," said Dallas coach Don Nelson. "
Michael has proven night in and night out that he is one of the
best players in this league."
</P>
<P>
Joining Allen as a first-time participant on the East team are
teammate Glenn Robinson, Indiana's Dale Davis, Detroit's Jerry
Stackhouse and New York's Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
Guard Allen Iverson and forward Vince Carter, named as Eastern
Conference starters on Saturday, also will be making their All-
Star Game debuts.
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a great feeling," Davis said. "It's something
every player wants to accomplish. It's a big goal and would not
have been possible without my teammates."
</P>
<P>
Portland's Rasheed Wallace joins Finley as a first-time
participant for the West.
</P>
<P>
Among the veterans named to the East squad were Indiana guard
Reggie Miller and Atlanta center Dikembe Mutombo. Seattle point
guard Gary Payton joins Sacramento forward Chris Webber and San
Antonio center David Robinson on the West squad.
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful honor," Miller said. "It's always nice to be
selected as one of the 12 best in the conference. It never gets
old."
</P>
<P>
Western Conference starters include guards Kobe Bryant of Los
Angeles and Jason Kidd of Phoenix, forwards Tim Duncan of San
Antonio and Kevin Garnett of Minnesota. The Lakers' Shaquille O'
Neal will start at center.
</P>
<P>
Joining Iverson and Carter as Eastern Conference starters are
Detroit forward Grant Hill, Charlotte guard Eddie Jones and Miami
center Alonzo Mourning.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' Phil Jackson will coach the West All-Stars while

guard Sam Cassell, who is averaging 18.4 points per game and is
second in the league at 9.4 assists per contest.

Also bypassed is Boston's Antoine Walker, who is averaging 20.4
points and 7.4 rebounds per game.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets, Magic Complete Five-Player Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Orlando Magic are
undergoing another major overhaul, acquiring three soon-to-be free
agents from the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday in a five-player deal.
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets on Tuesday sent guards Chauncey Billups, Ron Mercer
and Johnny Taylor to Orlando for guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad, veteran
forward Chris Gatling and a first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
It is yet another move by the Magic designed to clear more
salary cap room for this summer's free agent period. Tim Duncan
of San Antonio, Grant Hill of Detroit, Tracy McGrady of Toronto
and Eddie Jones of Charlotte are players who could be available in
the free agent market.
</P>
<P>
Orlando has stockpiled more than enough ammunition with eight
first-round picks over the next five seasons.
</P>
<P>
The first-round pick was not identified, but the Denver Post is
reporting that the Nuggets receive the one they gave up in a trade
for forward Keon Clark and Taylor with Orlando on January 21, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Denver likely made the deal amid concerns over whether the team
could re-sign Mercer, who is second on the club in scoring at 18.3
points per game.

PARIS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Emmanuel Magnien
displayed he had fully recovered from the bad injuries he
sustained in a crash last year by winning the Grand Prix La
Marseillaise, the opening race of the European road cycling season,
in La Seyne Sur Mer, France, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Magnien, who rides for La Francaise des Jeux, outsprinted his

race. Magnien won in three hours 24 minutes 33 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Magnien's season was forced to end last June in the Tour of
Germany when he crashed into a barrier and was run over by a
motorbike. He suffered multiple fractures, including a broken
knee cap. He resumed training in September.

"This is good for my morale and, hopefully, it is only the
first step to bigger triumphs," he said.

<HEADLINE> Graf Foresees New Era Soon Arising in Women's Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Former world No 1 female
tennis player Steffi Graf believes that the power hitting and
serving, a regular feature of men's tennis in recent years, is
likely to become the dominant factor in the women's game as well.
</P>
<P>
The player with 22 grand slam titles arrived Tuesday in
Auckland, the biggest city in New Zealand and played an exhibition
match against Australian Jelena Dokic there, narrowly losing 2-6,
6-3 and 6-7.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Graf noted the trend of power
taking over in the women's game is already starting with the likes
of Lindsay Davenport, who is 1.90m tall, and Venus Williams (1.86m)
.
</P>
<P>
"There is a good chance for that to happen when you see players
are getting physically stronger," she said. "In the future you
will see players with stronger builds in terms of height and
muscle tones because it is an advantage to have the sort of
physiques some of the girls have. But hopefully it will be about
tennis as well."
</P>
<P>
Asked about her own advantage, Graf said it had been a natural
mental toughness in which nervousness had never been a factor.
From an early age she had been able to give anything her total
concentration and towards the end of her career she had become
indifferent to winning or losing.
</P>
<P>
Questioned if she has much influence on the hot form of Andre
Agassi, Graf said: "I will answer that question but that's not a
subject for here.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly talk about tennis here and there, no question.
But I have nothing to do with that (his play).
</P>
<P>
"He's the one who has to go out and play and decide what to do
on the court. I can only sit there and hope for the best."
</P>
<P>
The retired star said she now has other aims in her life such
as sightseeing in the world, working for favorite projects such as
the World Wildlife Foundation and a foundation formed late in 1998
to help children who were victims of war.
</P>
<P>
After she has finished a present commitment to help develop
some promising juniors, a long term future involvement in tennis
either as a coach or administrator doesn't look likely, she said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cyprus Never to Recognize Reality of Aggression: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides reiterated Wednesday that the Greek Cypriots will never
recognize the reality of the Turkish aggression and occupation of
Cyprus territory.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remarks in Geneva where the second round of
the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the Greek and Turkish
Cypriots is underway.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Cyprus News Agency quoted Clerides as saying
that
the Greek Cypriot side is ready to negotiate a solution within the
parameters established by Security Council resolutions, noting
that "the question of sovereignty is not a negotiable issue..."
</P>
<P>
He added that the Greek Cypriots will also never accept the
importation of illegal settlers from Turkey and the change of the
demographic character of the island is contrary to the Security
Council and General Assembly resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when the
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
Mediterranean island in the wake of an aborted coup in Nicosia
seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for decades to reunite the
divided island, but no tangible results have been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots put forward a proposal on August 31, 1998,
that a confederation formed by two sovereign states be set up in
Cyprus and their "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)",
backed solely by Ankara, be recognized in talks with Nicosia on
equal basis.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a written statement in Geneva clarifying four general
principles guiding the proximity talks, Clerides said,"The object
of the negotiations is not to create a new State of Cyprus but to
amend the existing Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The second principle reads "the settlement must be based on a
state of Cyprus with a single sovereignty and international
personality and a single citizenship, with its independence and
territorial integrity safeguarded."
</P>
<P>
"Such a settlement must exclude union in whole or in part with
any other country or any form of partition or secession, and
consequently confederation is excluded and cannot be accepted," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
The third principle says that "fundamental human rights as
recognized and protected by the European Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights, the U.N. Bill of Rights and other
international instruments and conventions binding on the Republic
of Cyprus should be safeguarded and respected."
</P>
<P>
The fourth principle notes that in view of Cyprus' application
to join the European Union (EU) "the new constitution should not
contain provisions which will prevent effective implementation of
decisions of the EU executive or legislative."

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Egypt Sign landmark Energy Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Egypt on Wednesday
signed an energy agreement on oil exploration and the purchase of
natural gas, Turkish Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reached the agreement following Turkish Energy
Minister Cumhur Ersumer met visiting Egyptian Oil Minister Sameh
Fahmi on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The protocol allows joint oil exploration operations both in
Turkey and Egypt as well as in third countries.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian side has presented two options to Turkey for
natural gas sales: by a pipeline passing through Israel and Syria,
or through the transport of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) by tankers.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish authorities reportedly said they would consider the
proposals and shortly give a response.
</P>
<P>
Suffering from natural gas and electricity shortages, Turkey is
searching in earnest for new alternatives, not only to compensate
for its energy shortage but also to diversify its energy sources.
</P>
<P>
For this reason,, Turkey wants to purchase natural gas and oil
from Egypt as well as from Russia, Algeria and Iran.

"COSCO started issuing commercial papers in the international
capital market in 1995," Lu told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Blair Concerned Over Arms Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Wednesday that the Northern Ireland peace process faces
a real crisis unless there is movement on paramilitary arms
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the House of Commons during question time, Blair
warned the success of the peace process was a matter of life and
death.
</P>
<P>
He made the comments as crucial talks were being held in
Belfast and Dublin to try to resolve the impasse over whether
Northern Ireland's political institutions should be suspended.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the government was working day and night to ensure
the peace process does not collapse.
</P>
<P>
"Let us never forget that there are people now today, that if
we don't get this peace process sorted out and moving forward
again will not grow up in normal conditions and some will not be
alive at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was still hopeful of persuading the parties involved
of the need to make progress but said there must be
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
"At the present time, bluntly, there is insufficient progress (
on decommissioning) for General (John) de Chastelain to make the
report that he has to make," he said.
</P>
<P>
The threat to Northern Ireland's political institutions
followed the presentation of a report by the international
commission on paramilitary weapons decommissioning to the British
and Irish governments, which says the IRA has not moved to disarm.
</P>
<P>
First Minister and Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has
said his party cannot continue in government with Sinn Fein while
the IRA still holds weapons.
</P>
<P>
He flew to London Tuesday night to ask Blair to suspend
Northern Ireland's institutions.
</P>
<P>
If the executive is not suspended, Trimble and senior party
members are likely to resign, collapsing the institutions.
</P>
<P>
Unless a breakthrough can be made, the Northern Ireland
secretary could bring legislation before the House of Commons to
suspend the devolved government within days.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to make an announcement on the
future of the Assembly in the Commons Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair is to speak by telephone to Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern later Wednesday to discuss the decommissioning issue.

<HEADLINE> OAU, S. Africa Condemn Comorian Separatist Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and South Africa Wednesday condemned the leadership of
the Anjouanese separatist movement for dismembering the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the so-called
referendum and are determined to protect the integrity and
sovereignty of a united Comoros," said the OAU and South Africa in
a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the regional coordinator on the problem of the
Comoros, an island country which has been troubled for years with
separatist crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The mandate of South Africa and the countries of the region is
to safeguard the territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity of
the Comoros," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Anjouanese separatist leaders unilaterally held a
"referendum" on January 23, 2000, designed to become independent
from the Comoros. According to the OAU, the so-called
referendum was held in "a climate of terror, intimidation and
suppression of the freedom of speech."
</P>
<P>
In view of the situation, the OAU and the countries of the
region are left with no choice but to implement a series of
punitive measures directed at leaders of the separatist movement
and their families and cohorts, the regional organization said in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the measures would include travel
restrictions, non-recognition of their travel documents and
passports, freezing of bank accounts and other financial
transactions, inside and outside the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
Task teams will be established on the continent to liaise and
coordinate the effective implementation of the agreed measures,
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the OAU expressed the hope that the Comorian
separatist leaders will stop separatist movement and sign the
Antananarivo Agreement which is designed to find a long-lasting
political settlement to the crisis in the archipelago.

LUSAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has

given to former President Kenneth Kaunda to meet the costs of

<P>
LIMA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Peru and Chile
signed Wednesday here an accord for a reciprocal promotion and
protection of investments and a memorandum of understanding in
order to halt the illegal trafficking of cultural goods.
</P>
<P>
Signing of the documents was in charge of PERU'S Foreign

In his talk, Fujimori stressed that the signing of the
documents, following the Act of Execution, is another step forward
toward a common objective of association of interests.

He said the question of investments occupies an important place
in the bilateral agenda. With historic signing of Treaty of 1929,

<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) - Europe's main stock markets
closed higher Wednesday after a day of sharp swings dominated by
activity in the telecom and media sectors.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index closed modestly higher, as powerful
gains by Vodafone and other technology stocks offset a sharp slide
in BT stock.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark was up 11.5 points at 6302.40, well off its
session high as volumes surged and three stocks enjoyed double-
digit percentage gains.
</P>
<P>
Vodafone's shares closed 7.5 percent higher at 382 pence after
Vivendi said the two may team up to acquire a 50 percent stake in
AOL Europe from German media group Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
However, British Telecom slumped 17.6 percent to close at 980
pence, having dipped as low as 930 earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE Eurotop 300, a broader pan-European index, closed up 1.
23 percent at 1538.13, buoyed by a 4 percent rise in its media and
tech segments.
</P>
<P>
Germany's benchmark DAX closed up 121.4 points, or 1.72 percent,
at 7171.95. The CAC 40 in Paris ended up 3.0 percent at 5946.86

MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A violent bus explosion killed
at least six people and left more than 30 injured on the
northwestern outskirts of Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan,
Wednesday, reported the Interfax news agency.

A bomb may be the reason for the bus blast, which occurred soon
after the Ikarus vehicle began to move in the morning, said Tajik
deputy Interior Minister Nikolai Madzhar.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to determine the exact number of victims so far,
as a number of passengers were blown apart and many others were
not carrying identity papers, said sources in the republic's law-
enforcement agencies and Emergency Situations Ministry.

After careful expert examination, the number of victims may be
found to be higher, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed on Higher Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Wednesday as the Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates
in an effort to ward off inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 37.85 at 11,003.20,
giving up an early gain of as much as 60 points after the rate
hike was announced. The blue chip index rose 302.18 points in the
previous two tradings.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 0.16 at 1,409.12. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 21.98 at 4,073.96.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index made moderate gains in early session but moved
into the negative territory after the Federal Reserve announced a
quarter-point increase in the federal fund rate to 5.75 percent.
It's the fourth rate rise since June, last year.
</P>
<P>
Higher rates can cut into corporate profits by raising the cost
of borrowing money. That would cause damage to the stock market.
</P>
<P>
But the technology stocks survived the rate hike to finish
higher. Hewlett-Packard and IBM among the Dow components surged,
and Yahoo! and qualcomm on the Nasdaq rose as well.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 1.09 at 625.93 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 4.61 at 877.69. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 6.14 at 509.89.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,681 up, 1,340 down and 519
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 1.03 billion shares from 974.38

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua's Parliament Denies to Annul Tax on Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, February 2 (Xinhua)-- President of Nicaragua's
National Assembly (AN) Ivan Escobar Fornos Wednesday denied he
wants to tax on 35 percent products imported from Honduras and
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Such a tax, known as "Sovereignty Tax", was approved last
December by parliament members following ratifying last November
of Ramirez-Lopez Treaty between Honduras and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua rejected the treaty and affirmed it cuts 130,000
square kilometers off from its Caribbean Sea continental platform.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's Foreign Minister Eduardo Montealegre said last week
the Executive would be presenting an initiative to AN so that the
questioned tax is canceled under request of a resolution from
Central America's Court of Justice (CCJ).
</P>
<P>
But Ivan Escobar Fornos said that to his office no initiative
presented by the government has arrived, but when it does the
Assembly will analyze as it is a matter of sovereignty and
national integrity.
</P>
<P>
Escobar Fornos reiterated they are waiting first of all for
Honduras to observe the resolution sent by CCJ itself, which some
days previous ratifying of Ramirez-Lopez Treaty ordered Honduras'
Congress to abstain from approving it.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the president of Nicaragua's parliament indicated
that "in Colombia you don't know who rules".
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of last January, president Arnoldo Aleman
qualified in his yearly work report Colombia as expansionist and
colonialist, which provoked energetic protest from Colombia's
government.
</P>
<P>
Aleman has manifested that Nicaragua will sue Colombia before
International Court of Justice at The Hague, as it has done
against Honduras.

<HEADLINE> Fed Raises Key Interest Rate for Fourth Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
raised a key interest rate Wednesday by a quarter in an effort to
slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a closed-door meeting of the
Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate
policies.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said it was increasing its target for the federal funds
rate, the interest that banks charge each other on overnight loan,
to 5.75 percent from 5.50 percent. That is the fourth increase
since last June.
</P>
<P>
It also raised its mostly symbolic discount rate, the interest
that the Fed charges to make direct loans to banks by a quarter
point to 5.25 percent from 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a statement explaining its decision, the Fed said it
continued to be worried that the rapidly growing economy "could
foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's
record economic expansion."
</P>
<P>
The Fed's quarter-point increase in the funds rate was expected
to be followed quickly by announcements from commercial banks that
they were boosting their prime lending rate by one-quarter point,
from the current 8.50 percent to 8.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The prime rate is a key benchmark for millions of loans, from
home equity and credit card balances to short-term loans for small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's announcement, the Fed for the first time
employed a new disclosure policy that it hopes will remove some of
the confusion that had arisen in financial markets over the past
year over its announcements concerning potential future actions.
</P>
<P>
The new simplified announcement said the Fed believes that
future "risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may
generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.
"
</P>
<P>
This statement does not guarantee that there will be future
rate increases but it puts financial markets on notice that the
Fed continues to be worried about inflation dangers.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe today's rate increase will be followed
by two or more increases before the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy grew at a strong 5.8 percent annual rate in
the last quarter of the year and by 4 percent for all of 1999.
With the economy growing so fast, employers are having trouble
finding scarce workers to fill job openings. Thus, they are wooing
them with higher wages and benefits, increasing the costs of doing
business to the point that economists and members of the Fed fear
a sharp run-up in prices.

<HEADLINE> German IMF Candidate Sees Good Chance--Government Spokeswoman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 2 (Xinhua)-Germany finds good chance for its
candidate to succeed French Michel Camdessus as next International
Monetary Fund (IMF) chief, a cabinet spokeswoman Wednesday said in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
German candidate Caio Koch-wesser, state secretary in Finance
Ministry, has won "more and more support" and will "probably
become the new IMF chief," said deputy cabinet spokeswoman Charima
Reinhardt.
</P>
<P>
"There have been some positive signals, and we hope soon we can
unanimously present a European candidate," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the European Union (EU)'s Helsinki summit last December,
Germany formally recommended Koch-Wesser as successor to Camdessus,
who is due to leave office on February 16.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's massive
lobbying, the spokeswoman stressed, "the Chancellor has
recommended Koch-Wesser in lot of letters to foreign leaders."
</P>
<P>
Most European Union (EU) members, except France, have
expressed support to Koch- Wesser, she said,
</P>
<P>
Officially, France and the United States have their own
candidates. The U.S. President Bill Clinton has recommended his
Secretary of Treasury Larry Summers, and France backs its
parliament president Laurent Fabius.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton has "apparently changed his mind and called back
Summers," while France also withdrew after Schroeder threatened to
veto Fabius, Wednesday's Handelsblatt business newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The IMF post has long belonged to a French, but the U.S.
seemed to be interested after Camdessus' last year announcement to
retire early.
</P>
<P>
Koch-Wessere, 55, had served more than 25 years the World Bank.
And before he returned to German Finance Ministry last year, he
had been one of the four top managing directors of the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Thorpe Has Hat Trick in Swimming World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- World champion Ian Thorpe of
Australia had a hat trick at a World Cup swimming tournament in
Sheffield, England, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old, who won the 100 and 400 meters freestyle
Tuesday, swam away with the gold in the 200m freestyle in one
minute and 44.82 seconds Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe's gold treble was trumped by South African Terence
Parkin and Slovakia's Martina Moravcova, who both won four events
in the two-day meeting at the Ponds Forge pool, the eighth leg in
the 12-stop World Cup short-course series.
</P>
<P>
Parkin, a deaf swimmer who relies on a flash in a lamp at the
base of his starting block to get the start, added the 100
breaststroke and 200 meters individual medley to the 400
individual medley and 200 breaststroke golds he won Tuesday as
well as a silver in the 50 breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
His victim in the 200 individual medley was Britain's James
Hickman, who had suffered his first 200 butterfly short-course
reverse in three years Tuesday when he was pipped by American
Olympic silver medalist Tom Malchow.
</P>
<P>
But Hickman, who won Tuesday's 100 meters individual medley,
picked up a second win Wednesday, celebrating his 24th birthday
with a comprehensive victory in the 100 meters butterfly, which he
won by nearly two seconds from German veteran Christian Keller.
</P>
<P>
Moravcova, a triple short-course world champion who won Tuesday
's 200 freestyle and 200 individual medley, followed up with wins
in the 100 freestyle and 100 individual medley, each time beating
top Briton Sue Rolph into second place.

<HEADLINE> (repeat)Nicaragua's Parliament Denies to Annul Tax on Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Such a tax, known as "Sovereignty Tax", was approved last
December by parliament members following ratifying last November
of Ramirez-Lopez Treaty between Honduras and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua rejected the treaty and affirmed it cuts 130,000
square kilometers off from its Caribbean Sea continental platform.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's Foreign Minister Eduardo Montealegre said last week
the Executive would be presenting an initiative to AN so that the
questioned tax is canceled under request of a resolution from
Central America's Court of Justice (CCJ).
</P>
<P>
But Ivan Escobar Fornos said that to his office no initiative
presented by the government has arrived, but when it does the
Assembly will analyze as it is matter of a question of
sovereignty and national integrity.
</P>
<P>
Escobar Fornos reiterated they are waiting first of all for
Honduras to observe the resolution sent by CCJ itself, which some
days previous ratifying of Ramirez-Lopez Treaty ordered Honduras'
Congress to abstain from approving it.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the president of Nicaragua's parliament indicated
that "in Colombia you don't know who rules".
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of last January, president Arnoldo Aleman
qualified in his yearly work report Colombia as expansionist and
colonialist, which provoked energetic protest from Colombia's
government.
</P>
<P>
Aleman has manifested that Nicaragua will sue Colombia before
International Court of Justice at The Hague, as it has done
against Honduras.

<HEADLINE> Russia Concerned Over Indian Court's Sentence on Its Aircrew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Moscow shows grave concern over
the Indian Calcutta Court's Wednesday sentence of life
imprisonment on five Latvian aircrew members, among them four
Russian citizens, and will urge the court to reverse its decision,
said the Russian Foreign Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was "insufficiently founded. This was an unexpected
decision for us. We expected seven to 10 years in prison," said a
spokesman for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Russian lawyers will appeal against the
decision in order to ensure a revision of such a rigorous ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Latvian crew of an An-26 liner, including commander
Alexander Klishin, second pilot Oleg Gaidash, flight engineer Igor
Timmerman, cargo operator Yevgeny Antimenko and navigator Igor
Moskvitin, have been held in a Calcutta city prison on charges of
supplying a consignment of weapons to Indian separatists since
1995, when their plane was forced to land in Bombay by Indian
fighter jets after air dropping armaments in West Bengal province.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian media, at the end of 1999, four of the
five pilots, who had the status of permanent Latvian residents,
were granted the identity of Russian nationals at their request.
The four will not be allowed to return to Latvia due to being
sentenced to more than three years in jail. They asked to be
naturalized by Russia, hoping for liberation.
</P>
<P>
The fifth, Kim Davy, is believed to be a British citizen. The
press claimed he was a CIA agent suspected of supervising the arms
shipment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Panel Rejects BP Amoco Purchase of ARCO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) Wednesday rejected BP Amoco Plc's proposed
purchase of Atlantic Richfield Co. (ARCO) and said it would go to
court to halt the 30-billion-U.S.-dollar deal.
</P>
<P>
The commission voted 3-2 to seek a court injunction against the
merger, troubled for months because of the antitrust regulator's
concern that the new company would have too much control over
Alaska oil production.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have a compelling case," the London-based BP
Amoco said in a statement, promising to "argue the case vigorously
" in court. The company also said it was open to further
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The FTC staff recommended against the proposed acquisition in
December, saying it could lead to higher gasoline prices in
California and other West Coast states. The companies have
strongly denied any such threat.
</P>
<P>
The combination of BP Amoco and ARCO would create the world's
second largest non-government oil company behind Exxon Mobil,
whose merger was completed in November hours after it received the
FTC's approval. BP Amoco itself was created only a little more
than a year ago with the merger of British Petroleum and Amoco.
</P>
<P>
The FTC was known to be deeply concerned about the merger's
impact on retail gasoline prices in California and other West
Coast states because BP Amoco and ARCO currently produce 70
percent of the oil on Alaska's North Slope. That oil accounts for
45 percent of the oil refined in California, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
After the FTC staff made its opposition clear in December and
negotiations bogged down, the two companies announced on January
13 they would proceed with or without FTC approval. They set
Thursday as a deadline for completing the merger, but then
extended it to next Monday.
</P>
<P>
If BP Amoco persists, antitrust and industry lawyers said the
litigation could trigger one of biggest oil industry antitrust
court fights since the breakup of Standard Oil nearly a century
ago.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Progress in Globe Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday called for progress in global disarmament,
saying that the deployment of ballistic defenses poses "a serious
threat" to the Anti-Ballistic Missile (AMB) Treaty and strategic
stability in the world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters, which
began its current session Monday and ends Wednesday, Annan said, "
It is even more disheartening to hear nuclear-weapon States
reiterate their nuclear doctrines, postures and plans, which
envisage reliance on nuclear weapons 'for the foreseeable future.'
"
</P>
<P>
"Deployment of ballistic missile defenses seems increasingly
likely, posing a serious threat to the ABM Treaty and the
strategic stability it embodies," he said. "More countries have
nuclear-weapons capability than ever before. Fissile material
negotiations have not even begun. A dangerous new arms race looms
on the horizon."
</P>
<P>
"That list is indeed discouraging," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I consider disarmament one of the most important tools of
preventive diplomacy," he said. "Properly used, it can do much to
reduce tensions or prevent them from arising."
</P>
<P>
At present, "progress in the disarmament field tends to
reflect the general political climate of the day," he said. "And
the present climate is one of divisions among the main actors,
which hamper exchanges between governments on disarmament issues
at all levels -- bilateral, regional, multilateral, and not least
in the Security Council itself."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. intention to deploy national missile defense system,
known as NMD, met with strong criticism at the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Students on Strike for More Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
OTTAWA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Canadian students Wednesday
staged a national strike for more education funding.
</P>
<P>
More than one thousand students gathered at Parliament Hill in
Ottawa to demand 3.5 billion Canadian dollars (about 2.4 billion U.
S. dollars for post-secondary education.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that a college student leaves school with a
debt of 25,000 Canadian dollars (17,280 U.S. dollars) as a result
of the highest tuition fees since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Protests are also staged by university students from Moncton,
New Brunswick, to Winnipeg, Manitoba, to intensify pressure in the
run-up to the federal budgetary decision.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of students took to the streets in
Toronto in demand of more grant for secondary education.
</P>
<P>
The demand is coupled with a call by the Ontario Teachers'
Federation for support of publicly funded education.
</P>
<P>
The federation of 107,000 teachers said in a letter to
government officials that they hope officials will "speak
positively" in support of publicly funded education in every way.
</P>
<P>
The call for more education funding came amid reports about
the country's improved economy with more and more budgetary
surplus.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin predicted last November
that the country's budgetary surplus could hit 95.5 billion
Canadian dollars (about 66 billion U.S. dollars) in five years.
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal year of 2000-2001, the minister projected a
surplus of 5.5 billion (about 3.8 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes Bill Overhauling Bankruptcy Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate
overwhelmingly passed legislation Wednesday making it harder for
Americans to sweep away credit card and other debts through
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The 83-14 vote was on a bill that also would raise the hourly
minimum wage by one U.S. dollar to 6.15 dollars over three years,
give billions in new tax breaks to small businesses and increase
penalties for powder cocaine crimes. The House has passed a
similar but narrower bankruptcy bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill applies a new standard for determining whether people
filing for bankruptcy should be forced to repay their debts under
a court-approved reorganization plan rather than having them
abrogated. If a debtor is found to have sufficient income to repay
at least 25 percent of his or her debts over five years, a
reorganization plan generally would be required.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, which supports rewriting the
bankruptcy laws in principle, has criticized both versions because
it believes they are too hard on debtors. The White House also
opposes the business tax breaks and wants to see the minimum wage
increase over a shorter period of time.
</P>
<P>
House and Senate negotiators now must iron out differences
between the two bills.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy legislation has been pushed by banks, credit
card companies and retail-business groups. Proponents say the
bankruptcy overhaul is needed to stem abuse by people who can
afford to repay their debts.
</P>
<P>
They point to the rise in personal bankruptcies of Americans in
recent years, which reached a record 1.4 million in 1998, despite
the strong economy, up more than 300 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Consumer groups and other opponents maintain the legislation
favors corporate profits over the needs of families struggling
with debt. They insist that the credit card companies share the
blame by flooding consumers with mailed solicitations to entice
them into easy credit.
