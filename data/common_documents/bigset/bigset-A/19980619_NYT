WOODSIDE BITTEN BY LAST-LAP CRASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What goes around, comes around. And NASCAR Winston
West driver Sean Woodside knows it.
</P>
<P>
   So when race leaders crashed and fumbled away a victory to
Woodside a few weeks back in Kansas, the 27-year-old Valencia
driver knew someday he'd have to give up a win in the same fashion.
</P>
<P>
   That day arrived this past Sunday at Altamont Raceway Park in
Tracy. Woodside led 198 laps of the 200-lap Spears Manufacturing
200 before being taken out in a crash on the turn before the
checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside started the race on the pole and led all the way until
getting a late challenge from eventual winner Kevin Harvick and
Gary Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith bumped Woodside while taking the lead coming out of turn
two. Woodside caught him on the outside coming out of turn 3. But
as the cars went into turn 4, Smith squeezed Woodside up high,
bumping him head-on into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Just one of those hard-charging racing incidents, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's racing,'' said Woodside, who cracked two ribs on
impact. He was spun down low on the track where his Pontiac Grand
Prix was hit again by Craig Raudman. ``I'm really not sure. He just
turned right and stuffed us right into the fence. I guess he just
lost his mind for minute. Either that or his driving ability _ one
or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   While Woodside, Smith and Raudman were skidding around the
track, Harvick took the checkered flag and retook the series points
lead from Woodside. Harvick has a five-point advantage, 1,124-1,119
over Woodside. Smith is a distant third at 1,036.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside's car took a beating in the crash and is being rebuilt
in the North Carolina shop of NASCAR mechanical-whiz Ronnie
Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess (Smith) was trying to win,'' Woodside said. ``I hope
he's happy. Neither one of us won and two cars got destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   If the crash was unfortunate, at least it came at a point in the
schedule where Woodside's team will have time to get his car back
in shape.
</P>
<P>
   The tour's next stop is not until July 10 in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his injured ribs, Woodside doesn't want to wait until
July for his next race. He plans to drive in the June 27 NASCAR
Featherlite Southwest Tour race at Sears Point.
</P>
<P>
   Lengthy lead: Despite a wire-to-wire victory by Prunedale driver
Doug McCoun, Granada Hills' M.K. Kanke padded his Featherlite
Southwest Tour season points lead with a fourth-place finish in
Sunday's Altamont 100.
</P>
<P>
   Kanke (1,160 points) is 115 ahead of second-place Steve Portenga
and almost 200 better than third place John Metcalf (973).
</P>
<P>
   Several Valley-area racers made good showings at Altamont.
Chatsworth's Keith Spangler was third, Agua Dulce's Bob Lyon was
sixth, Glendale's Darrell La Moure was ninth and Palmdale's Dennis
Dyer was 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the saddle: Defending Trans-Am champion Tom Kendall,
without a steady ride for most of this season, will be busy this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making a final run with the International Race of
Champions all-stars in late July, Kendall will drive Team SABCO's
No. 46 First Union Chevy Monte Carlo on NASCAR Winston Cup road
courses at Sears Point (June 28) and Watkins Glen, N.Y. (Aug. 9).
</P>
<P>
   And he will drive occasional U.S. Road Racing Championship
Can-Am races with the R&AMP;S Ford team owned by Jim Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, long one of the stars of American road racing, gets a
call almost every year from one Winston Cup team or another looking
for a driver for the tour's two road-course stops.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is particularly excited about his chances this year
after recent test runs at Sears Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we are by far the fastest car to have tested,'' said
the La Canada product. ``Jeff Gordon was close. . . . I think we
are very much in the running not just for the pole but to win the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   When not racing, Kendall can be found doing commentary at
various races. He will be in Portland, Ore., this weekend, decked
out with a microphone and headset for ESPN's coverage of the FedEx
Championship Series Budweiser-G.I. Joe 200.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: Wally Dallenbach will take over behind the wheel
of the No. 50 Budweiser Winston Cup car for Sunday's Pocono 500.
Dallenbach, fired earlier this year by Team SABCO, takes over
relief duty for Ricky Craven, who is recuperating from
post-concussion syndrome. . . . Mojave Desert Racing, Inc. will
hold the third of its five race weekends today, Saturday and
Sunday. The event's being called the Kar Tek Off Road California
200, in Lucerne Valley. Information: (626) 442-9320. &QL;

STEWART CLOSES FAST FOR OPEN LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Birdies on the closing holes yesterday at the
Olympic Club proved tougher to collect than Beanie Babies during
the Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was Payne Stewart, basket full and face awash in an
impish grin, trying to calculate the odds against repeating the
birdie-birdie-birdie finish that propelled him into the first-round
lead at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing it again, I don't know,'' said Stewart, who was one of
only five players to birdie the par-4 17th hole, which played to a
scoring average of 4.65. ``I can see doing 16 and 18. But when you
get a birdie at 17, you can almost soar to the 18th tee. In my
mind, that's an eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there would be long odds against it. But whoever made
the odds just lost, because it just got done.''
</P>
<P>
   By closing with three consecutive birdies, Stewart finished with
a 4-under-par 66 and took a one-stroke lead over Mark Carnevale on
a day with the par-70 layout played to an average score of 75.
</P>
<P>
   Well-tucked pins, firm fairways, tiny greens and thick rough
tinged with a heavy morning dew helped make scoring conditions
difficult for the 156 starters. Stewart was among nine players who
finished yesterday with under-par scores.
</P>
<P>
   Others included Tom Lehman, Bob Tway and Jose Maria Olazabal,
all at 68. Joe Durant, John Daly, Jesper Parnevik and Jeff Maggert,
a Houston resident and Texas A&AMP;M graduate, are at 69.
</P>
<P>
   Several notables struggled, however. Past major-championship
winners Ben Crenshaw (82), Hale Irwin (80), Davis Love III (78),
Nick Faldo (77), Curtis Strange (77) and Corey Pavin (76) all find
themselves at least 10 strokes in back of Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champ Ernie Els, fighting a back ailment, labored to a
75. So did Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks, who still finished five
strokes ahead of fellow Fort Worth resident Sam Randolph (80).
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a less than stellar showing by the game's top
players. But they had plenty of help from U.S. Golf Association
officials, who set pins in positions that were ``scary,'' in the
estimation of Colin Montgomerie, who shot even-par 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised they had the pins so difficult on the first
day,'' said Tiger Woods, who shot a 74 that included a four-putt at
the ninth green. ``Usually, there's a blend of difficult pins and
easy ones. Today, everything was shaded toward the difficult
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   But the well-hidden pins could not stop Stewart, who collected
five birdies and one bogey. He also drained two par putts from
beyond 12 feet in matching his best career start at the Open. In
1991, when Stewart won the title, he opened with a 67.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took advantage of some breaks out there today,'' said
Stewart, who bagged two birdies and collected two pars on holes
where he drove the ball into the rough. ``When you get them, you
have to take advantage of them, especially at a U.S. Open. Because
you don't get that many.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's biggest break came at No. 17, where he hit a driver
into the first cut on the right-hand side. Figuring he could not
reach the green, Stewart opted to play a 2-iron out of the tall
grass and caught it flush. The ball rolled. And rolled. And rolled.
</P>
<P>
   All the way to the front edge of the green, where Stewart
drained the 45-footer for birdie and began an impromptu funky
chicken dance in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge,'' Stewart said. ``That hole is a par-5, no
matter what the scorecard says. To get away with a three ... let's
just say it was a brisk walk down to the 18th tee. I was ready to
hit another shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed with his worst swing of the day, a misdirected
2-iron into the right rough. From there, Stewart dug out an 8-iron
that skirted the edge of the green before reaching pin-high and
turning toward the hole. It eventually stopped 12 feet above the
hole, and Stewart canned the ticklish putt for his final birdie of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's closest pursuer is Carnevale, a career journeyman who
has bounced between the PGA Tour and Nike Tour in recent seasons.
But the 38-year-old emerged as the only front-runner to finish 18
holes without a bogey in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Carnevale, 38, hit 10 of 14 fairways and found 12 of 18 greens
in regulation. He one-putted nine greens, including three for
birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, this is only Thursday. But this is where all the
attention of the golf world is this week,'' said Carnevale, whose
lone PGA Tour triumph came at the 1992 Chattanooga Classic. ``This
is what you have struggled all your life to get to. You finally
realize, `Hey, I'm here.' I'm excited. It was a lot of fun out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   And when was the last time Carnevale played 18 holes without a
bogey?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe at Putt-Putt,'' Carnevale said. ``I'm not sure. But it's
been a while.''

D-BACKS' STARTERS ON A ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Don't try searching for some special formula to
explain the Diamondbacks' recent winning ways. There is no secret
method for success.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason the Diamondbacks have won three in a row and
four of five begins and ends with their pitching rotation. Period.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to be some old baseball codger to know pitching
has been and always will be the difference between winning and
losing at this level. Everyone who has ever been associated with
baseball knows the game is all about pitching.
</P>
<P>
   If you got it, you win. If you don't, you're the Florida
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Benes, Willie Blair, Brian Anderson and Omar Daal have
pitched about as well as their human bodies are capable in the last
week. Since beating St. Louis last Saturday, the four have combined
to produce an almost pea-sized ERA of 1.60 during the five-game
span.
</P>
<P>
   The only loss since last Friday was Sunday's series finale
against St. Louis, which won, 2-0. Blair allowed two runs in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   This, folks, is what a top-notch pitching staff looks like. Pay
attention to it, because stretches like this don't tend to last
very long outside of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the Diamondbacks are riding the crest of a
wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear all the time that this game is contagious,'' Blair
said. ``Right now, we're feeding off each other. When you feel good
about the way you're pitching, chances are you're going to go out
and pitch better.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment that the Diamondbacks gained only one game
in the standings entering Thursday's game. That's not the important
part of this three-game win streak.
</P>
<P>
   This is about a brand-new franchise finding some players it can
count on, which is really what the 1998 season is all about. Benes
is a known quantity. He will produce his 15 or so victories over
the course of a full season.
</P>
<P>
   Blair won a career-best 16 last year and has suffered some hard
luck in the form of very few runs along the way to his 2-9 record.
Anderson, who pitched seven scoreless innings in Thursday
afternoon's victory, has won four straight decisions to improve to
5-6.
</P>
<P>
   Daal, probably the biggest surprise of the bunch, is pitching as
if he wants no part of the bullpen ever again. Since replacing
injured Joel Adamson in the rotation, Daal has baffled opponents
and has allowed only two earned runs in his past 17 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who one month ago were on a pace to go 44-118,
are suddenly on a pace to win 56 games. They have played above .500
in their past 33 games and no longer can be considered the
pushovers they were in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a bad ballcub on paper, like ours,'' Cincinnati
Manager Jack McKeon said. ``But they take it on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Diamondbacks pitching coach Mark Connor has stuck
with his core of starters. Benes, Blair and Anderson have started
at least 15 games, never missing a turn.
</P>
<P>
   Daal has not missed a turn since he was inserted into the
rotation, and even Jeff Suppan must admit he was given more than a
fair shake, lasting 11 starts before being sent to Triple-A Tucson
with his 1-6 record and 7.04 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The next audition belongs to 24-year-old Amaury Telemaco,
scheduled to make his Diamondbacks debut as a starter Saturday
against St. Louis. Telemaco was claimed off waivers from the
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want us to find out about these guys before anybody else
does,'' Manager Buck Showalter said. ``We have that luxury,
especially this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are now enjoying the fun part that comes from a
stretch like this. Their starters are currently engaged in friendly
competition, each wanting to outdo the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing to have among a staff,'' Connor said.
``They're on a roll right now, and no one wants to be the guy that
stops it.''
</P>
<P>
   The wave will crash at some point, especially with a rotation as
relatively young as this one. As long as the pitchers are riding
the wave, who cares? &QL;

NBC   DOESN'T OVERCOVER MARTIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From noon to 2 p.m. Thursday, NBC interrupted
``Another World'' and ``Days Of Our Lives'' for the first round of
the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   It could easily have been called ``As Casey Martin's World
Turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, TV decided not to wring more unnecessary suds from
this soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   By the time The Handicapped Golfer climbed into his E-Z-Go cart
after a 3:30 p.m. tee time and nearly run over a USGA official who
cut in front of him, ESPN had assumed coverage (in a somewhat
surreal setting, using NBC broadcasters Dick Enberg and Johnny
Miller). Enberg mentioned that Martin deserved ``high-grade
bravados.'' Miller called Martin ``a brave guy.'' USGA boss David
Fay, in the booth, discussed both sides of the controversy that led
to Martin's court-sought permission to use a cart for the
circulatory ailment in his right leg known as
Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Martin's wild ride through the Olympic course
Thursday was thankfully less than full throttle.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's round didn't really deserve much attention (he wasn't
even finished when coverage ended). ESPN cameras didn't even show
his cart rides between holes, showing instead more shots from other
players.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a reserved treatment is surprising from NBC just coming
off the Michael Jordan Experience. It will have much more of a
chance to cover him live today with his second-round tee-time of 10
a.m. But if anything, extended coverage by NBC and ESPN Thursday
tended to rein in the hype and make the scores the thing to focus
on rather than the potential sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we do (at NBC) is address the issues that are
hot and interesting, but we are fair to who gets covered,'' Miller
said before the tournament. ``It's more the scores than who it is.
We do try to cover who's the best. And there are a lot of good
stories in the game today, in addition to Casey Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning that even with non-Masters'-like TV time _ NBC does 16
hours over the four days, and ESPN takes the first two rounds to
near completion _ there won't be anything more on the Martin story
unless something materializes.
</P>
<P>
   It's also ironic that the usually vocal Miller measures his
words when talking about Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue I'm trying not to make a lot of comments
about,'' said Miller. ``I see both sides. I pull for him, but I
understand the PGA Tour's position. On one hand it's que sera, but
on the other hand, how disabled do you have to be to have the rule
apply? Would it apply to someone like me who has had six
operations? He's in a gray area. I'm very open to his plight, but
from a public view, anything negative sounds very cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably wishes he didn't have to walk. I credit him for
staying so much dead-center on the course that he has the right
stuff to handle the media scrutiny. It's the first time he's here
with the big boys. It'd be quite a thing for him to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Added course reporter Roger Maltbie, who followed Miller in the
18th-hole tower seat Thursday afternoon: ``I certainly feel this is
a special occasion _ a first _ and it's newsworthy. We want the
public to see it first-hand and feel the emotion of his playing. By
the time the first two rounds are complete, you'll see a lot of
him, I believe. But if Casey is 6-over, his coverage is over.''
</P>
<P>
   CASEY AT THE BAT
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who has received nothing but praise by media types for
his accommodating demeanor, writes in the current issue of WE, a
magazine for people with disabilities:
</P>
<P>
   ``Every tournament I'm on the front page or the top of the
sports page, and I'm not totally comfortable there. I want
attention for playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes on to say that some reporters bother him and ``don't
listen to my answers because they have their own agenda. Sometimes,
they have an angle and will come after me relentlessly until they
get their quote.... They hang around until they can take your words
to suit the kind of story they want to have been assigned to write.
That's when it's a distortion, a pain for me.''
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-TRANSACTION WIRE
</P>
<P>
   With the network's NBA coverage complete for the year and
probably no Michael Jordan to baby-sit anymore, Dick Ebersol has
abdicated his title of NBC Sports president to Ken Schanzer.
Ebersol, who had the nameplate since 1989, is going to be known as
the chairman of NBC's Olympics division....
</P>
<P>
   A seven-year contract extension between KCAL-Channel 9 and the
Lakers translates into about a $140 million revenue-sharing deal.
It also guarantees the station all Lakers playoff games that aren't
tied into the national NBC package....
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' new three-year deal KRLA-AM (1110) doesn't mean
they'll be butting heads with the Ducks, whose games were on the
station last season. The Ducks' contract with KRLA ended, and
reportedly they're talking to XTRA-AM (690), which is the station
that the Kings left because of the signal's lack of penetration in
the San Fernando Valley and because the station presented many more
conflicts with other teams' broadcasts....
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Bernstein was allowed out of her contract as a reporter
with ESPN a year early so she could hook up with CBS' ``NFL Today''
show this fall....
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's football game at Miami on Sept. 26 will be on CBS'
schedule with a 9 a.m. kickoff time locally, and Terry Donahue will
be the analyst. &QL;

NOT QUITE DALY WAY AT OLYM PIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Olympic Club has taken away John Daly's
driver this week, but it can't touch his daily drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty cool, and they spelled it right,'' said Daly, who
has driven down John Daly Boulevard every day as he enters the U.S.
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Not only John Daly Boulevard, but Daly City, which is about two
of Daly's big drives down the freeway from here. The ``other'' John
Daly was a dairy farmer who once owned most of the property in this
area.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the name game is a good thing for Daly, who is 3 shots
off Payne Stewart's lead after a surprising 1-under 69. It
certainly is a big turnaround from last year, when Daly stormed out
of the U.S. Open at Congressional Country Club near Washington
D.C., after playing only nine holes of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the shakes this year like I did then. I'm not
craving alcohol,'' said Daly, whose bouts with the bottle are
well-chronicled. ``When you putt at a major (championship), your
nerves are already there, and then top it off with the shakes _ if
you've never been there, you wouldn't understand _ it was a
difficult time for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Daly doesn't like is not being able to hit his
big drives off the tee this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sucks. I hate it,'' Daly said of hitting 3-woods and
2-irons instead of the driver. ``The bonus from Callaway (for
winning the driving title) is huge, but I'd rather be in the
fairway.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Arizona connection &QL;  &QL; 
Of Arizona's eight entries in the Open, three are among the
leaders. Tom Lehman shot 68, Andrew Magee was at 70 and Phil
Mickelson came in with a 71.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked my butt off,'' said Magee, who was 3 over after three
holes before he capped his rally with a 6-foot birdie at the 18th
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Open is not fair, but you know that coming in. I
guess I'm not just a big fan of the (sponsoring U.S. Golf
Association).''
</P>
<P>
   Other Arizona players were probably thinking the same. Like Kirk
Triplett, who was among the leaders after a 33 on the front nine,
only to end up at 73. Mark Calcavecchia and Don Pooley also were 2
under early before falling back to 74.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse, as Brandel Chamblee (76) and Howard Twitty (79)
struggled in. &QL;  &QL; 
Open tragedy &QL;  &QL; 
Rick McGuire, the vice chairman of the U.S. Open who has strong
ties to Phoenix, died of a heart attack Thursday morning, just a
few hours before the tournament began. McGuire, whose son, Mike, is
an assistant pro at Phoenix Country Club, was 51.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick had gotten tickets for about 30 of us from Phoenix,''
said Ralph Bernhisel, the director of golf at Phoenix Country Club.
``We were all having such a good time, and for this to happen is
such a tragedy. I especially feel bad for Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Magee, who is using McGuire's locker this week, also was hit
hard by the news as he walked off the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had played with Rick in the Santa Claus Classic,'' Magee
said of the annual pro-am at the TPC of Scottsdale. ``He was truly
a great guy.'' &QL;  &QL;

JUDGMENT AGAINST PHOENIX SATISFIES FIRE VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fire at little Lori Romaneck's house appeared suspicious
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like it began in more than one place, and it spread
fast and low, as if it had been fueled.
</P>
<P>
   So fast, in fact, that it killed Lori's sisters and left half of
her body badly burned.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1967, and the fire broke out during another family
mystery: the disappearance of Lori's mother, Dianne.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators ruled the fire an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, Romaneck came forward with a shocking story
_ that her father had killed her mother and buried her body at the
family home.
</P>
<P>
   The father eventually was sent to prison for that crime, and
investigators took another look at the fatal fire. They determined
it was not an accident but arson.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Romaneck won a $5.5 million judgment against the
city, claiming that police and fire officials were negligent in
their investigation of her sisters' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that negligence, her father, Eugene Keidel,
remained free _ and, she said, subjected her to years of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the fire, my father used to rip off (my) bandages and
rip off new skin,'' said Romaneck, now 37. ``I was 6. I was begging
my father for skin. As you at 6 would beg for a cookie before
dinner, I would beg for skin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They (investigators) abandoned me and left me with a monster
that beat me and tortured me,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   City officials disputed that Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our argument is, `Wait a minute, that's kind of a reach,' ''
City Attorney Phil Haggerty said. ``But that's an argument a jury
could reach. There was risk in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   So the city agreed to a judgment in Romaneck's favor. The $5.5
million will be paid by the city's insurance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   One of Romaneck's attorneys, Frank Verderame, said Thursday that
the key for Romaneck was having the city acknowledge the
negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted acknowledgement of what the city, by walking away
from the death of her mother and her sisters, really did to her,''
he said. ``If it was just about money, we might have held out for
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of Dianne Keidel remained a mystery for 27
years, until Romaneck broke her silence and came forward with
shocking details.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter mailed to Phoenix police, she wrote that she had
seen her father beat her mother on Sept. 17, 1966. Then she had
heard digging outside their west Phoenix house.
</P>
<P>
   But fearful of her father's ``violent retaliation,'' she had
kept quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The year after the letter, in 1994, Eugene Keidel was arrested.
A jury found him guilty of first-degree murder, and he was
sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the murder investigation, questions arose about
the deaths of Romaneck's sisters, Karen Sue ``Susie'' Keidel, 12,
and Kelly Lisa Keidel, 8.
</P>
<P>
   The fire had occurred Jan. 9, 1967. Eugene Keidel told
investigators that he was not home at the time. He had gone to a
convenience store, bought a beer and then drank it while drying
clothes at a laundromat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not 10 minutes later, flames were shooting from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Keidel's four children were home alone. Two died;
Romaneck suffered burns on more than 50 percent of her body; and
her brother, Gregory, 8, escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The two surviving children were left in the care of Eugene
Keidel. Romaneck said that led to a childhood filled with terror _
years and years of physical and sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father started abusing me immediately after my mother's
death,'' she said Thursday, ``and continued to abuse me in various
ways until I turned 18 and moved out of his home.''
</P>
<P>
   Romaneck said she learned for the first time that police and
fire officials suspected foul play in her sister's deaths in 1995,
when she was given copies of their death certificates.
</P>
<P>
   They had been amended by investigators who re-examined the fire
after Romaneck had come forward about her mother's disappearance.
They concluded that the 1967 investigation was flawed, that the
fire was caused by arson, and that the girls' deaths were
homicides. Officials have yet to decide whether to charge Keidel
with them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Romaneck sued.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition, a retired fire investigator, Bob Biven, said
that in 1967 he had suspicions about the fire. He said it appeared
to have started in more than one place, but he could not eliminate
the pan on the stove as a possible source.
</P>
<P>
   He asked police to help investigate, and he worked with
Detective Bill Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Moore later said in a deposition that he could not rule out the
pan on the stove and that he believed the fire was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But the detective also acknowledged that he didn't interview the
surviving children and didn't see the bodies of the dead children
and their burns, or photos of the dead children.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, another Phoenix detective was investigating the
disappearance of Keidel's wife four months before the fire, court
records show, and believed that Keidel was a possible suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Romaneck said Thursday she still has vivid memories of the day
of the fire. Her older sister, Karen Sue, tried desperately to
protect her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last words that child said to me was, `I love you, and
I'll never ever leave you,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a child that's 12 to love me enough to die with me . . . I
could no longer allow their deaths to go unrecognized.'' &QL;

SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE RULES MORE HEARINGS NEEDED ON GENERAL PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In adopting a plan that would allow massive growth
in Los Angeles _ boosting the population 25 percent by 2010 _ city
officials failed to properly tell the public the staggering costs
of meeting the needs of 820,000 new residents, a judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the City Council adopted a General Plan
Framework to guide overall development, Superior Court Judge David
Yaffe tentatively ruled Thursday that the city must hold additional
hearings and give the public a chance to review and comment on how
to meet traffic and transit needs, and whether the city has the up
to $25 billion available to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision could at least temporarily set aside the
General Plan until the additional hearings are held and the plan is
readopted in its current or modified form.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am convinced of is that the public was cut out of this
process,'' Yaffe said during a hearing attended by more than a
dozen homeowner group activists who are challenging the growth plan
in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Improvement and Mitigation Program was not
properly circulated to the public for input before the City Council
voted 9 to 4 to approve the General Plan and an accompanying
Environmental Impact Report in 1996, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That draft EIR refers to this grandiose mitigation scheme to
mitigate traffic problems,'' Yaffe said. ``What you don't tell
everybody is that these mitigation measures are going to cost $25
billion altogether, and the city's share is undisclosed, but is
more than what the city can afford to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaffe said he would not substitute his judgment for that of the
City Council on the merits of the proposal, but said the city was
legally obligated to disclose the transportation plan and its
warnings before adopting the General Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge obviously sees the failings of the city to try to
mitigate the problems of this city,'' said Patricia Bell-Hearst, a
leader of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Associations, the
lead plaintiff in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Bernson, who chairs the City Council's Planning and Land Use
Committee, harshly criticized the ruling even as he maintained it
would have little immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the framework for the plan,'' Bernson said. ``The
actual plan is in the 35 other community plans that spell out the
specifics on zoning and land use. The framework doesn't deal with
zoning. It is merely a set of criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing it did was meet the guidelines of the federal
and state mandates. The framework is only a blueprint for all the
community plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernson's bigger complaint, however, was with Yaffe's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand what he's doing here,'' Bernson said.
``Either he didn't do his homework or he was misled. All the
population projects were developed by SCAG (the Southern California
Association of Government). It is ridiculous of this judge to set
aside the framework that doesn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Susan Phann said depending on the wording
of the judge's written order _ to be finalized in two weeks _ the
General Plan might be allowed to remain in effect while the
transportation report is recirculated and hearings are held.
</P>
<P>
   But Lawrence Teeter, an attorney for the federation, said he
believes the judge's action would temporarily set aside the city's
General Plan while the transportation issue is reheard.
</P>
<P>
   Teeter said he does not see how the council could keep the
General Plan in effect while holding hearings on whether it is
adequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what they want to try, it would be a sham hearing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Murley, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners
Organization and the federation, said the ruling allows a new
challenge about whether the growth plan adequately deals with
traffic and transit problems it would generate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge made the case that we were disenfranchised,'' Murley
said. ``It gives us the ability to raise very strongly the exact
reason why it's an inadequate EIR.''
</P>
<P>
   If the city were allowed to grow at the levels envisioned by the
plan, freeway speeds would grind to half what they are nowunless
mass transit was greatly expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Growth allowed under the disputed plan would create a huge gulf
between needs and critical services, leaving the city short 6,100
police officers, 77 fire stations and 87 schools.
</P>
<P>
   The General Plan is a land-use guide for city planners in
judging zoning and building applications, channeling new
development into areas where public agencies would have to invest
in service and transit upgrades.

DISNEY BUYING INTERNET SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mickey Mouse wants to make it simple to
cyber-surf.
</P>
<P>
   In a major move rearranging the Web's power structure, The Walt
Disney Co. announced Thursday it is buying what will turn into a
controlling interest of one the most popular Internet search
companies in a deal valued at nearly $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney officials say they will use the Internet might of
Infoseek and Disney's strongest assets _ which include such
powerhouse brands as ABC and ESPN, its theme parks and characters _
to attract the hundreds of millions of people not already online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reach to those not yet online is vast,'' said Disney
Internet chief Jake Winebaum.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that far more than any other Internet player,
Disney can successfully market the idea of easy Web access to
nontechies, including the advertising-attractive group of parents
who trust the Disney name but aren't Internet-savvy yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe in the growth of the Internet, and I think
everyone does, this positions Disney as having one of the premier
vehicles,'' said analyst Stewart Halpern of Furman Selz. ``It makes
for a very powerful combination.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies will launch a yet-to-be-named ``portal'' site
later this year but were vague about how it will look and feel
other than the fact that it will seamlessly direct traffic to
Disney's four major Web sites _ Disney.com, ESPN SportsZone,
ABC.com and ABCNews.com.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will put Disney in competition on at least one front
with Internet companies such as America Online and Yahoo! that also
are building content on the World Wide Web, currently used by about
50 million people. But where AOL also serves as an Internet service
provider, giving customers a local telephone number through which
they can access AOL and the Internet, Disney is just offering sites
_ albeit, well-branded sites _ to visit once someone is online.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, with cable and telephone companies working
feverishly to bring the Internet into every home, Disney doesn't
have to offer connection service. After all, Disney attracts
millions of moviegoers but doesn't own any theater chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this will do is bring the Internet to a much broader
consumer base,'' said Steven Cesinger, an analyst with Greif &AMP; Co.
``Because of the power of Disney's name, it's going to build
consciousness of the Internet as a vehicle for getting content out
there. And Disney is correctly figuring out that the Internet is
going to be a dominant distribution medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney, which already has 9 million people viewing
its Web sites regularly, promised in late April that it would
expand its Internet operations as a ``gatekeeper,'' leading to
rumors it would buy a stake in Excite.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the entertainment behemoth targeted Sunnyvale,
Calif.-based Infoseek, which with 14 million users is the third
most popular search engine behind Yahoo! and Excite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a critical step strategically,'' said Jill Krutick of
Salomon Smith Barney. ``It allows the companies to combine their
strengths and it will increase the visibility of the Disney
brands.''
</P>
<P>
   The deals reinforce the view that traditional media companies
will have to partner with Internet specialists rather than build
Web portals from scratch if they are to achieve significant
recognition among current and future Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's deal was just the latest agreement between a
mainstream media company and an Internet firm. Disney formed an
alliance two weeks ago with Excite, providing easy access to
Disney's sites, and NBC last week paid $32 million for a minority
investment in Internet specialist CNET and its Snap! directory
service.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Infoseek had risen nearly 50 percent in the past three
weeks as takeover rumors lifted most Internet stocks. Infoseek
shares gained 62.5 cents to $35.125 after hitting $42 during the
session while Disney lost 2 5/16 to $112.
</P>
<P>
   The $496 million deal calls for Disney to obtain a 43 percent
stake in Infoseek in exchange for Disney's ownership position in
Starwave Corp. _ which develops Disney's Internet sites _ plus $70
million cash.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also calls for Infoseek to buy $165 million in
``promotional support,'' such as ads at the Web site, from Disney.
Disney will give Infoseek a $139 million note that's payable over
five years in exchange for warrants for Disney to buy a majority
stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement stakes out an even more ambitious role for
Disney in this promising medium and provides an ideal partnership
for the creation of a new Internet portal service,'' said Disney
CEO Michael Eisner. ``We have made great strides as a sports, news
and entertainment programmer on the Internet over the past four
years. Through our association with Infoseek, we are now
well-positioned to take advantage of the Internet as it evolves
into commercial maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the entertainment giant is in the right place
at the right time even though profits won't show up on the bottom
line immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a move that looks to the future and not toward any
near-term financial benefits,'' Halpern said.

NBC   DOESN'T OVERCOVER MARTIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From noon to 2 p.m. Thursday, NBC interrupted
``Another World'' and ``Days Of Our Lives'' for the first round of
the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   It could easily have been called ``As Casey Martin's World
Turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, TV decided not to wring more unnecessary suds from
this soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   By the time The Handicapped Golfer climbed into his E-Z-Go cart
after a 3:30 p.m. tee time and nearly run over a USGA official who
cut in front of him, ESPN had assumed coverage (in a somewhat
surreal setting, using NBC broadcasters Dick Enberg and Johnny
Miller). Enberg mentioned that Martin deserved ``high-grade
bravados.'' Miller called Martin ``a brave guy.'' USGA boss David
Fay, in the booth, discussed both sides of the controversy that led
to Martin's court-sought permission to use a cart for the
circulatory ailment in his right leg known as
Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Martin's wild ride through the Olympic course
Thursday was thankfully less than full throttle.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's round didn't really deserve much attention (he wasn't
even finished when coverage ended). ESPN cameras didn't even show
his cart rides between holes, showing instead more shots from other
players.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a reserved treatment is surprising from NBC just coming
off the Michael Jordan Experience. It will have much more of a
chance to cover him live today with his second-round tee-time of 10
a.m. But if anything, extended coverage by NBC and ESPN Thursday
tended to rein in the hype and make the scores the thing to focus
on rather than the potential sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we do (at NBC) is address the issues that are
hot and interesting, but we are fair to who gets covered,'' Miller
said before the tournament. ``It's more the scores than who it is.
We do try to cover who's the best. And there are a lot of good
stories in the game today, in addition to Casey Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning that even with non-Masters'-like TV time _ NBC does 16
hours over the four days, and ESPN takes the first two rounds to
near completion _ there won't be anything more on the Martin story
unless something materializes.
</P>
<P>
   It's also ironic that the usually vocal Miller measures his
words when talking about Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue I'm trying not to make a lot of comments
about,'' said Miller. ``I see both sides. I pull for him, but I
understand the PGA Tour's position. On one hand it's que sera, but
on the other hand, how disabled do you have to be to have the rule
apply? Would it apply to someone like me who has had six
operations? He's in a gray area. I'm very open to his plight, but
from a public view, anything negative sounds very cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably wishes he didn't have to walk. I credit him for
staying so much dead-center on the course that he has the right
stuff to handle the media scrutiny. It's the first time he's here
with the big boys. It'd be quite a thing for him to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Added course reporter Roger Maltbie, who followed Miller in the
18th-hole tower seat Thursday afternoon: ``I certainly feel this is
a special occasion _ a first _ and it's newsworthy. We want the
public to see it first-hand and feel the emotion of his playing. By
the time the first two rounds are complete, you'll see a lot of
him, I believe. But if Casey is 6-over, his coverage is over.''
</P>
<P>
   CASEY AT THE BAT
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who has received nothing but praise by media types for
his accommodating demeanor, writes in the current issue of WE, a
magazine for people with disabilities:
</P>
<P>
   ``Every tournament I'm on the front page or the top of the
sports page, and I'm not totally comfortable there. I want
attention for playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes on to say that some reporters bother him and ``don't
listen to my answers because they have their own agenda. Sometimes,
they have an angle and will come after me relentlessly until they
get their quote.... They hang around until they can take your words
to suit the kind of story they want to have been assigned to write.
That's when it's a distortion, a pain for me.''
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-TRANSACTION WIRE
</P>
<P>
   With the network's NBA coverage complete for the year and
probably no Michael Jordan to baby-sit anymore, Dick Ebersol has
abdicated his title of NBC Sports president to Ken Schanzer.
Ebersol, who had the nameplate since 1989, is going to be known as
the chairman of NBC's Olympics division....
</P>
<P>
   A seven-year contract extension between KCAL-Channel 9 and the
Lakers translates into about a $140 million revenue-sharing deal.
It also guarantees the station all Lakers playoff games that aren't
tied into the national NBC package....
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' new three-year deal KRLA-AM (1110) doesn't mean
they'll be butting heads with the Ducks, whose games were on the
station last season. The Ducks' contract with KRLA ended, and
reportedly they're talking to XTRA-AM (690), which is the station
that the Kings left because of the signal's lack of penetration in
the San Fernando Valley and because the station presented many more
conflicts with other teams' broadcasts....
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Bernstein was allowed out of her contract as a reporter
with ESPN a year early so she could hook up with CBS' ``NFL Today''
show this fall....
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's football game at Miami on Sept. 26 will be on CBS'
schedule with a 9 a.m. kickoff time locally, and Terry Donahue will
be the analyst.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   -- The case of the mistaken celebrity hunk. Go back to that May
25 issue of Sports Illustrated with Mike Piazza on the cover that
proclaimed: ``Trade of the Century.'' The riveting account of
Piazza's final hours as a Dodger as documented by writer Michael
Bamberger takes a strange turn when Piazza takes a phone call from
Fabio. Bamberger assumes it's the male fashion model, who wouldn't
know baseball from boccie ball. So Bamberger writes that. Anyone
who has heard Jim Rome's sports-talk radio show is clued into the
fact that ``Fabio'' is the nickname Piazza gave Eric Karros. We saw
it and laughed it off. But Daily News reader Mark Neuman asked SI
about it. He received e-mail back last week: ``We checked with
Michael Bamberger regarding the `Fabio' that Piazza was on the

repeated that it was the model Fabio, not Karros. Go figure! Best
wishes, SI Letters.'' Just a flippant ``Go figure?'' How about go
figure out who does fact-checking. The official scorer just changed
that from a wild pitch to E-SI.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   -- Sports Illustrated has struck a deal with Norwegian Cruise
Lines to create ``SI Afloat,'' which will charge people to take
cruises and mingle with real-life sports celebrities... like Fabio!
</P>
<P>
   -- ESPN's Sunday morning round table ``The Sports Reporters''
has changed its name to ``ESPN Magazine's The Sports Reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The latest New York media scandal. Famed WCBS sportscaster
Warner Wolf, the video-mad East Coast version of Fred Roggin, lost
his dentures during a live sound bite last Friday night. The New
York Post headline: ``Let's Go to the Poli-Grip,'' along with a
three-picture sequence of Wolf catching his fangs before they bit
the dust. C'mon, is that news? Imagine if Carlos Del Valle was on
the air and became tongue-tied during a KNBC sportscast. No one
would anyone think differently of him.
</P>
<P>
   -- Maybe it's best that USC's new football play-by-play man
doesn't use his real name. With analyst Paul McDonald next to him
and Paul Hackett on the field, it would get pretty confusing.

PATE FINDS HIS RANGE _ OFF COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Somewhere along the Olympic Club's Lake Course
Thursday, Steve Pate misplaced his swing. He stopped by the lost
and found after his first round at the U.S. Open and nobody had
turned it in.
</P>
<P>
   So all the Agoura Hills resident could do was storm off to the
driving range, where he was a study in displaced anger, beating
range balls when everyone knew darn well that what he really wanted
to do was take a bulldozer to the 16th, 17th and 18th holes.
</P>
<P>
   Those 1,424 yards were Pate's undoing, turning a resplendent
round inside out. He arrived at the 16th tee tied for the early
lead at 2-under par and feeling pretty good about himself. He left
the scorer's tent less than an hour later seething after signing
off on a 2-over-par 72.
</P>
<P>
   The four-shot swing came courtesy of bogeys at 16 and 17 and a
double bogey at the par-4, 347-yard 18th. His finish told the story
of many players' first rounds on a day when a marine layer parked
itself over the course like an irksome spectator and made
everything in its midst _ players, putters, coffee _ cold.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Carnevale, who posted a 3-under-par 67, one stroke behind
leader Payne Stewart, was the only player in the 156-man field to
successfully elude the bogey man. Pate was one of the few not to
feel like the Ice Man had cometh.
</P>
<P>
   Pate, a member of the first group that teed off, was at the
driving range for 3{ hours. That was nearly as long as he and
playing partners Olin Browne and Grant Waite were on the course. As
the afternoon wore on, the temperature dropped appreciably and a
wicked wind kicked up chillbumps.
</P>
<P>
   All around Pate, people were reaching for sweatshirts and
windbreakers _ or apparently their wallets, because inside the USGA
merchandise tent warm items were moving faster than some of the
putts on the Lake Course's sloping greens.
</P>
<P>
   Pate was one of the precious few who didn't feel the need to add
another layer to his short-sleeved shirt. Nature's thermostat may
have been turned down ``but not my personal temperature,'' said
Pate, who posted three consecutive top-10 finishes at the start of
the year but has missed the cut in three of his last five PGA Tour
events.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's a small wonder the stares he trained on the heavens
after some of his shots down the stretch didn't burn away the fog.
On the 18th hole, he looked insulted when his second shot from the
shaggy green stuff to the left of the fairway landed in the bunker
in front of the green, indignant when his third shot failed to
clear the bunker, incisive when his fourth shot stopped 6 feet from
the pin, incensed when he missed the bogey putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terrible out there,'' Pate deadpanned after hitting over
500 range balls. ``Now I'm mediocre.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is entirely true. He had a couple of magical moments,
chipping in for a birdie on No. 4 and draining a 60-foot birdie
putt on No. 9. And he hit a couple hundred really nice shots on the
range.
</P>
<P>
   His body language throughout his practice session screamed that
he was particularly disdainful of his downswing. Asked if he had
worked out the kinks to his satisfaction, Pate quipped: ``Yeah, but
I just find new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   At least he could sort of laugh at himself. That's no small
thing for a guy whose peers affectionately call him ``The
Volcano.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate's eruptions are the stuff of lore, but the way he was
snuffing range balls, a few of his fellow players just had to ask,
against their better judgment: ``Whaddya shoot?''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, plus-two hardly seemed worth five bags of range
balls, much less 10. Seventy-seven players in the field would have
given their spare sweater for that score, among them Hale Irwin
(80), Sam Randolph (80), Ben Crenshaw (82) and poor Richard Ames
(86).
</P>
<P>
   Pate's range rage was rivaled only by Jim Furyk, who spent
!ital!four!off! hours teeing up practice balls after shooting a 74
that included a double bogey on each nine.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing for Pate and Furyk that USGA officials didn't
post signs like the ones you find at the gym, usually in the
vicinity of the stairmasters and treadmills, that ask you to abide
by a 30-minute time limit when people are waiting.
</P>
<P>
   We'll find out today whether or not it's a good thing they're
getting another shot at the Lake Course. Pate's strategy is going
to be pretty simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to try to hit some good shots,'' Pate said,
``and avoid the same disasters.'' &QL;

FIXES DURANT'S SCORE TO 68 
 
STEWART CLOSES FAST FOR OPEN LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Birdies on the closing holes yesterday at the
Olympic Club proved tougher to collect than Beanie Babies during
the Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was Payne Stewart, basket full and face awash in an
impish grin, trying to calculate the odds against repeating the
birdie-birdie-birdie finish that propelled him into the first-round
lead at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing it again, I don't know,'' said Stewart, who was one of
only five players to birdie the par-4 17th hole, which played to a
scoring average of 4.65. ``I can see doing 16 and 18. But when you
get a birdie at 17, you can almost soar to the 18th tee. In my
mind, that's an eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there would be long odds against it. But whoever made
the odds just lost, because it just got done.''
</P>
<P>
   By closing with three consecutive birdies, Stewart finished with
a 4-under-par 66 and took a one-stroke lead over Mark Carnevale on
a day with the par-70 layout played to an average score of 75.
</P>
<P>
   Well-tucked pins, firm fairways, tiny greens and thick rough
tinged with a heavy morning dew helped make scoring conditions
difficult for the 156 starters. Stewart was among nine players who
finished yesterday with under-par scores.
</P>
<P>
   Others included Tom Lehman, Bob Tway, Joe Durant and Jose Maria
Olazabal, all at 68. John Daly, Jesper Parnevik and Jeff Maggert, a
Houston resident and Texas A&AMP;M graduate, are at 69.
</P>
<P>
   Several notables struggled, however. Past major-championship
winners Ben Crenshaw (82), Hale Irwin (80), Davis Love III (78),
Nick Faldo (77), Curtis Strange (77) and Corey Pavin (76) all find
themselves at least 10 strokes in back of Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champ Ernie Els, fighting a back ailment, labored to a
75. So did Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks, who still finished five
strokes ahead of fellow Fort Worth resident Sam Randolph (80).
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a less than stellar showing by the game's top
players. But they had plenty of help from U.S. Golf Association
officials, who set pins in positions that were ``scary,'' in the
estimation of Colin Montgomerie, who shot even-par 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised they had the pins so difficult on the first
day,'' said Tiger Woods, who shot a 74 that included a four-putt at
the ninth green. ``Usually, there's a blend of difficult pins and
easy ones. Today, everything was shaded toward the difficult
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   But the well-hidden pins could not stop Stewart, who collected
five birdies and one bogey. He also drained two par putts from
beyond 12 feet in matching his best career start at the Open. In
1991, when Stewart won the title, he opened with a 67.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took advantage of some breaks out there today,'' said
Stewart, who bagged two birdies and collected two pars on holes
where he drove the ball into the rough. ``When you get them, you
have to take advantage of them, especially at a U.S. Open. Because
you don't get that many.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's biggest break came at No. 17, where he hit a driver
into the first cut on the right-hand side. Figuring he could not
reach the green, Stewart opted to play a 2-iron out of the tall
grass and caught it flush. The ball rolled. And rolled. And rolled.
</P>
<P>
   All the way to the front edge of the green, where Stewart
drained the 45-footer for birdie and began an impromptu funky
chicken dance in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge,'' Stewart said. ``That hole is a par-5, no
matter what the scorecard says. To get away with a three ... let's
just say it was a brisk walk down to the 18th tee. I was ready to
hit another shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed with his worst swing of the day, a misdirected
2-iron into the right rough. From there, Stewart dug out an 8-iron
that skirted the edge of the green before reaching pin-high and
turning toward the hole. It eventually stopped 12 feet above the
hole, and Stewart canned the ticklish putt for his final birdie of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's closest pursuer is Carnevale, a career journeyman who
has bounced between the PGA Tour and Nike Tour in recent seasons.
But the 38-year-old emerged as the only front-runner to finish 18
holes without a bogey in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Carnevale, 38, hit 10 of 14 fairways and found 12 of 18 greens
in regulation. He one-putted nine greens, including three for
birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, this is only Thursday. But this is where all the
attention of the golf world is this week,'' said Carnevale, whose
lone PGA Tour triumph came at the 1992 Chattanooga Classic. ``This
is what you have struggled all your life to get to. You finally
realize, `Hey, I'm here.' I'm excited. It was a lot of fun out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   And when was the last time Carnevale played 18 holes without a
bogey?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe at Putt-Putt,'' Carnevale said. ``I'm not sure. But it's
been a while.''  &LR; tagtop:Jimmy Burch, (817) 390-7760

1ST LEWINSKY LAWYER IS QUESTIONED AT GRAND JURY SESSION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts throughout story, re-editing throughout)  (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal grand jury investigating the
relationship between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky on
Thursday heard from the lawyer who had helped prepare her statement
in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony by the lawyer, Francis Carter, has been sought
from the outset of the inquiry by the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr. Carter helped prepare an affidavit on Ms. Lewinsky's behalf
in the lawsuit by Mrs. Jones, in which Ms. Lewinsky denied under
oath that she had had a sexual relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was referred to Carter by Vernon Jordan, a close
friend of the president. Jordan has said that he took Ms. Lewinsky
to see Carter at about the time he was helping to arrange a job for
her. At the time, she faced a subpoena in the sexual harassment
lawsuit brought by Mrs. Jones against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After a full day before the grand jury, Carter declined to
answer reporters' questions. His lawyer, Charles Ogletree, said
some questions had been posed about Carter's relationship with
Jordan, but he declined to provide details other than to say Carter
``testified completely, thoroughly and accurately.''
</P>
<P>
   But later on Thursday, in an interview with The Washington Post,
Carter depicted himself as a lawyer who had been kept in the dark
by his client, Ms. Lewinsky, about several important details. Ms.
Lewinsky did not tell him that she had received gifts from Clinton,
or that Jordan was even then trying to help her find a job, The
Post quoted Carter as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea of any connection between Vernon and her and any
job search,'' Carter recounted in The Post interview, published in
Friday's editions. ``She never mentioned it, and neither did
Vernon.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the subject of Jordan's job-hunting help come up, Carter
said, ``I might have asked her why he was doing it.'' But he
stressed that he still might not have thought anything was
improper, because she also had ties to other prominent Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has said he tried to assist Ms. Lewinsky at the request
of Clinton's personal secretary, Betty Currie. Starr is known to be
investigating whether the job aid from Jordan was part of an
illegal scheme to keep Ms. Lewinsky quiet about a possible affair
with Clinton while the Jones lawsuit was still pending.
</P>
<P>
   A subpoena from Ms. Jones' legal team had demanded that Ms.
Lewinsky turn over any gifts from the president (which reportedly
included a brooch, a T-shirt and a copy of Walt Whitman's ``The
Leaves of Grass''), but Carter said Ms. Lewinsky never mentioned
any gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said Jordan, a powerful figure in Washington's political
and social circles, never suggested how the case should be handled
but simply ``took a piece of candy'' and left Carter and Ms.
Lewinsky alone to get acquainted.
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, Jordan called him on several occasions to see how
Ms. Lewinsky was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Lewinsky had denied a sexual relationship with the
president in the Jones affidavit, Ms. Lewinsky's second set of
lawyers had proposed as part of secret immunity talks with
prosecutors that she would be willing to testify that she did have
sex with Clinton, lawyers involved in those talks said.
</P>
<P>
   But no evidence has surfaced to indicate that Carter did
anything improper in helping Ms. Lewinsky prepare her original
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's appeared before the grand jury on Thursday after losing
a court fight over whether his conversations with Ms. Lewinsky were
protected by the lawyer-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno said she had not
decided whether to open an inquiry about accusations in a new
magazine, Brill's Content, that Starr made improper disclosures to
reporters. Starr has denied those accusations. Ms. Reno said she
had referred the matter to the Office of Professional
Responsibility at the Justice Department to decide whether to
pursue an inquiry.

STEWART CLOSES FAST FOR OPEN LEAD

Fixes Durant score to 68 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

LONE MAN IN CART SHOWS OTHERS THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As they watch him limp, the bitterness wanes. As
they meet the person, the principles soften. And as they witness a
disabled man validating his journey, an amazing thing is happening:
A big divot of compassion is emerging from the pampered fairways of
their soul.
</P>
<P>
   Professional golfers are finding room for Casey Martin and his
cart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see the Senior Tour on the regular Tour,''
said Scott Simpson. ``But as far as Casey _ gosh, he is such a
great guy, you can't root against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not now. Not when the man with a dying leg beats the system,
shrugs off the animosity, keeps his head down and completes the
first round of his first major . . . eight strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Same score as Tiger Woods. One shot better than David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   The stodgy suits will never admit it, but golf scored big on
Thursday. Four months after winning in court, Martin is poised to
go from role model to folk hero.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this wasn't a freak show or a rebel without a cause.
This is a golfer proving why he deserves to ride. And if you have a
pulse, you are cheering for Martin now.
</P>
<P>
   Just like they were on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost overwhelming the support I got from the fans,''
Martin said. ``I have to admit, I was almost crying on the first
tee from the ovation I got.''
</P>
<P>
   Why must the lords of golf fight this sentiment? Why can't they
drop the appeal, one that is costing Martin over six figures in
legal fees? How can they cite the sanctity of tradition when they
sell out to club manufacturers?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to fawn over talent, but what about courage? Isn't
that worth more than anything, a lesson everyone can learn from?
You would think they'd recognize what a boon Martin can be for
their sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He earned his way here,'' Woods said. ``He showed a lot of
courage in dealing with all the things he's had to deal with, with
the lawsuits and all the distractions. I really don't like seeing
golf carts out there, but sometimes you do what's right for the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   So don't fight Casey Martin. Celebrate Casey Martin.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost cruel what Martin experienced after arriving in
San Francisco. A flat tire on the way to his practice round. A cart
that broke down after one hole, and another single-seat model that
almost tipped over navigating the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Martin graciously accepted whatever he was
given, and then his luck began to change.
</P>
<P>
   In an impromptu skins game, Martin fleeced Woods out of $30. On
Thursday, despite a late tee time that had him shivering in the
dark, he played with incredible poise. Despite bogeying the last
two holes, he is in good position to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temperature dropped quite a bit,'' Martin said. ``And not
to put all the blame on this, but it was hard to see and I didn't
hit too many good shots on the last two holes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of playing in the dark, there is still a faction
opposed to Martin. By deposition, Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer
testified against him. And Tom Watson had a chilling response when
asked how he'd feel if his son was in the same position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell him, `You know, son, I want you to play the best you
can within what the Tour will allow','' Watson said. ``(If) the
Tour doesn't allow it, that is just one of the tough decisions in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, Tom. But for all the talk of golf being a physical
activity, know Martin had to walk from approach shot to green, then
on to the next tee. That's about 60 yards per hole, and given
Martin's disease, I'd call that a wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saddens me a bit,'' Martin said. ``It hurts a little to
have to get in a cart to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet once the sun had disappeared, there were no tire tracks, no
dilemmas, no controversy surrounding his cart. Just a man who never
gave up showing us the reason why. &QL;

INDIAN COMMUNITY, STATE REACH TRUCE OVER CASINO POKER HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   State tribal negotiators reached a truce Thursday in the state
poker wars, just 18 hours before Casino Arizona was set to open on
the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Community, east of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   After months of declaring that the state has no authority over
Indian-run poker, Ivan Makil, tribal president, agreed to hire the
state Gaming Department to oversee and monitor its 42-table poker
room at McKellips Road just east of the Pima Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Gov. Jane Hull will not take the tribe the court to
resolve the poker issue, which erupted in August after state
Attorney General Grant Woods said that Indian-run card games are
illegal in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the pact have not been worked out, but it means that
Casino Arizona, which opens Friday, will continue to run its poker
hall while negotiations continue between Hull and tribal officials.
Without the agreement, the casino's continued operation may have
been in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Husk, head of the Arizona Gaming Department, said his
concerns over hiring practices at the casino prove the state should
regulate poker just as it does slot machines and other games in
Indian country.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is worried about the integrity of poker at Casino
Arizona because the tribe has hired a felon and another man whose
gaming license was revoked by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is completely irresponsible for the Salt River Community to
employ unsuitable workers within their gaming operations,'' Husk
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Casino Arizona said that the men pose no risk to
players, and have been approved by the National Indian Gaming
Association in Washington, D.C., and cleared several other
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   The casino's decision to hire Frank Vawter, convicted in 1978 of
embezzlement, and Michael Byrne, whose state gaming license was
revoked in 1996, is under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Tribes, rather than the state, issue licenses to poker-hall
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Salt River gaming officials, who were scrambling Thursday to get
the 20,000-square-foot hall ready for Friday's poker players,
defended the hiring of Vawter and Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Jenkins, Casino Arizona president, said the two men, like
all 300 casino employees, were issued preliminary licenses pending
further background checks.
</P>
<P>
   All poker-hall workers are subjected to checks by federal gaming
officials, as well as the Arizona Indian Regulatory Association,
Jenkins said. In addition, he said, Salt River officials verify
references and call other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Amalia Valencia, Salt River's licensing official, acknowledged
that the casino has hired other felons, but she said they are not
violent and are trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Makil said it is not the tribe's ``policy to hire felons,'' but
said many of ``these people deserve another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Vawter agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``My conviction was 20 years ago, and I have been clean as a
whistle since,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vawter was working at Fort McDowell's casino in 1995 when the
state learned that he had been convicted in California of
embezzling $10,000 from a business partner. He was sentenced to 30
days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Although records show that Vawter's conviction was later set
aside, an Arizona hearing officer refused to issue him a gaming
license needed for a supervisory job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a 20-year career yanked away from me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne, who also worked at Fort McDowell, lost his gaming license
after state regulators ruled that he had worked temporarily in an
unlicensed casino in California. But Byrne said he was given
permission by his boss at Fort McDowell to work at the California
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Although he lost his Arizona license, he said he has been
licensed in California and has been a guest speaker on gambling at
Scottsdale Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (losing your license) should be a lifetime
sentence,'' he said. ``That is not fair.'' &QL;

KOSOVO: THINK CAREFULLY, NATO, BEFORE UNLEASHING THE DOGS OF WAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks simple. The local thug is causing trouble again, this
time beating up his own people, not the neighbors. Last time, he
became cooperative only when the West, in the shape of NATO, showed
it meant business by carrying out air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   All the dire consequences predicted by doubters failed to
happen. A peace treaty was signed, which has worked remarkably
well.
</P>
<P>
   It is now clear that if NATO had acted a lot earlier, Slobodan
Milosevic _ for the thug in question is the Serb nationalist who is
probably more to blame for the Balkans' wars than anyone else _
would have brought his Bosnian cousins to heel much sooner.
Thousands of lives would have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   So don't make the same mistake again: let the bombing begin.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow this week, Milosevic was persuaded by Boris Yeltsin
that it would be prudent to listen to his critics and at least talk
to the people in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo. Yet no one
should assume that this better behavior will last long.
</P>
<P>
   Serb nationalists have a special reverence for parts of Kosovo,
notably the Field of Blackbirds, where their forebears' defeat at
the hands of the Ottomans in 1389 cast the Serbs into 500 years of
Muslim subjugation.
</P>
<P>
   But this reverence for Kosovo does not extend to its people, 90
percent of whom are ethnically Albanian and mostly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   In communist times, Kosovo was an autonomous province of the
Yugoslav republic of Serbia, but since 1989, when its autonomy was
ended, repression has intensified.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars want to secede. Some would prefer to negotiate
their independence; others, growing in number by the day, are ready
to fight for it _ with arms supplied by brethren across the border
in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement on the status of Kosovo, any lull in the
killing is likely to be just that, a lull. The question of whether
to intervene will then recur.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against armed intervention are far from trivial.
It would, if it happened, be an attack on a lawful government that
could claim to be doing no more than fighting to uphold the
principle of territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that what Abraham Lincoln was fighting for? And who gave
NATO the right to go around interfering in other countries'
internal affairs?
</P>
<P>
   On current form, Russia and China would veto any resolution in
the U.N. Security Council to authorize NATO air strikes. And
without the Security Council's approval, it is far from certain
that even a majority of NATO's members would give theirs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, after all, has been assuring everyone that it is now a
defense-cum-peacekeeping outfit that threatens absolutely nobody,
least of all its old adversaries the Russians (among whose
fellow-Slavs are the Serbs). Action, if it is taken, could end up
as an American-British affair.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Serbs' repression in Kosovo, though terrible, is
by no means exceptionally terrible. Some 200-300 people have been
killed and perhaps 65,000 have abandoned their homes, 10,000 of
them fleeing abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The world, it may be remembered, never felt obliged to intervene
in Chechnya (50,000-100,000 dead), East Timor (100,000-200,000) or
Rwanda (800,000).
</P>
<P>
   Is it really wise to start freelance intervention against such
relatively small-time bullies as Milosevic?
</P>
<P>
   Innocents might get killed (always a possibility in military
actions). The Serbs might refuse to back down, leading to the
dangers of more intervention or the embarrassment of less. And the
Kosovars, emboldened by western help, might turn on their
oppressors, ethnically cleansing _ maybe cutting the throats of _
the 10 percent Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day, it could be cited as an awful precedent: how
would NATO react were China, say, to carry out air strikes against
an Indian government that was fighting to prevent its
majority-Muslim province of Jammu &AMP; Kashmir from seceding?
</P>
<P>
   All this should make outsiders think hard before letting slip
their airborne dogs of war. Yet one consideration strengthens the
case, perhaps decisively, for intervention of the right kind.
</P>
<P>
   It is the likelihood that, if the turmoil in Kosovo is not
contained, it will spread to Macedonia, which has its own
discontented ethnic-Albanian minority. The ensuing civil war would
probably lead other Macedonians to take up arms, some of them eager
to break up their country and create a Greater Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Were that to stretch to the Aegean, as some would like, Greece
would be drawn in, and surely also the Kosovars' friend, Turkey
(never mind Albania proper, which has already had one civil war
this decade). Cyprus too would almost certainly go up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   If all this could be stopped by a few bombs now, they would be
bombs well dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a few, or even many, bombs
would be enough. Armed intervention, if it were to work, would also
require specifying exactly what is wanted of the Serbs: an end to
repression in Kosovo and the restoration of its autonomy,
preferably with the handing over to Serbia of the Serbs' holy
places.
</P>
<P>
   It would be accompanied by a vow that the West would not support
the rebels seeking to split Kosovo from Serbia, nor recognize a
self-proclaimed ``independent'' Kosovo (to do so would make a
nonsense of the West's no-change-of-frontiers policy in Bosnia).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the West should do what it could to stabilize
Macedonia (offer aid in return for decent treatment of the ethnic
Albanians). But even this would probably be too little if the
interveners were not ready to get involved on the ground, as well
as in the air, to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect is the nastiest of all for NATO, but, without it,
attacks on Kosovars would probably continue, the pledge to uphold
Serbia's integrity would be disbelieved _ and the bombing would be
seen as yet another empty western gesture. &QL;

   But this reverence for Kosovo does not extend to its people, 90
percent of whom are ethnically Albanian and mostly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   In communist times, Kosovo was an autonomous province of the
Yugoslav republic of Serbia, but since 1989, when its autonomy was
ended, repression has intensified.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars want to secede. Some would prefer to negotiate
their independence; others, growing in number by the day, are ready
to fight for it _ with arms supplied by brethren across the border
in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement on the status of Kosovo, any lull in the
killing is likely to be just that, a lull. The question of whether
to intervene will then recur.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against armed intervention are far from trivial.
It would, if it happened, be an attack on a lawful government that
could claim to be doing no more than fighting to uphold the
principle of territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that what Abraham Lincoln was fighting for? And who gave
NATO the right to go around interfering in other countries'
internal affairs?
</P>
<P>
   On current form, Russia and China would veto any resolution in
the U.N. Security Council to authorize NATO air strikes. And
without the Security Council's approval, it is far from certain
that even a majority of NATO's members would give theirs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, after all, has been assuring everyone that it is now a
defense-cum-peacekeeping outfit that threatens absolutely nobody,
least of all its old adversaries the Russians (among whose
fellow-Slavs are the Serbs). Action, if it is taken, could end up
as an American-British affair.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Serbs' repression in Kosovo, though terrible, is
by no means exceptionally terrible. Some 200-300 people have been
killed and perhaps 65,000 have abandoned their homes, 10,000 of
them fleeing abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The world, it may be remembered, never felt obliged to intervene
in Chechnya (50,000-100,000 dead), East Timor (100,000-200,000) or
Rwanda (800,000).
</P>
<P>
   Is it really wise to start freelance intervention against such
relatively small-time bullies as Milosevic?
</P>
<P>
   Innocents might get killed (always a possibility in military
actions). The Serbs might refuse to back down, leading to the
dangers of more intervention or the embarrassment of less. And the
Kosovars, emboldened by western help, might turn on their
oppressors, ethnically cleansing _ maybe cutting the throats of _
the 10 percent Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day, it could be cited as an awful precedent: how
would NATO react were China, say, to carry out air strikes against
an Indian government that was fighting to prevent its
majority-Muslim province of Jammu &AMP; Kashmir from seceding?
</P>
<P>
   All this should make outsiders think hard before letting slip
their airborne dogs of war. Yet one consideration strengthens the
case, perhaps decisively, for intervention of the right kind.
</P>
<P>
   It is the likelihood that, if the turmoil in Kosovo is not
contained, it will spread to Macedonia, which has its own
discontented ethnic-Albanian minority. The ensuing civil war would
probably lead other Macedonians to take up arms, some of them eager
to break up their country and create a Greater Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Were that to stretch to the Aegean, as some would like, Greece
would be drawn in, and surely also the Kosovars' friend, Turkey
(never mind Albania proper, which has already had one civil war
this decade). Cyprus too would almost certainly go up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   If all this could be stopped by a few bombs now, they would be
bombs well dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a few, or even many, bombs
would be enough. Armed intervention, if it were to work, would also
require specifying exactly what is wanted of the Serbs: an end to
repression in Kosovo and the restoration of its autonomy,
preferably with the handing over to Serbia of the Serbs' holy
places.
</P>
<P>
   It would be accompanied by a vow that the West would not support
the rebels seeking to split Kosovo from Serbia, nor recognize a
self-proclaimed ``independent'' Kosovo (to do so would make a
nonsense of the West's no-change-of-frontiers policy in Bosnia).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the West should do what it could to stabilize
Macedonia (offer aid in return for decent treatment of the ethnic
Albanians). But even this would probably be too little if the
interveners were not ready to get involved on the ground, as well
as in the air, to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect is the nastiest of all for NATO, but, without it,
attacks on Kosovars would probably continue, the pledge to uphold
Serbia's integrity would be disbelieved _ and the bombing would be
seen as yet another empty western gesture. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the mighty fall, mere mortals get scared.
</P>
<P>
   After clinging on desperately for years, Japan has finally
tumbled: output has fallen for two quarters in succession, so its
economy is no longer merely drifting but is officially in
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The news provoked another wave of worldwide economic alarm, as
the yen sank at the beginning of the week to an eight-year low.
Once the global exemplar, Japan's failing economy has come to be
seen as a potent risk to its neighbors and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Outright depression in Japan, further rounds of economic and
political turmoil in the rest of Asia, and a global slump to
follow: might this dismal scenario unfold after all?
</P>
<P>
   What, if anything, can be done to prevent it?
</P>
<P>
   On June 17 the governments of Japan and America made a show of
acting together to fend off the danger. They announced no new
policies, but did back their soothing words with determined
intervention in the foreign-exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
   The yen rallied impressively and global stock markets bounced.
The respite is likely to prove short-lived. Asia's nightmare, and
the West's anxieties about what it means for Europe and America,
are far from over.
</P>
<P>
   A coherent account of what went wrong in Asia, what should have
been done to stop it happening, and what should be done now to
restore stability in the region, is still lacking; for the time
being, damage control and crisis management remain the orders of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the latest events do allow one conclusion to be drawn and
acted upon. Japan must _ and can _ act decisively to revive its
economy.
</P>
<P>
   It has every reason in its own interests to do so, but the fate
of the region also hinges on whether it meets the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of East Asia is in a terrible fix. GDP fell by an
annualized 20 percent or more in South Korea, Malaysia and
Indonesia in the first quarter of this year, and new forecasts
suggest these economies will at best see no growth next year.
</P>
<P>
   As the mayhem continues, Europe and America can exhort, plead
and affect to intervene (in both senses), but for the most part
this is a sideshow. If Asia ever needed, or was entitled to expect,
Japanese leadership, now is the time.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's plight has not caused the region's ills. But it affects
Asia in two ways. Lack of demand in its economy _ much the region's
biggest _ means that the crippled tigers cannot export their way to
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Sales to Japan account for as much as 12 percent of Malaysia's
GDP, and 5-7 percent of GDP in Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and
Taiwan. In addition, the weak yen reduces the competitive advantage
that the Asian devaluations would otherwise have given the tigers'
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Asia needs both stronger demand in Japan and
a stronger yen. But arranging both is tricky, even supposing that
Japan can summon the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A loose monetary policy is essential if Japan is to spur
domestic demand; a loose monetary policy means, among other things,
a depreciated yen.
</P>
<P>
   This dilemma has helped to fuel the recent mood of despair _ and
yet it can be resolved. In itself, the harm that a weak yen does to
Asia is not great. The yen has fallen over the past couple of
months, but it remains much stronger against the other East Asian
currencies than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also, though South Korea and Taiwan compete head-on with Japan,
other Asian countries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia,
export quite different goods: their competitiveness in third
markets is not directly affected by the fall in the yen.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a cheap yen would be a small price for Asia to pay
for a speedier recovery in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   To this, the most resolute pessimists reply that neither a cheap
yen nor anything else will spur the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal policy has stopped working; the sickness of Japan's banks
makes any macroeconomic approach to the problem, fiscal or
monetary, irrelevant; the country's productive potential, not
merely its ability to mobilize demand, is collapsing. And so the
litany of despair goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Things are bad, all right, but nowhere near as bad as this.
Fiscal policy remains both usable and, if used, effective. The
problems in the banking system, once properly acknowledged, can be
dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   The ``supply side'' of Japan's economy needs further reform, but
it is hysterical to say that, regardless of demand in the economy,
Japan is henceforth condemned to little or no growth. These are
excuses for inaction _ the last thing Japanese politicians need.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose then that Japan does what it should _ spurring demand
with monetary and fiscal policy, cleaning up the banking mess and
vigorously pursuing reform elsewhere in the economy _ will that be
enough to make the world economy a safe place?
</P>
<P>
   No. Risk can be reduced but not eliminated. A devaluation of
China's yuan, for instance, would cause further real harm to the
region's other economies. The Hong Kong dollar's peg would probably
give way, too, leading to another round of competitive devaluations
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, China will continue to resist devaluation: the recent
fall in China's exports is mainly due to weak regional demand, not
an overvalued currency. But China may devalue anyway, and that
would be scary.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk is the delicate state of western stock markets,
especially Wall Street. If more bad news from Asia causes equity
prices in the United States and Europe to slide, the scene would be
set for a slowdown spreading far beyond Asia. This remains the
likeliest channel of contagion.
</P>
<P>
   America's exports to Japan account for a tiny 1 percent of its
GDP. All its exports to the whole of Asia amount to a relatively
modest 2.4 percent of GDP. Even if its sales to the region fell by
25 percent, this would reduce growth only by half a point.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the slump in Asia has so far had little effect in
the United States. Also, the faster-than-expected recovery in
continental Europe this year is helping to fill the hole in world
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the problems in Asia, the Fed would almost
certainly have raised America's interest rates by now. Indeed,
there is growing evidence that the American economy is overheating
despite the chilly breeze from across the Pacific: consumer
spending continues to boom, unemployment is at a 30-year low of 4.3
percent, and inflation is starting to creep up.
</P>
<P>
   Asia notwithstanding, America needs to raise its interest rates
_ but to do so would hurt Asian debtors and, by drawing more
capital out of Asian markets, worsen the region's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   So here is another monetary-policy dilemma. Again, it is best
resolved by attending first to the needs of the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan needs looser monetary policy, America needs tighter. Moves
in either case would act to weaken the yen _ which is a risk, but
on balance one that is worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Asia's interests are better served by stronger demand in
Japan than by a policy to defend the yen, so they are better served
by economic stability in the United States than by a concern to
keep American interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation in America continues to rise, the Fed will have to
raise rates abruptly, and by more than if it acts now. That would
deal Asia a worse blow.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Japan faced pressure from the United States to
keep its interest rates down. America was worried about the
tumbling dollar and slow growth. Japan obliged, despite signs that
its economy was overheating and a financial bubble was developing.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's current mess has much to do with that mistake. It is a
lesson worth pondering. &QL;

   On June 17 the governments of Japan and America made a show of
acting together to fend off the danger. They announced no new
policies, but did back their soothing words with determined
intervention in the foreign-exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
   The yen rallied impressively and global stock markets bounced.
The respite is likely to prove short-lived. Asia's nightmare, and
the West's anxieties about what it means for Europe and America,
are far from over.
</P>
<P>
   A coherent account of what went wrong in Asia, what should have
been done to stop it happening, and what should be done now to
restore stability in the region, is still lacking; for the time
being, damage control and crisis management remain the orders of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the latest events do allow one conclusion to be drawn and
acted upon. Japan must _ and can _ act decisively to revive its
economy.
</P>
<P>
   It has every reason in its own interests to do so, but the fate
of the region also hinges on whether it meets the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of East Asia is in a terrible fix. GDP fell by an
annualized 20 percent or more in South Korea, Malaysia and
Indonesia in the first quarter of this year, and new forecasts
suggest these economies will at best see no growth next year.
</P>
<P>
   As the mayhem continues, Europe and America can exhort, plead
and affect to intervene (in both senses), but for the most part
this is a sideshow. If Asia ever needed, or was entitled to expect,
Japanese leadership, now is the time.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's plight has not caused the region's ills. But it affects
Asia in two ways. Lack of demand in its economy _ much the region's
biggest _ means that the crippled tigers cannot export their way to
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Sales to Japan account for as much as 12 percent of Malaysia's
GDP, and 5-7 percent of GDP in Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and
Taiwan. In addition, the weak yen reduces the competitive advantage
that the Asian devaluations would otherwise have given the tigers'
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Asia needs both stronger demand in Japan and
a stronger yen. But arranging both is tricky, even supposing that
Japan can summon the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A loose monetary policy is essential if Japan is to spur
domestic demand; a loose monetary policy means, among other things,
a depreciated yen.
</P>
<P>
   This dilemma has helped to fuel the recent mood of despair _ and
yet it can be resolved. In itself, the harm that a weak yen does to
Asia is not great. The yen has fallen over the past couple of
months, but it remains much stronger against the other East Asian
currencies than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also, though South Korea and Taiwan compete head-on with Japan,
other Asian countries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia,
export quite different goods: their competitiveness in third
markets is not directly affected by the fall in the yen.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a cheap yen would be a small price for Asia to pay
for a speedier recovery in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   To this, the most resolute pessimists reply that neither a cheap
yen nor anything else will spur the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal policy has stopped working; the sickness of Japan's banks
makes any macroeconomic approach to the problem, fiscal or
monetary, irrelevant; the country's productive potential, not
merely its ability to mobilize demand, is collapsing. And so the
litany of despair goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Things are bad, all right, but nowhere near as bad as this.
Fiscal policy remains both usable and, if used, effective. The
problems in the banking system, once properly acknowledged, can be
dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   The ``supply side'' of Japan's economy needs further reform, but
it is hysterical to say that, regardless of demand in the economy,
Japan is henceforth condemned to little or no growth. These are
excuses for inaction _ the last thing Japanese politicians need.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose then that Japan does what it should _ spurring demand
with monetary and fiscal policy, cleaning up the banking mess and
vigorously pursuing reform elsewhere in the economy _ will that be
enough to make the world economy a safe place?
</P>
<P>
   No. Risk can be reduced but not eliminated. A devaluation of
China's yuan, for instance, would cause further real harm to the
region's other economies. The Hong Kong dollar's peg would probably
give way, too, leading to another round of competitive devaluations
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, China will continue to resist devaluation: the recent
fall in China's exports is mainly due to weak regional demand, not
an overvalued currency. But China may devalue anyway, and that
would be scary.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk is the delicate state of western stock markets,
especially Wall Street. If more bad news from Asia causes equity
prices in the United States and Europe to slide, the scene would be
set for a slowdown spreading far beyond Asia. This remains the
likeliest channel of contagion.
</P>
<P>
   America's exports to Japan account for a tiny 1 percent of its
GDP. All its exports to the whole of Asia amount to a relatively
modest 2.4 percent of GDP. Even if its sales to the region fell by
25 percent, this would reduce growth only by half a point.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the slump in Asia has so far had little effect in
the United States. Also, the faster-than-expected recovery in
continental Europe this year is helping to fill the hole in world
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the problems in Asia, the Fed would almost
certainly have raised America's interest rates by now. Indeed,
there is growing evidence that the American economy is overheating
despite the chilly breeze from across the Pacific: consumer
spending continues to boom, unemployment is at a 30-year low of 4.3
percent, and inflation is starting to creep up.
</P>
<P>
   Asia notwithstanding, America needs to raise its interest rates
_ but to do so would hurt Asian debtors and, by drawing more
capital out of Asian markets, worsen the region's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   So here is another monetary-policy dilemma. Again, it is best
resolved by attending first to the needs of the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan needs looser monetary policy, America needs tighter. Moves
in either case would act to weaken the yen _ which is a risk, but
on balance one that is worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Asia's interests are better served by stronger demand in
Japan than by a policy to defend the yen, so they are better served
by economic stability in the United States than by a concern to
keep American interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation in America continues to rise, the Fed will have to
raise rates abruptly, and by more than if it acts now. That would
deal Asia a worse blow.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Japan faced pressure from the United States to
keep its interest rates down. America was worried about the
tumbling dollar and slow growth. Japan obliged, despite signs that
its economy was overheating and a financial bubble was developing.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's current mess has much to do with that mistake. It is a
lesson worth pondering. &QL;

WESTPHAL HOPES THIS SEATTLE STAY PANS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bad as it might get for Paul Westphal next season _
combine the NBA labor dispute with a significant team rebuild, as
well as Gary Payton's mercurial temperament, and prospects are not
pretty _ it won't compare to the tub o' goo he found the first time
he replaced a local Sonic hero.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal retains a souvenir from his unlamented Seattle season
of 1980-81, when he was traded from Phoenix for fellow All-Star
guard Dennis Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bedpan,'' he said. ``Everybody on the team got one as a
joke, because of all the injuries we had that year.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years after they won the NBA title, the Sonics fell to 34-48
and last in the Pacific Division _ the fastest, steepest fall for a
champion in NBA history. Along with leading scorer Gus Williams'
season-long contract holdout and forward Lonnie Shelton's broken
wrist after 14 games, Westphal's Sonic career lasted just 36 games
because of a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was a free agent after the season and left Seattle for
the New York Knicks, and since Johnson went on to stardom with the
Suns and Boston Celtics, including two championships, it can be
argued that Westphal was part of the worst trade in Seattle pro
sports history (remember, Brian Bosworth was a draft choice).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the Most Valuable Player in the 1979 Finals and a
superb defender. But his subsequent big contract and petulant
selfishness made him, according to his then-coach, Lenny Wilkens,
``a cancer that had to be cut out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's problems faded as he matured. Larry Bird
eventually called him ``the greatest guard I ever played with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson trade ushered in a decade of mediocrity that didn't
end until Karl arrived in 1992. Now, after six years averaging
nearly 60 regular-season wins, the Sonics are at a crossroads
similar to the one two decades earlier _ on the backside of
success, striving to stay elite.
</P>
<P>
   And Westphal again is the linchpin.
</P>
<P>
   But the travail of his first Sonic go-round provides a couple of
lessons useful this time: Things can slip away quickly, and one
can't assume that today's pain will be tomorrow's pain.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the disparity between the Sonics and Lakers in the
playoffs, and the disparities between L.A. and Utah, and Utah and
Chicago, it's clear that the 60-win benchmark in the
expansion-bloated NBA has been cheapened dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   By April, the aging Sonics had slid considerably. At least four
players in the rotation _ Jim McIlvaine, Nate McMillan, Sam Perkins
and Dale Ellis _ could no longer play the Sonic-style defense,
because of injury, age or inability. Should there have been an
injury to any one of the remaining regulars, the Sonics were doomed
to another first-round disaster.
</P>
<P>
   While the return of Gary Payton, Vin Baker, Detlef Schrempf and
Hersey Hawkins would seem to bode well, they each did enough things
poorly in the playoffs to suggest that the team Westphal inherits
is more vulnerable than it appears on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic president Wally Walker will need to do more than simply
sign up free agents to fill vacancies. Years of failure to develop
young talent under Karl means Walker has to be extremely aggressive
and/or lucky to avoid a 10- to 12-game dropoff.
</P>
<P>
   In his introductory press chat, Westphal hinted that a falloff
might be in store.
</P>
<P>
   Playing young players ``may mean you'll lose a few more
regular-season games,'' he said, ``but the coach owes it to the
franchise to develop that talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Karl would have said that? When Walker talks of Karl's
inability to be on the same page with the organization, it has to
do more with unshared goals such as developing young players than
it does with leaks to the press.
</P>
<P>
   As far as today's pain lingering into tomorrow: Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   A growing assumption is that Payton will be the same headache to
manage for Westphal that he was to Karl. While Payton, 30 by next
season, isn't likely to transform as Johnson did, his dealings with
Westphal might prove more positive.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal is a cooler, less emotional commander than Karl, whose
temper made for regular flashpoints with the equally dyspeptic
Payton. The relationship between Payton and Karl was frayed enough
to have become counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal made clear he will indulge a double standard with
Payton, as he did with Charles Barkley in Phoenix. If that
arrangement is understood and accepted by the team from the start,
rather than develop awkwardly over time, the tension drops
substantially.
</P>
<P>
   The x-factor in the Sonic future is the bitterness that will be
generated from the impending lockout of NBA players forecast for
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has already prompted a withdrawal of NBA stars,
including Payton and Baker, from the team that will represent the
U.S. at the World Championships in Athens in August.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't return, among the options USA Basketball is
considering is suing the individual players for breach of contract.
If that won't get Payton double ornery, nothing will.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to know where the lockout, as well as the other variables,
will leave the Sonics by November. But if it gets really bad,
Westphal still has his bedpan.

STEWART LEADS U.S. OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One trip around The Olympic Club was supposed to
bring great pain and suffering. We got Payne Stewart and sinister
laughter instead.
</P>
<P>
   The guy in the funny clothes Thursday mocked the torture chamber
known as the 98th U.S. Open, sidestepping the unforgiving rough and
striding jauntily through the eucalyptus and cyprus trees. He
didn't stop until climbing atop the first-round leaderboard with a
four-under-par 66.
</P>
<P>
   That was good for a one-shot edge over Mark Carnevale. That was
reason enough for the USGA to consider testing only his equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 41 and in decline since winning a pair of majors, made
it look easy when things were meant to be flat-out miserable.
Player after player had declared Olympic's four-foot rough as
unfair as any ever encountered on the tour. Par golf was predicted.
</P>
<P>
   With a shrug and a 2-iron, the carefree Stewart barely flinched
on a cool, overcast day in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave myself a lot of chances and I was very patient,'' he
said. ``That is what you have to be at a United States Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also was uncommonly good as he finished. He birdied the
last three holes on the course, something done only once before _
by Denis Watson at Olympic's 1987 U.S. Open. He birdied the par-4,
468-yard 17th _ a feat matched by only three others, Carnevale,
Jason Allen and Chris Tidland. He was one of nine players among the
156 to break par, and his 66 was the lowest first-round score in
four Olympic Opens.
</P>
<P>
   And he seemed to greatly enjoy himself and his new-found
success. Meeting with reporters, Stewart feigned mock horror when
USGA official Les Unger pointed out that it had been a couple years
since he had been in the U.S. Open press tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never invited me,'' Stewart said. ``I would have come.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Unger: ``You have to do something to be invited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good shot; I deserved that,'' Stewart said
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly so. He had finished well out of the running in the
previous four U.S. Opens, with 21st his best effort. He had won
only once on the tour over the past seven years, since claiming the
1991 U.S. Open in a playoff with Scott Simpson (his other major
victory was the 1989 PGA Championship). In his most recent outing,
The Memorial, he had shot an 83, taking a 10 on one hole.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Stewart was a new man. He was dressed the same as
usual, wearing one of his trademark ensembles, a blue and plaid
look, complete with cap and knickers. But his game was sharper,
mixing pinpoint accuracy, great resilience and, admittedly, dumb
luck in piecing together a five-birdie, one-bogey effort.
</P>
<P>
   On the short but tricky 288-yard seventh, he nearly holed out,
leaving a wedge shot three inches from the cup. Tap-in birdie. On
the 609-yard 16th, he left an iron shot eight inches from the hole.
Another tap-in birdie.
</P>
<P>
   On the 17th, a converted par-5 and Olympic's toughest hole,
Stewart launched a 2-iron out of the rough and onto the green. He
rammed in a 45-foot putt for birdie and wiggled his body in
celebration. On the 347-yard 18th, he curled in a 12-footer for
birdie, again escaping the rough off the tee. Playing
conservatively, he used his driver just three times.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart would have been content with an even-par score. At
four-under, he was downright giddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really good, really good, really good,'' he said, almost
rhythmically. ``I enjoyed that.''
</P>
<P>
   His closest pursuer was another unlikely Open contender,
Carnevale, who shot a bogey-free 67. The stocky 38-year-old golfer
had struggled mightily this season, missing the cut in 10 of 15
events and finishing no higher than 41st at the Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
   But he hung with Stewart. Even when the inevitable happened _
when he realized how much uncharted territory he had covered. He
has one tour victory to his name, the 1992 Chattanooga Classic. Not
exactly a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work so hard to get to this point and, all of a sudden,
you realize that this is where all the attention of the golf world
is this week,'' he said. ``This is what you have struggled all your
life to get to. You finally realize: `Hey, I am here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, Joe Durant, Jose Maria Olazabal and Bob Tway were
two strokes back. Jeff Maggert, Jesper Parnevik and John Daly were
three off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, winner of the 1991 PGA Championship and 1995 British Open,
has forsaken his driver this week, a courageous move for a man
longer off the tee than anyone. He has turned to his 3-wood,
leaving him some 35 to 40 yards shorter than the norm and conceding
long drive stats and bonus money. He's not happy, but he's in
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, this sucks,'' he said. ``I mean, I hate it. I don't like
it. But it is challenging. Whenever I can't use a driver on 18
holes, it is not good for the fans. But it is the only way to play
this golf course and I believe the only way I have a chance of
playing really solid.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ As America basks in what may soon become the longest
economic expansion in its history, one state continues to struggle
with economic adversity. It is, curiously, the state that most
Americans naturally associate with luxurious good times and
unclouded skies: Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian economy has been stagnant for most of the decade.
It has averaged only 0.5 percent growth per year since 1990; the
Bank of Hawaii is predicting no growth at all in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion poll last month, 34 percent of those asked said
they were worse off financially than a year ago, compared with only
15 percent who felt better off.
</P>
<P>
   Some are much worse off: unemployment has more than doubled
since 1990 and personal bankruptcies have increased fivefold.
</P>
<P>
   While other states bicker over how to spend their growing budget
surpluses, Hawaii may face a $140 million deficit by June next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Aloha State thinks of itself as on Asia's doorstep. These
days, that is no advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese tourists, who account for more than a third of all
Hawaii's tourism, are still coming in record numbers, but they are
spending less and going home sooner. Their money, they find, does
not go far; the yen has depreciated 40 percent against the dollar
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland Americans, eager to spend some of their stock market
gains on a Hawaiian vacation, have taken up part of the slack. But
that is not much help. The Japanese, who take more presents home,
spend on average twice as much a day as Americans, despite their
recent belt-tightening.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian islands are also feeling the hangover from the
party they threw in the late 1980s, mostly with Japanese money.
Japanese investors ploughed money into Hawaiian property, sending
prices to dizzying levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, on the big island of Hawaii, is a
typical bubble development. The 1,200-room hotel was built in 1988
by a group of Japanese investors for an estimated $360 million.
Guests are ferried to their rooms by water taxi; employees scurry
about in underground tunnels. You can pay to swim with live
dolphins in a 2 million-gallon lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   The property was unloaded by a Japanese bank in 1993 for $55
million.
</P>
<P>
   Then there has been bad luck. Hurricane Iniki leveled the island
of Kauai in 1992, causing nearly $2 billion-worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the state as a whole, eight sugar-cane plantations have
closed in the past decade, in part because Asia can grow the crop
more cheaply, but also because Americans are using more
high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiians sometimes feel they cannot win. ``We don't control
the forces on the outside. We're just a little dot on the
Pacific,'' says Hawaii's governor, Ben Cayetano.
</P>
<P>
   True, but this is an expensive, highly-taxed, highly-regulated
little dot on the Pacific, and Hawaii cannot blame all its troubles
on Asia; it is also a lousy place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the cost of living roughly a third higher than the
American urban average, but government is far more centralized than
in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii, for example, is the only state with one unified school
district operated at the state level. (Not surprisingly, the
schools get poor marks.)
</P>
<P>
   Only Michigan and New York have a higher proportion of unionized
workers. The public-sector unions are particularly powerful. The
result is that Hawaii is 20 years behind other cities and states in
wringing productivity gains out of its public workers.
</P>
<P>
   Each new public employee can count on 21 days of paid holiday,
14 public holidays on which he gets paid, and 21 days of paid sick
leave. Should that prove too stressful, he must be caught drinking
on the job four times in a two-year period before being asked to
resign; he is not sacked.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the collective-bargaining agreement gives the
public-workers' union virtual veto power over any government
decision that changes ``conditions of work,'' even if no union jobs
are lost.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that public managers can spend years trying to
accomplish something as trivial as changing the route of a garbage
truck.
</P>
<P>
   And things have got worse. Last year, the Hawaii Supreme Court
essentially ruled privatization unconstitutional by finding that
the state's Civil-Service Act forbids moving to the private sector
any jobs that have ``traditionally and historically'' been
performed by public workers.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's powerful environmental groups are skeptical, if not
hostile, to growth and development. On its face, that is a good
thing. Hawaii has some of the most spectacular scenery in the
world, and tourists fly thousands of miles to see its white sand
beaches and stunning volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   These need to be protected. Yet the people most fiercely opposed
to development often earned their money on the mainland before
retiring to Hawaii; they are not unemployed farm workers, who might
benefit from a few more carefully managed projects.
</P>
<P>
   Take the contentious issue of the airport on Maui. At present,
the airport does not have a runway long enough to take large jets

also help business.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gifford, the president of the Maui Land &AMP; Pineapple
Company, points out that the short runway makes it more difficult
to get fresh pineapples to market.
</P>
<P>
   On the west coast of the island of Hawaii, a new international
airport generated a 26 percent increase in tourist arrivals in
1997. But the anti-growth forces will not countenance a bigger
airport on Maui and, so far, they are winning. &QL;

   The floundering economy sets the stage for a political showdown.
Hawaii is a Democratic bastion; the state has not had a Republican
governor since 1962. That may change in November.
</P>
<P>
   Cayetano is being challenged by Linda Lingle, the mayor of Maui.
Lingle is not exactly what a political consultant would prescribe:
she is a white Jewish Republican, born in St. Louis. But she has
gained notice on Maui for getting things done and for drawing
business people into the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Her finance director, Travis Thompson, is a former Boeing
employee who thought he was retiring to Maui. Lingle points out
that, while the rest of the state struggles to grow, Maui has added
jobs in five of the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Can she win? Lingle has been twice reelected as mayor, even
though registered Democrats in Maui County outnumber Republicans by
about 30 to one.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful union leaders remain staunch Democrats; the rank
and file are not so sure. A recent poll put Lingle solidly ahead of
Cayetano, 49 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The better question is whether she can really change things if
she does win. For all the angst over the economy, there is
tremendous grass-roots resistance to economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Cayetano and legislative leaders convened an Economic
Revitalization Task Force made up of government officials, business
leaders and organized labor. Months later, the group returned with
proposals for reducing the cost of doing business, streamlining the
regulatory process, boosting tourism and improving the public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But even with organized labour on board, the package could not
be sold to legislators, some of whom had branded the task-force
members as ``avaricious jackals,''
</P>
<P>
   Some changes were made, including a big cut in the personal
income tax, but much of the package was torn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a legislature that was pounded on for a year to do
something, and they did diddly,'' says Paul Baldwin, a prominent
Maui rancher. Baldwin is one of five investors who have built a
high-tech research park on Maui in hopes of luring
information-technology firms to the state. &QL;

   The Hawaiian economy has not fallen off the cliff. But it has,
after climbing for decades, reached a long plateau. The state grew
at an average rate of 4.4 percent between 1959 and 1990.

   ``Not growing when you're used to it is really painful,'' says

PAYTON HOLDS KEY TO SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Gary Payton had done it again. No surprise. It was
expected under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed the Los Angeles Lakers at halftime in Game 4
of the Western Conference semifinals. Even more frustrating, they
were getting walloped in the series on their way to playoff
elimination.
</P>
<P>
   So Payton exploded _ in the locker room and in the face of
former coach George Karl, who barked back. The scene reflected the
type of confrontations (usually over game-plan disagreements) that
Karl and Payton engaged in several times last season, seemingly
many times during their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics went on to lose that game 112-100. Payton followed
the tirade with an explosion on the court _ 31 points, 13 assists
and eight rebounds in 41 minutes _ yet his monster game did not
translate into a victory. One loss later, Karl was finished as
Sonics coach.
</P>
<P>
   Point of the story?
</P>
<P>
   If Paul Westphal did not know already, he has a clue now.
Westphal, who was named the Sonics' new coach Wednesday, must get
more out of Payton _ in subtle ways _ than his predecessor did.
</P>
<P>
   Karl struggled with his point guard from start to finish.
Veteran Sonic players complained privately that Karl established
rules _ such as players must practice to play _ then let Payton
bend them with impunity. They also complained that Payton sometimes
strayed from Karl's game plans or would sometimes distance himself
from his teammates in critical moments of games when his leadership
was needed.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sonics were dropped from the postseason, Karl met with
president Wally Walker to discuss the team's future. One of Karl's
suggestions was that the Sonics should be open to the possibility
of trading Payton for several players if the team experienced more
second-round jolts. It was the second time in four years that Karl
made such a plea.
</P>
<P>
   Walker told Karl then what he told the Post-Intelligencer
recently: ``I'm still a Gary Payton fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Ackerley loves Payton. The team owner invested seven years
and $87 million into the All-Star point guard. Seattle fans idolize
Payton, and the NBA markets his ability.
</P>
<P>
   Karl admired Payton's skills. To most observers, Payton is the
best point guard in the game. Karl also knows that Payton turned
him into a $3.5 million coach. Karl helped Payton become a $12
million player.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship, while respectful, was airtight only for
public consumption. Karl continuously insisted on more from Payton.
He wanted a type of leadership Payton isn't ready to give. In
Payton's view, playing hard and producing every night is enough;
Karl also wanted a second coming of Nate McMillan, a vocal leader
in the locker room as well as on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, though, is a superstar. And with superstars come
baggage. Now, it is Westphal's turn to carry the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line in the NBA is what happens out there when the
game begins. Are you playing hard? Are you playing for the team?
Are you giving everything you have?'' Westphal said. ``There are a
lot of personality quirks that everybody has. Me included. And
after having coached Charles Barkley (in Phoenix) I don't think
there's anything that I'll see that I haven't already seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal knows the makeup of his best player. Payton often does
not practice. He is volatile and emotional. Payton is so
competitive that when he doesn't win, he transforms into someone
whose raging persona rivals the Incredible Hulk. Karl never got a
grip on that part of Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Westphal will. He is cut from the same cloth. Although
Westphal is considered laid-back now, he was a terror growing up.
Westphal told a childhood story about getting kicked out of a
sixth-grade game. He thought the officiating was terrible and
committed a flagrant foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only correct call (the referee) made all game,''
Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the game, Westphal remembers the official's advice:
Get emotions under control, or flame out. Westphal had grown up a
``monster on the court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So his meeting with Payton in Oakland earlier this week wasn't
about changing the eight-year Sonic. Westphal merely opened the
lines of communication as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are very fortunate if you have a superstar who is willing
to be coached,'' Westphal said. ``If your superstar is not willing
to admit he's wrong sometimes, or admit that the coach has to have
the final say on things, then you're doomed. I don't care who you
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of it comes down to the integrity of the player to
agree to have a coach tell him what the final say is. There have
been instances exhibited in the NBA recently where a player can get
a coach fired. Hopefully, the player can be reasonable, and I think
that's the case here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being short-tempered, Payton is gentle, respectful and
open-minded. All superstars must exercise those qualities at some
level.
</P>
<P>
   For as little as Chicago's Phil Jackson is given credit for the
Bulls' success, the glory is his. Sure, Michael Jordan makes all
the game-winning baskets, but he is canning them Jackson's way.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan hated the triangle offense when Jackson was named coach.
He still believes ``it is not a professional offense.'' However, it
wasn't until Jordan accepted Jackson's idea of leading that the
Bulls thrived. Remember that Jordan was in the league seven years
before Chicago won its first title.
</P>
<P>
   Payton will give Westphal a chance. He wants to reach the next
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody can't be the perfect person in practice, slapping
the floor and being rah-rah,'' said Eric Goodwin, who manages
Payton with Aaron Goodwin, his brother. ``Most of the big stars in
the game have their own quirks. These guys are being tugged in
millions of ways. There has to be an outlet. Sometimes he (Payton)
doesn't want to practice. But that's not what leadership is about.
Leadership is finding ways to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton's reluctance about practice is due in part to his
chronically sore back, for which he gets regular treatment. It's
not in the club's best interest that he risks aggravating the
problem in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, though, has missed just two regular-season games his
entire career. He is regarded as the Sonics' toughest player. Think
Westphal will ride him about practice?
</P>
<P>
   Westphal won an NBA championship alongside John Havlicek on the
1973-74 Boston Celtics. Havlicek almost never practiced, Westphal
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd come (in the gym), sit and watch practice, but played 48
minutes every game. Nobody played harder than him, and he never
touched a ball in the summer,'' said Westphal, who continued his
point by describing how Celtic legend Larry Bird came to practice
early and left late. ``Everybody says be like Larry Bird. Nobody
says be like John Havlicek _ never practice, never touch a ball (in
the summer).
</P>
<P>
   ``... A coach has to be flexible and understand the need of his
players, that players are not all the same. And that the players
have to understand that you are treating them fairly but not
equally. Then you have no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a theory Payton already believes in. Westphal's problem
will be getting the 11 other Sonics to buy into it.

<P>
   HONOLULU _ As America basks in what may soon become the longest
economic expansion in its history, one state continues to struggle
with economic adversity. It is, curiously, the state that most
Americans naturally associate with luxurious good times and
unclouded skies: Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian economy has been stagnant for most of the decade.
It has averaged only 0.5 percent growth per year since 1990; the
Bank of Hawaii is predicting no growth at all in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion poll last month, 34 percent of those asked said
they were worse off financially than a year ago, compared with only
15 percent who felt better off.
</P>
<P>
   Some are much worse off: unemployment has more than doubled
since 1990 and personal bankruptcies have increased fivefold.
</P>
<P>
   While other states bicker over how to spend their growing budget
surpluses, Hawaii may face a $140 million deficit by June next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Aloha State thinks of itself as on Asia's doorstep. These
days, that is no advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese tourists, who account for more than a third of all
Hawaii's tourism, are still coming in record numbers, but they are
spending less and going home sooner. Their money, they find, does
not go far; the yen has depreciated 40 percent against the dollar
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland Americans, eager to spend some of their stock market
gains on a Hawaiian vacation, have taken up part of the slack. But
that is not much help. The Japanese, who take more presents home,
spend on average twice as much a day as Americans, despite their
recent belt-tightening.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian islands are also feeling the hangover from the
party they threw in the late 1980s, mostly with Japanese money.
Japanese investors ploughed money into Hawaiian property, sending
prices to dizzying levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, on the big island of Hawaii, is a
typical bubble development. The 1,200-room hotel was built in 1988
by a group of Japanese investors for an estimated $360 million.
Guests are ferried to their rooms by water taxi; employees scurry
about in underground tunnels. You can pay to swim with live
dolphins in a 2 million-gallon lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   The property was unloaded by a Japanese bank in 1993 for $55
million.
</P>
<P>
   Then there has been bad luck. Hurricane Iniki leveled the island
of Kauai in 1992, causing nearly $2 billion-worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the state as a whole, eight sugar-cane plantations have
closed in the past decade, in part because Asia can grow the crop
more cheaply, but also because Americans are using more
high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiians sometimes feel they cannot win. ``We don't control
the forces on the outside. We're just a little dot on the
Pacific,'' says Hawaii's governor, Ben Cayetano.
</P>
<P>
   True, but this is an expensive, highly-taxed, highly-regulated
little dot on the Pacific, and Hawaii cannot blame all its troubles
on Asia; it is also a lousy place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the cost of living roughly a third higher than the
American urban average, but government is far more centralized than
in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii, for example, is the only state with one unified school
district operated at the state level. (Not surprisingly, the
schools get poor marks.)
</P>
<P>
   Only Michigan and New York have a higher proportion of unionized
workers. The public-sector unions are particularly powerful. The
result is that Hawaii is 20 years behind other cities and states in
wringing productivity gains out of its public workers.
</P>
<P>
   Each new public employee can count on 21 days of paid holiday,
14 public holidays on which he gets paid, and 21 days of paid sick
leave. Should that prove too stressful, he must be caught drinking
on the job four times in a two-year period before being asked to
resign; he is not sacked.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the collective-bargaining agreement gives the
public-workers' union virtual veto power over any government
decision that changes ``conditions of work,'' even if no union jobs
are lost.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that public managers can spend years trying to
accomplish something as trivial as changing the route of a garbage
truck.
</P>
<P>
   And things have got worse. Last year, the Hawaii Supreme Court
essentially ruled privatization unconstitutional by finding that
the state's Civil-Service Act forbids moving to the private sector
any jobs that have ``traditionally and historically'' been
performed by public workers.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's powerful environmental groups are skeptical, if not
hostile, to growth and development. On its face, that is a good
thing. Hawaii has some of the most spectacular scenery in the
world, and tourists fly thousands of miles to see its white sand
beaches and stunning volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   These need to be protected. Yet the people most fiercely opposed
to development often earned their money on the mainland before
retiring to Hawaii; they are not unemployed farm workers, who might
benefit from a few more carefully managed projects.
</P>
<P>
   Take the contentious issue of the airport on Maui. At present,
the airport does not have a runway long enough to take large jets
from Asia. A longer runway would bring more tourists, and would
also help business.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gifford, the president of the Maui Land &AMP; Pineapple
Company, points out that the short runway makes it more difficult
to get fresh pineapples to market.
</P>
<P>
   On the west coast of the island of Hawaii, a new international

Stewart closes fast to snare Open lead
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ It's impossible to call The Olympic Club tame,
under any circumstances. But the golfers playing in the 1998 U.S.
Open Championship who didn't take advantage of what the course had
to offer Thursday might have missed their best opportunity for
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions for the first round of the Open were about as good as
they are going to get.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some tough pin placements, the greens remained
receptive, and those golfers in the fairway could get a little
aggressive with their second shots. The result was nine under-par
rounds on a course that some predicted might not give up a handful
of low scores all week.
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart showed how much damage could be done early, making
birdies on the last three holes to take the first-round lead at
4-under-par 66. Stewart finished before many in the field had even
teed off, but his score held up. Mark Carnevale ended up second at
67, while Joe Durant, Tom Lehman, Jose Maria Olazabal and Bob Tway
were tied at 68.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodlands' Jeff Maggert finished at 69, along with John Daly
and Jesper Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest cheers were for a golfer who finished at
4-over-par 74. Casey Martin, who has been the center of attention
all week for using a golf cart, was clearly the crowd favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost overwhelming the support I got,'' said Martin,
who finished in near darkness Thursday and made bogeys on the last
two holes. ``I was almost crying on the first tee when they gave me
that ovation. It meant a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he had trouble seeing on his final two holes, which
might have contributed to his bogey-bogey finish. But for the
remainder of the field, patience was the most important quality,
and Stewart had the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that you have got to play from the fairway, and you
have got to be very patient,'' Stewart said. ``I never really drove
it off-line huge where I had to chip out, except for 18. And I took
advantage of some breaks out there today. When you get them, you
have to take advantage of them. Especially in a United States Open
because you don't get that many.''
</P>
<P>
   There were certainly players who could relate to that.
Pre-tournament favorite David Duval ended up at 5-over-par 75,
while Davis Love III closed at 78 and defending champion Ernie Els
was at 75. Tiger Woods started off well, getting to 2-under but
then struggled down the stretch and found himself 4-over for the
opening round.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who kept their cool during the rough moments _ and
nearly everyone had at least one _ there were birdies to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Durant, who is making his first Open appearance, was the only
player to really challenge Stewart's hold on the top spot all day.
Durant, a former Nike Tour player who is in his second year on the
PGA Tour, came out hot, making the turn at 31 and then taking lone
possession of the lead at 5-under when he made a spectacular pitch
to within one foot on No. 12 and sank the birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   But Durant stumbled on No. 14, leaving his chip shot short of
the green and three-putting from the fringe for double bogey. He
got one stroke back with a birdie on No. 15 but added bogeys on
Nos. 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Durant played in the same threesome as Carnevale, who was
equally pleased with his effort at Olympic Club. This is only
Carnevale's second Open, and he hasn't had a great year on the PGA
Tour to date. In 15 events, he has missed the cut 10 times. But he
certainly found his game in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fantastic out there,'' said Carnevale, the only player
without a bogey. ``It was just a lot of fun out there today. You
work so hard to get to this point. This is what you have struggled
all your life to get to. And you finally realize, `Hey, here I
am.'''
</P>
<P>
   But as the veterans in the field can attest, getting there and
staying there are two different things. Stewart won his first U.S.
Open in 1991 and then didn't win again on tour until the 1995 Shell
Houston Open. And he hasn't won since. Still, Stewart has played
some good golf this year and said he felt his game was U.S.
Open-ready coming into this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game has been pretty good,'' he said. ``I am hitting the
ball the way I want to hit the ball. And it feels good to have it
in that kind of shape coming into the U.S. Open Championship
because you know what to expect before you ever get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the rough is going to be penal, and you can't spend
much time in it and do well. The greens are going to be hard and
fast. But you also know coming here that par is going to be a great
score.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, 4 under par is even better. Stewart ended his first
round with a flourish. After making eight consecutive pars, Stewart
cut lose with a 9-iron for his third shot on the par-5 16th hole,
hitting it to within eight inches and birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Then came his most heroic effort of the day. The 17th hole is a
monster hole, measuring out at 468 yards for a par-4. Any golfer in
the field would gladly take par there and leave. But Stewart let
his 2-iron run up 15 feet onto the green, and then he drained a
45-foot putt for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it was an eagle,'' Stewart said with a grin. ``But
on the score card, birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart appeared headed for trouble on No. 18, when he sent his
2-iron into the right rough and then left his 8-iron 12 feet from
the pin. But he sank the putt for his third birdie and couldn't
have been happier.

   JASPER, TEXAS _ At dusk on Friday night, at the end of a
difficult week in the east Texas town of Jasper, 80 or so boys were
playing basketball in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Two games were in progress, one at each net. Boys rose up,
caught air, dunked baskets. Cars were drawn up close to the court,
doors open, pumping out a heavy urban beat into the sultry air.
Every player was black, all the attendant girlfriends were black,
all the hangers-on were black. There was not a white in sight,
apart from this correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Did white kids come down and play sometimes? ``Who you kidding!
They wouldn't be seen with us.'' So it was just black kids all the
time? Several players nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, fool,'' said another player, striding over and slapping
his bare chest, ``What you think, that everything's all right 'cos
the old folk says so? Ain't all right man, we apart, we always been
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene, and the conversation, would not be unusual in
inner-city America. In a town of 8,000 people, it gives pause for
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper is a quiet, pretty place, with forests and lakes that
look more like Finland than Texas. Down one country road you pass a
creek, a meadow dappled in sunshine, then you go on into dense
emerald forest.
</P>
<P>
   This spot is where the last sinews on James Byrd's neck tore
loose and his head _ the face already shredded on the tarmac _
bounced off into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   The murder by three white men of Byrd, a happy-go-lucky black
man known in Jasper for singing songs and hitching rides, has
reminded Jasper _ and the rest of America _ that relations between
the races are as vexed as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rest of Texas, which breaks down along Anglo-Latino
lines, east Texas is almost wholly black-and-white. This is
particularly true of Jasper, which is 55 percent white and 42
percent black.
</P>
<P>
   The knee-jerk reaction of the national media, as the story
broke, was to present east Texas as a white-trash outpost whose
public offices are occupied by closet bigots. In fact, as the
journalists soon discovered, Jasper has a black mayor and a black
school principal.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Black Panthers, who sallied into town for a shameless
publicity session, praised the white sheriff, Billy Rowles, for his
efficient handling of the case. Byrd's family offered unconditional
forgiveness to his white killers.
</P>
<P>
   Many times in the week, militant blacks _ in town from distant
parts to preach their particular form of racial separatism _ were
shouted down not by whites but by blacks, who said they abhorred
violence and vengeance. On the surface, outrage and sorrow brought
Jasper together.
</P>
<P>
   The townsfolk were adamant that this awful crime did not
represent them. This was true. What represents the town, and makes
it so typical, is something much more subtle: a thousand small
prejudices and slights that blacks in east Texas feel, but whites
rarely notice.
</P>
<P>
   It bothers blacks in Jasper that the bank-tellers are almost all
white, and that they rarely see a black waitress in the more
expensive local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A group of black maids at a local hotel (speaking anonymously
for fear of managerial retribution) were particularly candid. They
felt humiliated, they said, when security people followed them
around the aisles in the Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   They wondered why no blacks were ``good enough'' to work as
hotel receptionists. None of them thought blacks had a fair deal in
the town. ``Those signs may have gone,'' said one of the maids,
visibly surprised at her own outspokenness, ``but to me they're
still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger blacks were particularly unhappy with Jasper's black
leaders, who, they said, were too deferential to whites. It had
taken the death of Byrd, they claimed, to wake up the local chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP).
</P>
<P>
   The black view often seemed to be that race relations were fine,
so long as blacks stayed in their place and did not get ``uppity.''
This meant, of course, that they were not as fine as all that.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Byrd's funeral showed the unstated segregation. Of
the 1,000 or so people who attended the service, fewer than 50 were
white.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was laid out in a black funeral home, eulogized in a black
church, and buried in the back part of the town cemetery, where
blacks have always been buried, out of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they tell you,'' one of the hotel maids had said
unhappily, ``they was going to bury him in the back?''
</P>
<P>
   White supremacy may be marginalized, but it is still menacing.
The sheriff's claim that there are no Ku Klux Klansmen in Jasper
appears to be false. A local Klan leader insists that his group has
a strong presence there.
</P>
<P>
   And already the town is bracing itself for a Klan march on June
27, with its potential for a bloody showdown between white bigots
and Black Panther hotheads.
</P>
<P>
   The murder has also shed light on the fact that state prisons in
Texas and across the South have become purveyors of white
supremacy, recruiting susceptible men into violent gangs such as
the Aryan Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Byrd's alleged killers had been monitored for involvement
in a white supremacist group while in prison. Kerry Noble, a former
white supremacist whose recent book, ``Tabernacle of Hate,'' opens
the lid on the movement, told The Economist that the killing might
have been to ``earn points'' for acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Jasper? This is a community of mutual respect, but
it is still distinctly divided at all the levels that matter in
ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   What the boys on the basketball court cared about was not
whether white kids came and played ball with them. They cared about
good jobs, fair treatment _ and about the fact that Dennis Rodman,
the bad-boy star of the Chicago Bulls, had elected to pay for
Byrd's funeral. It sounded awfully like separate but equal. &QL;

<P>
   JERICHO _ Whether or not the Israelis do what they are supposed
to do under the Oslo agreements, they continue to prepare for a
final settlement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of this is the quiet encouragement of Palestinian
migration from the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Netanyahu and his government see the Jordan River as
Israel's permanent eastern border. A map which the prime minister
says will ``guide'' the negotiations on a final settlement would
reportedly annex to Israel a 20-kilometer (12-mile) swathe of land
along the river, excluding Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   Some 35,000 Palestinians live or work on the West Bank side of
the Jordan Valley. Covering an area of 700,000 dunums (175,000
hectares), the valley is one of the West Bank's most fertile
regions, containing 60 percent of the Palestinians' horticultural
land.
</P>
<P>
   With both water and a hot climate, it is ``a natural
greenhouse,'' says the Palestinian Authority's farm minister, Abdel
Jawad Salah. The locals see it as the agricultural basin of any
future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1967 and 1993, Israel confiscated 100,000 dunums of the
Jordan Valley as ``closed security zones,'' making the land
off-limits to Palestinian farmers.
</P>
<P>
   It also set up some 20 Jewish settlements (with fewer than 3,000
settlers) on prime farming land.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians were left with about 95,000 dunums of
cultivated and irrigated land and a host of ``security''
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing of the Oslo peace agreement in 1993, the
Palestinians hoped they might be able to add to the developed area.
But the restrictions and confiscations continue.
</P>
<P>
   Jawad Salah cites the case of an agricultural research station
in the valley, which helped farmers with crop research and
technology; Israel has refused to transfer the station to the
Palestinian Authority by declaring its 300 dunums to be one of
those closed security zones.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have also, in the past three years, made security
zones of many of the hills in the Jordan Valley. These hills are
traditionally used as grazing pastures by Bedouin shepherds, who
are now being forced to abandon some of their goats and sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Jawad Salah estimates that the shepherds may have lost 50,000
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Israeli army appears to be turning the temporary
territorial divisions that exist in the West Bank under the Oslo
agreement into permanent facts.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 of the Palestinians who work on the farms in the
valley are seasonal laborers who live in villages near Nablus.
These are in Area B under Oslo's classification, meaning that they
come under Palestinian civilian jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jordan Valley, Jericho apart, is in Area C, under
Israel's exclusive military control. To get from B to C
Palestinians now require a permit from the army, ``exactly as if we
wanted to travel to Tel Aviv,'' says Muhammad Omar Jahalin, the
mayor of Jiflik, a Bedouin village in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   The permits are granted on a daily basis _ but the laborers work
on the farms for the whole winter.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of these measures is the steady migration of
Palestinians westwards from the valley to urban areas such as East
Jerusalem and Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   For Jahalin, the aim is clear: ``Israel wants to empty the
Jordan Valley of its Palestinian inhabitants.''
</P>
<P>
   To resist such a future, the Palestinian Authority has earmarked
the valley as a ``priority'' area and is working with international
agencies to resuscitate farming. But real development will come
only with Palestinian sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, admits
Jawad Salah.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this eventuality that Netanyahu is preparing
against. &QL;

   Benjamin Netanyahu and his government see the Jordan River as
Israel's permanent eastern border. A map which the prime minister
says will ``guide'' the negotiations on a final settlement would
reportedly annex to Israel a 20-kilometer (12-mile) swathe of land
along the river, excluding Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   Some 35,000 Palestinians live or work on the West Bank side of
the Jordan Valley. Covering an area of 700,000 dunums (175,000
hectares), the valley is one of the West Bank's most fertile
regions, containing 60 percent of the Palestinians' horticultural
land.
</P>
<P>
   With both water and a hot climate, it is ``a natural
greenhouse,'' says the Palestinian Authority's farm minister, Abdel
Jawad Salah. The locals see it as the agricultural basin of any
future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1967 and 1993, Israel confiscated 100,000 dunums of the
Jordan Valley as ``closed security zones,'' making the land
off-limits to Palestinian farmers.
</P>
<P>
   It also set up some 20 Jewish settlements (with fewer than 3,000
settlers) on prime farming land.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians were left with about 95,000 dunums of
cultivated and irrigated land and a host of ``security''
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing of the Oslo peace agreement in 1993, the
Palestinians hoped they might be able to add to the developed area.
But the restrictions and confiscations continue.
</P>
<P>
   Jawad Salah cites the case of an agricultural research station
in the valley, which helped farmers with crop research and
technology; Israel has refused to transfer the station to the
Palestinian Authority by declaring its 300 dunums to be one of
those closed security zones.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have also, in the past three years, made security
zones of many of the hills in the Jordan Valley. These hills are
traditionally used as grazing pastures by Bedouin shepherds, who
are now being forced to abandon some of their goats and sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Jawad Salah estimates that the shepherds may have lost 50,000
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Israeli army appears to be turning the temporary
territorial divisions that exist in the West Bank under the Oslo
agreement into permanent facts.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 of the Palestinians who work on the farms in the
valley are seasonal laborers who live in villages near Nablus.
These are in Area B under Oslo's classification, meaning that they
come under Palestinian civilian jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jordan Valley, Jericho apart, is in Area C, under
Israel's exclusive military control. To get from B to C
Palestinians now require a permit from the army, ``exactly as if we
wanted to travel to Tel Aviv,'' says Muhammad Omar Jahalin, the
mayor of Jiflik, a Bedouin village in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   The permits are granted on a daily basis _ but the laborers work
on the farms for the whole winter.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of these measures is the steady migration of
Palestinians westwards from the valley to urban areas such as East
Jerusalem and Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   For Jahalin, the aim is clear: ``Israel wants to empty the
Jordan Valley of its Palestinian inhabitants.''
</P>
<P>
   To resist such a future, the Palestinian Authority has earmarked
the valley as a ``priority'' area and is working with international
agencies to resuscitate farming. But real development will come
only with Palestinian sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, admits
Jawad Salah.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this eventuality that Netanyahu is preparing
against. &QL;

   JERICHO _ Whether or not the Israelis do what they are supposed

McGwire's feats demand attention
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ Unfortunately, Mark McGwire doesn't care for the
attention. He'd prefer to hit his home runs surrounded by peace and
quiet. He'd swap the batter's box for a vacuum chamber any day.
</P>
<P>
   Not an option, though, is it? The world is fast becoming his
fish bowl. The press corps' full-court press is only now starting,
and as the McDinger count mounts, which seems as inevitable as a
new record for times being intentionally walked, the questions will
increase at the same pace. And they'll probably get even dumber
than he already thinks they are.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one solution, Mack.
</P>
<P>
   Singles, man. Hit singles.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you don't want people asking you about your
batting-practice feats, stop showing off in batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Each night this week, McGwire's pre-game blasts have traveled
farther and farther. One among many Thursday landed three rows
beneath the upper-deck scoreboard in the Astrodome. Impressive
stuff that, the kind of stuff you're going to tell your
grandchildren about someday.
</P>
<P>
   But more impressive was what he did for real. His 33rd home run
in his 63rd game, coming in the fifth inning at the expense of an
already beaten-down Shane Reynolds, traveled almost that far _ 449
feet, according to the boys in the computer room. It also lowered
his 1998 ratio of homers to at-bats to one of the former for every
6.6 of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   How good is that? His career ratio is already the best ever,
1-to-11.54, ahead of Babe Ruth's 1-to-11.76. Were he to continue at
such a preposterous pace, which would be flat-out impossible except
for the fact that he already has kept it going deep into June,
he'll hit 80 home runs by the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And then nobody will talk much about Ruth or Maris or asterisks
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   What McGwire himself will talk about in the interim remains to
be seen, but it's likely to have a surly, argumentative tone. If
he's feeling good as he goes about trying to destroy sport's most
famous record, he's not showing it during his post-game rap
sessions with his friends in the media.
</P>
<P>
   He claims to see no reason for the fuss, that it's way too early
to get breathless, never mind that he already has set the
major-league record for the most homers by the end of June, with 11
June dates left for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   I've been assured he will be a delight come September, when the
Ruth/Maris numbers are squarely in his cross hairs and he feels a
more pressing need to reflect on his place in the cosmos. Still,
you wonder why he can't relax, smile a bit and at least let himself
appear to be having fun.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of us _ except those who scribble ``pitcher'' on
their rsums.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is an equal-opportunity mauler. He unapologetically
roughs up everybody. Ray Lankford, leading off the fifth, had just
knocked a Reynolds pitch into the cheap seats. No matter. When
McGwire came up, he didn't give squat about Shane's hurt feelings.
He just parked another into some even cheaper seats with a flick of
his thick wrists. It was his second in two nights after a rare
three-game hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   The ball almost reached the sixth row of the upper deck, a level
where only 10 others have flown in regulation play. Manager Larry
Dierker, who has seen them all, said it had to have been the
longest of the bunch because ``the others were closer to the foul
poles.''
</P>
<P>
   The monster mash gave the Cardinals just enough of a margin to
win the series. So, in the 7-6 squeaker, McGwire's shot would be
the difference. He had to speak afterward. He makes his own rules.
If he figures in the outcome, and only if, then he will suffer
fools, albeit not gladly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team sport,'' he protested. ``Sometimes it does get
embarrassing. Why don't you go talk to (Ron) Gant, or (Rick)
Croushore? I wish you could acknowledge what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the tape-measure aspect of the rip, he said: ``You
don't get a prize for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, for his part, was rendered speechless after what could
only be described as a shaky outing. Hey, how would you feel if
somebody had gone that deep off you?
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Vern Ruhle visited the mound prior to the
now-famous at-bat, but he didn't mention the ``Mc'' word to
Reynolds. He said he was merely trying to remind Shane about his
rhythm. Dierker, however, was more candid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just buying time for the bullpen,'' the skipper said.
``No matter what had happened there, Shane wasn't going to be out
there much longer. I felt bad for him. With that big crowd, he
really wanted to pitch a good game. But it wasn't meant to be.
Today was definitely not Shane's day.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, they're almost all McGwire's days, whether he likes
them or not.

Lehman recovers after double bogey
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ When Tom Lehman walked off the 10th green Thursday
at The Olympic Club, it looked like his three-year run of
contending at the U.S. Open was in danger of coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman had just three-putted from four feet for a double-bogey
6, putting himself at 2-over for the day. But Lehman said that more
than anything, the hole strengthened his resolve to play better on
the remaining eight holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, being 2 over par at that point makes me feel like I
better not mess up anymore from here on in,'' Lehman said. ``I was
in a tough situation. But making a birdie on the 11th hole and then
a really good save on 12, which was like making a birdie, helped a
lot more. So from that point forward, I played really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman ended up making birdies on three of the final four holes
and finished only two strokes off the lead at 2-under-par 68. That,
of course, sets him up nicely for another run at yet another Open
title. In the last three years, Lehman has finished third, tied for
second, and third at the U.S. Open. But Lehman insisted Thursday
that this is a tougher course for him than the last three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last four years in the Opens where I have played
well, I think this may be the most difficult course for me in terms
of it not quite setting up as well as the other ones did,'' Lehman
said. ``For me, it is quite difficult. I am not saying that I can't
play well, obviously. But it means that it requires my best golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman showed on the back side of the first round just how good
his best can be. He sank a 15-footer for birdie on No. 11 and then
drained a long 30-foot birdie putt on No. 15. Lehman added a
12-footer on No. 16 and closed with a six-foot birdie on No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   But Lehman said that perhaps his best effort was his par save on
No. 12, where he hit way right off the tee, had to pitch back out
into the fairway and then hit a sand wedge to within 10 feet and
made the putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the kinds of things in the U.S. Open that I think
you have to do once in a while because you aren't always going to
drive it in the fairway,'' Lehman said. ``No matter who you are,
you need every so often to get up and down for par. That was one of
those situations like making a birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped ease the pain of the double bogey on No. 10, when
Lehman hit his 7-iron second shot just left of the green, made a
great chip to four feet and then three-putted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a huge spike mark that was right in my line
on the first putt,'' Lehman said. ``It hit the spike mark and
bounced off line. There's not much you can do about that. Missing
the second putt, that was just a bad putt. The 10th hole wasn't my
best effort, but I managed to survive and shot a good score.''
</P>
<P>
   And set himself up for yet another chance to win the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman said coming into the tournament that he thought he should
have a good week. He finished third at last week's Buick Classic,
closing with a spectacular 65. So after his early troubles
Thursday, Lehman was more than pleased with the way his day ended
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody will tell you that you can't win the
tournament in the first round, but you can certainly lose it,''
Lehman said. ``So as long as you don't lose it in the first round,
you need to be happy.''

RAINBOW FAMILY PREPARES FOR FESTIVAL IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBBIE SHERWOOD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beneath a swaying Ponderosa pine, Adam Blunt stirs a large
kettle of beef stew with the same stick that just stoked his fire
and explains why he threw away a six-figure career to feed hippies.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt will be serving food and coffee 24 hours a day for the
next two weeks as more than 20,000 members of the Rainbow Family
stream into his campsite in the forest west of Springerville.
</P>
<P>
   His hair matted and his skin darkened by sun and dirt, Blunt
said money can't buy the feeling he has at that moment watching his
pot reach a boil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty rich once,'' said Blunt, who owned repossession
and landscaping businesses in Maryland. ``I gave it all up for
this. I've been broke for three years, but can you see the
satisfaction? This pot of soup will feed 50 or 60 people.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation is interrupted by shouts of ``six up!'' _
Rainbow slang for the number of lights atop a police vehicle.
Marijuana pipes quickly disappear as a green U.S. Forest Service
truck cruises through the camp. The Forest Service is the
ever-present downer at the family's annual Gathering for World
Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Because Rainbow gatherings typically take place on public land
and attract tens of thousands of people, the Forest Service has
created a seven-member task force that follows the Rainbows,
briefing communities on what to expect from the influx, and trying,
usually in vain, to get the family to sign a use permit.
</P>
<P>
   The task force is in Springerville because on Sunday, the
Rainbows officially chose the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest for
their annual Fourth of July Gathering For World Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Task force members found out about the site the same way many
Rainbows did, by checking the group's Internet site. Locals got a
clue when busloads of people started showing up in town. If the
gathering's projected size is accurate, Rainbows could soon
outnumber area residents by a 4-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   The party promises to be much larger than when Rainbows last
gathered near Springerville in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbows say they're benign, peace-loving hippies and blame
the problems that follow them on troubled hangers-on they call
``drainbows.''
</P>
<P>
   But after witnessing four gatherings, task force spokeswoman
Rose Davis said the differences are irrelevant to overwhelmed
locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a core group that still maintains the spiritual
values of the gathering,'' she said. ``But there are others who
just come up to party, and that's who we have trouble with. We have
seen a lot of runaways hiding out, felons and people who just don't
have any other place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the size of the gatherings are detrimental to the
forest, and the Rainbows' refusal to sign use permits is not fair
to others who comply. So far, the rancher who owns the water rights
to Carnero Lake and a few surrounding springs has refused to grant
the Rainbows permission to drink and bathe. The Forest Service is
negotiating for a peaceful solution, so far unsuccessfully.
</P>
<P>
   The ecologically conscious Rainbows hotly dispute claims that
they damage the forest. They say the forests belong to everyone,
and they plan to leave behind about 60 members to break down camps
and reseed the trampled meadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be able to find even a cigarette butt or a bottle
cap when we leave,'' said Little Hawk, a 27-year Rainbow veteran.
``We'll leave this place better than when we found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis admitted that the Rainbows do a good job at picking up
after themselves but said the sheer size of the event means the
area will be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site gets hammered,'' she said. ``There will be severe
soil compaction, and they will have to dig slit latrines for 20,000
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the camp, there is at least one dog for every three people.
Last year in Oregon, the Rainbows left behind at least 100 dogs.
Those that were caught had to be destroyed because of a parvo
outbreak, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some really unique spiritualism and organization to
these things, and some really nasty crime and evil to it, too,''
she said. ``It's a real contradiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the forest, is what happens to the small communities
they typically invade. The twin towns of Springerville and Eagar
are home to only about 5,000 combined, and Apache is the most
economically depressed county in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Many Rainbows have money and are spending it in stores, but too
many are relying on a rapidly disappearing charity system. The
Rainbows have been arriving for less than a week and already the
welcome mats have been pulled in.
</P>
<P>
   Police have written dozens of citations for panhandling,
shoplifting and vagrancy, and most businesses have closed their
public restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   An incident Sunday also has led businesses to lock their
dumpsters. A small party of Rainbow women went into a convenience
store and bathed in the bathroom, which is in the pantry. While
there they also urinated on several cases of beer and food, police
said. The goods had to be thrown out, and when they were, the
Rainbows were waiting, according to Eagar police.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the many tactics Rainbows have used at past
gatherings to get stores to throw away food, Davis said. Another is
poking holes in the plastic wrap on meat. The Forest Service task
force has urged stores to lock trash bins so there is no reward for
this type of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Two Rainbows were hospitalized Monday after a car accident, and
there has been a growing stream of visitors in the local hospital
emergency room for cuts, broken bones and other care.
</P>
<P>
   The small hospital in Pineville, Ore., where the Rainbows
gathered last year, is still owed $32,000 in medical bills. Dave
Ross, CEO for the White Mountain Communities Hospital, expects to
face the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   With Rainbows arriving from practically every state, and few
carrying insurance, it will be up to the county's indigent
health-care fund to shoulder the burden when they get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a small city, so we expect all kinds of things, even
babies being born,'' Ross said. ``But this county is not in great
financial shape. We have an ongoing difficulty in collecting money
from the county for indigent patients as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital plans to set up a first-aid station near the
gathering to care for minor injuries, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A large meadow near Carnero Lake will serve as the main
gathering site. On July 4, the group will remain silent until noon,
than gather in a massive circle to pray for world peace.
</P>
<P>
   But now, most of the 500 to 600 early arrivals are concentrated
about a mile from the meadow in a ramshackle parking lot that
resembles a graveyard for buses. The Rainbows, whose bond is
non-violence and an aversion to commercial and government
bureaucracy, have been gathering since 1972. Inside a gathering,
eccentricity is commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Many have also appropriated spiritual and cultural beliefs from
Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Little Hawk sports a ``Rainbow Warrior'' tattoo and spouts Hopi
and Sioux parables. A 19-year-old woman who calls herself A Little
Green Tree has just embarked on a 10-year ``vision quest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be native to have those types of beliefs any
more,'' Tree said. &QL;

PAYTON HOLDS KEY TO SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Gary Payton had done it again. No surprise. It was
expected under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed the Los Angeles Lakers at halftime in Game 4
of the Western Conference semifinals. Even more frustrating, they
were getting walloped in the series on their way to playoff
elimination.
</P>
<P>
   So Payton exploded _ in the locker room and in the face of
former coach George Karl, who barked back. The scene reflected the
type of confrontations (usually over game-plan disagreements) that
Karl and Payton engaged in several times last season, seemingly
many times during their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics went on to lose that game 112-100. Payton followed
the tirade with an explosion on the court _ 31 points, 13 assists
and eight rebounds in 41 minutes _ yet his monster game did not
translate into a victory. One loss later, Karl was finished as
Sonics coach.
</P>
<P>
   Point of the story?
</P>
<P>
   If Paul Westphal did not know already, he has a clue now.
Westphal, who was named the Sonics' new coach Wednesday, must get
more out of Payton _ in subtle ways _ than his predecessor did.
</P>
<P>
   Karl struggled with his point guard from start to finish.
Veteran Sonic players complained privately that Karl established
rules _ such as players must practice to play _ then let Payton
bend them with impunity. They also complained that Payton sometimes
strayed from Karl's game plans or would sometimes distance himself
from his teammates in critical moments of games when his leadership
was needed.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sonics were dropped from the postseason, Karl met with
president Wally Walker to discuss the team's future. One of Karl's
suggestions was that the Sonics should be open to the possibility
of trading Payton for several players if the team experienced more
second-round jolts. It was the second time in four years that Karl
made such a plea.
</P>
<P>
   Walker told Karl then what he told the Post-Intelligencer
recently: ``I'm still a Gary Payton fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Ackerley loves Payton. The team owner invested seven years
and $87 million into the All-Star point guard. Seattle fans idolize
Payton, and the NBA markets his ability.
</P>
<P>
   Karl admired Payton's skills. To most observers, Payton is the
best point guard in the game. Karl also knows that Payton turned
him into a $3.5 million coach. Karl helped Payton become a $12
million player.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship, while respectful, was airtight only for
public consumption. Karl continuously insisted on more from Payton.
He wanted a type of leadership Payton isn't ready to give. In
Payton's view, playing hard and producing every night is enough;
Karl also wanted a second coming of Nate McMillan, a vocal leader
in the locker room as well as on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, though, is a superstar. And with superstars come
baggage. Now, it is Westphal's turn to carry the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line in the NBA is what happens out there when the
game begins. Are you playing hard? Are you playing for the team?
Are you giving everything you have?'' Westphal said. ``There are a
lot of personality quirks that everybody has. Me included. And
after having coached Charles Barkley (in Phoenix) I don't think
there's anything that I'll see that I haven't already seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal knows the makeup of his best player. Payton often does
not practice. He is volatile and emotional. Payton is so
competitive that when he doesn't win, he transforms into someone
whose raging persona rivals the Incredible Hulk. Karl never got a
grip on that part of Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Westphal will. He is cut from the same cloth. Although
Westphal is considered laid-back now, he was a terror growing up.
Westphal told a childhood story about getting kicked out of a
sixth-grade game. He thought the officiating was terrible and
committed a flagrant foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only correct call (the referee) made all game,''
Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the game, Westphal remembers the official's advice:
Get emotions under control, or flame out. Westphal had grown up a
``monster on the court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So his meeting with Payton in Oakland earlier this week wasn't
about changing the eight-year Sonic. Westphal merely opened the
lines of communication as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are very fortunate if you have a superstar who is willing
to be coached,'' Westphal said. ``If your superstar is not willing
to admit he's wrong sometimes, or admit that the coach has to have
the final say on things, then you're doomed. I don't care who you
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of it comes down to the integrity of the player to
agree to have a coach tell him what the final say is. There have
been instances exhibited in the NBA recently where a player can get
a coach fired. Hopefully, the player can be reasonable, and I think
that's the case here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being short-tempered, Payton is gentle, respectful and
open-minded. All superstars must exercise those qualities at some
level.
</P>
<P>
   For as little as Chicago's Phil Jackson is given credit for the
Bulls' success, the glory is his. Sure, Michael Jordan makes all
the game-winning baskets, but he is canning them Jackson's way.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan hated the triangle offense when Jackson was named coach.
He still believes ``it is not a professional offense.'' However, it
wasn't until Jordan accepted Jackson's idea of leading that the
Bulls thrived. Remember that Jordan was in the league seven years
before Chicago won its first title.
</P>
<P>
   Payton will give Westphal a chance. He wants to reach the next
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody can't be the perfect person in practice, slapping
the floor and being rah-rah,'' said Eric Goodwin, who manages
Payton with Aaron Goodwin, his brother. ``Most of the big stars in
the game have their own quirks. These guys are being tugged in
millions of ways. There has to be an outlet. Sometimes he (Payton)
doesn't want to practice. But that's not what leadership is about.
Leadership is finding ways to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton's reluctance about practice is due in part to his
chronically sore back, for which he gets regular treatment. It's
not in the club's best interest that he risks aggravating the
problem in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, though, has missed just two regular-season games his
entire career. He is regarded as the Sonics' toughest player. Think
Westphal will ride him about practice?
</P>
<P>
   Westphal won an NBA championship alongside John Havlicek on the
1973-74 Boston Celtics. Havlicek almost never practiced, Westphal
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd come (in the gym), sit and watch practice, but played 48
minutes every game. Nobody played harder than him, and he never
touched a ball in the summer,'' said Westphal, who continued his
point by describing how Celtic legend Larry Bird came to practice
early and left late. ``Everybody says be like Larry Bird. Nobody
says be like John Havlicek _ never practice, never touch a ball (in
the summer).
</P>
<P>
   ``... A coach has to be flexible and understand the need of his
players, that players are not all the same. And that the players
have to understand that you are treating them fairly but not
equally. Then you have no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a theory Payton already believes in. Westphal's problem
will be getting the 11 other Sonics to buy into it.

STEWART LEADS U.S. OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One trip around The Olympic Club was supposed to
bring great pain and suffering. We got Payne Stewart and sinister
laughter instead.
</P>
<P>
   The guy in the funny clothes Thursday mocked the torture chamber
known as the 98th U.S. Open, sidestepping the unforgiving rough and
striding jauntily through the eucalyptus and cyprus trees. He
didn't stop until climbing atop the first-round leaderboard with a
four-under-par 66.
</P>
<P>
   That was good for a one-shot edge over Mark Carnevale. That was
reason enough for the USGA to consider testing only his equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 41 and in decline since winning a pair of majors, made
it look easy when things were meant to be flat-out miserable.
Player after player had declared Olympic's four-foot rough as
unfair as any ever encountered on the tour. Par golf was predicted.
</P>
<P>
   With a shrug and a 2-iron, the carefree Stewart barely flinched
on a cool, overcast day in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave myself a lot of chances and I was very patient,'' he
said. ``That is what you have to be at a United States Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also was uncommonly good as he finished. He birdied the
last three holes on the course, something done only once before _
by Denis Watson at Olympic's 1987 U.S. Open. He birdied the par-4,
468-yard 17th _ a feat matched by only three others, Carnevale,
Jason Allen and Chris Tidland. He was one of nine players among the
156 to break par, and his 66 was the lowest first-round score in
four Olympic Opens.
</P>
<P>
   And he seemed to greatly enjoy himself and his new-found
success. Meeting with reporters, Stewart feigned mock horror when
USGA official Les Unger pointed out that it had been a couple years
since he had been in the U.S. Open press tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never invited me,'' Stewart said. ``I would have come.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Unger: ``You have to do something to be invited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good shot; I deserved that,'' Stewart said
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly so. He had finished well out of the running in the
previous four U.S. Opens, with 21st his best effort. He had won
only once on the tour over the past seven years, since claiming the
1991 U.S. Open in a playoff with Scott Simpson (his other major
victory was the 1989 PGA Championship). In his most recent outing,
The Memorial, he had shot an 83, taking a 10 on one hole.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Stewart was a new man. He was dressed the same as
usual, wearing one of his trademark ensembles, a blue and plaid
look, complete with cap and knickers. But his game was sharper,
mixing pinpoint accuracy, great resilience and, admittedly, dumb
luck in piecing together a five-birdie, one-bogey effort.
</P>
<P>
   On the short but tricky 288-yard seventh, he nearly holed out,
leaving a wedge shot three inches from the cup. Tap-in birdie. On
the 609-yard 16th, he left an iron shot eight inches from the hole.
Another tap-in birdie.
</P>
<P>
   On the 17th, a converted par-5 and Olympic's toughest hole,
Stewart launched a 2-iron out of the rough and onto the green. He
rammed in a 45-foot putt for birdie and wiggled his body in
celebration. On the 347-yard 18th, he curled in a 12-footer for
birdie, again escaping the rough off the tee. Playing
conservatively, he used his driver just three times.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart would have been content with an even-par score. At
four-under, he was downright giddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really good, really good, really good,'' he said, almost
rhythmically. ``I enjoyed that.''
</P>
<P>
   His closest pursuer was another unlikely Open contender,
Carnevale, who shot a bogey-free 67. The stocky 38-year-old golfer
had struggled mightily this season, missing the cut in 10 of 15
events and finishing no higher than 41st at the Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
   But he hung with Stewart. Even when the inevitable happened _
when he realized how much uncharted territory he had covered. He
has one tour victory to his name, the 1992 Chattanooga Classic. Not
exactly a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work so hard to get to this point and, all of a sudden,
you realize that this is where all the attention of the golf world
is this week,'' he said. ``This is what you have struggled all your
life to get to. You finally realize: `Hey, I am here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, Joe Durant, Jose Maria Olazabal and Bob Tway were
two strokes back. Jeff Maggert, Jesper Parnevik and John Daly were
three off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, winner of the 1991 PGA Championship and 1995 British Open,
has forsaken his driver this week, a courageous move for a man
longer off the tee than anyone. He has turned to his 3-wood,
leaving him some 35 to 40 yards shorter than the norm and conceding
long drive stats and bonus money. He's not happy, but he's in
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, this sucks,'' he said. ``I mean, I hate it. I don't like
it. But it is challenging. Whenever I can't use a driver on 18
holes, it is not good for the fans. But it is the only way to play
this golf course and I believe the only way I have a chance of
playing really solid.''

WESTPHAL HOPES THIS SEATTLE STAY PANS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bad as it might get for Paul Westphal next season _
combine the NBA labor dispute with a significant team rebuild, as
well as Gary Payton's mercurial temperament, and prospects are not
pretty _ it won't compare to the tub o' goo he found the first time
he replaced a local Sonic hero.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal retains a souvenir from his unlamented Seattle season
of 1980-81, when he was traded from Phoenix for fellow All-Star
guard Dennis Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bedpan,'' he said. ``Everybody on the team got one as a
joke, because of all the injuries we had that year.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years after they won the NBA title, the Sonics fell to 34-48
and last in the Pacific Division _ the fastest, steepest fall for a
champion in NBA history. Along with leading scorer Gus Williams'
season-long contract holdout and forward Lonnie Shelton's broken
wrist after 14 games, Westphal's Sonic career lasted just 36 games
because of a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was a free agent after the season and left Seattle for
the New York Knicks, and since Johnson went on to stardom with the
Suns and Boston Celtics, including two championships, it can be
argued that Westphal was part of the worst trade in Seattle pro
sports history (remember, Brian Bosworth was a draft choice).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the Most Valuable Player in the 1979 Finals and a
superb defender. But his subsequent big contract and petulant
selfishness made him, according to his then-coach, Lenny Wilkens,
``a cancer that had to be cut out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's problems faded as he matured. Larry Bird
eventually called him ``the greatest guard I ever played with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson trade ushered in a decade of mediocrity that didn't
end until Karl arrived in 1992. Now, after six years averaging
nearly 60 regular-season wins, the Sonics are at a crossroads
similar to the one two decades earlier _ on the backside of
success, striving to stay elite.
</P>
<P>
   And Westphal again is the linchpin.
</P>
<P>
   But the travail of his first Sonic go-round provides a couple of
lessons useful this time: Things can slip away quickly, and one
can't assume that today's pain will be tomorrow's pain.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the disparity between the Sonics and Lakers in the
playoffs, and the disparities between L.A. and Utah, and Utah and
Chicago, it's clear that the 60-win benchmark in the
expansion-bloated NBA has been cheapened dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   By April, the aging Sonics had slid considerably. At least four
players in the rotation _ Jim McIlvaine, Nate McMillan, Sam Perkins
and Dale Ellis _ could no longer play the Sonic-style defense,
because of injury, age or inability. Should there have been an
injury to any one of the remaining regulars, the Sonics were doomed
to another first-round disaster.
</P>
<P>
   While the return of Gary Payton, Vin Baker, Detlef Schrempf and
Hersey Hawkins would seem to bode well, they each did enough things
poorly in the playoffs to suggest that the team Westphal inherits
is more vulnerable than it appears on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic president Wally Walker will need to do more than simply
sign up free agents to fill vacancies. Years of failure to develop
young talent under Karl means Walker has to be extremely aggressive
and/or lucky to avoid a 10- to 12-game dropoff.
</P>
<P>
   In his introductory press chat, Westphal hinted that a falloff
might be in store.
</P>
<P>
   Playing young players ``may mean you'll lose a few more
regular-season games,'' he said, ``but the coach owes it to the
franchise to develop that talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Karl would have said that? When Walker talks of Karl's
inability to be on the same page with the organization, it has to
do more with unshared goals such as developing young players than
it does with leaks to the press.
</P>
<P>
   As far as today's pain lingering into tomorrow: Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   A growing assumption is that Payton will be the same headache to
manage for Westphal that he was to Karl. While Payton, 30 by next
season, isn't likely to transform as Johnson did, his dealings with
Westphal might prove more positive.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal is a cooler, less emotional commander than Karl, whose
temper made for regular flashpoints with the equally dyspeptic
Payton. The relationship between Payton and Karl was frayed enough
to have become counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal made clear he will indulge a double standard with
Payton, as he did with Charles Barkley in Phoenix. If that
arrangement is understood and accepted by the team from the start,
rather than develop awkwardly over time, the tension drops
substantially.
</P>
<P>
   The x-factor in the Sonic future is the bitterness that will be
generated from the impending lockout of NBA players forecast for
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has already prompted a withdrawal of NBA stars,
including Payton and Baker, from the team that will represent the
U.S. at the World Championships in Athens in August.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't return, among the options USA Basketball is
considering is suing the individual players for breach of contract.
If that won't get Payton double ornery, nothing will.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to know where the lockout, as well as the other variables,
will leave the Sonics by November. But if it gets really bad,
Westphal still has his bedpan.

DODGERS BEAT ROCKIES

<P>
   DENVER _ Bill Russell went to bed at 5:30 Thursday morning, but
to say he slept would be a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   There was the delayed flight from San Diego on top of a losing
streak on top of injuries and the fact that everyone back in L.A.
seems to be yelling for his head.
</P>
<P>
   Coors Field did not seem like the place to get away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   But less than 24 hours after the most demoralizing loss of the
season, Russell's Dodgers were the happiest they had been in weeks
with a 5-0 victory over the Colorado Rockies in front of a crowd of
48,029.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mlicki recorded just the eighth shutout in the four-year
history of Coors Field and Eric Karros drove in all five runs,
including a three-run homer that nicked off the left-field foul
pole.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, this was Russell's night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows what he has been through,'' Karros said.
``It's something that is everywhere. We've all been through a lot,
but a game like this is the only way to put the focus back on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Dodgers (35-36) ended a four-game losing
streak and stayed within 11{ games of the National League
West-leading San Diego Padres, who rallied Thursday to win their
10th straight.
</P>
<P>
   But as the rap music blared in the post-game clubhouse, the
numbers didn't seem to matter. As Chan Ho Park danced from the
shower to his locker, Russell smiled. He didn't care that the
once-formidable Rockies are a pitiful 11-21 at home. He has enough
to think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling when you win,'' Russell said, ``you're
able to get some sleep, relax and have a little fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell got to relax a little after Karros' first-inning homer
off Jamey Wright (5-7) gave the Dodgers a 3-0 lead. In a season
weighed down by an ailing left knee, Karros had his second five-RBI
game. He has 19 RBI in his other 45 games.
</P>
<P>
   With Bobby Bonilla, Eric Young and Raul Mondesi all out with
injuries, Karros' effort was critical. But it was Mlicki's
performance that might have been even more important.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Ramon Martinez arrived in Denver after
receiving a third opinion on his injured right shoulder. Noted
orthopedist William Andrews saw what the others saw _ torn
cartilage and rotator cuff that likely will require season-ending
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   While Martinez considers his future, Mlicki has been the only
Dodgers starter to step up. In his last two starts, Mlicki,
acquired from the New York Mets in the Hideo Nomo deal, has allowed
one run in 17 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Rockies, he allowed just two runners to reach base
and got 15 ground-ball outs. Unlike Wednesday, when Roger Cedeno's
error cost the Dodgers in the 12th, the club played great defense
behind Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko, starting at third for Bonilla, made a diving stop
of Dante Bichette's fourth-inning liner that looked even more
important when Vinny Castilla followed with a double to the gap in
right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki (3-4) got double plays in the first after Neifi Perez
opened with a single and in the ninth after Todd Helton opened with
a single.
</P>
<P>
   And before Karros blew open the game with a two-run double in
the eighth, Mlicki worked out of a jam in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   With runners at first and second and two out, Perez came to the
plate representing the tying run. He lifted a fly ball to deep
right. Gary Sheffield retreated to the warning track to make the
catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what Dave has brought here is a game plan,'' said
catcher Charles Johnson, who will leave the team for two days to
attend his grandmother's funeral in Florida. ``He used his fastball
to get ahead in the count. He has been doing that since he got
here. You don't win unless you have a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work in New York, where Mlicki was the fifth starter
and bumped several times in the rotation because of rainouts.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he is more than a fill-in guy. In three starts he has
moved to the head of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just feels good to contribute,'' said Mlicki, who grew up
in Colorado Springs. ``A lot has been going on in the short time
since I've been here. Every day it seems to be something. The only
way I can help is to pitch well.''

ANGELS BEAT MARINERS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Angels manager Terry Collins says the Seattle Mariners
still scare him. But one can only imagine how the Mariners make
their own manager Lou Piniella feel.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of poor defense and relief pitching by the
Mariners enabled the Angels to rally from a four-run deficit and
beat Seattle 11-5 before 30,268 at Edison Field Thursday night,
completing a three-game sweep of the defending AL West champions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' fourth win in a row, their seventh in eight
games and their 16th in 18. They remained 1{ games ahead of the
Texas Rangers in the AL West, with the Rangers in town to begin a
three-game series against the Angels tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The last-place Mariners fell 14 games behind the Angels, and
seeing Thursday's game, it's no wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners third baseman Russ Davis made two errors that led to
two unearned runs. Two Mariners pitchers botched plays when the
Angels were willing to give up outs with sacrifice bunts. And even
Gold Glove winner Ken Griffey Jr. misplayed a ball that helped the
Angels score three runs in the seventh to take a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels put the game away with a five-run eighth inning. In
all, the Angels had 15 hits, including three each by Gary DiSarcina
and Dave Hollins, and two apiece from Darin Erstad and Cecil
Fielder.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners bullpen came in with a reputation of blowing up
under pressure, and Thursday it lived up to it. The Angels scored
seven of their runs off the Mariners bullpen in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   The key play of the game, though, took place in the seventh
inning with the Mariners leading 5-3. The Angels had runners on
first and third with none out when Hollins hit a towering pop fly
into shallow center. Griffey, who got no help from his middle
infielders, got a late jump and allowed the ball to fall in for a
gift single. The Angels cut their deficit to 5-4 on that play, then
scored the tying and go-ahead runs on sacrifice flies by Tim Salmon
and Fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jarrod Washburn (3-0) appeared on his way to
getting his first major-league loss after falling behind early, but
he stuck around for 71/3 innings and got the win over Mariners
reliever Paul Spoljaric (3-1).
</P>
<P>
   Mariners starter Jamie Moyer pitched well for six innings before
Piniella decided to go to his bullpen with a runner on and none out
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Thursday's game, Washburn had done more than hold his
own since replacing the injured Jack McDowell in the starting
rotation on June 2. Washburn pitched into the seventh inning in
each of his first three starts and didn't allow more than three
runs in any of them. The Angels won all three games.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn got the victory in two of them, missing a third win
only because of a fly ball lost in the twilight sky in the ninth
inning on June 8 vs. Colorado that allowed the tying run to score.
The Angels eventually won the game anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Collins got his first look at Washburn during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked what I saw in those games, Collins said. ``He went
after people, he didn't back off. Everything everybody told me
about the guy was that he's tough, he's aggressive. But one thing
that's really impressed me is his command of his fastball. He moves
it around in the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn had been particularly good in the opening innings
during his first three starts. He didn't allow a run in innings 1-3
in any of them, but the streak ended Thursday. Griffey turned on a
3-2 fastball from Washburn and put it beyond the short fence down
the line in right field for a 1-0 Mariners lead in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the third, the Mariners batted around and scored four
times. Alex Rodriguez drove home two runs with a bases-loaded
single, Griffey added an RBI single and Jay Buhner had a sacrifice
fly. It could have been worse for the Angels if not for the catch
center fielder Jim Edmonds made on Buhner's deep drive to the
fence. Edmonds lunged and snared the ball before crashing into the
fence.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored in the first inning on Salmon's RBI single and
again in the third when DiSarcina singled and eventually scored on
a groundout by Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels trailed 5-2 in the sixth inning when third
baseman Davis handed the Angels a run. With Fielder (double) on
second and two out, Phil Nevin hit a slow roller to Davis. Davis
charged the ball, but it rolled under his glove for a two-base
error, allowing Fielder to score and make it 5-3.

RED SOX OUTLAST TAMPA BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ It took only 98 years, but the Red Sox
finally played a game in Florida that counted, and won it.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe would prefer not to count his wins by the year, but
for the moment, he has no choice. The last time the Red Sox
righthander won a game, he was pitching for the Seattle Mariners,
Tom Gordon was still a starter, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays were
something you found swimming underwater in the Gulf of Mexico, not
treading water under Teflon-coated fiberglass in Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll get a win sooner or later,'' said Lowe, who was
nine outs away from ringing up his first since last June 23 but
instead was watching on TV like most Red Sox fans by the time Troy
O'Leary's two-run triple gave Boston a 7-5, 10-inning win over its
newest expansion cousins Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pray for a win or hope for a win,'' Lowe added. ``I
know I'm going to get at least one by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The save went to Gordon, his 21st of the season and second in
two nights but first ever after he'd slept in his own bed in nearby
Avon Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom cooked breakfast,'' said Gordon, whose 1-2-3 10th made
a winner of another homegrown Floridian, John Wasdin, who struck
out two of the three batters he faced in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only left 10 tickets tonight, but I'm going to need all the
help I can get. You guys (reporters) got any tickets? I just can't
turn away any kids from home. If I have to buy 1,000 tickets
tonight, I'll just have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   One Sox player whose ticket was punched early was second baseman
Mike Benjamin, who left the game after striking out to end the top
of the fourth. Manager Jimy Williams said Benjamin jammed his right
wrist sliding into second base on a double-play ball after his RBI
single in the second. X-rays were negative, according to a club
spokesman, who initially had reported that Benjamin did not leave
the game because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin was not in the clubhouse after the game. Williams said
his valuable utilityman was day-to-day but sounded concerned that
the injury could have more lasting consequences. The list of downed
Red Sox second basemen is already a long one: Tim Naehring, Jeff
Frye, and Mark Lemke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a freak thing,'' said rookie Lou Merloni, who
replaced Benjamin. ``We're starting to run dry. I'm walking on
eggshells. But I'm ready to go. I'm ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays had rallied to tie the score, 5-5, in the eighth
with a two-out, two-run rally started by a double by a still frisky
Wade Boggs, the Tampa native son who had three hits Thursday night
after celebrating his 40th birthday Monday with a home run.
</P>
<P>
   While Lowe, who gave up home runs to Paul Sorrento and Mike
Kelly but had a 5-3 lead when he left after six innings, remained
on hold, O'Leary needed to wait just four days for the chance to
deliver another game-winner off Jim Mecir, who was with the Red Sox
last season in name only.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, whose 10th-inning single off Mecir Sunday night in
Fenway Park made a loser of the Devil Rays, drove a ball into the
left-center-field gap off Mecir after walks to Mo Vaughn and
DH-in-limbo Jim Leyritz, who had three hits and a walk in a rare
start against a righthander. That provided the Sox with their third
straight win and seventh in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched me inside in Boston,'' O'Leary said of Mecir, who
briefly became Red Sox property last summer as part of the Mike
Stanley trade but never played for Boston before Tampa Bay plucked
him in the expansion draft. ``I took the first pitch he threw me
just to see what he was throwing. It was outside, so I was looking
for the next pitch to be middle away. If that first pitch had been
a strike down the middle, I probably would have been confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at least something good came out of the day. That Jerry,
I mean, Dennis Springer was on me pretty good all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer _ the pitcher, not the talk show terrorist _ is a
knuckleballer who had success fooling O'Leary (ground out, double
play, whiff) but was less of a mystery to the rest of the Red Sox
lineup, which knocked him around for five runs and nine hits before
he left after Darren Bragg's single to start the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the damage was done by Leyritz and Vaughn, who doubled
and scored in the second, singled home two runs in the fifth, and
drew a one-out walk off Esteban Yan that accounted for the winning
run.
</P>
<P>
   While he is openly campaigning for a trade, Leyritz made it
clear again he just wants to play, period. That and have a contract
in hand for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to beat a dead horse with this issue,'' he said.
``If this team wants to hold on to me, make me more secure, and
pick up my (contract) option, I'll better accept my playing time
for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they've made it clear they won't do that.''

do JAPANESE HAVE PLAN TO END BURDEN OF BAD DEBT  
(See related stories: JAPAN-ASSESS, KOREA-ECON, ECON-REPORT) 
(mk) 
 By SHERYL WUDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's leading politicians are furiously thrashing out
the details of what the government hopes will emerge as a landmark
blueprint to clean up the nation's bad debts.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the plan are being closely guarded, but the prime
minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, referred to it obliquely at a news
conference Thursday, pledging that the government ``will take
drastic measures to resolve the bad-loan problem, which has been
considerably dragging economic recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   And the blueprint is likely to be an important topic on Friday
during talks when the deputy U.S. Treasury secretary, Lawrence
Summers, meets with Japanese government officials and party leaders
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After playing down the bad-loan problem for years, the
government now acknowledges that clearing away the loans may be the
single most important factor in building confidence overseas and in
giving a lift to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem loans, which have swelled to more than $600 billion
_ more than the size of the entire Chinese economy _ have been a
drag on the economy for years but now the government seems
increasingly determined to clean up the mess over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``An economic recovery and disposal of bad loans go hand in
hand,'' Hashimoto said at the news conference Thursday. He
suggested that he would call a special session of Parliament late
next month, after elections for the upper house on July 12,
apparently to turn the plan into law.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign investors are wary of new promises from the
government because they have been let down so many times. But other
analysts and economists say that while enormous uncertainties
remain, there are signs that the government may finally be ready to
implement the Total Plan, as it is being called here.
</P>
<P>
   The changes would take time but they could result in a sounder
banking sector, a more vibrant real estate market and a healthier
economy overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, Hashimoto's commitment to do something is getting
stronger and stronger,'' said Masaru Yoshitomi, chief economist at
the Long-Term Credit Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoshitomi argues that up until now, only the politicians
have broken from the pack to tackle the bad debt while the
regulators and the banks themselves have shown enormous reluctance.
</P>
<P>
   The Total Plan is being hammered out by 34 high-level Liberal
Democrat politicians and bureaucrats, who will convene a major
session next Tuesday to review a draft. The chairman is Okiharu
Yasuoka, a Liberal Democrat member of the lower house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is being done at a very top level,'' said a senior
government official. ``Few people know the details.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been through many versions and is still changing,
and about $17 billion has been set aside for it in the government's
$123 billion stimulus package. As described by government
officials, economists and bankers, the Total Plan focuses on the
bad loans and on the properties Japanese banks are stuck with
because they were the collateral for the loans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past banks have often set aside reserves for questionable
loans but they generally have not sold those properties or
liquidated the bad loans. One result has been a huge drag on the
property market and a continuing burden on the banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Total Plan calls for measures to encourage the banks to sell
the properties and remove both the loans and the collateral from
their books. This may be a wrenching process, for the sale of so
much real estate could drive property prices lower, and the
obligation to face up to the problems could force weak banks out of
business. This could be another blow to confidence in the Japanese
economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But supporters say that the plan at least offers a way out of
the mess, even if it is a risky and laborious passage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial proposals _ it is not yet part of
the government plan _ is to set up a ``bridge bank'' that would
essentially absorb the business of failed banks. The bridge bank
would take over the good loans and deposits of failed banks and
continue lending to their clients in order to minimize the
disruption in the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the clearest break from the current system in
which all banks, strong and weak, are pulled along together by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need a bridge bank,'' said Yoshitomi, a fervent
advocate of an expanded version of the Total Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The government already has a Resolution and Collection Bank,
which can absorb failed institutions, but its activities are not
comprehensive enough to deal fully with bankrupt banks.
</P>
<P>
   Ryuji Konishi, an economic consultant and former banking
executive who favors the idea, compares the bridge bank to a
fishnet that catched only the fish too weak to swim away on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong fish will jump over the net and survive, and the
shrimps and sardines will have to go into the net,'' he said.
``Unless you have a net, you can't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the weak banks are extremely sensitive to this
proposal because they do not want to be, in effect, taken over by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the government also put together a $221
billion bank bailout that would support depositors and help the
banks rebuild their capital.
</P>
<P>
   But the banks have drawn only 1.8 trillion yen. Weak banks are
reluctant to ask for money for fear that such an admission of
weakness would drive down their share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign investors would like to see the government put up
even more than 30 trillion yen, either through a bridge bank or
another rescue package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's not regarded as enough,'' said an executive at a
foreign asset-management company. He said Japan needs a bigger
bail-out in which the weak banks would go out of business once and
for all. ``Many people would like to see some of these banks go to
the wall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some bankers say the bridge bank is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time they really seem serious and are taking appropriate
action,'' said a senior bank officer at a large Japanese bank.
``What are the implications? The government is going to take
action. Maybe the government will close weak banks after it
prepares some structure to take over'' questionable assets.

MARTIN FINDS SUPPORT BETTER THAN SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ By 3:30 Thursday afternoon, when Casey Martin
finally teed off his dream, the fog and chill and mist all were
rolling in from the Pacific Ocean. Martin's tale had been warm, but
now it would be played out in the chill of reality and competition.
</P>
<P>
   The grandstand behind the first tee was packed. Melinda and King
Martin, Casey's parents, searched high and low for seats, and when
they finally were able to sit down, husband gripped the hand of
wife, father the hand of mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so thrilled,'' said Melinda Martin, who acknowledged
that tears were flowing down her cheeks when her son took his first
swing in his first US Open. ``The people cheering for him ... it
was very supportive. You could feel it in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   King Martin was experiencing nerves that would chew at him for
the entire round. Bill Wisnall, the lawyer from Eugene, Ore., who
had won the civil suit against the PGA Tour that enabled Martin to
ride a cart in PGA-sanctioned events and the US Open because of a
circulatory problem that makes walking difficult, put it bluntly:
``King's getting an ulcer today.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin himself heard the roar, ``and on that first tee, I
was trying not to think too much, to keep my thoughts simple. But
when they announced my name and the people roared like they did, I
admit I had to hit the ball quick before I first fell down.''
</P>
<P>
   After that first tee shot, King Martin removed himself from his
wife and family and friends and walked alone for much of the way at
The Olympic Club, needing the solitude to steel himself so he could
watch his son swing through a dream.
</P>
<P>
   But at that moment of that first Open swing for Martin, father
and mother were together watching son, ``and it was like the
fulfillment of a dream,'' said Melinda. ``I was overwhelmed. I was
thinking of what it was like 10 months ago when none of this seemed
possible ... and now he was able to fulfill the dream.''
</P>
<P>
   After the tee shot, Martin climbed into his EZGO golf cart, the
cart the PGA and the US Golf Association had not wanted him to
ride, as was the case with many in the golf establishment. Jack
Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer were two of the legends of golf who gave
videotaped testimony against him at the trial in mid-February where
Martin's opponents contended that allowing a player to ride in a
cart would soil the integrity of high-level competitive golf. For
his part, Wisnall could not help but think ``of the irony of
ironies.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because, said the lawyer, ``the last piece of evidence we
introduced before we rested our case was a commerical from EZGO.
The commercial had two golfers talking about how wonderful a cart
was, the EZGO cart. And the two golfers in the commerical? Jack
Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer ... and now Casey was riding an EZGO in
the Open even though they didn't want him to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin wished that he did not have to ride in a cart as he
stepped into it on that first hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to ride a cart to play golf,'' he said. ``It
hurts a little (psychologically) to get into a cart, but I need it
... and I'm grateful I'm able to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin parred the first hole and bogeyed the second when his
approach shot spun off the green and he could not get up and down.
The media contingent was sizable and the gallery also was large as
he finally settled down on the sixth hole for his first birdie.
Another birdie two holes later, on the par-3 eighth, brought him
back to level par, and the tale was growing warmer and warmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember back to a meeting Casey and I had back in my office
two weeks before the trial,'' said Wisnall. Wisnall said he had
told Martin he had only one condition for bringing the suit to
trial under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Which was?
</P>
<P>
   ``That if Casey ever got to a United States Open,'' said the
lawyer, ``he would have to come through with tickets for me so I
could be right at the ropes and see every swing of his. I was
thinking years down the road ... and here it was four months after
the suit and Casey was in the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was a no-brainer that Wisnall put his law business on hold
Wednesday afternoon, rushed down from Eugene to San Francisco, and
was at the ropes for every swing.
</P>
<P>
   Which were not too pretty on the second nine.
</P>
<P>
   On the ninth green, Martin had peeked at the leaderboard and
seen his name in bold, black letters at even par, but then the fog
rolled in some more, the air was chillier, ``and it felt really
cold,'' said Martin. And the cold affected his swing.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin kept rescuing hellacious par after hellacious par
until finally, the cold, the darkness, and the nerves all gathered
to thwart him on the final holes. He bogeyed the final two for a 39
on the back and a 4-over-par 74, eight shots off the lead, for the
day. But, said Martin, fizzling end or no fizzling end, ``I was
overwhelmed by the support I got.''

BUMBLING MARINERS FALL TO ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The rock formation in left-center field at
Edison Field provided a perfect setting for the Mariners'
three-night(mare) visit to the Anaheim Angels' refurbished home.
</P>
<P>
   Rock bottom seems to have been reached.
</P>
<P>
   In a game Mariner starter Jamie Moyer pitched well enough to end
the free-falling defending division champions' most recent skid,
two more errors by third baseman Russ Davis and two of the most
horrific innings of the season turned into an 11-5 debacle before
30,268 fans.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered the Angels' comeback. They chuckled at the M's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Though Davis spoke primarily of himself when he called Thursday
night's series finale ``embarrassing,'' there was enough blushing
to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Glenallen Hill dropped a line drive in the first
inning that was ruled a hit, leading to a run that negated Ken
Griffey Jr.'s league-leading 27th home run in the top of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer shook that off, got out of the inning, and happily sat in
the dugout when Alex Rodriguez's bases-loaded single, Griffey's RBI
hit and Jay Buhner's long sacrifice fly scored four runs in the
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer and the Mariners led, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Angels third baseman Dave Hollins drilled a sharp grounder to
Davis with one out and one on in the third inning, but instead of
catching the ball and starting an inning-inning double play, Davis
leaned over and the ball scooted through his legs. That led to the
Angels' second run.
</P>
<P>
   The third gift run came in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   After Cecil Fielder doubled, Moyer retired Justin Baughman for
the second out and appeared to have retired Phil Nevin on a chopper
to third. Davis charged, put his glove down, pulled it back up and
the ball skittered into the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mariners went back on defense in the seventh inning,
Jeff Huson was at third base and Davis was sitting in the dugout
wondering why this is happening to him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came up too quick,'' Davis said of the second error.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 19 errors, matching his total for all of last year,
he said, ``It's not a confidence thing. I want the ball hit to me.
I keep working hard everyday, thinking it will change. I'm more
embarrassed than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The second Davis bobble forced Moyer to throw even more pitches,
and so he continued, realizing that his fuel tank was running low.
</P>
<P>
   He told pitching coach Stan Williams that he was getting tired.
</P>
<P>
   After Gary DiSarcina led off the seventh with a single under
second baseman Joey Cora's glove, a pitching change was made. And
so was the game's complexion.

third with none out instead of nobody on with two outs.

and go-ahead runs.

   The bad news: most of the ticket buyers probably have been
reading, watching and listening about a team that has lost five

BUMBLING MARINERS FALL TO ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The rock formation in left-center field at
Edison Field provided a perfect setting for the Mariners'
three-night(mare) visit to the Anaheim Angels' refurbished home.
</P>
<P>
   Rock bottom seems to have been reached.
</P>
<P>
   In a game Mariner starter Jamie Moyer pitched well enough to end
the free-falling defending division champions' most recent skid,
two more errors by third baseman Russ Davis and two of the most
horrific innings of the season turned into an 11-5 debacle before
30,268 fans.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered the Angels' comeback. They chuckled at the M's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Though Davis spoke primarily of himself when he called Thursday
night's series finale ``embarrassing,'' there was enough blushing
to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Glenallen Hill dropped a line drive in the first
inning that was ruled a hit, leading to a run that negated Ken
Griffey Jr.'s league-leading 27th home run in the top of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer shook that off, got out of the inning, and happily sat in
the dugout when Alex Rodriguez's bases-loaded single, Griffey's RBI
hit and Jay Buhner's long sacrifice fly scored four runs in the
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer and the Mariners led, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Angels third baseman Dave Hollins drilled a sharp grounder to
Davis with one out and one on in the third inning, but instead of
catching the ball and starting an inning-inning double play, Davis
leaned over and the ball scooted through his legs. That led to the
Angels' second run.
</P>
<P>
   The third gift run came in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   After Cecil Fielder doubled, Moyer retired Justin Baughman for
the second out and appeared to have retired Phil Nevin on a chopper
to third. Davis charged, put his glove down, pulled it back up and
the ball skittered into the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mariners went back on defense in the seventh inning,
Jeff Huson was at third base and Davis was sitting in the dugout
wondering why this is happening to him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came up too quick,'' Davis said of the second error.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 19 errors, matching his total for all of last year,
he said, ``It's not a confidence thing. I want the ball hit to me.
I keep working hard everyday, thinking it will change. I'm more
embarrassed than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The second Davis bobble forced Moyer to throw even more pitches,
and so he continued, realizing that his fuel tank was running low.
</P>
<P>
   He told pitching coach Stan Williams that he was getting tired.
</P>
<P>
   After Gary DiSarcina led off the seventh with a single under
second baseman Joey Cora's glove, a pitching change was made. And
so was the game's complexion.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer watched a weird inning unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Spoljaric fed Darin Erstad a pitch that was hit back up the
middle, slightly to the pitcher's right. Out of instinct, Spoljaric
took a stab at the ball and knocked it toward Huson, who fielded it
barehanded but threw late to first. No one covered third base,
allowing DiSarcina to keep running, putting runners on first and

ANALYSIS: TOBACCO BILL'S FUTURE DEPENDS ON VOTER INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate may have killed its big tobacco bill,
but whether the measure still might rise from the ashes is anyone's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's day-after obituaries opened with scathing sound
bites from Democrats and promises to pummel Republicans on tobacco
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became entirely clear that in this merger era that we're
in, (tobacco company) RJR merged with the GOP,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle promised nonstop parliamentary warfare to revive a bill
before November. ``Piece by piece, drip by drip, we're going to
make this happen,'' he said. ``We're going to force action on this
legislation over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are betting that while tobacco has replaced
Monica Lewinsky as the hottest Beltway topic this summer, it's no
burning issue in the hinterlands. By the time November rolls
around, they calculate, voters will have forgotten the big tobacco
bill, which even legislators didn't fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense now is a general shrug,'' said a top Senate GOP
aide. ``People never understood it or believed in it much to begin
with. Most members are not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick said it was an easy
call for the GOP, whose mantra is tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an R after your name and a Cong. in front of your
name, this one was not even close,'' she said. ``The greater risk
for Republicans than being tarred as being in the pockets of the
tobacco industry was going on record voting in favor of taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still _ just in case _ backdoor negotiations are continuing to
see if any kind of legislation might be revived. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich suggested a much scaled-back version Thursday, but he
offered few details.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is teaming with Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, to fashion a new bill that would keep the key regulatory
and tax penalties intended to discourage smoking, but without the
extra baggage from both parties that ultimately brought down the
original bill sponsored by John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Said Feinstein: ``As the McCain bill got bigger and bigger, went
from the $516 billion to the $800 billion figure and they added the
marriage penalty (tax cut) and the drug program and the voucher
program, what happened is that the money left for public health
went way down to a fraction. ... That is not a good bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would like to immunize themselves from the tobacco
issue by passing a narrow bill to encourage education and other
efforts to reduce teenage smoking. The House leadership's version
would contain no tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Without revenue, such a bill would allow Republicans to say they
are doing something to cut teen smoking but avoid the charge that
they are raising taxes and expanding government with the big new
federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats and anti-smoking lobbyists are dead-set against
that approach. White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Thursday
that ``there is no such thing as a slimmed-down bill that protects
kids from smoking. ... A fundamental premise of the way in which
you curb youth smoking is to raise the price per pack of
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry also accused Republicans of misleading the public by
calling the proposed $1.10 tax increase on cigarettes a tax
increase. ``It's not,'' McCurry said. ``It's public health
policy.'' When challenged by a reporter, McCurry insisted, ``It's
not by definition a tax increase. It's a price increase first and
foremost and it generates revenue that is then used for other
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Crawford, a top lobbyist for the American Cancer Society,
said all parties from public health groups to the tobacco companies
(which at first sought legislation as a way to limit their
potentially staggering legal liability) are ``going to take a step
back'' to see what might be rescued.
</P>
<P>
   But Crawford said any bill ``can't be `tobacco-light'; it can't
be just something to get them through, saying they've done
something for kids. It has to be comprehensive and effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco legislation has taken so many surprising turns _
dead one day and alive the next _ and has developed so many
shifting political crosscurrents that even seasoned lobbyists won't
hazard a guess as to what will happen next.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative publisher Bill Kristol said Republicans will
probably go home for the July 4 recess to see how voters react. If
there's a big yawn, as Kristol suspects, nothing more will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's possible it will turn out there really is grassroots
interest in this bill,'' Kristol said, ``in which case Republicans
will come back here and revive it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist insists Republicans just saved
themselves. ``No Republican ever lost an election by voting against
a tax increase in the history of the world,'' Norquist said.
``There is only one thing voters will not forgive a conservative
party for, and that's raising taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats clearly smell an issue. Tobacco companies are now
the Great Satan of American society, polls show. And while polls
consistently show that most people hold smokers, not tobacco
companies, responsible for their smoking, sentiments reverse when
it comes to teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a Republican, I would be very nervous about being
identified with the tobacco companies,'' said a leading Democratic
strategist. Come November, he said, ``it won't be about all this
nuanced reasoning over the nature of the bill and taxes and where
the money would go, but rather, `Are you pro-tobacco or are you
against tobacco?' And on that one the Democrats win.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans counter that while nearly everyone thinks teens
shouldn't smoke, smoking is not a top parental concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the question, `Do you support legislation to help
curb teen smoking,' of course you're going to get upwards of 80
percent saying yes,'' said Fitzpatrick. ``But that's like the
questions, `Do you support protecting the environment or improving
education or even cutting taxes?' You get 80 percent saying yes,
and I often wonder, who is the other 20 percent?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when asked what teens do that most concerns them,
Fitzpatrick's polls show 39 percent say drugs; 17 percent say
gangs, crime and random violence; 9 percent say reckless driving
and another 9 percent alcohol; 7 percent say sex; and 2 percent
answer smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, public fallout from the Senate defeat of the
tobacco bill remains unclear, and no one knows where the issue is
headed. ``It's very hard to tell at this stage,'' Feinstein said.

KAISER WON'T COVER COST OF VIAGRA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After anguishing for weeks over how to cope with
Viagra mania, Kaiser Permanente, the nation's biggest HMO, will
announce plans Friday to exclude coverage of the popular blue pill
for male impotence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the HMO's new national policy will apply to other
prescription treatments for erectile dysfunction, including
suppositories and pills not yet on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was reached after an unprecedented national policy
review that had a team of physicians, ethicists and pharmacists
delving into such issues as the medical necessity for erections and
the dangers of recreational use of pills like Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   A stunning 2 million prescriptions have been written for Pfizer
Inc.'s Viagra since it was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in April _ making Viagra the most successful new
pharmaceutical on record.
</P>
<P>
   It's become a staple of late-night talk-show banter, so easy to
purchase that one can order it over the Internet. But it's
expensive _ selling wholesale for $7 a pill, retail for about $9 or
$10.
</P>
<P>
   In the last analysis, though, economic factors, as opposed to
medical issues, decided the question for Kaiser. Even if users were
limited to 10 pills a month, the HMO estimated that the cost would
exceed $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Kaiser dispensed only $59 million worth of
anti-virals last year, a category that includes all the protease
inhibitors and other expensive drugs used to fight AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could, of course, build the cost of Viagra into everyone's
premium, but is that the right thing to do?'' said Dr. Francis
Crosson, executive director of the Permanente Federation, Kaiser's
national physician organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's decision overrules some regional decisionmakers who had
hoped the HMO would provide at least limited coverage to help
certain patients.
</P>
<P>
   Several other HMOs have adopted rules limiting Viagra coverage
to six pills or so each month. About half of state-run Medicaid
programs provide Viagra benefits. Standard Medicare coverage
doesn't include any self-administered drugs, although some HMO
plans have been extending Viagra benefits that generally match
what's being offered through commercial plans.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra is the only FDA-approved pill affected by the new Kaiser
policy. But at least two other potential impotence treatments,
considered to be a year or two away from the FDA-approval stage,
also will be excluded, along with the so-called Muse suppository,
Kaiser officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The policy will take full effect when standard HMO contracts
come up for renewal, generally the first of the year. Employers and
other health-plan purchasers would have to buy an optional
supplemental benefit plan if they want Kaiser to provide the
coverage anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser doctors may continue to write prescriptions for Viagra,
and the drug will be available in the HMO's pharmacies. But the
standard $5 co-payment will not cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, where Kaiser provides HMO coverage to
roughly 2.7 million people, or 1 of every 3 insured residents,
Viagra has never made its way onto the list of reimbursed
medications.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the impact of the new policy, a spokeswoman said,
``Viagra wasn't covered yesterday, and it won't be covered
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, not surprisingly, was looking for a different answer
than what Kaiser came up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're disappointed,'' said spokeswoman Mariann
Caprino. ``This is a serious medical condition we're talking about
here.''
</P>
<P>
   She said excluding Viagra is inconsistent with policies that pay
for such things as seasonal allergy medications that also improve
quality of life, even if they don't treat life-threatening
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and advocates specializing in erectile dysfunction
roundly condemned Kaiser's decision, calling it a misguided slap
against those who want erection problems treated as a disease
rather than a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viagra has been terrific for me,'' said Santa Rosa, Calif.,
writer Eugene Shapiro, 63, who is co-writing a book about the
erection pill with a urologist.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said taking the pill helped him regain not only full
sexual function but also helped him fight bouts of depression.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bruckman, executive director of the American Foundation for
Urologic Disease in Baltimore, Md., said he was ``shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there has been any experimental or recreational use of this
drug, it's been limited and will not be ongoing,'' he said.
``Viagra is a serious drug for a serious medical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Imholz, senior attorney for Consumers Union in San
Francisco, noted that Kaiser will pay for office treatments and
surgery for erection problems.
</P>
<P>
   The policy banning payments for the drug ``seems to me a strange
inconsistency,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the impetus is cost-cutting, but they're going to
still pay for very invasive and costly procedures, and not cover a
safer and less costly medication.''
</P>
<P>
   But some top medical experts took Kaiser's side, maintaining
that all HMO members should not have to bear the cost of the sexual
activities of a few men.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's world of limited resources, you have to draw the
line somewhere,'' said Dr. Arnold Relman, a former editor of the
prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.

HOME-FILTERED WATER FAILS LEAD TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BARNUM  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some leading brands of home water filtration
systems, bought by tens of thousands of health-conscious consumers,
actually increase the amount of lead in drinking water, according
to a study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, commissioned by a San Francisco environmental group,
found that two common brands of water filters raised lead levels to
three times the federal standard and to more than 60 or 70 times a
more stringent state level.
</P>
<P>
   Four other brands were found to have lead levels above the state
standard. In all, the six brands represent as much as 50 percent of
the $2.5 billion market for water filtration systems, the group
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the study, one manufacturer, Franke Inc., said it
was withdrawing one of its product lines from the market and
offered to refund consumers the price of any recent purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Franke said it will conduct its own test on the products and
work with the Center for Environmental Health in San Francisco,
which commissioned the study, to ensure its products meet public
health requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Green, executive director of the group, welcomed the
move and said his group's goal is to use the state's anti-toxics
law, Proposition 65, to force other manufacturers to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a betrayal of public trust for corporations to sell
these products with the promise of protecting us from lead
exposures,'' Green said. ``It is the equivalent of having a smoke
detector with faulty wiring that starts a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted for Green's organization by the
Environmental Quality Institute at the University of North Carolina
at Asheville, which has done more than 50 studies of lead in
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Lead is the leading environmental threat to children's health.
Even at low levels, lead has been shown to impair fetal
development, cause learning disabilities in children and lead to
miscarriages in pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Green said the group had filed
60-day notices with the state pointing out that four of the
companies are in violation of Proposition 65, the state's
anti-toxics law.
</P>
<P>
   He said the group had filed a lawsuit against a fifth company,
Omni Corp. And a sixth company, Ametek Inc., the leading maker of
home filter systems, has already agreed to remove lead from its
product by November as part of a legal settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the study looked at 16 home water filtration systems
that have separate faucets mounted on a sink and usually have
filters mounted below the sink. The systems range in cost from $100
to $300.
</P>
<P>
   Over a three-week period, the study tested daily lead levels in
water that was left standing in the faucets. Many of the systems
have brass faucets, which contain lead that leaches into water left
in the faucet while it is not being used.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the researchers found, the filtering system can
increase the corrosiveness of the water and increase its ability to
leach out lead.
</P>
<P>
   Based on consumption of eight glasses of water a day, the study
showed that a filter made by Omni contained 35.5 parts lead per
billion, and one made by Franke contained 30.1 parts lead per
billion _ both well above the federal standard of 11 parts per
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Four other products, made by Amway, Equinox International Corp.,
QMP Inc. and Waterboss International, were below the federal level
but above the stricter Proposition 65 level of 0.5 parts per
billion.
</P>
<P>
   One independent authority who reviewed the study called it
sound. Donald Smith, a lead specialist at the University of
California at Santa Cruz, said that, if anything, the study
underestimated the exposure levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these exposure levels are sufficiently high to raise
concern for toxic effects, particularly for infants and young
children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Environmental Health recommended that consumers
run water for 10 seconds before filling a glass to remove water
with the highest lead levels.
</P>
<P>
   Franke and other manufacturers said they had not seen the study
and declined to comment directly on its results.
</P>
<P>
   But many noted that their products had been certified as safe by
a national certification group and by the California Department of
Health Services, both of which use the less restrictive federal
standard.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the certification group, NSF International,
formerly known as the National Sanitation Foundation, said, ``We
stand behind our certification.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said the study underscored the problem of
complying with conflicting standards in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a false sense of security since the state Department of
Health Services gave us a certification on our product,'' said Gary
Hatch, laboratory director of Plymouth Products, maker of the
Ametek water filter.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the state's certification program said manufacturers
have long been warned that certification would not protect them
from Proposition 65 lawsuits. And he said the study might force a
re-evaluation of the federal standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident it will undergo some pretty close scrutiny
now,'' said Robert Burns, chief of certification for the Department
of Health Service's drinking water program. ``There'll be a lot of
discussion about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Proposition 65 suits against makers of water filtration
systems stem from a similar campaign by environmental groups
against the makers of kitchen faucets.
</P>
<P>
   Using the California law, the groups have forced manufacturers,
at a cost of tens of millions of dollars, to virtually eliminate
the lead that can leach from taps into drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Faucets that do not meet the standards are required to carry
warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Somers, an attorney for the Center for Environmental
Health, said that water filtration systems simply fell through the
cracks when environmental groups were pursuing faucet
manufacturers.

 &HT;    Ho-hum, sailors home
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the fifth June in a row, in company of the sailing
half of our family, we are headed for a week's sail and crab-cake
tour of the Chesapeake Bay. En route to Baltimore we enjoy a
traditional Delta breakfast -- two small cookies and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   After a night in Annapolis, we enjoy breakfast at Chick and
Ruth's, where the Pledge of Allegiance tradition still holds, along
with New York bagels, fat cheese omelets, and Philadelphia
scrapple. At 8:30 in the morning everyone in Chick and Ruth's is
commanded to stop eating, stand up, place right hand over heart,
and recite the Pledge. They've been doing that for nearly a half
century, and people spend the night in Annapolis so they can
participate. With the Naval Academy just across the way and history
all around, you feel a tingle of patriotism in Chick and Ruth's.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast we board the good ship ``Alternative Medicine,''
sail under the Bay Bridge, and up past Fort McHenry, where no bombs
are bursting in air. The Star Spangled Banner still waves.
</P>
<P>
   The weather is cool and breezy, a sailor's delight. In good
weather, sailing is no more complicated than flying a kite and
operating a hay baler at the same time. Our boat is 35 feet long
with a 40-foot mast. Two large pieces of cloth are attached to the
mast. Raised up and down, set this way or that, they either pull,
or push, the boat along. I haven't figured out which. This is the
way Columbus discovered America.
</P>
<P>
   A sailboat has about two dozen ropes. You have to know the
ropes, as the saying goes. Sailing a boat is a pleasurable
experience as long as the weather is good and you don't get run
down by a freighter hauling televisions from Japan. When the
weather turns, there is some question about why people at the end
of the 20th century are spending their vacation traveling like
Christopher Columbus when perfectly good diesel engines are being
manufactured, even in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore's Inner Harbor we dock beside a couple from
Chattanooga who, unbothered by interleague schedules, have sailed
in to see the Braves play the Orioles. The Chattanoogans are flying
a big ``T'' pennant, as in Tennessee Big Orange. They are worried
about a quarterback, with Peyton Manning gone to the NFL, and
wondering if they'll ever beat Steve Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   We stroll past Camden Yards and think about hanging around to
see the Braves but decide to sail on and catch the Braves back in
Atlanta. Wise decision. Braves lose.
</P>
<P>
   After a night in Rock Hill on the Eastern Shore, we begin an
all-day sail down the bay to Oxford. Senior members of the crew go
ashore for a night at the Robert Morris Inn, built sometime before
1710. James Michener, who stayed there when he was researching his
Chesapeake book, said the Robert Morris serves the best crab cakes
on the bay. We find no reason to dispute the famous writer.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Oxford, it is D-Day, the Sixth of June, anniversary of
the stormy allied channel crossing to the Normandy beaches, and to
quote Lewis Grizzard, I'm not feeling so good myself. We are
bobbing around in the Choptank River, which is not at all a river
like the Flint or Chattahoochee. It's more the size of the Indian
Ocean, and 25-knot winds are kicking up 4- and 5-foot waves,
according to small craft warnings on the weather radio. We are in a
very small craft.
</P>
<P>
   A sailboat in rough weather doesn't ride on an even keel. One
side is up in the air, the other deep into the water. This causes
the helmsman to sit at an approximately 45-degree angle. The
company that comes up with Velcro seats in helmsmen's breeches will
make a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to expert seamanship by the captain, a.k.a. our downtown
son, we arrive safely in St. Michael's, famous for gourmet food and
an antique boat museum. Winds abate, and we welcome a good night's
sleep after a hazardous day at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Sailboat sleeping is complicated. If you're planning a sailing
trip and have a choice of roommates, I suggest a midget or an
acrobat. Our bedroom in the bow is pie-shaped. Our feet come
together while our bodies sprout out in opposite directions. To get
into bed, you wiggle in, sort of like slipping your hand into a
glove.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth summer on the Chesapeake came to an end with a sail
back into Annapolis. We didn't run aground, didn't get hit by a
freighter hauling televisions from Japan, didn't get lost in the
fog. Nobody fell overboard and we weren't set adrift by an anchor
coming loose in the night. We've become such experienced sailors
that once terrifying vacations are ho-hum. Next year we may try
something different, like an ox-cart trip across the Rockies.

   Commentary: Let's all get bald
</P>
<P>
   By John Young
</P>
<P>
   C.1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I just realized I should stop pretending I was
somebody else and start being like Mike, which is bald.
</P>
<P>
   I tell myself I'm not bald every day when, looking in the
mirror, I lean my head just so. Then from far-off points I comb the
morning strands in a left-to-right swipe. It is their commute to
work.
</P>
<P>
   I realized the futility of this exercise the morning after
Michael Jordan won his sixth NBA title, his teammates hugging his
neck like superfluous follicles.
</P>
<P>
   I thought to myself: Here is this man the world adores, the
epitome of grace, style and merchandizing, and he's got nothing on
his head but Air.
</P>
<P>
   And look at heads around the league, and look at the leagues
below, the colleges, the high schools, the junior high leagues.
There's more skin there than Sports Illustrated's swimsuit edition,
which has less and less suit every year.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not just talking about black guys. During the playoffs
the Indiana Pacers, in an apparent team initiative to make coach
Larry Byrd look prettier than John Tesh, all shaved their heads.
Now, head-shaved, seven-footer Rick Smits is no Yul Brynner.
Indeed, if Brynner had a backyard hound, the sight of Smits would
have caused it to lose its skin. But if that guy can parade lobar
nudity with pride, so can the rest of us. The fact is, we know we
can because Mike does.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is about Michael Jordan. Just ask NBC. He's next to
God and bigger than the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   One might protest, pointing out that the Beatles changed hair
styles around the world, and not just in smelly gyms. But the fact
is that bald consciousness is conquering the world. The other night
I saw Ringo Starr on the ``Tonight'' show. What was the legendary
mop-top wearing on his head? Just this side of nothing. Ringo has a
Rick Smits cut.
</P>
<P>
   Let's all get bald. Gov. George Bush? Let's get bald. Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison? Let's get bald.
</P>
<P>
   As hairlessness sweeps the land, we must wonder about economic
hardships, all those hair cuts, and who's making a mint off the
little man. In Waco, this trend could vault the local barber into
the income bracket occupied only by the local allergist.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm the one next to make a mint. I've applied for a
patent on a new hair-loss drug _ no, not to restore hair, to lose
it. Pending FDA approval, I think the trademark I've secured,
Nogaine, is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The baldness-causing agent? That's secret, of course. Generally,
I can tell you it's synthesized to mimic pheromones found in the
blood of veterans of President Clinton's damage-control team. Now
you can have the luxurious shimmer of James Carville without his
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In salve or pill, Nogaine can give you MJ's shine, if not his
jump shot. Hey, you take what you can get.
</P>
<P>
   We're coming to understand that this hair stuff is an impediment
to excellence, all those wasteful spins on the salon chair, all
those creams and combs. With Nogaine, fuss no more.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls' championship was a symbolic victory by the
forces of baldness over those of baldness remedies. Utah's Karl
Malone has been a TV spokesman for Rogaine. Loser.
</P>
<P>
   No I'm thinking that getting rid of unneeded hair may only be
the first big-money pharmaceutical opportunity brought on my modern
social developments.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, with women already starting to recoil from
scientific advances in the name of Viagra, my lab teams are busy
working on a pill to restore male impotence.

<P>
   ``Funny Girl'' didn't. ``Ship of Fools'' didn't (it wasn't even
on the ballot). ``She Done Him Wrong'' didn't, despite some of Mae
West's randiest come-ons (including ``Whyncha come up sometime, 'n'
see me?''). ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' didn't, despite
Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in their greatest, most
vitriolic and elemental roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Producers'' didn't. ``The Awful Truth'' didn't. ``Safety
Last'' didn't, proving that even Harold Lloyd couldn't overcome an
innate industry prejudice against comedy (silent, at that).
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Chaplin made it (with three: ``City Lights,'' ``Modern
Times'' and ``The Gold Rush''), although he's been caught slumming
in the bottom third of the list. His masterpiece in sound film, an
insane anti-fascist satire called ``The Great Dictator,'' wasn't on
the ballot. The Marx Brothers are duly represented by ``Duck
Soup,'' but where the heck is ``Animal Crackers,'' or ``Horse
Feathers''? (Answer: not on the ballot.)
</P>
<P>
   What about Fred Astaire in ``Top Hat?'' And the griping never
ends.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with a list like this: Everyone who's ever
gone to the movies has a really loud opinion. The AFI determined
its winners from a tally of 1,500 voters (including filmmakers,
critics, historians and assorted bigwigs), who chose their top 100
choices from a ballot of 400 domestic feature films.
</P>
<P>
   In determining the ``best,'' voters were asked to consider a
film's historical significance, critical reception, popularity and
box office. It's important to remember that a movie's artistic
value or dramatic impact was not the sole criterion. It's important
to remember, too, that the AFI's voters were not asked to rate
their choices from one to 100; a movie's ranking merely reflects
the number of people who included it in their final lump of 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizen Kane'' made No. 1 because more people included it in
their final list than any other film. Anyone could have predicted
it would win, teetering over such celluloid titans as ``The
Godfather'' (No. 3), ``The Wizard of Oz'' (No. 6) and ``The Bridge
on the River Kwai'' (No. 13).
</P>
<P>
   Orson Welles' masterwork is a movie everyone can agree on. It's
groundbreaking cinema, artful, poetic and thrillingly smart. No one
participating in the AFI vote would have dared leave it off their
list; it's too important, already too widely regarded as the
greatest movie ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Try leaving ``Hamlet'' off of a list of Top 100 English Plays,
and you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Citizen Kane'' is a cerebral winner, a film more studied
and admired than cherished and enjoyed. No one rents it because
they're in the mood for a good laugh, or a long cry, or a sweet,
extended swoon over dreamy kisses; for that, there's
``Casablanca,'' the AFI's runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Citizen Kane'' is an egghead No. 1, ``Casablanca'' is a No.
2 built for Kleenex. There are better Humphrey Bogart films
(``Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' No. 30), and better Ingrid
Bergman films (``Notorious,'' which didn't make it), and better
Michael Curtiz films (``Angels with Dirty Faces,'' ditto), but
``Casablanca'' yanks hard at our emotions. It's the sentimental
favorite, the romance all of us secretly wished were ours.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the ballyhooed ``Top 100'' has nothing to do with the
best American movies. It has everything to do with our favorites
movies we've seen 10, or 15, or 25 times, movies we grew up or grew
old with, movies that resonate in our now-departing 20th-century
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Wonderful Life'' is No. 8 because we have it memorized;
``The Wizard of Oz'' is No. 6 because of ``Toto, too''; ``Gone with
the Wind'' is No. 4 because we hum Max Steiner's score in the
shower. They can't be regarded, any longer, with anything
approaching critical detachment; it's like watching your kids in a
high-school play. Even their errors are proof of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   So along with the critical darlings (``Raging Bull,'' 24) and
hoary historical milestones (``Birth of a Nation,'' 44), the list
highlights films that have no business being in a best-of anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Fair Lady'' (91) is a charming slice of misogyny, but not
much more. ``Yankee Doodle Dandy'' (100) is fun, but so is ``On the
Town,'' which wasn't nominated. ``Forrest Gump'' sneaked onto the
list at 71, a reflection not of the movie's inherent worth but of
the mass hypnosis that turned it into a cult.
</P>
<P>
   For even less discernible reasons, ``Dances with Wolves''
slipped in at 75, just one shy of ``The Gold Rush.'' But why be a
crab about it? We all have our most-loved movies our childhood
crushes, favorite scenes, and pet likes and dislikes that make no
sense to others.
</P>
<P>
   Naming the best 100 movies is a pointless task, because a good
film spurs intense emotional response. It inspires passion, anger,
terror, anxiety, laughter, grief or delight. Despite all the talk
of lighting and camera angles and well-crafted scripts, the act of
moviegoing is a profoundly subjective experience. Movies are our
secret worlds; when we enter, we give ourselves up to fantasy. The
films that hold us firmly are those that win our hearts.

`MULAN,' POETRY IN MOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How far Disney has come from ``The Little Mermaid,'' an
innocent, joyously childish tale about a mermaid who yearns for
legs. And how un-childlike are the deepest pleasures of ``Mulan,''
an elegant film about a young woman who goes to war.
</P>
<P>
   The setting alone isn't exactly kids' stuff: ancient China, at
the time of the Hun invasions. The story, a timeworn legend that
involves Mulan's cross-dressing, army training and daring military
exploits, is deadly serious business. And the artwork _ epic Asian
imagery, shimmering pastel backgrounds and vivid-yet-graceful
characterizations _ is as sophisticated, and as ravishing, as
anything the studio's animators have produced. Despite its family
pedigree, ``Mulan'' is a grown-up film.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Disney sticks to its standard formula, diluting a sober plot
with comic relief (the voices of Eddie Murphy, Harvey Fierstein)
and hip-hip-hooray hymns and ballads that sound sweet but have the
nutritive value of a marshmallow. The songs are by pop craftsman
Matthew Wilder (who wrote a bit for ``The Air Up There'') and
lyricist David Zippel (``Hercules''), and they have a familiar,
labored earnestness think ``Pocahontas,'' revamped for the Northern
Wei Dynasty. No one will be humming these tunes when the lights go
down.
</P>
<P>
   What the film lacks in musical verve it makes up for in
grandeur. ``Mulan'' opens on an exquisite image of the Great Wall
at night, just as a mountainously muscled Hun leader named Shan-Yu
(Miguel Ferrer, doing a cool Clint Eastwood) is mounting his
invasion of China. Shan-Yu, a rock-like fellow with gleaming yellow
eyes and a hawk to match, is a villain in the grand comic-book
tradition of hulking bad guys the nastier the malefactor, the
thicker the neck.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the flame-haired Hades of ``Hercules,'' Shan-Yu is
little more than a plot device, a relatively minor character with
limited screen time and no apparent superpowers (beyond the ability
to survive an avalanche). He sings no songs; he sports no wiseacre
anthropomorphic sidekicks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing, too, because it allows the film to focus on a
terrific main character. Animated with great elasticity and fire,
and voiced with a neat sardonic edge by Ming-Na Wen (but sung by
Lea Salonga, Kim in Broadway's ``Miss Saigon''), Mulan is the
stubbornest in a long line of triumphantly obstinate Disney
heroines.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, she's a klutz. She hates makeup, speaks out of
turn, blows her first meeting with a husky matchmaker (she sets her
rump on fire) and is prone to wildly funny slapstick pratfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When will my reflection show who I am inside?'' she sings,
then rests in a garden scattered with blushing pink blossoms. A few
moments later she learns of the Hun invasion from an imperial
messenger, who demands the conscription of one man from each
family.
</P>
<P>
   Mulan's family has one man: her proud, aged father, voiced by
Pat Morita with infinitely craggy wisdom. ``It is my honor to
protect my country. . .. I know my place. It is time you learned
yours!'' he rebukes Mulan. Mulan knows her place, but she doesn't
want to stay in it. While her parents sleep, she cuts her hair,
dons her father's armor, assumes the identity of a young man and
rides off to war. Imagine ``Yentl,'' dressed for combat.
</P>
<P>
   Mulan's quest awakes her slumbering ancestors, who grumble about
the kid's rebelliousness (``I knew it, I knew it! Mulan was a
troublemaker from the start!'') but resolve to help. They appoint a
runt dragon named Mushu (voiced by Murphy with gut-popping puffery)
to rouse a powerful stone statue, but Mushu accidentally shatters
the old guy and scoots off to aid Mulan on his own (``travel size,
for your convenience!'' he boasts, explaining his size).
</P>
<P>
   Once in boot camp, Mushu instructs her in the fine art of
manliness (``punch him'') and assists her training, led by the
studly Captain Shang (voiced by B.D. Wong, sung by Donny Osmond).
</P>
<P>
   Mulan, renamed Ping, pals around with army buddies Yao (Harvey
Fierstein) and Ling (Gedde Watanabe) and helps pursue the advancing
Huns. Along the way there are glorious vistas (inspired by David
Lean) and breathtaking windows into ancient Chinese culture: a
scene in which Hun soldiers ring the lip of a snowy crest is
arresting and unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   The marvel of ``Mulan'' is its juxtaposition of visually poetic
images with the roughness of battle; it's a watercolor portrait of
war. There's no gore to speak of _ despite the combat sequences,
one scene in a burnt village and a bit of hand-to-hand violence in
the climax. The 4-year-old accompanying this reviewer was adamantly
unfazed (although she had a better time at ``Barney's Great
Adventure'').
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's a weird gumbo, this mix of adult subject matter,
radiant artistry, saccharine tunes and a buoyant, child-friendly
jokiness. It doesn't quite gel _ as though Disney yearned to be a
grown-up film _ but couldn't bear to abandon its family-movie
formula or the Happy Meal revenues it promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' may be art, but it's art that yields to commerce.

 &HT;    Commentary: TQP: Total Quality Parenting
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I saw the first lemonade stand of summer the other day. I was on
my way to pick up our youngest son at a friend's house. As I turned
the corner onto his street, I saw a hand-painted cardboard sign,
taped to a stick and stuck in the ground: ``Ice Cold Lemonade, Big
Cup 50 cents, Little Cup 25 cents. Ice Cold Water, Big Cup 40
cents, Little Cup 10 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   How cute, I thought to myself. Nothing like hot, summer days and
enterprising little kids. It's a milestone of almost every child's
life.
</P>
<P>
   I pulled up closer to the stand and, sure enough, there was my
son and his friend, manfully minding shop over the card table that
held his mom's best Tupperware pitcher and an ice chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirsty?'' my son asked, running to the curb to meet me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me the Big Cup,'' I answered grandly, digging into my
purse.
</P>
<P>
   When I handed over my 50 cents, he ran back to his friend and
shouted, ``That makes $2.75 for each of us!''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day's work. With the heat index at 108 degrees,
the two budding businessmen had a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder, why is $2.75 earned by standing in the suffocating
heat such a bonanza compared to the $5 a week we hand him for doing
his chores? He hardly takes note of those earnings, even though he
arguably has to work harder for them. No, the thrill comes from
planning, making and selling the product himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's no different for adults. This sense of ownership _ be it a
program at church, a product on the shelf or a marketing plan _
translates into the difference between participating in something
and caring deeply about it.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds me of the old joke about the ham-and-egg breakfast.
In producing it, the joke goes, the chicken is involved, but the
pig is committed.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure we want our commitment to go that far, but it does
make a point. For most of us to achieve any level of sacrificial
commitment, we must feel our input is valuable and essential.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, businesses were all abuzz about TQM, Total
Quality Management. It's pretty much the same philosophy described
above, practiced in the workplace. Small-group meetings are held
regularly among employees, their ideas and suggestions are sought
and implemented as much as possible. The message is loud and clear:
You are important to this organization, you make a difference, we
value you, we're listening to you.
</P>
<P>
   TQP should become the buzzword for all of us rearing children _
Total Quality Parenting. We should strive to make each family
member feel important, feel valued, know that his or her presence
makes a difference. Most important of all, perhaps, it would create
opportunities to listen, not lecture.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty easy trap to parent like an autocrat. After all,
that's what many of our parents did, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me why. I'm the parent, that's why. Just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, I'm not going to claim I've never said that to my
chidren, but I've tried not to. It belittles and demeans them. It
says, ``Your input on this doesn't matter to me. I don't care what
you think, and I don't even want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   I have a hunch many of us at times treat our co-workers and
friends with more courtesy and respect than we do our own family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Our son helped his friend close down shop for the day, hopped in
the car and proudly showed me his take-home pay. When you're the
youngest of three sons, it's easy for your accomplishments to get
overlooked. After all, two others already have been there and done
that.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a lot of lemonade stands in my life, but until today I
hadn't seen this one _ the one that my son and his friend made. I
couldn't have been prouder of him, and I told him so.

 &HT;    THE BIG WORLD OF BARBECUE
 &HT;    By JAN NORRIS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   American kids may think their dads invented barbecue. But that's
not exactly how the story goes.
</P>
<P>
   Roasting food over fire is the oldest form of cooking in the
world; picture the caveman licking his fingers after a satisfying
cookout.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it's as popular as ever, especially in the United
States, where more than 75 percent of households own a grill.
That's according to figures from the Barbecue Institute of America,
an industry group in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Men (and women) all over the world seem to get a thrill out of
their grills. Here's a little heated history to fire you up for a
Father's Day grill session:
</P>
<P>
   Barbecuing in the U.S. has many roots. Ponce de Leon, on his
cruise through the Caribbean, found Haitians cooking over fire. He
brought their techniques to America when he landed in the 1500s, in
what has become Florida, according to the institute. Other parts of
America doubtless picked up their outdoor cooking tips from Indian
tribes, who used foods indigenous to their regions.
</P>
<P>
   Pigs and chickens commonly landed on the spit, according to
early English writers documenting New World cuisines. It wasn't
long before the Spanish and English were firing up the pits and
cooking with rotisseries, but using the deer, cattle and sheep of
their fields in place of pigs or chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the world, meanwhile, picked up different methods
of fire-cooking from neighbors in the Middle East, Asia and Africa,
where Egyptians, Mongolians and desert nomads routinely cooked on a
spit over coals. The meats varied according to culture and
availability _ lamb in Mongolia, chicken and pork in southern
China, beef and lamb around Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of China and Southeast Asia today, cooking outdoors is
part of the culture, and communal cooking pits made of stone still
mark a village common. The people eat the same foods their
ancestors cooked over coals _ typically, beef, pork and chicken. In
southern India, Thailand and Vietnam, with miles of ocean
surrounding them, fish is skewered and charcoal-braised.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled wrapped foods, such as the Vietnamese dish of spiced
beef wrapped in herb leaves, beef lalot, are prepared over special
small ovens created for preserving precious cooking fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of those ovens is the Indian tandoori, a wood-burning
oven that gives everything from chicken to some breads a
distinctive smoky flavor, plus a red tinge that comes from smoke
penetration. Spicy marinades help, too: Curry mixtures and rubs are
popular in this country as a pre-grill seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Today's chefs favor smoking foods, and specialty stove-top
smokers are the latest craze. However, smoking is a centuries-old
preservation technique, used before refrigeration became prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   The Scandinavians and Russians smoke their indigenous fishes, as
do native Inuits and Indians along the Pacific Northwest. There,
planked salmon, deriving its flavor from both the wood of the plank
it's cooked on and the smoke, is a delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   Island nations such as Jamaica, Japan and Hawaii prefer grilling
their fish whole; everything from the tail to the sweet ``cheek
meat'' is eaten. Jamaica's whole grilled red snapper makes some
visitors forget about their other popular grilled dishes: jerk
chicken and pork, seasoned with the spicy rub that makes eyes
water.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the famous cash crop bonito, typically used for fish
stock, is available fresh once a year. At that time, the fish are
filleted and grilled quickly to sear the skin crisp, but keep the
flesh moist. It is then chilled and served with a marinade of soy,
ginger, honey and vinegar, according to Elizabeth Andoh, a noted
Japanese cookbook author.
</P>
<P>
   From Greece and Spain come shish kebabs _ skewered meat grilled
over fire, but in small chunks. Kebab history is loosely traced to
the Medieval days of sword-toting warriors who frequently ate in
the field during their battles. A deer, pheasant or rabbit was
caught, divided among the camp, and roasted in pieces skewered on
their swords over the campfire.
</P>
<P>
   Today's grill warriors prefer lamb, brushed with lemon juice and
seasoned with oregano in Greece; and beef and pork (and
occasionally lamb) in Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese, however, prefer cooking over a spit, roasting
the meat slowly over the coals. Home cooks are equipped with
rotisseries, and specialty restaurants called churrasqueira offer
the roasts, according to Portuguese cookbook author Carla Azevedo.
</P>
<P>
   A Portuguese delicacy, fresh sardines, get the grill treatment
after being sprinkled with coarse salt. They're served as a tapas,
with a rosemary, garlic and lemon oil dip.
</P>
<P>
   The big steak eaters are, naturally, citizens of countries that
raise beef as a primary meat source. The U.S., Argentina, Brazil
and Australia are beef grillers. Argentina takes specific pride in
its cattle, and huge stone grills for barbecuing are common on the
gaucho ranches.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Lukins, author of ``All Around the World Cookbook,''
describes the enthusiasm with which the gauchos go at it: ``They
don't fool around here. Ribs, both pork and beef, and sausages
threaded on very long skewers and beef short ribs were grilling
everywhere. A separate wood fire is kept going at all times for the
embers that feed the grills . . . There are no marinades or special
seasonings used on the meat, only salt.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the meal known as asado _ which literally means
``ribs.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Americans? The Barbecue Institute says steak, of
course, but burgers, ribs and chicken are tops with pops (and moms)
doing the grill thing.
</P>

<P>
   1/4 cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Choose a slender filet mignon or piece of London broil that's no
thicker than 1 1/4 inches. Make several shallow slits in all the
surfaces of the meat and insert slivers of garlic into them. Brush
the meat with a thin layer of oil, then salt and pepper both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Sear meat over hot coals. Turn it once after 5 minutes or when
well browned. Sear other side; if filet is rounded, you may need to
turn it 1/4-turn each time. The meat should be rare, though not
raw, inside.
</P>
<P>
   Remove meat from the grill and plunge it into ice water. Gently
lift the meat out of the water, leaving any fat behind. Pat meat
dry on several layers of paper toweling.
</P>
<P>
   In a glass or ceramic container large enough to accommodate
meat, combine marinade ingredients. Stir well to distribute. Let
meat sit in marinade, covered, in refrigerator overnight. If
marinade doesn't completely cover steak, turn meat several times to
ensure even flavoring.
</P>
<P>
   Serve chilled, sliced diagonally, with dipping sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 to 8 servings.
</P>

   In a food processor, process all the paste ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl to hold all chops, marinate the lamb chops in the
paste for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Over a medium charcoal grill, grill the chops for 5 minutes on
each side. Serve warm with sliced cucumbers, tomatoes and
scallions. Naan bread is often served with this dish as well.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Mahai kebab (fresh fish barbecue)
</P>
<P>

3/4-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil spray
</P>
<P>
   At least 1 hour and up to 8 hours before you grill, prepare the
dry rub, combining all rub ingredients. Coat chicken breasts evenly
with the rub, place in a plastic bag, and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   Remove chicken from refrigerator and bring to room temperature
before grilling. Meanwhile, heat grill to medium.
</P>
<P>
   Just before grilling, spritz the chicken with vegetable oil.
Grill, uncovered, over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes per side,
until opaque, but still juicy.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-inspired mojo-marinated pork tenderloin
</P>
<P>
   For the mojo marinade and sauce:
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 3 large oranges (about 1 1/2 cups)
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 2 large limes
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup minced fresh parsley
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Avocado slices and red-ripe tomato slices, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   At least 2 1/2 hours before grilling (or overnight), mix mojo
ingredients in a small bowl. Place the tenderloins in a plastic bag
and about 2/3 of the mojo over them. Cover and refrigerate the pork
and the remaining mojo.
</P>
<P>
   Remove pork from refrigerator; drain and blot. Let pork sit,
covered, at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Heat grill for a two-level fire capable of cooking first on high
heat (1 to 2 seconds with hand-held-over-flame test) and then on
medium heat (4 to 5 seconds with hand test).
</P>
<P>
   Transfer tenderloins to the grill, arranging them so that thick
end is over hottest part of fire. Grill, uncovered on high heat,
for 3 minutes, rolling pork on all sides. Move the pork to medium
heat, continue turning and complete grilling as indicated:
</P>
<P>
   Thin tenderloins (about 1 1/2 inches in diameter) need an
additional 10 to 12 minutes on medium and thick ones (about 2 1/2
inches in diameter) require up to 25 minutes. The meat is done when
the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees to 160 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Can be used as Cuban sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings.

   Don't believe politically correct Klan
</P>
<P>
   By Rowland Nethaway
</P>
<P>
   c: 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When blond-haired, blue-eyed Grand Dragon Michael
Lowe, backed by several dozen of his Texas Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan followers, shows up in the strife-torn East Texas community of
Jasper with a message of peace and harmony, don't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   It would be best if no one showed up at the June 27 KKK rally on
Jasper's courthouse steps because Grand Dragon Lowe is the Klan's
</P>
<P>
   most skilled recruiter. This rally fits his hateful agenda
better than a new fitted sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe is a successful recruiter for the Klan because he keeps the
hoods and sheets in the closet and preaches a message that could
substitute for the political platform of many current politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe represents the new politically correct Ku Klux Klan _ the
Klan with a happy face. Again, don't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of America, Lowe's attention must have riveted on
the small timber community of Jasper following reports that three
white men chained the feet of Jasper native James Byrd Jr. to the
trailer hitch of a beat-up old pickup and dragged the 49-year-old
African-American down country roads until his body was torn to
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The three white ex-cons arrested for the murder were reported to
have links to racist prison gangs. Add racial hatred as the
apparent motive for the ghastly crime and Lowe must have felt the
thrill of a once-in-a lifetime opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   When Lowe isn't busy putting a mainstream happy face on the
Klan, he works as a carpenter in the Waco area. He grew up and
still lives in nearby Robinson where high school classmates
remember him as a misfit who had a well-developed hatred for blacks
at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   A chilling peek into Lowe's young psyche that reverberates with
the Jasper murder was reported in an Aug. 14, 1994, Tribune-Herald
article about Lowe by staff writer Teresa Talerico.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe erupted when a black student was nominated as class
favorite, according to a classmate who graduated with Lowe in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all are crazy electing this n..... as our favorite,'' Lowe
screamed as he jumped to his feet, according to classmate Lee
Tadlock. ``My granddaddy had n.....s in the cotton field and drug
them behind the wagon with a rope around their necks until they was
dead,'' Lowe was quoted by Tadlock in the 1994 news story.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe has claimed that he joined a Klan faction, United Klans of
America, at 16. After high school, Lowe was convicted twice for
burglary
</P>
<P>
   and served prison time on one of the convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Lowe also received 10 years probation for possession of
an explosive device involving a series of bombings in Houston of a
</P>
<P>
   restaurant, an underground newspaper and an architectural
office, according to a 1989 ``Tribune-Herald'' article.
</P>
<P>
   Several years out of prison, Lowe finally found his calling. It
seemed to come naturally to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I joined the Knights in 1986, I told them, 'If you make
me an organizer, I'll build the biggest Klan in the country.'''
Lowe was
</P>
<P>
   quoted in the Tribune-Herald's 1994 article. ``We have built the
largest Klan in the country,'' he said. ``And they know it.'' In
less than five years, Lowe was promoted to grand dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, a soft-spoken man who talks with a lisp, found his version
of success through tireless ``klanning.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't hide from public view. He seeks publicity. When
opportunities arise, he calls a rally so he can tell everyone that
the Klan does not hate or advocate violence.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe talks about white civil rights. He talks about mainstream
values. He talks about family farms to farmers. He talks about
problems with immigrants. He talks about problems with the welfare
system. He talks about the right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   But don't believe it.

 &HT;    Global grilling
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans aren't the only ones who get fired up about grilling.
Here's a look at barbecuing in different countries.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco and Greece: Skewered meats, typically lamb, cooked over
direct heat. Mediterranean spices, such as garlic, lemon and
oregano used in basting sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia, Japan: Whole fish cooked over small hibachi-type
grills, with dipping sauces that include soy, ginger, honey and
often, hot chiles.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean: Pork and chicken cooked over open-pit barbecues or
roadside steel drums. Sweet-hot spicy rubs (jerk seasoning) are
applied to the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, Spain and France: Rotisserie-cooked roasts, primarily
beef and lamb, with basting sauces flavored with wine, garlic and
fresh herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Scandinavia, Pacific Northwest: Smoked foods, particularly fish.
Fish is salted before smoking; flavoring comes from the wood used.

 &HT;    Heritage river: Chattahoochee denied status
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At the request of Alabama's governor and congressional
delegation, a White House committee has backed off from
recommending President Clinton designate the Chattahoochee as an
American Heritage River.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Alabama angered Georgia officials, and might
escalate an already bitter water war between the states. Georgia
officials, including Gov. Zell Miller, pushed for the designation,
which would pave the way for federal funds and programs to help
clean up, protect and maintain the environmental integrity of the
Chattahoochee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely disappointing for all of us who worked so
hard to get this designation,'' said Lonice Barrett , Georgia
Department of Natural Resources commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to name 10 waterways this month as American
Heritage Rivers under a program he created last year to bring
national attention to the importance of the nation's rivers. The 10
will be the first to be designated American Heritage Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the White House's Council on Environmental
Quality, Alabama Gov. Fob James and members of the state's
congressional delegation claimed that giving the Chattahoochee that
designation could upset negotiations among Alabama, Florida and
Georgia to settle an interstate water war.
</P>
<P>
   Under two interstate compacts signed by the three states,
negotiators are trying to work out an allocation formula by the end
of 1998 to divide the waters of the Chattahoochee and other rivers
flowing through the tri-state region. The Alabama officials say the
American Heritage Rivers program could bring in ``unexpected
impediments from outside parties.'' The letter did not specify whom
or what those might be.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Champion, an associate biology professor at Columbus State
University who led the effort for the Chattahoochee's designation,
said the program would have no bearing on the water allocation
process: ``I can't see why this designation should be a concern.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Chattahoochee appeared headed for inclusion on the
list of 10 waterways the council will recommend to Clinton. More
than 125 communities around the country nominated rivers for the
program. But at a meeting Tuesday in St. Louis, council officials
told Champion that the Chattahoochee would not be recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Champion said more than 3,500 residents and elected officials in
Georgia and Alabama, and 21 cities and counties had signed letters
supporting the Chattahoochee's designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope now is that President Clinton will go ahead and name
the Chattahoochee as an American Heritage River despite the CEQ's
decision,'' Champion said.

 &HT;    Good soles?
 &HT;    By Tim Pallesen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Residents of one of the city's poorest
neighborhoods were blessed with thousands of sports and outdoor
shoes recently after looters raided a tractor-trailer filled with 5
tons of name brands parked a block off Tamarind Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Chip Woods said he concluded that it would be ``stupid''
to ask anyone to return the stolen shoes. ``For some of those kids
there, this was probably their first pair of new shoes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Gross, a 37-year-old trucker from Tallahassee, told
police he exited Interstate 95 around 2 p.m. Wednesday (June 18) on
his Miami-to-Mississippi run because he was looking for sex and
marijuana. ``He flagged down a young lady riding a bike and asked
if she wanted to party,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous caller later told police that drug dealers broke
into the 18-wheeler first, followed by others who wanted new men's
shoes by Rockport, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Timberland and Nautica.
</P>
<P>
   Two cars collided on 13th Street trying to reach the scene,
Woods said. About 40 people were inside the trailer when police
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a free-for-all. Everyone came from everywhere,'' said
Edward Robinson, who lives on 13th Street between Tamarind and
Douglas avenues where Gross parked before police said he
disappeared into a nearby rooming house with an unidentified
25-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   Police retrieved about one-third of the shoes _ nearly 1,700
pairs _ which were strewn on the street or still in the trailer
when they arrived. Some of the looters had left old shoes where
they'd sat down to try on their new shoes, Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   John Fayard, the wayward trucker's boss in Gulfport, Miss.,
declined comment Thursday, except to say his insurance will pay for
the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was looked upon by this neighborhood as an opportunity _
not a crime,'' said resident Edward Fitzgerald. ``Was it a crime
for Michael Milken to make all that money on junk bonds?''
</P>
<P>
   Only Edward Robinson, the loss prevention director at the
Mississippi salvage yard where the shoes were to be delivered for
reshipment, called the police giveaway an outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe anybody should keep things they steal,'' he
said.

 &HT;    By all means, get the Blue Chips
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is probably no more ubiquitous woodworking hand tool than
the Blue Chip chisels made by the British firm of Marples. I've got
a set, you've probably got a set. They're everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   They're cheap and they're available. Thus it was interesting to
see this query, and the response it brought, on the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past month I've been staring at that Woodcraft coupon
for the six-piece Marples chisel set for $49.95 and the Record
block plane for $10 off. I've about decided to get them. My
question is, are they worth it? Anybody use and like these Marples
chisels? Should I go ahead and get them, or wait until I can afford
Sorby? How about the Record plane? Is it better or worse than the
equivalent Stanley UK model?''
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming consensus was that the fellow should go ahead
and get them. Actually, $49.95 is pretty high for a set of Blue
Chips, but I gather this one comes boxed. I'd forgo the box and buy
them cheaper. I can't remember what I paid for mine, but it was
closer to half that price. Of course, that was a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some responders even suggested that anybody who would turn up
his nose at Blue Chip chisels is nothing but a snob.
</P>
<P>
   I would say get the Blue Chips for a couple of reasons: First,
this gentleman is obviously a beginner and they're most adequate
for starters. Second, I know of no other moderately priced set
which includes the invaluable 1/8-inch chisel. And finally, I'd as
soon have the Marples as the Sorby. I don't know how much
difference in price there is between the sets, but I doubt if
there's much difference in quality.
</P>
<P>
   But I wouldn't suggest that anyone who wants a better set is a
snob. He's simply moved to another level of the craft.
</P>
<P>
   I recall some years back Fine Woodworking did one of its rare
(for the time) reviews of tools, and in this case analyzed the
steel in various brands of chisels. The Blue Chips came in last by
a long way. They'll take a fine edge, but they won't necessarily
hold it very long.
</P>
<P>
   There are, generally speaking, no finer chisels than those made
in Japan, although one needs to be careful to buy from a reputable
dealer who will sell a set made for export. Japanese chisels are
made of laminated steel; a thin layer of hard steel on the back for
the edge, with a thicker layer of milder steel to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, most woodworkers use soft woods, and thus can use
extremely hard steel. But in this country, where furniture making
nearly always involves hardwoods, such an edge will tend to chip
very easily.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese chisels range from moderately priced to incredibly
expensive. The more expensive ones tend to be works of art rather
than practical tools. A $10 chisel may not hold an edge as long as
I'd like, but a $100 one makes me nervous.
</P>
<P>
   The Record plane is in the same category as the Marples chisels
-- it's hard to find anything else, and even harder to find
anything better. The soles of Record planes are never, in my
experience, flat or square to the sides, and the irons are of
indifferent quality. If you're willing to put in a considerable
degree of scutwork, you can deal with this.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, you'll have to flatten the soles by hand, which means
rubbing them on wet silicon carbide powder or paper on an
absolutely flat surface, usually heavy glass. The soles don't have
to be totally flat, but the leading edge, the surfaces just fore
and aft of the iron, and the tail end should all be on exactly the
same plane. The rest of the surface can be a little lower.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the iron only takes money. The Japanese make excellent
irons to fit the Record planes, and so does the small American
maker Hock. You can also improve them considerably by getting all
the slop out of the adjustment screw, but you'll need a better
expert than myself to explain that.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the Marples chisels will need similar work. The
back (edge side) of the chisel is just like the sole of a plane; it
has to be flat and square to the sides. The Marples tools won't be.
Once again, silicon carbide powder and water on a piece of heavy,
flat glass are called for.

   SALAMANDER-POEM _ AUSTIN _ U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks,
mixing rhyme and reason, kept the Barton Springs Pool open by
denying attempts to stop the city from cleaning the spring-fed pool
that is habitat to an endangered salamander and a cool respite for
Central Texans. In a 16-line poem and a 20-page opinion, the judge
took literary and legal swings at the Endangered Species Act,
ruling that the city's cleaning does not harm the 3-inch
salamander, which lives only in the local springs. (Copelin, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

   SMART-CAMPS _ Forget canoeing and horseback riding. These
``smart'' camps, ranging in cost from free to about $300 a week,
expose kids to everything from engineering and science to poetry
and architecture. (Tanamachi/Coleman, Austin American-Statesman)
MOVED.

</P>
<P>
   BEER-MSKUBE _ Along with the darker Altbiers of nearby
Dusseldorf and the spritzy white beers of Berlin, Kolsch is the
least familiar of German styles in the United States. It's a
different kind of ale (an English word Germans never use), light as
a sister's kiss, pale as summer corn, served in a cylindrical
7-ounce glass with no ornamentation. (Skube, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED. EMBARGOED FOR 6/18.

<P>
   FOOD-RECIPESWAP _ Frances Bowie recently e-mailed Recipe Swap
looking for the Mix-Easy Two Egg Cake recipe from the cookbook and
manual that came with her Dormeyer mixer in 1948. Luckily, there
were a handful of pack rats out there who pulled out their Dormeyer
mixer manuals from around the same time and found the recipe. And

their mixers were still working. (Recipe follows.) (Walker, Atlanta

   YBORFLA _ TAMPA _ I strolled and shopped by day and crawled bar
to bar at night. This is the way to see Tampa's Ybor City. Ybor
City draws huge weekend crowds for its nightlife. Nightclubs are
shoulder-to-shoulder along the main street, Seventh Avenue, like
cheapskates at an open bar. That wasn't the case about 20 years ago
when Ybor was a crumbling, neglected, dangerous-at-night
neighborhood. (Lomartire, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   YBORFLA-WALKINGTOUR _ TAMPA _ Carmen Morales, who grew up in
Ybor City, can bring the past back with anecdotes that make a
1-mile walking tour a lively excursion. A volunteer guide, she'll
tell you about her history, which is Ybor's history, too.
(Lomartire, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   SEASIDE _ SEASIDE, Fla. _ This small town built next to the Gulf
of Mexico gives contradictory first impressions. You see a
Victorian village with turn-of-the-century turrets, verandas and
picket fences. But on closer inspection it looks like a movie set
too perfect to be a real town. In fact, Seaside, which was the
location for the new movie The Truman Show starring Jim Carrey, is
not historic, unless 17 years _ the first house was built in 1981 _
counts as vintage. (Blackerby, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   SEASIDEFLA-ARCHITECTURE _ SEASIDE, Fla. _ So what do people do
in this Architectural Digest-perfect town? One would think the Gulf
of Mexico would be the main attraction. No, indeed. Houses are what
draw sightseers, many of whom are architects and urban planners,
who come here to admire and photograph the real estate. (Blackerby,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   SUWANNEE-HOUSEBOAT _ SUWANNEE, Fla. _ I'm on the Suwannee. The
houseboat is real and we're cruising lazily up the river
immortalized in Stephen Foster's song Old Folks at Home, a perfect
place to remember old daydreams. Our cruise begins at Miller's
Marina in the town of Suwannee, where the river empties into the
gulf on Florida's West Coast. The lower area of the river is a
national wildlife refuge. (Zent, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

BOUNTY MIGHT STOP WELFARE CHEATS WHO LIVE BEHIND BARS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ One of the darkest fears I hear expressed by the
50 or so people who call me every day is that the poor are ripping
them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work hard for my money,'' they tell me, ``and my tax dollars
are going to support lazy stiffs who just sit around all day and
watch Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's true that one New Yorker in 18 collects welfare. It's
also true that the overwhelming majority of those welfare
recipients are children _ people who can't yet work and would
starve in the streets if they weren't provided for them. But I can
understand resentment against able-bodied adults who are on the
dole.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when those able-bodied adults happen to be collecting
aid while they're behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you think that doesn't happen? Then you should know that
about two years ago, just before Congress passed welfare reform,
the inspector general of the Social Security Administration looked
into how many inmates nationwide were illegally receiving Social
Security benefits, mostly disability payments.
</P>
<P>
   His estimate? About 60,000 jail and prison inmates were
continuing to collect that money even though they were in the
slammer and no longer eligible. How much money are we talking
about? Oh, only about $500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   How can a thing like this happen? Well, when the inmates go into
the slammer some of them somehow neglect to mention to anybody in
authority that they're collecting. OK, so that's fraud. So, what's
anybody going to do to them _ put them behind bars?
</P>
<P>
   The Empire State has about 7 percent of the country's
population. That meant that, all factors being equal, about 4,200
New York jail and prison inmates probably were collecting illegal
Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And, when you talk about New York as opposed to the rest of
America, nothing is ever equal. New York is Ripoff Central, USA.
New Yorkers probably had more than their share of incarcerated
Social Security cheats.
</P>
<P>
   What Washington did to deal with this was to come up with a
bounty system to encourage state prison systems and local jails to
find Social Security cheats. Find a cheat and we'll give you money,
Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   So now the New York state prison system is assiduous about
trying to catch Social Security cheats. The state averages about
five grand a month in bounty money from the feds. Local jails are
also trying to crack down. Last year, for example, the Saratoga
County jail in suburban Albany, which has maybe 190 inmates at any
given moment, found 11 Social Security cheats and collected $4,400
in bounty money from the feds. So far this year, Saratoga County
has nailed another four and collected about $2,800 in bounties. The
jail in Rensselaer County, another Albany suburb with about 265
inmates at any given moment, caught four guys just in the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   But no such bounty program exists for state-delivered benefits
like welfare. And people who go to jail are more likely to be
receiving welfare benefits than the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the administration of Gov. George Pataki began
comparing state and local inmate lists with welfare lists. Since
then, the computer runs have nailed about 2,500 inmates a year and
saved about 12 million bucks annually. But, given the Social
Security Administration figures, that number strikes me as a bit
low.
</P>
<P>
   My guess: there exist a few more than that in the New York
system.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's my suggestion: The Pataki administration _ not to
mention the administrations of other states around the country _
should offer the state prison system and the local jails the same
sort of bounties for jailed welfare cheats that the feds are
offering for jailed Social Security cheats. The worst that can
happen is that jailers won't catch any extra cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, I suspect they will.

WELCOME TO TIGER NATION

 Commentary

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For 4 1/2 hours Thursday I was a citizen of
Tiger Nation, the most rapidly growing nation in the world. If I
had a dollar for every time I heard the word ``Tiger'' at the
Olympic Club, I'd have made more money in one day than Tiger Woods
ever has.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the thwank of titanium on Titleist. Here's what the
U.S. Open sounds like: ``Tiger, Tiger, Tiger ...''
</P>
<P>
   You hear it on the shuttle bus going in, along all the fairways,
at all the concession stands and on the bus going out. The
pulsating sound of ``Tiger'' blots out the caws of crows, the beat
of camera helicopters and the drone of golf jargon on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cut across here, we can catch Tiger.'' ``Tiger hit a
bullet with that one.'' ``Did you see Tiger bogey on that hole?''
``Did you see? Tiger threw his putter.''
</P>
<P>
   Need I say Woods? Need I say the most famous sports hero in the
world, even for those who don't quite consider golf a sport?
</P>
<P>
   The only break you get from hearing his name is when the
marshals hush the crowd before a shot, and thank God for that bit
of etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Etiquette crumbles somewhat when the Tiger stampede starts. When
it's coming at you, you know how Custer felt when he saw the Sioux
nation coming.
</P>
<P>
   Except this nation comes in all races, ages and color of polo
shirts, and you don't die, except maybe of boredom. This is golf,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with the tiny figure of Tiger Woods swinging a club
far in the distance. Before the ball finishes rolling 290 yards
toward you, the horde of uncountable thousands is coming your way
along the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, one Tiger chaser would slip down an embankment,
taking two or three others with him, but they keep coming after a
brief ``Are you OK?'' and ``Excuse me.'' Golf is still a polite
sport, and this is a polite stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Nation isn't quite what you'd think it is. Most Tiger
stalkers were like most golfers _ older white guys who'd look right
in a Lexus. Tiger is a golf phenom, not an ethnic phenom.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there were a lot of young people. At 6:30 a.m. high school
students Nancy Luu and Jason Cunningham already had staked out
seats in the top row of the bleachers at the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   After the crowds arrived, 11-year-old Anthony Sigg of
Sacramento, Calif., was sitting on his dad's shoulders watching
Tiger. ``He's got a better view than I do,'' said his dad, Clay
Sigg.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster said, ``I'm here to see Tiger and Davis Love.''
Anthony already plays golf and knows that there are a lot more
golfers than Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   The complexion of the crowd at the U.S. Open had changed quite a
bit since the last time it was at the Olympic Club in 1987. There
were hundreds of African Americans, Asian Americans and Asians.
Shinichi and Chikako Saito came all the way from Osaka, Japan, to
watch the tournament in their new Stanford University sweat shirts,
and yes, watch Stanford's most famous alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   Guys who usually play public courses, like Frank Brown and
Richard Lomax of Sacramento, ogled the Olympic Club. ``These
fairways look like our greens at home,'' Lomax said.
</P>
<P>
   Why were they there? ``Tiger, I have to say Tiger,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   I saw a teen-ager in a Tupac Shakur T-shirt and baggy pants,
which led to the most interesting clothing clash on the course all
day.
</P>
<P>
   Two girls his age walked by, looked at his Tupac shirt and
giggled. They were wearing Bermudas and blouses in Muffy-Buffy
plaids. Hey, who's wearing the funny clothes here?
</P>
<P>
   Tiger unites all, though. As he approached the 14th hole, the
kid in the Tupac shirt began chatting with an older man in a blue
blazer and Panama hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Tiger's in trouble,'' the Tupac kid said. ``That ball
really rolled backward,'' the blazer man said. ``Like a rolling
stone,'' the kid said. ``Come on, Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tiger, Tiger, Tiger. But there were other names, and even the
most star-struck Tiger groupie knew them.
</P>
<P>
   John Daly, what a guy. He looks like John Candy's younger,
meaner brother. He hits long, lives large and is my kind of
athletic role model. A Kaiser roll model.
</P>
<P>
   I was waiting along the first fairway for Tiger when Daly's ball
landed nearby. He leaned on his club and lit up a ciggy. When it
was time to hit, he crushed it on the fairway. His caddy picked up
the butt.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kinds of details you see watching golf in person
that you'll never see on television.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson played in the same group with Tiger and got bigger
cheers on occasion. Golf is the only sport where you'll hear a
woman in the crowd say to her husband, ``Tom is looking awfully
well, isn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   They don't say anything about guys' butts, as in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Another comment I heard on the sidelines was, ``He's got his
glove off. That's interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the power of this sport. The player in question put his
glove back on, leading to follow-up glove analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Some advice if you're going on safari with Tiger this weekend.
Just do it briefly. It's great to see him up close, but you only
see parts of him between heads, under visors and around carefully
bobbed hair.
</P>
<P>
   There has to be more to watching golf than that. Don't ask me. I
only saw Tiger once close up, and never did see him sink a putt. I
assume he did.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger and Tiger and Tiger, oh my.

SOME COMPUTERS PREFER PLATINUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: In a recent conversation with tech support, I
discovered new laws of physics. The dilemma was over whether a
CD-ROM drive was broken or whether a game was at fault. The tech
support person told me that since the back of my CD was
gold-colored, that was the problem. He said it was not
industry-standard silver. I accepted this politely even though I
knew it was a lie.
</P>
<P>
   _ Peeved
</P>
<P>
   DEAR PEEVED: Now that's what's wrong with the relationship
between the computer industry and consumers. You were willing to
just roll over and accept any load of fertilizer they handed you.
</P>
<P>
   You knew this tech support weasel was wrong, and you let him get
away with it. You should have demanded to talk to his supervisor.
Computers are confusing to most of the people who use them, and
they have to depend on ``expert'' advice when they're in trouble.
What good does it do to let that bonehead continue to spew spurious
advice that's going to create more frustration than it clears up?
</P>
<P>
   This pea-brain also should have had the guts to admit he didn't
know his discs from a hole in the ground. A simple ``I don't know''
would be so refreshing. At the very least he could have asked
somebody with more experience to take over the call.
</P>
<P>
   To clear things up, it doesn't matter that your CD was gold. The
little laser thingie that shines on its surface is looking for
microscopic holes in the reflective surface, and it could care less
about colors. Take a look at a recordable CD. Guess what color it
is.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there any way somebody can find out that I
trade adult pictures with people I meet on America Online?
</P>
<P>
   _ Trader
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TRADER: Yes. Now we all know you're a perv.
</P>
<P>
   Get real, Trader. AOL can track everything you do online if
somebody there really wanted to. And I mean ``everything.'' Don't
forget, they have your real name and address, too. They may even be
inclined to tell your mommy you've been a bad boy.
</P>
<P>
   And you don't even have to trade pictures to get on somebody's
perv list. All you have to do is enter one of those weird chat
areas with names like ``Naughty Teens'' or ``Nervous Sheep'' and
you can be sure that some lowlife who trolls the rooms looking for
sickos will add your name to a mailing list. The next day your
mailbox is stuffed with offers of real live naked naughty bits for
a reasonable fee, charged discreetly to your mom's Visa. Let's just
pray she isn't in any of those pictures.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What does one do with old CD-ROM programs? I'd
hate to just trash them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Waste Not, Want Not
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NOT: Well, they're not aerodynamic enough to make decent
Frisbees. They're lousy as coasters. You can only make so many
cutesy clock faces out of them. Maybe hang them in the trees to
scare off squirrels? Find a used software shop and try to make a
few bucks? Give them to a school or church or charity and take a
nice tax deduction? Listen, you tell me what to do with them. I've
got a closet full of the things. But then, I plan to use them as
currency after the coming revolution puts the world in my evil
clutches. I guess I shouldn't have tipped you off about that.

   Commentary: Let's all get bald
</P>
<P>
   By John Young
</P>
<P>
   C.1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I just realized I should stop pretending I was
somebody else and start being like Mike, which is bald.
</P>
<P>
   I tell myself I'm not bald every day when, looking in the
mirror, I lean my head just so. Then from far-off points I comb the
morning strands in a left-to-right swipe. It is their commute to
work.
</P>
<P>
   I realized the futility of this exercise the morning after
Michael Jordan won his sixth NBA title, his teammates hugging his
neck like superfluous follicles.
</P>
<P>
   I thought to myself: Here is this man the world adores, the
epitome of grace, style and merchandizing, and he's got nothing on
his head but Air.
</P>
<P>
   And look at heads around the league, and look at the leagues
below, the colleges, the high schools, the junior high leagues.
There's more skin there than Sports Illustrated's swimsuit edition,
which has less and less suit every year.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not just talking about black guys. During the playoffs
the Indiana Pacers, in an apparent team initiative to make coach
Larry Bird look prettier than John Tesh, all shaved their heads.
Now, head-shaved, seven-footer Rick Smits is no Yul Brynner.
Indeed, if Brynner had a backyard hound, the sight of Smits would
have caused it to lose its skin. But if that guy can parade lobar
nudity with pride, so can the rest of us. The fact is, we know we
can because Mike does.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is about Michael Jordan. Just ask NBC. He's next to
God and bigger than the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   One might protest, pointing out that the Beatles changed hair
styles around the world, and not just in smelly gyms. But the fact
is that bald consciousness is conquering the world. The other night
I saw Ringo Starr on the ``Tonight'' show. What was the legendary
mop-top wearing on his head? Just this side of nothing. Ringo has a
Rick Smits cut.
</P>
<P>
   Let's all get bald. Gov. George Bush? Let's get bald. Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison? Let's get bald.
</P>
<P>
   As hairlessness sweeps the land, we must wonder about economic
hardships, all those hair cuts, and who's making a mint off the
little man. In Waco, this trend could vault the local barber into
the income bracket occupied only by the local allergist.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm the one next to make a mint. I've applied for a
patent on a new hair-loss drug _ no, not to restore hair, to lose
it. Pending FDA approval, I think the trademark I've secured,
Nogaine, is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The baldness-causing agent? That's secret, of course. Generally,
I can tell you it's synthesized to mimic pheromones found in the
blood of veterans of President Clinton's damage-control team. Now
you can have the luxurious shimmer of James Carville without his
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In salve or pill, Nogaine can give you MJ's shine, if not his
jump shot. Hey, you take what you can get.
</P>
<P>
   We're coming to understand that this hair stuff is an impediment
to excellence, all those wasteful spins on the salon chair, all
those creams and combs. With Nogaine, fuss no more.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls' championship was a symbolic victory by the
forces of baldness over those of baldness remedies. Utah's Karl
Malone has been a TV spokesman for Rogaine. Loser.
</P>
<P>
   No I'm thinking that getting rid of unneeded hair may only be
the first big-money pharmaceutical opportunity brought on my modern
social developments.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, with women already starting to recoil from
scientific advances in the name of Viagra, my lab teams are busy
working on a pill to restore male impotence.

THE NEW MEDIA MOGULS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Murdoch's hair is turning white,'' writes New
Yorker media columnist Ken Auletta of plutocrat Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is 64, and his shoulders stoop slightly. His voice is soft,
and his manner is unfailingly courteous as he sits with one leg
tucked under the other. Only the hard brown eyes suggest that he is
a predator.''
</P>
<P>
   Close observation and the occasional use of stiletto prose
characterize Auletta's ``The Highwaymen,'' a collection of his New
Yorker pieces just published in an updated paperback edition by
Harcourt Brace.
</P>
<P>
   The book, first issued last year in hardcover, is built around
profiles of media moguls such as Murdoch, TCI's John Malone, Time
Warner's Ted Turner, Microsoft's Bill Gates and Viacom's Sumner
Redstone _ the toll-takers, construction bosses and salvage-truck
operators on the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   Auletta came through San Francisco recently to promote ``The
Highwaymen,'' which features a new introduction and a wholly new
chapter on Microsoft _ changes necessitated, he says, by the
pedal-to-the-metal speed at which the highwaymen move. Indeed, they
are going so fast, it unnerves even them, Auletta says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you got inside Bill Gates' or Andy Grove's mind, you'd find
they're scared,'' Auletta says. ``Scared of (unpredictable)
technology, scared of government, scared of the press, scared of
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   A desire to glimpse the human side of media tycoons and
understand how the emotional melds with the commercial is what
drives Auletta to craft his celebrated, fly-on-the-wall profiles.
``Essentially, you're visiting other planets and trying to
understand the natives,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to demonize these guys but they're people. They make
mistakes. They're driven by panic or by their desire for their
little place in history. These are not people waking up every day
thinking, `How many people can I kill today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Auletta, a trim, snappily dressed, 56-year-old, is a widely
published magazine writer and former New York Daily News and
Village Voice columnist. His previous book, ``Three Blind Mice,''
was a dissection of ABC, NBC and CBS, an insider's tale of how the
Big Three broadcast television networks failed to understand
changing technology and the changing media marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought of themselves as a single channel and not as a
newsstand,'' Auletta says of the networks' slowness (NBC partially
excepted) to diversify into cable TV and cyberspace. ``In
retrospect, that was quite dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Auletta has been writing ``Annals of Communications'' for the
New Yorker since 1992. With its long lead times and acres of space,
the New Yorker allows Auletta to dig deeply and develop his
reporting on complex issues and complex people _ a rarity in the
age of sound-bite journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Auletta's M.O. is to spend time in board rooms and corporate
jets with members of the billionaire boys' club, seeing them
up-close and personal and, he hopes, unrehearsed. In the process,
he tries to glean insights into how they do deals and where they're
likely to go next on the Infobahn.
</P>
<P>
   For an unflattering piece on Murdoch titled ``The Pirate,''
Auletta spent eight days with the News Corp. chief over a
five-month period, taping 15 hours of interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Auletta says he tells his subjects at the outset that
```Everything is on the record unless you tell me it's not, and
there's no ex post facto off the record.'''
</P>
<P>
   ```I will be unobtrusive,''' Auletta says, continuing his
recitation of the ground rules. ```I won't talk (at business
meetings). I won't sit in a central seat. Look, I'm trying to
understand you. If I pick up stuff _ say, about a pending deal _
I'm not going to leak it to a daily reporter.'''
</P>
<P>
   When, as a fly-on-the-wall reporter, ``you get real close,
you're not just reporting press conferences. You're getting behind
the mask _ you think. They're always performing.''
</P>
<P>
   Auletta says he realizes that top CEOs might give him access to
their meetings, meals and tete-a-tetes because they think they can
co-opt him for their own self-promoting purposes, but he thinks
it's worth taking the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get to be a CEO without a tremendous amount of
self-confidence, and you think you can persuade reporters to write
your version. But,'' Auletta says of his way of working, ``if
you're nice, quiet and subtle, they feel comfortable with you.
Ultimately, they're going to say things that they don't mean to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Often an executive not ordinarily given to self-examination will
inadvertently reveal character.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Murdoch, the son of a relatively small-time
Australian newspaper proprietor, was snubbed at his exclusive
English boarding schools and made to feel the unworthy outsider as
a boy. Thus, while he is politically conservative, Murdoch sees
himself as anti-establishment and has a me-against-the-world
attitude. He is, in Auletta's opinion, driven as much by personal
animus as by political agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Auletta rakes Murdoch for taking the BBC World Service
off his Star TV satellite network in China because the Beijing
government thought the BBC was too critical of China. He also takes
Murdoch to task for publishing a flattering biography _
hagiography, actually _ of Beijing's late paramount leader, Deng
Xiaoping, written by Deng's daughter for Murdoch's HarperCollins.
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTINAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Auletta says he has no political agenda of his own. ``I'm not
there to prosecute a predetermined point,'' he says. Thus,
Auletta's pieces are characterized not so much by a unifying
political sensibility as by a storyteller's fascination with how
big personalities animate big issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auletta's favorite piece in ``The Highwaymen'' is a chapter
titled ``What Won't You Do?'' Catching the commercial commissars of
culture off-guard by asking them where they draw the line on what
they will produce or distribute, he sends record company
executives, filmmakers and studio heads backpedaling furiously as
they defend violent, misogynist gangsta-rap and the salacious
offerings of tabloid TV as First Amendment treasures. At one point,
a huffy Oliver Stone, so very fond of bending historical facts to
his own liking in his movies, demands that Auletta quote him
accurately.
</P>
<P>
   Its very unpredictability, Auletta says, is what makes writing
about the modern media business interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have one of the great beats,'' he says.
``Intellectually, it's a great time to be covering
communications.''

   Commentary: Let's all get bald
</P>
<P>
   By John Young
</P>
<P>
   C.1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I just realized I should stop pretending I was
somebody else and start being like Mike, which is bald.
</P>
<P>
   I tell myself I'm not bald every day when, looking in the
mirror, I lean my head just so. Then from far-off points I comb the
morning strands in a left-to-right swipe. It is their commute to
work.
</P>
<P>
   I realized the futility of this exercise the morning after
Michael Jordan won his sixth NBA title, his teammates hugging his
neck like superfluous follicles.
</P>
<P>
   I thought to myself: Here is this man the world adores, the
epitome of grace, style and merchandizing, and he's got nothing on
his head but Air.
</P>
<P>
   And look at heads around the league, and look at the leagues
below, the colleges, the high schools, the junior high leagues.
There's more skin there than Sports Illustrated's swimsuit edition,
which has less and less suit every year.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not just talking about black guys. During the playoffs
the Indiana Pacers, in an apparent team initiative to make coach
Larry Bird look prettier than John Tesh, all shaved their heads.
Now, head-shaved, seven-footer Rick Smits is no Yul Brynner.
Indeed, if Brynner had a backyard hound, the sight of Smits would
have caused it to lose its skin. But if that guy can parade lobar
nudity with pride, so can the rest of us. The fact is, we know we
can because Mike does.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is about Michael Jordan. Just ask NBC. He's next to
God and bigger than the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   One might protest, pointing out that the Beatles changed hair
styles around the world, and not just in smelly gyms. But the fact
is that bald consciousness is conquering the world. The other night
I saw Ringo Starr on the ``Tonight'' show. What was the legendary
mop-top wearing on his head? Just this side of nothing. Ringo has a
Rick Smits cut.
</P>
<P>
   Let's all get bald. Gov. George Bush? Let's get bald. Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison? Let's get bald.
</P>
<P>
   As hairlessness sweeps the land, we must wonder about economic
hardships, all those hair cuts, and who's making a mint off the
little man. In Waco, this trend could vault the local barber into
the income bracket occupied only by the local allergist.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm the one next to make a mint. I've applied for a
patent on a new hair-loss drug _ no, not to restore hair, to lose
it. Pending FDA approval, I think the trademark I've secured,
Nogaine, is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The baldness-causing agent? That's secret, of course. Generally,
I can tell you it's synthesized to mimic pheromones found in the
blood of veterans of President Clinton's damage-control team. Now
you can have the luxurious shimmer of James Carville without his
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In salve or pill, Nogaine can give you MJ's shine, if not his
jump shot. Hey, you take what you can get.
</P>
<P>
   We're coming to understand that this hair stuff is an impediment
to excellence, all those wasteful spins on the salon chair, all
those creams and combs. With Nogaine, fuss no more.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls' championship was a symbolic victory by the
forces of baldness over those of baldness remedies. Utah's Karl
Malone has been a TV spokesman for Rogaine. Loser.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm thinking that getting rid of unneeded hair may only be
the first big-money pharmaceutical opportunity brought on by modern
social developments.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, with women already starting to recoil from
scientific advances in the name of Viagra, my lab teams are busy
working on a pill to restore male impotence.

CONSERVATIVE STANCE ON SUBMITTING GENERATES BACKLASH BY MODERATE
TEXANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Not All Baptists Have a 19th Century Mindset,'' declares a
statement sent out by moderate-led Texas Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are millions of Southern Baptists who do not believe
women are second-class citizens ...'' states the declaration. It is
part of the backlash to the Southern Baptist Convention's recent
adoption of a statement that wives are ``to graciously submit to
the servant leadership of their husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A statement demeaning to women as that which passed the
Southern Baptist Convention in Salt Lake City would never pass in
the Baptist General Convention of Texas,'' declares the statement
issued by Texas Baptists Committed.
</P>
<P>
   It continues: ``We know that in God's eyes, men and women are
equal and that marriage is a partnership relationship between
equals and calls on both parties to seek to please and affirm each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Baptists Committed is a Baptist moderates support group
that during the last decade has fended off efforts of conservatives
to take over the Texas convention in the way they've done at the
national level.
</P>
<P>
   But while conservatives are in full control of the
Nashville-based Southern Baptist Convention, moderates, led by
Baylor University's moderates, control the independently governed
Baptist General Convention of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Baptists, whose state convention is larger than many
national denominations, have rebelled against what they call a
``fundamentalist'' mindset of the national Southern Baptist
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   While continuing to support Southern Baptist missionaries and
many other efforts of the national denomination, Texas Baptists now
send a smaller percentage of state money to the national
denomination and are backing moderate-led seminaries and university
theological training as an alternative to conservative graduate
theological training.
</P>
<P>
   David Currie, of San Angelo, coordinator of Texas Baptists
Committed, says Texas Baptists are the ``real'' Baptists and that
the conservatives in charge of the national denomination have
wandered off into the direction of the Rev. Jerry Falwell and other
more fundamentalist Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention's statement about wives
submitting was approved earlier this month in Salt Lake City as
part of a larger document on ``The Family,'' which also rejects
homosexual ``marriages'' and asks children to be obedient to their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Along with statements about women being ``helpers'' to their
husbands, Bible verses are quoted, including the Genesis account of
Adam and Eve and how a woman will be a helpmate to a man.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was added to the Baptist Faith and Message
Statement, a general statement of beliefs that must be signed by
all professors at the six seminaries supported by the national
denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Southern Baptist leaders, including the outgoing
convention president, the Rev. Tom Elliff, of Del City, Okla.,
defended the statement on ``The Family'' and said the pronouncement
wasn't interpreted well by the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you hear about from the media is submitting,'' Elliff
said. ``But the statement was about a lot more than submission. It
nullifies any thought of homosexual unions and the big call is for
husbands to love their wives as Christ loves the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliff said the biblical teaching doesn't mean wives have to
knuckle under to husbands who mistreat them and their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard to submit to a cruel husband, but what we are
talking about is the ideal situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currie, head of Texas Baptists Committed, said moderate Baptists
will take out ads in state Baptist newspapers _ and perhaps in
secular publications _ to let the public know that not all Southern
Baptists agree with ``fundamentalists'' on the submitting
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Southern Baptist Convention is becoming an embarrassment
to traditional Baptists,'' Currie said.

WHITE HOUSE CRITICIZES PELOSI ON CHINA TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry took a
verbal swipe Friday at Rep. Nancy Pelosi, saying she has an
``isolationist view'' for seeking to link U.S. trade ties with
China with Beijing's human rights policies.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said congressional critics of administration efforts to
continue so-called ``most favored nation'' (MFN) trade status with
China are putting up ``isolationist blinders'' that potentially
imperil American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's spokesman said ``a number of members of
Congress'' are insisting ``that we should suspend normal trade
relations with China _ which is the thermonuclear device of
economic diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry added that critics who urge an end to normal trade
relations with China ``are exactly those who are favoring
isolationism versus engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat, is a leading congressional
critic of administration policies toward China.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Pelosi's contention that China must earn normal
trading status with the United States by honoring human rights,
McCurry replied: ``That is purely and simply an isolationist view.
That is exactly how you isolate China in seeking that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry added: ``She would isolate China economically by way of
trying to compel different types of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-way U.S.-China trade amounted to $157.2 billion last year _
about eight percent of U.S. trade worldwide. White House officials
say about 120,000 American jobs are dependent on U.S. trade with
China, a nation of 1.2 billion with one of the fastest growing
economies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that normal trading status is extended to a number
of nations ``that we have far more significant and serious policy
disputes with than we do with China.''
</P>
<P>
   To threaten suspension of normal trading ties ``and to use it as
a penalty or to compel certain types of behavior is a very risky
thing to do,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will emphasize the U.S. economic stakes in trade with
China during his 10-day, five-city visit to China that begins next
Wednesday, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit will be the first by an American president since
Chinese communist authorities cracked down on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989, leaving between 400 to
800 dead and hundreds more imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will seek to ``create more interest in Congress'' in
expanding economic and political ties with China during the foray
to China, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress sometimes puts these isolationist blinders up and
they don't see these global problems as being connected to the
livelihoods of American families and the problems they're facing
when they sit around the kitchen table and worry about their
futures,'' McCurry said. ``We have to drive that point home.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry noted America's deepening trade deficit with Asia due to
the inability of faltering Asian economies to import U.S. products
and the ever-cheaper prices of Asian goods in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all the more reason why we've got to act in a very
disciplined way to address the needs of these economies,'' McCurry
said. ``It really is our livelihoods that are at stake _ not just
theirs. The president will be making that case during his trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Four American presidents have renewed normal trading ties with
China every year since 1980 _ including after the Tiananmen Square
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton renewed the status on June 3. Congress has 90 days to
vote to disapproval the renewal. The House is expected to take the
initial congressional action on Clinton's request after it returns
from the July 4 recess.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that the U.S. trade
deficit soared to $14.5 billion in April _ a new record for the
month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, concerned about the plight of Asian economies, ordered
the purchase of Japanese yen earlier this week in an effort to stem
the declining value of the Japanese currency, a situation that
threatened to escalate the 10-month old Asian crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ On at least two counts, past experience does not
encourage optimism that America's intervention to prop up the
wilting Japanese yen will prove effective for long.
</P>
<P>
   First, intervention in money markets has not generally worked,
and second, Japan in the past has repeatedly failed to live up to
its promises to straighten out its economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Previous moves to halt the decline of a major currency by buying
up large amounts of it in world markets have had only temporary
impact unless matched by quick fiscal and economic policies by the
government under fire. As one Paris banker said Friday,
``Intervention is a tactic for buying time, but the time passes
swiftly unless other measures are taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has pledged such steps,
declaring he will act speedily to stimulate his country's economy
and swiftly revamp the crippled banking system, with its pile of
bad loans, that has been a major factor in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Hashimoto has made similar promises before and failed to
follow through. As the London Financial Times pointed out: ``There
remains widespread skepticism about whether Mr. Hashimoto's
announcement contains anything new and, even if it does, about the
strength of the Japanese commitment to carry out the reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The British daily said the forces within Japan that have been
blocking genuine reforms are so powerful that Hashimoto might have
to resign if he tried to do what he has promised. The entrenched
bureaucracy that has long run Japan still appears reluctant to
change the methods that brought unprecedented post-World War II
prosperity but have now badly failed.
</P>
<P>
   The paper warned that Hashimoto might falter unless Washington
``cajoles an inward-looking Japanese leadership toward doing what
needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   More currency intervention would not be enough, it said, adding
that Congressional opposition to further monetary injections could
be expected since many lawmakers ``believe public money should
never be used to help countries in distress.''
</P>
<P>
   French economist and former Finance Ministry official Francois
Ringet said the United States ``will have to keep a relentless eye
on the Japanese to ensure that they fulfill their commitment. As
events have now shown, only the Americans possess the financial and
political power to keep the Japanese from delaying and finding ways
of not living up to their promises.''
</P>
<P>
   The French analyst questioned Washington's ``attention span,''
however. ``The Americans tend to get diverted because of their
worldwide responsibilities,'' he contended. ``Japanese officials
are aware of this from previous experience. They have patience and
know how to wait out those who seek to compel them to adopt
policies they have no desire to carry out.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials have been guilty of trying to cover up
aspects of the crisis, Ringet noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Finance Ministry concedes that bad bank loans are three
times higher than previously disclosed, nearly $600 billion,'' he
said. ``The Finance Ministry tried to hide the extent of the losses
because it hasn't wanted to force more bank closures. This is not
how a modern government should be run and is hardly a way to
instill confidence in how the Japanese will do things from now
on.''

however. ``The Americans tend to get diverted because of their
worldwide responsibilities,'' he contended. ``Japanese officials
are aware of this from previous experience. They have patience and
know how to wait out those who seek to compel them to adopt
policies they have no desire to carry out.''

   Japanese officials have been guilty of trying to cover up
aspects of the crisis, Ringet noted.

   ``The Finance Ministry concedes that bad bank loans are three
times higher than previously disclosed, nearly $600 billion,'' he
said. ``The Finance Ministry tried to hide the extent of the losses
because it hasn't wanted to force more bank closures. This is not
how a modern government should be run and is hardly a way to
instill confidence in how the Japanese will do things from now
on.''

<P>
   For the first time since 1979 _ when Iranian students seized and
held American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Teheran for 444 days
_ there is the possibility of improved U.S.-Iran relations.
</P>
<P>
   President Khatami wants to promote civil society and the rule of
law. He wants to end Iran's isolation. He wants to improve the life
of the Iranian people. He is reaching out to Iran's neighbors _ and
he is reaching out to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By himself, Khatami won't be able to reverse two decades of
strident anti-Americanism. He is engaged in a fierce power struggle
inside Iran, which remains bitterly divided between hard-line
conservatives and reformers.
</P>
<P>
   I believe we need to begin a policy of engagement with Iran. It
will not be easy and it will take time to produce results, but I am
persuaded that such a policy serves the American national interest.
</P>
<P>
   No one who looks at U.S. policy toward Iran since 1979 can be
satisfied with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   First, we want changes by Iran in ``deeds, not words.'' But that
dialogue isn't happening because of a fundamental lack of trust
between us. Iranians, even those interested in dialogue, fear that
somehow the United States will use such a dialogue to humiliate or
weaken Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the policy of ``dual containment'' of Iran and Iraq is
not working, and is not sustainable. Seven years after the Persian
Gulf War, no country in the world has followed the U.S. lead in
sanctioning Iran. Our efforts to isolate and contain Iran have been
counterproductive. They have caused great strains with our allies
in Europe and in the Persian Gulf. Our policy is not isolating Iran
_ it is isolating the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should use several avenues for outreach to
Iran and its people. Just as President Khatami chose CNN to send
his message to the United States, President Clinton _ or a senior
U.S. official _ can talk directly to the Iranian people through
interviews on Iranian radio and TV, or on the Persian service of
Voice of America.
</P>
<P>
   We should end references to Iran as a ``rogue'' or ``renegade''
state. Those terms suggest a lack of interest in serious dialogue.
We should end references to Iranian ``behavior.'' This term
connotes dogs and children. We should talk about ``policies'' or
``actions.'' We should emphasize the positive. U.S. officials can
refer to Iran's great civilization. Such language makes a great
impression on a people who are proud of their rich culture and
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In official statements or speeches, we can express ``regret''
over the state of our relations. In so doing, we demonstrate a
willingness to end 20 years of mutual recrimination and
finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is concerned about Iran's attitude toward the
Middle East peace process. But we should not simply say Iran is
totally opposed to the peace process. We are deeply concerned about
Iran's support for international terrorism. Yet as Khatami knows,
Iran too has paid a price for terrorism. It has paid in isolation
from Europe, deep suspicion from its neighbors and sanctions from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To assess whether Iran is pulling back from its support for
terrorist groups, we should ask ourselves:
</P>
<P>
   _ Is Iran imposing constraints on the military activities of
groups it has supported? Hezbollah in Lebanon has talked about
pulling back from the border with Israel if Israel withdraws from
Lebanon. We should test the Iranians' willingness to change words
into deeds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have military shipments through the Damascus Airport
diminished? It may be too early to get definitive answers, but we
should be communicating to Iran specific, doable achievable steps
that we want it to accomplish, on the way toward cutting off all
support for political violence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Is the declaratory policy of the Organization of Islamic
Conference, which condemned terrorism by all member states, holding
and being honored by Iran, the OIC's chairman for the next three
years?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we should take up President Khatami's offer to
increase unofficial exchanges of experts.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should send a USIA officer to the Swiss
Embassy, to initiate and coordinate exchange programs with Iran.
Former policymakers, professors, journalists, scientists, artists,
writers and representatives of non-profit organizations should meet
to discuss subjects of mutual interest. These will help break down
prejudices and misconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the United States should change its visa policies
for Iranians. We should end the current rules that collectively
punish Iranians through long delays for entire categories of visa
applicants. When a U.S. wrestling team traveled to Tehran in
February, they were treated respectfully by the Iranian government.
The United States reciprocated by treating Iranian wrestlers like
common criminals, delaying them for two hours at the airport so
they could be fingerprinted and photographed.
</P>
<P>
   This was humiliating to them, insulting to Iran and directly
contrary to our interest in signaling a willingness to develop
better relations.
</P>
<P>
   While we should take necessary precautions for security reasons
and for full observance of immigration laws, we should no longer
subject Iranians otherwise entitled to visas to long delays,
expenses and humiliation.

 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate)  
 &HT;    It's not the kind of thing you usually have to worry about.
 &HT;    But there's no mistaking the urgency in the voice of
zero-gravity test director Judy Rickard.
 &HT;    Several of us are floating upside down in the airplane cabin _
not that it's easy to tell upside from down, with gravity
temporarily suspended _ and the half-minute of weightlessness is
about to end.
 &HT;    Landing headfirst can be a real hazard on zero-G flights, even
though the floor, like the rest of our aircraft's interior, is well
padded, so Rickard and the other instructors are keeping a vigilant
eye on the suspended novices.
 &HT;    With a quick kick to the ceiling, I propel my legs back down
below head level _ just in the nick of time.
 &HT;    As ``down'' abruptly reasserts its existence, I crumple to the
floor, more or less feet first, and settle in for a couple of
minutes of double-strength gravity. Keeping track of which way the
floor lies is just one of the bewildering tasks that confront the
passengers on NASA's reduced-gravity test aircraft, otherwise known
as the ``vomit comet.''
 &HT;    There's nothing stomach-churning about the plane itself _ it's
essentially like a commercial Boeing 707 with interior padding
instead of windows _ but its two-hour flight can produce nausea in
even a seasoned sailor.
 &HT;    The aircraft follows a roller-coaster flight path consisting of
40 parabolic arcs, and at the top of each curve, passengers float
weightless for 25 seconds. Then come two minutes of almost double
gravity as the plane dives, levels off and begins another climb.
 &HT;    On this flight, the 21 passengers _ 19 students and two
journalists _ are getting their first and maybe their last taste of
zero gravity. Even for the unlucky ones who are sidelined by motion
sickness, it's the ride of a lifetime. But the students all have
experiments to conduct, so after the first thrill of floating up
off the floor, most of them are knuckling down to work.
 &HT;    Two members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology team _
Mandy Chambers, an aspiring astronaut, and Onier Villarreal, a
premed student _ float over to their equipment and pull themselves
into position to start their test of weightless welding.
 &HT;    About three dozen parabolas later, though, the students realize
it's their last chance to have some gravity-free fun. One by one
they abandon their experiments and begin _ gingerly at first, then
with increasing gusto _ to attempt things they can do only in these
weightless moments, such as spinning upside down or doing midair
quadruple somersaults.
 &HT;    Chambers tries slithering ``up'' one wall, across the top, and
headfirst ``down'' the other side, and finds herself convinced that
the floor is the ceiling.
 &HT;    All too soon, the plane is rolling back into Ellington Field,
north of the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, and the sense of
letdown has begun. We stumble down the stairs into the blazing
Texas sun and line up by the plane for the obligatory group photo,
once more firmly in the grip of gravity.
 &HT;    The NASA craft went into service in 1959 to train the Mercury
Seven astronauts, and it and a successor have been used by every
U.S. astronaut since for initial training. The converted KC-135
military plane was also the stage for space scenes in ``Apollo
13,'' the first movie ever to include authentic zero-G footage
rather than simulations.
 &HT;    But this is only the second year that a shot at the unique ride
has been offered to college students across the nation, who compete
for a spot by planning zero-G research projects to be conducted on
board.
 &HT;    The program is the brainchild of NASA zero-G test director Bob
Williams, a veteran of 71,000 weightless parabolas, and University
of Texas space researcher Burke Fort. They started the program
three years ago with just a few teams from local Texas colleges,
then expanded nationwide in 1997. This year, the program flew
almost 200 students from 47 colleges and universities, and it
expects to double the number of students next year.
 &HT;    The program costs NASA about $170,000, which its managers
consider a small price for the educational benefits _ not to
mention the public-relations value of sending the students back to
their campuses full of enthusiasm.
 &HT;    For the MIT team, and most of the others, the trip to Houston
began last summer on the Internet. Some received e-mail messages
from friends or professors, others stumbled onto the NASA
zero-gravity site on their own.
 &HT;    The terms of the offer were simple: Come up with an experiment
to be carried out in weightlessness, submit a proposal to the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and teams of up to
four students could test their experiments _ and their stomachs _
aboard the vomit comet.
 &HT;    For Chambers, an MIT sophomore from Dallas, the lure of zero-G
was irresistible. Since she was 5 years old, Chambers has dreamed
of becoming an astronaut _ and more than dreamed: She earned her
pilot's license at 18, has made dozens of skydives, and spent three
summers at Space Camp, a privately run facility in Huntsville, Ala.
 &HT;    She chose her college and her major, mechanical engineering,
with an eye to NASA's future needs, and joined the Air Force ROTC
in hopes of becoming a test-flight engineer.
 &HT;    A successful bid for the vomit comet would get her in the door
of the Johnson Space Center, and she might even meet members of the
astronaut selection committee. Best of all, she would get a taste
of what it feels like to be in space _ a few minutes of real
weightlessness.
 &HT;    In September, Chambers and three fellow students, one of whom
later dropped out, set to work planning their proposal. They
started with tedious searches of Internet and library sources,
checking what kinds of experiments others had done in zero-G and
what might be possible.
 &HT;    In the end, their inspiration came from team member Hernan
Mercado's summer job. Working in a machine shop, Mercado, a
20-year-old junior from Puerto Rico, had learned a bit about arc
welding; a search of the literature showed that it was an area ripe
for exploration.
 &HT;    It would not be just abstract research; astronauts may have to
make such repairs in space, possibly in an emergency situation like
last year's air leak on Mir, the aging Russian space station. ``I
can think of a couple of Russians last year who wouldn't have
minded having a welding torch,'' Chambers says.
 &HT;    Their experiment, Mercado explains, would examine ``the quality
of the weld _ can we weld at all? _ and the way zero-gravity
affects the melt density and surface tension.'' The MIT team put
together a formal proposal and e-mailed it to NASA. Early in
December, just before first-semester exams and winter vacation,
they got word that their project had been approved.
 &HT;    That was the easy part, compared with the task they faced after
vacation. With a March deadline looming, the team got to work on
constructing the equipment they needed.
 &HT;    But first, they had to scrounge up some money. NASA would cover
the costs of the flight, but all equipment and travel expenses were
up to the students _ and figuring out how to pay for it turned out
to be a big part of the learning experience.
 &HT;    As in many a real-world research enterprise, ``Money was the
hardest part of the whole project, by far,'' Mercado says. After
weeks of begging and bargaining, the roughly $7,000 they needed to
pay for welding equipment and two weeks in Houston was eventually
collected from various MIT offices and departments; in return, the
equipment will end up in an MIT machine shop.
 &HT;    There were logistical problems as well. None of the team members
was old enough to rent a car _ almost a requirement for getting
around Houston. They decided they'd have to make do with cabs. Then
a freight company refused to ship their tank of argon gas, a
crucial part of the welding equipment. They would have to find
another argon tank in Houston.
 &HT;    But those problems were behind them, and soon forgotten, when
they pulled into Ellington Field on March 16 and joined the other
teams in the NASA hangar, where students were setting up equipment
on a series of long tables flanked by an exotic assortment of NASA
test and training aircraft.
 &HT;    Forty-eight teams had been accepted from this year's 98
applications, and some were taking the concept of team spirit to
picturesque lengths. Several teams were decked out in matching
T-shirts, including the pessimistically named ``Team Hurl'' from
George Washington University. The Pomona College team, two men and
two women, had all dyed their hair deep blue.
 &HT;    The teams' projects were almost as various: One group was
studying the use of power tools in weightlessness _ something that
astronauts assembling the International Space Station later this
year will have to deal with. For instance, what's the best way to
anchor a power drill so that it's the bit that turns, rather than
the person holding the drill?
 &HT;    Another group was looking at ways of putting out a fire in
space, something that's trickier than you might think. In zero
gravity, water from a sprinkler system, for example, wouldn't fall
``down'' but would have to be directed at the flames under
pressure.
 &HT;    Another team would observe how goldfish in a sealed tank reacted
to the absence of gravity: Would they swim cheerfully and
omnidirectionally or fishily freak out as they lost their moorings?
 &HT;    Like commercial airline passengers, the students can't fly till
they've had their safety instructions. NASA's version, though, is a
bit more complicated than the flight attendant's memorized spiel:
It starts with a full day of lectures, attendance required, on
dealing with sudden decompression and moves on to the high-altitude
chamber for a sample of actual oxygen deprivation.
 &HT;    Decompression _ a loss of the cabin air pressure that makes
high-altitude flight survivable _ can happen in any airplane, as
passengers are reminded before every flight. But on a commercial
flight, you're strapped in inches from the oxygen mask. On the
KC-135, passengers could be anywhere in the 61-foot-long empty
cabin, far from the seats in the rear, where the oxygen masks are
stowed, if a decompression occurs. They need to know how to
recognize the confusion that signals oxygen deprivation, or
hypoxia, before it's too late to respond.
 &HT;    There are other uncomfortable effects of decompression too, the
lecturers explain: Gas will expand to several times its original
volume, so it's important to avoid gas-producing foods before the
flight _ and, in the unlikely event of a decompression, not to be
shy about relieving a sudden pressure buildup.
 &HT;    Burke Fort, the lanky and genial director of the program,
explains that the altitude chamber would simulate suddenly being
transported to a 24,000-foot mountaintop. Even experienced
mountaineers require weeks of acclimatization to function at that
altitude, so being ``transported'' rapidly to such heights is
guaranteed to make anyone black out within minutes; the brain
simply can't get enough oxygen to keep functioning.
 &HT;    The trick _ and the purpose of the training _ is to recognize
the symptoms of impending hypoxic unconsciousness in time to get
one's oxygen mask on.
 &HT;    The chamber itself _ World War II vintage, and ``older than most
of your parents,'' as one instructor points out to the students _
is a big steel cylinder that looks a bit like a used fuel tank.
 &HT;    Originally used to train pilots, since the 1950s it has been a
testing ground for every U.S. astronaut from the Mercury and Apollo
pioneers through today's space shuttlers, as well as anyone
(including Tom Hanks and the rest of the Apollo 13 cast and crew)
planning to fly on the vomit comet.
 &HT;    On the morning of the flight, everyone assembles early at the
Ellington hangar, nervous, excited, and just a little scared.
First, there's a round of preflight briefings, and everyone is
issued a Scop-Dex capsule _ standard issue for astronauts before a
flight. It's a combination of scopolamine, to combat nausea, and
dexedrine, to counteract the drowsiness scopolamine causes. It's
optional, but everyone agrees that it drastically improves the odds
of keeping down your breakfast.
 &HT;    The students get one last stern warning about keeping track of
their feet as they move around in zero gravity. ``If you kick me, I
will kick you back,'' Williams says gruffly, ``and it will hurt.''
Then, finally, it's time to strap into the seats in the plane's
rear and prepare for the unknown.
 &HT;    The takeoff, though smooth and uneventful, already has an eerie
feel; with no windows nearby, you can't quite tell when you've left
the ground. Once in the air, the student teams scramble into
position next to their experimental apparatus, all well padded and
reinforced to protect both people and equipment against unforeseen
collisions when the gravity changes.
 &HT;    Most people, it turns out, get sick during the minutes of
increased gravity, not while floating weightless. ``I'm really not
feeling well, really not,'' says one student _ and the zero-G
hasn't even started yet.
 &HT;    Then, abruptly, the heavy weight lifts, and the students begin
to drift slowly up from their places on the floor. Yelps, whoops,
and laughter fill the cabin.
 &HT;    ``This is by far the coolest thing I've ever done,'' says one
grinning George Washington student. Some students begin right away
to experiment with the new sensation, trying aerial somersaults and
spins. Others are more cautious, just letting themselves drift a
little or grabbing straps to hold themselves down.
 &HT;    After a few parabolas of getting used to the new freedom, and
trying to get stomachs back down out of throats, the students
settle in to do what they came here for. Most of the experiments
deal with basic engineering, chemical reactions or fluid dynamics,
but a few are more offbeat.
 &HT;    One team, from the San Francisco Art Institute, is experimenting
with painting and dancing in weightlessness. As Fort explains, such
creative endeavors might be important for maintaining psychological
balance during long-duration space missions, such as a six-month
flight to Mars.
 &HT;    MIT's welding is less glamorous, though perhaps of more
practical value. The students find it's harder than they expected
to hold themselves in position while welding, but the steel welds
they complete appear smooth and strong _ potentially good news for
some future astronaut in a leaky craft.
 &HT;    And then, suddenly, it's all over; our feet are planted on the
floor again, the plane heads home, and zero-G is just a memory.
 &HT;    A few veterans of the vomit comet, inspired by the experience,
may reappear at the Johnson Space Center in years to come, perhaps
to train for missions on the shuttle, the space station, or even
the first human flight to Mars. But even those who will never
return are taking home, along with their used equipment and
hard-won research data, memories and photos of a truly exotic trip.
 &HT;    And stories they'll be telling for the rest of their lives.

 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate)  
 &HT;    It's not the kind of thing you usually have to worry about.
 &HT;    But there's no mistaking the urgency in the voice of
zero-gravity test director Judy Rickard.
 &HT;    Several of us are floating upside down in the airplane cabin _
not that it's easy to tell upside from down, with gravity
temporarily suspended _ and the half-minute of weightlessness is
about to end.
 &HT;    Landing headfirst can be a real hazard on zero-G flights, even
though the floor, like the rest of our aircraft's interior, is well
padded, so Rickard and the other instructors are keeping a vigilant
eye on the suspended novices.
 &HT;    With a quick kick to the ceiling, I propel my legs back down
below head level _ just in the nick of time.
 &HT;    As ``down'' abruptly reasserts its existence, I crumple to the
floor, more or less feet first, and settle in for a couple of
minutes of double-strength gravity. Keeping track of which way the
floor lies is just one of the bewildering tasks that confront the
passengers on NASA's reduced-gravity test aircraft, otherwise known
as the ``vomit comet.''
 &HT;    There's nothing stomach-churning about the plane itself _ it's
essentially like a commercial Boeing 707 with interior padding
instead of windows _ but its two-hour flight can produce nausea in
even a seasoned sailor.
 &HT;    The aircraft follows a roller-coaster flight path consisting of
40 parabolic arcs, and at the top of each curve, passengers float
weightless for 25 seconds. Then come two minutes of almost double
gravity as the plane dives, levels off and begins another climb.
 &HT;    On this flight, the 21 passengers _ 19 students and two
journalists _ are getting their first and maybe their last taste of
zero gravity. Even for the unlucky ones who are sidelined by motion
sickness, it's the ride of a lifetime. But the students all have
experiments to conduct, so after the first thrill of floating up
off the floor, most of them are knuckling down to work.
 &HT;    Two members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology team _
Mandy Chambers, an aspiring astronaut, and Onier Villarreal, a
premed student _ float over to their equipment and pull themselves
into position to start their test of weightless welding.
 &HT;    About three dozen parabolas later, though, the students realize
it's their last chance to have some gravity-free fun. One by one
they abandon their experiments and begin _ gingerly at first, then
with increasing gusto _ to attempt things they can do only in these
weightless moments, such as spinning upside down or doing midair
quadruple somersaults.
 &HT;    Chambers tries slithering ``up'' one wall, across the top, and
headfirst ``down'' the other side, and finds herself convinced that
the floor is the ceiling.
 &HT;    All too soon, the plane is rolling back into Ellington Field,
north of the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, and the sense of
letdown has begun. We stumble down the stairs into the blazing
Texas sun and line up by the plane for the obligatory group photo,
once more firmly in the grip of gravity.
 &HT;    The NASA craft went into service in 1959 to train the Mercury
Seven astronauts, and it and a successor have been used by every
U.S. astronaut since for initial training. The converted KC-135
military plane was also the stage for space scenes in ``Apollo
13,'' the first movie ever to include authentic zero-G footage
rather than simulations.
 &HT;    But this is only the second year that a shot at the unique ride
has been offered to college students across the nation, who compete
for a spot by planning zero-G research projects to be conducted on
board.
 &HT;    The program is the brainchild of NASA zero-G test director Bob
Williams, a veteran of 71,000 weightless parabolas, and University
of Texas space researcher Burke Fort. They started the program
three years ago with just a few teams from local Texas colleges,
then expanded nationwide in 1997. This year, the program flew
almost 200 students from 47 colleges and universities, and it
expects to double the number of students next year.
 &HT;    The program costs NASA about $170,000, which its managers
consider a small price for the educational benefits _ not to
mention the public-relations value of sending the students back to
their campuses full of enthusiasm.
 &HT;    For the MIT team, and most of the others, the trip to Houston
began last summer on the Internet. Some received e-mail messages
from friends or professors, others stumbled onto the NASA
zero-gravity site on their own.
 &HT;    The terms of the offer were simple: Come up with an experiment
to be carried out in weightlessness, submit a proposal to the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and teams of up to
four students could test their experiments _ and their stomachs _
aboard the vomit comet.
 &HT;    For Chambers, an MIT sophomore from Dallas, the lure of zero-G
was irresistible. Since she was 5 years old, Chambers has dreamed
of becoming an astronaut _ and more than dreamed: She earned her
pilot's license at 18, has made dozens of skydives, and spent three
summers at Space Camp, a privately run facility in Huntsville, Ala.
 &HT;    She chose her college and her major, mechanical engineering,
with an eye to NASA's future needs, and joined the Air Force ROTC
in hopes of becoming a test-flight engineer.
 &HT;    A successful bid for the vomit comet would get her in the door
of the Johnson Space Center, and she might even meet members of the
astronaut selection committee. Best of all, she would get a taste
of what it feels like to be in space _ a few minutes of real
weightlessness.
 &HT;    In September, Chambers and three fellow students, one of whom
later dropped out, set to work planning their proposal. They
started with tedious searches of Internet and library sources,
checking what kinds of experiments others had done in zero-G and
what might be possible.
 &HT;    In the end, their inspiration came from team member Hernan
Mercado's summer job. Working in a machine shop, Mercado, a
20-year-old junior from Puerto Rico, had learned a bit about arc
welding; a search of the literature showed that it was an area ripe
for exploration.
 &HT;    It would not be just abstract research; astronauts may have to
make such repairs in space, possibly in an emergency situation like
last year's air leak on Mir, the aging Russian space station. ``I
can think of a couple of Russians last year who wouldn't have
minded having a welding torch,'' Chambers says.
 &HT;    Their experiment, Mercado explains, would examine ``the quality
of the weld _ can we weld at all? _ and the way zero-gravity
affects the melt density and surface tension.'' The MIT team put
together a formal proposal and e-mailed it to NASA. Early in
December, just before first-semester exams and winter vacation,
they got word that their project had been approved.
 &HT;    That was the easy part, compared with the task they faced after
vacation. With a March deadline looming, the team got to work on
constructing the equipment they needed.
 &HT;    But first, they had to scrounge up some money. NASA would cover
the costs of the flight, but all equipment and travel expenses were
up to the students _ and figuring out how to pay for it turned out
to be a big part of the learning experience.
 &HT;    As in many a real-world research enterprise, ``Money was the
hardest part of the whole project, by far,'' Mercado says. After
weeks of begging and bargaining, the roughly $7,000 they needed to
pay for welding equipment and two weeks in Houston was eventually
collected from various MIT offices and departments; in return, the
equipment will end up in an MIT machine shop.
 &HT;    There were logistical problems as well. None of the team members
was old enough to rent a car _ almost a requirement for getting
around Houston. They decided they'd have to make do with cabs. Then
a freight company refused to ship their tank of argon gas, a
crucial part of the welding equipment. They would have to find
another argon tank in Houston.
 &HT;    But those problems were behind them, and soon forgotten, when
they pulled into Ellington Field on March 16 and joined the other
teams in the NASA hangar, where students were setting up equipment
on a series of long tables flanked by an exotic assortment of NASA
test and training aircraft.
 &HT;    Forty-eight teams had been accepted from this year's 98
applications, and some were taking the concept of team spirit to
picturesque lengths. Several teams were decked out in matching
T-shirts, including the pessimistically named ``Team Hurl'' from
George Washington University. The Pomona College team, two men and
two women, had all dyed their hair deep blue.
 &HT;    The teams' projects were almost as various: One group was
studying the use of power tools in weightlessness _ something that
astronauts assembling the International Space Station later this
year will have to deal with. For instance, what's the best way to
anchor a power drill so that it's the bit that turns, rather than
the person holding the drill?
 &HT;    Another group was looking at ways of putting out a fire in
space, something that's trickier than you might think. In zero
gravity, water from a sprinkler system, for example, wouldn't fall
``down'' but would have to be directed at the flames under
pressure.
 &HT;    Another team would observe how goldfish in a sealed tank reacted
to the absence of gravity: Would they swim cheerfully and
omnidirectionally or fishily freak out as they lost their moorings?
 &HT;    Like commercial airline passengers, the students can't fly till
they've had their safety instructions. NASA's version, though, is a
bit more complicated than the flight attendant's memorized spiel:
It starts with a full day of lectures, attendance required, on
dealing with sudden decompression and moves on to the high-altitude
chamber for a sample of actual oxygen deprivation.
 &HT;    Decompression _ a loss of the cabin air pressure that makes
high-altitude flight survivable _ can happen in any airplane, as
passengers are reminded before every flight. But on a commercial
flight, you're strapped in inches from the oxygen mask. On the
KC-135, passengers could be anywhere in the 61-foot-long empty
cabin, far from the seats in the rear, where the oxygen masks are
stowed, if a decompression occurs. They need to know how to
recognize the confusion that signals oxygen deprivation, or
hypoxia, before it's too late to respond.
 &HT;    There are other uncomfortable effects of decompression too, the
lecturers explain: Gas will expand to several times its original
volume, so it's important to avoid gas-producing foods before the
flight _ and, in the unlikely event of a decompression, not to be
shy about relieving a sudden pressure buildup.
 &HT;    Burke Fort, the lanky and genial director of the program,
explains that the altitude chamber would simulate suddenly being
transported to a 24,000-foot mountaintop. Even experienced
mountaineers require weeks of acclimatization to function at that
altitude, so being ``transported'' rapidly to such heights is
guaranteed to make anyone black out within minutes; the brain
simply can't get enough oxygen to keep functioning.
 &HT;    The trick _ and the purpose of the training _ is to recognize
the symptoms of impending hypoxic unconsciousness in time to get
one's oxygen mask on.
 &HT;    The chamber itself _ World War II vintage, and ``older than most
of your parents,'' as one instructor points out to the students _
is a big steel cylinder that looks a bit like a used fuel tank.
 &HT;    Originally used to train pilots, since the 1950s it has been a
testing ground for every U.S. astronaut from the Mercury and Apollo
pioneers through today's space shuttlers, as well as anyone
(including Tom Hanks and the rest of the Apollo 13 cast and crew)
planning to fly on the vomit comet.
 &HT;    On the morning of the flight, everyone assembles early at the
Ellington hangar, nervous, excited, and just a little scared.
First, there's a round of preflight briefings, and everyone is
issued a Scop-Dex capsule _ standard issue for astronauts before a

 By MICHAEL WINERIP  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was easy to tell right away, walking into the large meeting
room, that something hot was for sale and a lot was at stake.
 &HT;    A dozen eager company reps _ stylish young men and women of all
races and backgrounds _ stood behind two long tables with slick
brochures and stacks of applications in English and Spanish.
 &HT;    There were balloons and potted plants everywhere, cookies,
pastries, coffee, juices and soft drinks, a room nearby to park the
children.
 &HT;    By the time Kathleen Madigan, Ed.D, began her pitch on this
April night, it was standing room only, more than 300 Jersey City
parents. One father in the audience, Robert Silberman, was struck
by how much the meeting felt like a sales presentation at the
telecommunications company where he works, while others remarked on
the speaker's evangelical tone.
 &HT;    But what was being offered was neither cell phones nor God's
salvation. The offering to this heavily minority audience in one of
the poorest school districts in New Jersey was a free, publicly
financed education for their children at a new charter school to be
opened in September by Advantage Schools Inc., a Boston-based,
for-profit company with schools in Phoenix and Rocky Mount, N.C.
 &HT;    ``As we speak,'' began Madigan, Advantage's curriculum director,
``I have kindergartners in Phoenix and North Carolina who can tell
you the three phases of matter! ... I have 5-year-olds in North
Carolina who know where the prime meridian is! ... We have 200
instructional days, 20 more than the public schools! ... We go from
8 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon! Eight in the morning
until 3:30! ... We will have a phenomenal staff to make this a
reality. We get to choose our teachers ... We don't say it's the
child's fault, or they didn't have a good breakfast, or they came
from this kind of family.
 &HT;    ``This is how they're taught to walk down the hall,'' she said,
marching, her hands folded in front of her.
 &HT;    For an hour those parents sat, rapt, listening to one remarkable
story after another. She told them how Advantage ran a
direct-instruction school stressing basics, with teachers using
daily scripts to drill students. She showed them videos of young
black boys reading.
 &HT;    ``Our children on third level are reading the `Iliad'; in fifth
grade they read Homer's 'Odyssey.' ... Most children don't like to
rewrite. Oh no? Our children say, 'Give me one more chance! ... No
child will fall through the cracks in our school.''
 &HT;    And then she made an irresistible claim: ``Every single one of
our kindergartners in both schools is reading! Every single one! I
don't get up here and say it unless it's true.''
 &HT;    Kimlee Acosta, an employment agency worker and mother of two
boys in the public schools, was sold. She found a pay phone and
called her friend Christine Litaker, who was still at work. ``You
got to get down here,'' Acosta said. ``It's freakin' great! They're
going to start school at 8; they go to 3:30! My kids start school
at freakin' quarter to 9.''
 &HT;    India Sloane, a home health aide with a daughter entering
kindergarten, thought it sounded better than her local public
school. ``I'm going to apply her for this school,'' she said. ``It
have good qualifications for, you know, a child.''
 &HT;    That night, hundreds of Jersey City parents signed up their
children for a school that didn't have even a building or location
yet, run by a company whose entire track record is two schools,
each in existence for less than a year. The parents were willing to
take the plunge because while they didn't know fully what they were
getting into, they knew they weren't pleased with what their
children had.
 &HT;    Still, not everyone was converted. While Silberman liked it, his
wife Karen thought it sounded militaristic. ``I guess we're having
a disagreement,'' she said. And Sandra Oviedo has a son who's
having problems with math in a school that uses a similar method.
``It's not magic,'' she said.
 &HT;    Even many parents eagerly signing on the dotted line were
wondering if there really could be such a miraculous urban public
school where every kindergartner reads.
 -0- 
 &HT;    This is the cutting edge of the school-choice movement, and it
is stunning to behold because it is so radically different from
what has come before in public education, and at the same time so
much in sync with this era, when the free market is entrusted to
deliver the best public-policy choices for us all.
 &HT;    In the new education marketplace, public schools are expected to
sell themselves aggressively, and the burden of figuring out what
is real and what is hype falls not on regulators or district
bureaucrats or boards of education but on parents. During the
question period at that April meeting, Carlos Garcia asked what
kind of guarantees went with all the company's promises.
 &HT;    ``What happens if my child does fall by the wayside?'' Garcia
asked. ``I'm having that now, in another charter school.''
 &HT;    ``You're asking what recourse you have if we don't do what we
say,'' Madigan responded. ``I don't have a good answer for you. If
this school doesn't do it, you tell other people and we don't keep
in business.''
 &HT;    In short: Let the buyer beware.
 &HT;    Each new school year brings more charters, and that in turn is
pressuring public schools to sell themselves harder. Since 1991,
when Minnesota passed the first charter legislation, 32 other
states, including New Jersey (but not New York), have followed
suit. There are currently 786 charter schools in America, with 400
to 500 more expected this fall.
 &HT;    They tend to be in big cities, but exist in suburbs and rural
areas too, varying enormously in philosophy and quality. While most
are run on a nonprofit basis, started by parents and educators,
there are also about a dozen for-profit charter companies,
including Edison, the best known, which will have 48 schools by
fall, and Advantage, which will have 7 or 8.
 &HT;    The movement has attracted support across the spectrum, from
conservative businessmen like Steven Wilson, a founder of
Advantage, to liberal public educators like Deborah Meier, who
created the widely admired Central Park East public school in
Harlem in the 1970s and recently started her own charter in Boston.
 &HT;    In Jersey City alone _ where six charters have been approved _
there is one started by white yuppies and one by the Urban League.
There are charters that stress basics, and there is the Learning
Community charter, which uses the Bank Street model and has a
principal who warns parents that there will be little homework and
no textbooks. When Kiwan Fitch is asked what she likes about that
charter, she mentions the time her kindergartner, Brandon,
dissected a fish.
 &HT;    Anyone in New Jersey who wants to start one _ parents, teachers,
professors, businesspeople _ submits a plan to the state. If the
state approves, then that plan _ the charter _ becomes the
blueprint for the school. A charter school is free and open to any
child who lives within the public-school district where the charter
school is located. Typically, too many children want to attend and
a lottery is held.
 &HT;    Financing is all tax dollars, and that is where the competition
comes in, where things turn nasty. Nearly every dollar that goes to
a charter is subtracted from that district's public schools.
 &HT;    Jersey City public schools currently receive about $7,000 from
the state and city for each child educated. When a charter opens,
it receives most of that $7,000 per child enrolled and the public
school loses that $7,000 per child.
 &HT;    So Advantage's charter, with 500 students, would receive close
to $3.5 million in public funds that would have otherwise gone to
Jersey City public schools. The numbers make it easy to understand
the hard sell at that April meeting. Every family could bring in at
least $7,000 to Advantage Schools Inc.; Acosta's two sons were
worth a cool $14,000.
 &HT;    Nor are public-school districts sitting by quietly as their
funds and motivated students are skimmed off. Of 23 new charters
approved this year in New Jersey, 14 faced legal challenges, most
claiming they were an unfair economic drain.
 &HT;    Supporters of school choice say that rather than being hurt,
good public schools will rise to the market challenge and improve.
And you can see some of that in Jersey City, at schools such as
P.S.16, where the principal and parents are also out selling their
school hard. Fortunately, P.S. 16 has lots to sell: It's a small
school in a handsome old building in a gentrifying neighborhood of
brownstones, with a poor yet upwardly mobile immigrant population
whose children have some of the city's best test scores.
 &HT;    The problem with school choice is what happens to schools that
have nothing to sell, schools left behind after the most-motivated
families have made their choices and moved on.
 &HT;    P.S. 39 is widely regarded as Jersey City's worst elementary
school, a large, dark building at the end of a dead-end street
surrounded by a 25-foot-high chain-link fence that makes it look
like Riker's Island. The school has the city's lowest test scores
and the most poor children, 94 percent qualifying for free lunches,
many living on welfare in the Duncan Avenue projects. Midyear, the
principal resigned. The week I visited, fights frequently broke
out; the lunchroom was in chaos.
 &HT;    The stereotype of bad inner-city schools is overcrowded classes,
but so many parents work hard to get their children elsewhere _
whether a charter, a Catholic school or, by using a fake address, a
better public school _ that at P.S. 39 average class size is
actually small, 21.
 &HT;    At P.S. 39, in Laurie Ralph's third grade this year, a girl
named Fathema often screamed, rolled on the floor like a dog and
fought, making it impossible to accomplish anything some days.
There were times the veteran teacher broke down crying.
 &HT;    Fathema's mother, Peggy Smith, 30, says she doesn't know how to
handle her daughter either. One thing is certain: Smith won't be
signing up her five children (three of them in special education)
for a charter. She had never heard of charters. ``I don't know too
much about them,'' she says.
 &HT;    This year's Jersey City Teacher of the Year is from P.S. 39,
Jerri O'Brien-Cass. She works long hours and learns about the
personal problems her third graders face at home so she can help
them better. For one boy who can't read and is failing, she sent
home 17 notes requesting a parent conference _ with no response.
 &HT;    P.S. 39 is on the losing side of the school-choice debate, and
it enrages the teacher of the year.
 &HT;    ``If my best students, my Schnelle and my Phillip, are going off
to charter schools, God bless them _ let them go if it gives them
better lives,'' she says. ``But that makes us like a prison. We'll
be the Last Stop Incarceration Public School.''
 &HT;    The answer from school choicers would be if P.S. 39 doesn't
work, get rid of it and let the children of the Duncan Avenue
projects choose among the city's best schools. In fact, Jersey City
children can leave their neighborhood school and pick another if
that other school's principal signs a waiver saying there is room.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, most Jersey City schools are overcrowded, and
schools in the more upscale neighborhoods are the most overcrowded.
Those schools, which also have the top test scores, such as P.S.
27, P.S. 38 and P.S. 6, average 30 students in first grade. And
Jersey City's mayor, Bret Schundler, who is a national leader of
the school-choice movement and regularly disparages his city's
public schools (''They're a failure,'' he said), is not much help.
 &HT;    While the state has tripled its annual aid to Jersey City
schools in the last decade, the city's contribution has shrunk from
$91 million in 1990 to $72 million this year. Schundler recently
used his political clout ($34 million in city bonding power) not
for public schools but to finance six new buildings to be occupied
by charter schools. This diversion of resources is public
educators' worst fear.
 &HT;    Yet the school-choice debate is most importantly about how to
design an effective public system to educate poor children, as
Meier, the progressive educator, argues in ``The Power of Their
Ideas.'' The middle and upper classes, she points out, have always
enjoyed school choice. If they don't like their public school, they
can choose a private school or move to a suburb.
 &HT;    Indeed, in the 1960s and '70s, thousands of white ethnic Jersey
City families exercised choice by moving to suburbia. Today, Jersey
City, the state's second largest district, has 32,000 mainly
minority children _ a mix of Hispanics (38 percent) and
African-Americans (41 percent), along with immigrants.
 &HT;    In 1989, the state took over Jersey City's public schools and
still controls them, the longest-running takeover of a failing
system in the nation. Of 39 charters approved in New Jersey since
1996, when the Republican governor, Christine Todd Whitman, won
passage of enabling legislation, Jersey City has 6, second only to
Trenton.
 &HT;    Jersey City's Schundler has been a vocal school-choice advocate.
He is a popular Republican in a Democratic city, a 39-year-old
Harvard-educated bond salesman turned politician with a reputation
as an urban reformer. The shift in Schundler's focus in recent
years from vouchers to charters reflects a national switch by
Republicans that has helped bring the choice movement into the
mainstream.
 &HT;    The Clinton administration, always quick to jump on a popular
Republican idea, has been giving grants of up to $100,000 to
charters to hire community outreach staffs to attract students.
 &HT;    But even in the glow of newness, problems have surfaced in
Jersey City. Significantly, after nine years of state takeover
there, with all the innovations, if you look at the test results
for the 27 elementary schools, the school with the most
middle-class kids, P.S. 27 (63 percent free lunches), is at the
top, and the poorest school, P.S. 39 (94 percent free lunches), is
at the bottom.
 &HT;    And there is considerable correlation: The more free lunches,
the lower the test scores. The exceptions are schools such as P.S.
16 (84 percent free lunches) dominated by immigrants. While poor in
this country, they often came from middle-class backgrounds in
their homelands.
 &HT;    When I asked to meet a top eighth grader at P.S. 39 _ a
predominantly African-American school with many second-generation
welfare families _ the guidance counselor introduced me to Edward
Adu Jr.
 &HT;    Edward's family immigrated to Jersey City two years ago from
Africa. He is the P.S. 39 valedictorian and the only child accepted
to attend Academic High next year, Jersey City's elite high school.
 &HT;    In Ghana, his father was a skilled mechanic, and Edward attended
a private school where he took 13 subjects a day, learning English
and several other languages on top of his native Twi. He knows
little of America beyond P.S. 39. While he has stood on Jersey
City's docks and looked across the Hudson to Manhattan's
skyscrapers, he has never visited there.
 &HT;    When asked what has surprised him about America, he says, ``It
seems the schools in Africa are better than here.''

 By MICHAEL WINERIP  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was easy to tell right away, walking into the large meeting
room, that something hot was for sale and a lot was at stake.
 &HT;    A dozen eager company reps _ stylish young men and women of all
races and backgrounds _ stood behind two long tables with slick
brochures and stacks of applications in English and Spanish.
 &HT;    There were balloons and potted plants everywhere, cookies,
pastries, coffee, juices and soft drinks, a room nearby to park the
children.
 &HT;    By the time Kathleen Madigan, Ed.D, began her pitch on this
April night, it was standing room only, more than 300 Jersey City
parents. One father in the audience, Robert Silberman, was struck
by how much the meeting felt like a sales presentation at the
telecommunications company where he works, while others remarked on
the speaker's evangelical tone.
 &HT;    But what was being offered was neither cell phones nor God's
salvation. The offering to this heavily minority audience in one of
the poorest school districts in New Jersey was a free, publicly
financed education for their children at a new charter school to be
opened in September by Advantage Schools Inc., a Boston-based,
for-profit company with schools in Phoenix and Rocky Mount, N.C.
 &HT;    ``As we speak,'' began Madigan, Advantage's curriculum director,
``I have kindergartners in Phoenix and North Carolina who can tell
you the three phases of matter! ... I have 5-year-olds in North
Carolina who know where the prime meridian is! ... We have 200
instructional days, 20 more than the public schools! ... We go from
8 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon! Eight in the morning
until 3:30! ... We will have a phenomenal staff to make this a
reality. We get to choose our teachers ... We don't say it's the
child's fault, or they didn't have a good breakfast, or they came
from this kind of family.
 &HT;    ``This is how they're taught to walk down the hall,'' she said,
marching, her hands folded in front of her.
 &HT;    For an hour those parents sat, rapt, listening to one remarkable
story after another. She told them how Advantage ran a
direct-instruction school stressing basics, with teachers using
daily scripts to drill students. She showed them videos of young
black boys reading.
 &HT;    ``Our children on third level are reading the `Iliad'; in fifth
grade they read Homer's 'Odyssey.' ... Most children don't like to
rewrite. Oh no? Our children say, 'Give me one more chance! ... No
child will fall through the cracks in our school.''
 &HT;    And then she made an irresistible claim: ``Every single one of
our kindergartners in both schools is reading! Every single one! I
don't get up here and say it unless it's true.''
 &HT;    Kimlee Acosta, an employment agency worker and mother of two
boys in the public schools, was sold. She found a pay phone and
called her friend Christine Litaker, who was still at work. ``You
got to get down here,'' Acosta said. ``It's freakin' great! They're
going to start school at 8; they go to 3:30! My kids start school
at freakin' quarter to 9.''
 &HT;    India Sloane, a home health aide with a daughter entering
kindergarten, thought it sounded better than her local public
school. ``I'm going to apply her for this school,'' she said. ``It
have good qualifications for, you know, a child.''
 &HT;    That night, hundreds of Jersey City parents signed up their
children for a school that didn't have even a building or location
yet, run by a company whose entire track record is two schools,
each in existence for less than a year. The parents were willing to
take the plunge because while they didn't know fully what they were
getting into, they knew they weren't pleased with what their
children had.
 &HT;    Still, not everyone was converted. While Silberman liked it, his
wife Karen thought it sounded militaristic. ``I guess we're having
a disagreement,'' she said. And Sandra Oviedo has a son who's
having problems with math in a school that uses a similar method.
``It's not magic,'' she said.
 &HT;    Even many parents eagerly signing on the dotted line were
wondering if there really could be such a miraculous urban public
school where every kindergartner reads.
 -0- 
 &HT;    This is the cutting edge of the school-choice movement, and it
is stunning to behold because it is so radically different from
what has come before in public education, and at the same time so
much in sync with this era, when the free market is entrusted to
deliver the best public-policy choices for us all.
 &HT;    In the new education marketplace, public schools are expected to
sell themselves aggressively, and the burden of figuring out what
is real and what is hype falls not on regulators or district
bureaucrats or boards of education but on parents. During the
question period at that April meeting, Carlos Garcia asked what
kind of guarantees went with all the company's promises.
 &HT;    ``What happens if my child does fall by the wayside?'' Garcia
asked. ``I'm having that now, in another charter school.''
 &HT;    ``You're asking what recourse you have if we don't do what we
say,'' Madigan responded. ``I don't have a good answer for you. If
this school doesn't do it, you tell other people and we don't keep
in business.''
 &HT;    In short: Let the buyer beware.
 &HT;    Each new school year brings more charters, and that in turn is
pressuring public schools to sell themselves harder. Since 1991,
when Minnesota passed the first charter legislation, 32 other
states, including New Jersey (but not New York), have followed
suit. There are currently 786 charter schools in America, with 400
to 500 more expected this fall.
 &HT;    They tend to be in big cities, but exist in suburbs and rural
areas too, varying enormously in philosophy and quality. While most
are run on a nonprofit basis, started by parents and educators,
there are also about a dozen for-profit charter companies,
including Edison, the best known, which will have 48 schools by
fall, and Advantage, which will have 7 or 8.
 &HT;    The movement has attracted support across the spectrum, from
conservative businessmen like Steven Wilson, a founder of
Advantage, to liberal public educators like Deborah Meier, who
created the widely admired Central Park East public school in
Harlem in the 1970s and recently started her own charter in Boston.
 &HT;    In Jersey City alone _ where six charters have been approved _
there is one started by white yuppies and one by the Urban League.
There are charters that stress basics, and there is the Learning
Community charter, which uses the Bank Street model and has a
principal who warns parents that there will be little homework and
no textbooks. When Kiwan Fitch is asked what she likes about that
charter, she mentions the time her kindergartner, Brandon,
dissected a fish.
 &HT;    Anyone in New Jersey who wants to start one _ parents, teachers,
professors, businesspeople _ submits a plan to the state. If the
state approves, then that plan _ the charter _ becomes the
blueprint for the school. A charter school is free and open to any
child who lives within the public-school district where the charter
school is located. Typically, too many children want to attend and
a lottery is held.
 &HT;    Financing is all tax dollars, and that is where the competition
comes in, where things turn nasty. Nearly every dollar that goes to
a charter is subtracted from that district's public schools.
 &HT;    Jersey City public schools currently receive about $7,000 from
the state and city for each child educated. When a charter opens,
it receives most of that $7,000 per child enrolled and the public
school loses that $7,000 per child.
 &HT;    So Advantage's charter, with 500 students, would receive close
to $3.5 million in public funds that would have otherwise gone to
Jersey City public schools. The numbers make it easy to understand
the hard sell at that April meeting. Every family could bring in at
least $7,000 to Advantage Schools Inc.; Acosta's two sons were
worth a cool $14,000.
 &HT;    Nor are public-school districts sitting by quietly as their
funds and motivated students are skimmed off. Of 23 new charters
approved this year in New Jersey, 14 faced legal challenges, most
claiming they were an unfair economic drain.
 &HT;    Supporters of school choice say that rather than being hurt,
good public schools will rise to the market challenge and improve.
And you can see some of that in Jersey City, at schools such as
P.S.16, where the principal and parents are also out selling their
school hard. Fortunately, P.S. 16 has lots to sell: It's a small
school in a handsome old building in a gentrifying neighborhood of
brownstones, with a poor yet upwardly mobile immigrant population
whose children have some of the city's best test scores.
 &HT;    The problem with school choice is what happens to schools that
have nothing to sell, schools left behind after the most-motivated
families have made their choices and moved on.
 &HT;    P.S. 39 is widely regarded as Jersey City's worst elementary
school, a large, dark building at the end of a dead-end street
surrounded by a 25-foot-high chain-link fence that makes it look
like Riker's Island. The school has the city's lowest test scores
and the most poor children, 94 percent qualifying for free lunches,
many living on welfare in the Duncan Avenue projects. Midyear, the
principal resigned. The week I visited, fights frequently broke

personal problems her third graders face at home so she can help
them better. For one boy who can't read and is failing, she sent
home 17 notes requesting a parent conference _ with no response.

it enrages the teacher of the year.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``One of the neat things about being a commander,'' says Lt.
Col. Curtis L. Brown Jr., ``is when you take rookies into space and
you see their face after the main engine shutdown and you're in
orbit. You never forget that.''
 &HT;    In October, if all goes as planned, Brown will fly his fifth
shuttle mission with one crew member who may have that same look,
not from the novelty of the experience but from distant memory.
 &HT;    If Charles Lindbergh had climbed into a cockpit two years before
Ronald Reagan became president, he would have been 77, the age John
Glenn will be when he makes his second spaceflight. Indeed, to
understand the peculiarity of this flight, it helps to do one more
piece of math: We are now further away in time from Glenn's first
mission than that mission was from Lindbergh's solo flight across
the Atlantic.
 &HT;    On Feb. 20, 1962, Glenn flew over a country with 80 million
fewer people than it has today, a land without ZIP codes and
throughout which three-quarters of the households still contained
both husbands and wives. Most of the wives were home that day, and
about the time Friendship 7 was rounding out its third orbit some
of the husbands were rounding into a third martini at lunch.
 &HT;    The record store down the street from the possibly segregated
hotel had yet to stock a Beatles album. Had the astronaut possessed
a more powerful periscope than he did, he still could not have
picked out a St. Louis arch or a World Trade Center to serve as a
guidepost below.
 &HT;    Not even Telstar, the early communications satellite, was in the
heavens to block his path. The capsule's progress through the skies
was relayed by teletype from one tracking station to another.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' says Gene Kranz, the legendary controller who was
directing the flight that morning, ``probably the most advanced
technology we worked with was the Atlantic cable, which had just
been relaid in 1956.''
 &HT;    After five hours, Friendship 7, not much bigger than the
Stratoloungers poised before millions of black-and-white TV sets
below, retrorocketed back to Earth. And as it roared through the
atmosphere like ``a real fireball,'' in the pilot's own calm words,
no one knew for certain that its heat shield wasn't about to fall
off.
 &HT;    A young but edgy country, with no idea of the decade it was
about to live through, leapt from its chairs and crowed over the
man who finally splashed down in the Atlantic. For the next several
weeks it heaped gratitude, relief and sheer unjaded delight on the
honest-to-God hero _ and regular fellow _ who had made this wild,
necessary ride.
 &HT;    When it came time for his ticker-tape parade, there was actual
ticker tape to fling through the windows.
 -0- 
 &HT;    A middle-age visitor to John Glenn's Senate office - one who
remembers Feb. 20, 1962, as a 10-year-old, and whose
elementary-school autograph book still bears the entry ``My hero is
John Glenn'' on a prefatory page _ finds it difficult even to ask
the question, Is this shuttle flight perhaps a reward for the
senator's unexpectedly partisan behavior during last year's
campaign-finance hearings?
 &HT;    After all, Bill Clinton is not without a say in NASA affairs,
and more than one observer saw Glenn acting as ``White House
defense counsel'' against the probings of Sen. Fred Thompson and
the Republican majority.
 &HT;    ``It's not true,'' Glenn says. ``I had not one single
conversation with the president or the vice president or any of the
people from the White House.'' The idea of sending an older person
into space has so much scientific validity that ``even if I wasn't
involved, I would be backing that,'' he insists, adding that he
would urge that they ``send somebody else.''
 &HT;    For all its public-relations value to NASA _ this is the biggest
manned-space story in years _ Glenn sticks resolutely to
medical-research terms in discussing his mission's origin and
meaning. His wife Annie says that ``he's always wanted to go'' back
into space.
 &HT;    But after a three-decade political hiatus, what requalified him
was, oddly enough, getting old. Glenn, who has long served on the
Senate's Special Committee on Aging, was in his late 60s when he
sat down one weekend with a Merck manual on geriatrics and another
book called ``Space Physiology and Medicine,'' one of whose
authors, Dr. Arnauld E. Nicogossian, is now the associate
administrator of NASA's Division of Life and Microgravity Sciences
and Applications.
 &HT;    Looking through the manual, Glenn was struck by how many of the
natural processes of aging ``right here on Earth occur to the
younger people in their 30s, 40s and early 50s up there in space.''
 &HT;    The list included cardiovascular changes, immune-system
alterations and loss of bone density and muscle mass. Geriatric
research, he realized, was his ticket back into space. The next
step was to convince NASA to reserve him a seat.
 &HT;    As it happens, by the late 1980s, NASA researchers and
representatives of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) were also
discussing what they started calling ``parallel processes.''
 &HT;    Glenn made known his own interest, and kept pushing the issue in
dozens of discussions with gerontologists and NASA administrators.
Finally _ after what some say was considerable lobbying on his part
_ came this January's announcement of his place on shuttle mission
STS (Space Transportation System)-95.
 &HT;    For 10 weightless days, Glenn will subject himself to a marathon
of geriatric experimentation. He will take pills to measure his
protein production, receive injections to calibrate the atrophy of
muscle and swallow miniature thermometers to help measure
temperature fluctuations during sleep.
 &HT;    He gives every sign of approaching these tests with the same
studiousness he exhibited toward all the esoteric physical
humiliations (the feet-in-ice-water test, for example) that
accompanied the first astronaut selections at the Wright Air
Development Center in Ohio 40 years ago.
 &HT;    His quick, soft speech betrays no diminished alertness. It is
only when you walk behind him, or fix your gaze on his right eye,
slightly more hooded than the left, that you can credit the idea
that this man is closer to 80 than 70.
 &HT;    It's a good thing he is, too, or he might not have got his new
assignment. Story Musgrave, who retired from the astronaut corps in
1997 at age 62 after six shuttle flights, objected to the idea of
Glenn's going even before it was official: ``I stayed with the
space program and made it my career. He left 33 years ago and went
into politics.''
 &HT;    But from the gerontological point of view, Musgrave simply isn't
old enough for this mission. ``When we talked out at NIA about
this,'' Glenn says, ``they felt that the most productive assessment
will be done on somebody between 75 and 80. And I didn't suggest
that _ they suggested that. I'm the oldest used astronaut, I
guess.''
 &HT;    At the other end of the age spectrum, skeptical and even angry
postings started appearing right after the January announcement on
a Web site used by astronaut hopefuls: ``That's completely uncool
to let him jump in line like that for STS-95. Just because you can
fly a little ol' Mercury capsule around the Earth three times,
doesn't mean you should be bumped into a prime 10-day mission.
Sheesh.''
 &HT;    Jokes began immediately (Jay Leno said there would be no space
walk on STS-95 because NASA feared Glenn might ``wander off''), and
there were some dismaying editorials. The flight assignment was
``Nostalgia in Orbit'' to The New York Times, and ``the orbital
equivalent of the Lincoln Bedroom'' to an op-ed writer in USA
Today.
 &HT;    Some biologists expressed doubt about the usefulness of whatever
data Glenn would generate, and even a few of the thumbs-ups he got
were for the idea's inspirational, not scientific, value. At most,
Glenn is establishing a starting point for further geriatric
research. He has admitted that ``one person does not a database
make.''
 &HT;    But as John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at
George Washington University, cheerfully adds, ``One person a
database starts.'' And maybe, Glenn says, this ``opens up'' things
for some of the other veterans.
 &HT;    When asked about Glenn's impending return to space, his close
Project Mercury friend Scott Carpenter, a lean and very fit 73,
smiles and says: ''I told him I'm going to be his backup again. And
this time he's going to come down with something.''
 &HT;    If Glenn is the only septuagenarian to go up, even his single
shot is likely to provide a psychological lift for senior citizens.
 &HT;    ``I think it's great,'' says Bob Dole, Glenn's longtime Senate
colleague and himself a recent medical test-subject, for the
anti-impotence drug Viagra. ``I think it probably gets people out
of their chairs'' and ``shows you never get too old to do these
things.''
 &HT;    In Glenn's case, the flight returns him not so much to his prime
as to his earliest ambition.
 &HT;    ``If World War II hadn't come along,'' Annie Glenn says, ``he
was either going to be a medical doctor or go into medical
research.'' Here at last, in fate's roundabout way, comes his
chance.
 -0- 
 &HT;    The Johnson Space Center these days has the tranquil look of a
state university. Birdsong floats over its clipped lawns and boxy
midcentury buildings; some 1960's rockets, including a Saturn, sit
off in a grassy corner like old football trophies too big for a
display case.
 &HT;    When most of the Original Seven (Glenn was the oldest) were
flying their missions, the center was still under construction for
space personnel being transferred from Langley Research Center in
Virginia.
 &HT;    The new seven among whom Glenn spends time these days are
``about half-again smarter than we ever thought of being back
then,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``They're better educated, and they're deeper into science.''
They're certainly a more diverse lot than the brush-cut,
all-Protestant test pilots introduced to the country in 1959. Along
with Pedro Duque, a European Space Agency astronaut from Spain, the
STS-95 crew includes Chiaki Mukai, a medical doctor who four years
ago became the first Japanese woman to go into space.
 &HT;    If back in 1959, at their first news conference, Glenn did all
he could to stand out from the six other astronauts _ famously
raising two hands when a reporter asked which of the men thought
they would safely return to Earth _ 40 years later he is doing his
best to blend in. Except for an occasional lapse, he's ``John,''
not ``Senator Glenn,'' to the rest of the crew.
 &HT;    On a Friday afternoon in April, wearing the same blue knit shirt
as everyone else, he sits down at a conference-room table and, when
a visitor starts asking questions, easily defers to Brown.
 &HT;    Two of Glenn's crewmates are doctors, and one of these is a
specialist in emergency medicine. But that's not, they all insist,
from any anxiety about an older-than-usual astronaut's being on
board. Glenn points out that Mukai was assigned to STS-95 more than
a year ago, and Scott Parazynski, the other doctor, notes that two
doctors is ``actually par for the course'' for this kind of
``life-sciences emphasis'' flight.
 &HT;    With his busy senatorial schedule, Glenn will be in Houston for
some long weekends, spent 10 days there around Memorial Day and
will spend another 10 there around the Fourth of July, the whole
month of August and then most of the five or six weeks before the
flight.
 &HT;    Christopher Kraft, the retired but still no-nonsense flight
director of Project Mercury, who counts Glenn a close friend, says
that with all his obligations, Glenn's problem now is time: ``He
doesn't want to make a fool of himself. He's got to spend enough
time on it to know what the emergency procedures are.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, even if Discovery goes through a fraction of the
catastrophes that controllers keep simulating for Brown and his
cockpit crew, Glenn won't be part of the emergency improvisations.
In fact, he won't be on the flight deck at all. He'll be below, on
Discovery's middeck.
 &HT;    In the early days of the space program, the astronauts insisted
that they be pilots, not passengers _ to be more than the chimps
who preceded them aloft. Glenn knows that regardless of the other
tasks he has been assigned (he's in charge of the photo equipment
and works with some experiments that don't involve his own
biology), he is on STS-95 essentially to accept punishment to his
aging body _ to be, in short, the monkey.
 &HT;    As ironies go, this one is more noble than cheap. Glenn jokes
that his bald head is perfectly designed for the electrodes that it
is already being fitted with, and he knows that 10 days of
weightlessness, some of it free-floating, may induce not only a
loss of muscle and bone but also nausea _ certainly more of it than
he ever had the chance to experience during five hours strapped
into the seat of Friendship 7.
 &HT;    The serious risk to Glenn's health may not be very great, but
the exhaustion is likely to be considerable, and no one at NASA
wants the most memorable photo of STS-95 to be one of Glenn being
carried off the orbiter on a stretcher.
 &HT;    The toll this flight may take on Glenn's status as cultural
legend is probably even less predictable. His return to space could
play out like a lackluster movie sequel, diminishing memories of
the long-ago flight that made him such an icon, and NASA's PR coup
could backfire if Glenn's return only adds to the nostalgia that
dominates public consciousness of the space program.
 &HT;    But the hotels around Cape Canaveral are already booked solid
for Oct. 29, and Brown, who says his mother usually greets his
mission assignments with quiet resignation, got a very different
reaction when he telephoned in February to tell her about this one:
``Is that the flight with Senator Glenn on it?''
 &HT;    ``Well, yeah.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, great!''
 &HT;    Whatever reminiscence it provokes, Glenn's flight will also
begin one entirely forward-looking enterprise: the movement of
civilians into space.
 &HT;    And, oddly enough, it will be Glenn, a plumber's son who became
so mythic that John F. Kennedy was disinclined to risk putting him
on another flight, who may get NASA past the most lingering trauma
of Challenger, the death of Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher.
The agency picked the moment of its announcement about Glenn to
declare that Barbara Morgan, the teacher who trained as McAuliffe's
backup a dozen years ago, has been accepted into the next group of
regular astronaut trainees.
 &HT;    At the mention of this ``civilian'' business, Glenn fairly rolls
his eyes. ``I don't know what they think I am,'' he says. ``I spent
a career in the military. I was in the space program. They're not
gettin' a new boy.''
 &HT;    What is Glenn's biggest anxiety about this mission? He'll be
thinking in the same quiet, right-stuff italics he did on Feb. 20,
1962. ``My main concern,'' he says, ``is that I just not mess up.''
 &HT;    As she watches him lift off, his wife Annie will be quietly
resurrecting the attitude with which she waited out World War II,
Korea, test-piloting at Patuxent River and Project Mercury:
``John's like a cat with nine lives.'' If something happens, she
will ``always live with the idea that John went the way John would
like to. That's been my way of life, I think.''
 &HT;    This fall, when the Discovery takes Glenn back into space, the
science and public relations of STS-95 will drop away with the
shuttle's rocket boosters. This is especially so for the minority
of Americans old enough to recall Feb. 20, 1962 _ and for those
oldest citizens whose physical needs are the official justification
for Glenn's place on the flight.
 &HT;    At launch, emotion will trump all the mission's other meanings,
and anyone who has made the last 36 trips around the Sun with Glenn
will care about this aging astronaut for the same reason we cared
about Everest and the Moon: because he's there.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``One of the neat things about being a commander,'' says Lt.
Col. Curtis L. Brown Jr., ``is when you take rookies into space and
you see their face after the main engine shutdown and you're in
orbit. You never forget that.''
 &HT;    In October, if all goes as planned, Brown will fly his fifth
shuttle mission with one crew member who may have that same look,
not from the novelty of the experience but from distant memory.
 &HT;    If Charles Lindbergh had climbed into a cockpit two years before
Ronald Reagan became president, he would have been 77, the age John
Glenn will be when he makes his second spaceflight. Indeed, to
understand the peculiarity of this flight, it helps to do one more
piece of math: We are now further away in time from Glenn's first
mission than that mission was from Lindbergh's solo flight across
the Atlantic.
 &HT;    On Feb. 20, 1962, Glenn flew over a country with 80 million
fewer people than it has today, a land without ZIP codes and
throughout which three-quarters of the households still contained
both husbands and wives. Most of the wives were home that day, and
about the time Friendship 7 was rounding out its third orbit some
of the husbands were rounding into a third martini at lunch.
 &HT;    The record store down the street from the possibly segregated
hotel had yet to stock a Beatles album. Had the astronaut possessed
a more powerful periscope than he did, he still could not have
picked out a St. Louis arch or a World Trade Center to serve as a
guidepost below.
 &HT;    Not even Telstar, the early communications satellite, was in the
heavens to block his path. The capsule's progress through the skies
was relayed by teletype from one tracking station to another.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' says Gene Kranz, the legendary controller who was
directing the flight that morning, ``probably the most advanced
technology we worked with was the Atlantic cable, which had just
been relaid in 1956.''
 &HT;    After five hours, Friendship 7, not much bigger than the
Stratoloungers poised before millions of black-and-white TV sets
below, retrorocketed back to Earth. And as it roared through the
atmosphere like ``a real fireball,'' in the pilot's own calm words,
no one knew for certain that its heat shield wasn't about to fall
off.
 &HT;    A young but edgy country, with no idea of the decade it was
about to live through, leapt from its chairs and crowed over the
man who finally splashed down in the Atlantic. For the next several
weeks it heaped gratitude, relief and sheer unjaded delight on the
honest-to-God hero _ and regular fellow _ who had made this wild,
necessary ride.

 &HT;    A middle-age visitor to John Glenn's Senate office - one who
remembers Feb. 20, 1962, as a 10-year-old, and whose
elementary-school autograph book still bears the entry ``My hero is
John Glenn'' on a prefatory page _ finds it difficult even to ask
the question, Is this shuttle flight perhaps a reward for the
senator's unexpectedly partisan behavior during last year's

 &HT;    And, oddly enough, it will be Glenn, a plumber's son who became
so mythic that John F. Kennedy was disinclined to risk putting him
on another flight, who may get NASA past the most lingering trauma
of Challenger, the death of Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher.
The agency picked the moment of its announcement about Glenn to
declare that Barbara Morgan, the teacher who trained as McAuliffe's
backup a dozen years ago, has been accepted into the next group of
regular astronaut trainees.
 &HT;    At the mention of this ``civilian'' business, Glenn fairly rolls
his eyes. ``I don't know what they think I am,'' he says. ``I spent
a career in the military. I was in the space program. They're not
gettin' a new boy.''
 &HT;    What is Glenn's biggest anxiety about this mission? He'll be
thinking in the same quiet, right-stuff italics he did on Feb. 20,
1962. ``My main concern,'' he says, ``is that I just not mess up.''
 &HT;    As she watches him lift off, his wife Annie will be quietly
resurrecting the attitude with which she waited out World War II,
Korea, test-piloting at Patuxent River and Project Mercury:
``John's like a cat with nine lives.'' If something happens, she
will ``always live with the idea that John went the way John would
like to. That's been my way of life, I think.''
 &HT;    This fall, when the Discovery takes Glenn back into space, the
science and public relations of STS-95 will drop away with the
shuttle's rocket boosters. This is especially so for the minority
of Americans old enough to recall Feb. 20, 1962 _ and for those
oldest citizens whose physical needs are the official justification
for Glenn's place on the flight.
 &HT;    At launch, emotion will trump all the mission's other meanings,
and anyone who has made the last 36 trips around the Sun with Glenn
will care about this aging astronaut for the same reason we cared
about Everest and the Moon: because he's there.

 By CHARLES McGRATH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Pretend for a minute that you're an alien, sent to Earth to
assess its suitability for takeover.
 &HT;    Right away you'd notice that the black earthlings and the white
earthlings tend to live apart; that they both worship particularly
large earthlings in open-air stadiums and that earthlings residing
outside the crowded urban centers broil sacrificial meats on little
outdoor altars.
 &HT;    Eventually you'd pick up on smaller, possibly more significant
things _ Sunday evening, for example, and how in many households as
the hour of 9 approaches, the eating utensils are quickly and
ceremoniously cleansed and stored and the younger offspring are
clothed in loose-fitting cotton garments and then made to lie
dormant in darkened chambers, while the elders and the proto-elders
(many of them adorned with bits of metal on their teeth) drift into
their communications centers, as if in answer to the eerie
whistling music now emanating from their cathode-ray scopes, and
for the next 60 minutes or so remain motionless, enraptured, while
contemplating images of other earthlings engaged in negotiations
with ... aliens just like you, with the same long spatulate
fingers, the same greenish ichor coursing through their cooling
systems!
 &HT;    In such a case, you'd probably conclude that you had arrived too
late, and that the earthlings had already been colonized.
 &HT;    Such a weekly visitation does in fact take place in 90-odd
countries all over the globe. The force behind it is the Fox-TV
network and the producers of ``The X-Files.'' In five seasons, this
offbeat sci-fi series has more than doubled its ratings, and is now
watched by almost 20 million households (making it television's
third most popular drama), not counting those who also tune in to
the nightly reruns of old episodes.
 &HT;    But mere television-watching isn't the half of it. As Andy
Meisler, author of Volume 3 of ``The Official Guide to the
X-Files,'' one of a half-dozen or so reference books spawned by the
show, has said, ``You sometimes get the feeling that the actual
show is just an excuse for all the other stuff.''
 &HT;    The other stuff is the stuff that cults are made of. There are
now more than a thousand Web sites devoted to ``The X-Files,'' many
of them emitting the ozone whiff of spaciness that pervades the
show _ which is essentially about a shadowy department of the FBI
devoted to investigating extraterrestrials and paranormal
occurrences.
 &HT;    Among the sites are dozens specializing in ``fan fiction'' _
short stories that invent new plots and scenes for the show's two
main characters, the FBI agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder _ and
even a feverish subgroup preoccupied with getting these two, whose
relationship on screen is famously platonic, into bed together.
 &HT;    There is also a Web site that collects sound files from the show
that, when played backward, turn out to reveal hidden meaning.
``Mulder, why can't you just accept the facts?'' for example, in
reverse becomes: ``Sky of fruit baskets with the
8-year-little-old'' _ an unmistakable reference, if you go in for
this sort of thing, to Mulder's younger sister, Samantha, who, in
one of the show's key events, is mysteriously abducted.
 &HT;    The show's creators, meanwhile, have not neglected to churn out
paperback novels, a series of young-adult books, CD-ROMs, posters,
postcards and assorted tchotchkes. And they hope to extend the
franchise still further with a feature-length film (opening later
this week) that will supposedly expand on plot developments
introduced in this season's last televised episode but also make
perfect sense to first-time viewers _ if there are any left.
 &HT;    For 13 weeks this spring, the X-Files expo, a sort of roadshow
and revival meeting, wended its way across the country, drawing
throngs of the faithful and, not incidentally, priming them with
clips from the film in a portable, Dolby-equipped theater. The
atmosphere was more than a little reminiscent of the fervor
surrounding ``Star Trek'' and its many conventions and big-screen
spinoffs.
 &HT;    Yet unlike ``Star Trek,'' ``The X-Files'' has accomplished the
transition to cultdom while the show itself is still being shown in
prime time _ it's a cult without any apparent tinge of campiness or
rerun quaintness.
 &HT;    Almost from the beginning, a good deal of critical ink has been
spilled in an effort to account for the popularity of ``The
X-Files,'' which began simply as a chiller in the tradition of
Darren McGavin's old supernatural detective story, ``Kolchak: The
Night Stalker.'' Much of the attention has centered on the
so-called ``mythology'' of ``The X-Files'' _ roughly a fifth of the
117 episodes so far, which constitute an intricate and
ever-evolving serial tale of UFOs, alien abduction, unsavory
biological experimentation and government conspiracy and cover-up
at the very highest levels.
 &HT;    The secret of ``The X-Files,'' or so the argument goes, is that
the mythology taps into the most authentically anxious parts of our
post-modern Zeitgeist _ our fear of government and cancer (which
are practically interchangeable), along with our ongoing
fascination with the notion of extraterrestrial entities.
 &HT;    The program's creator, Chris Carter, has said: ``The show's
original spirit has become kind of the spirit of the country _ if
not the world. There is a growing paranoia. With the Berlin Wall
down, with the global nuclear threat gone, with Russia trying to be
a market economy, there is a growing paranoia because, as somebody
once said, there are no easy villains anymore.''
 &HT;    For the very same reasons, however, you could make a compelling
case that at no time in recent years have Americans been less
paranoid, especially about their own government. We're fearful
these days not so much of political plots as of random evil _ the
sort of unpredictable violence perpetrated by rogue states, by
weapon-toting militias with only a handful of members, by our
children even.
 &HT;    The show touches on these threats, but only glancingly, and then
to suggest that they're really manifestations of some vast
metaforce.
 &HT;    Rather than probing our deepest fears, ``The X-Files'' cleverly
reintroduces into our lives something like the feeling of paranoia
without the content, a pleasantly creepy frisson that awakens us to
all those thready webs of coincidence; they don't mean anything
exactly but they're pretty cool all the same.
 &HT;    If ``The X-Files'' is about anything, it's really about
nostalgia _ for a time (which may never have existed, really) when
a belief in global conspiracy held out the promise of a universe
that could be comprehended.
 &HT;    That the ``The X-Files'' culties themselves don't necessarily
believe that life is one dark plot was reinforced for me when I
caught up to the X-Files Expo in Miami. ``Please,'' one visitor to
the expo, a middle-aged airline pilot, said when I asked him if he
believed in government conspiracies. ``Just look at what's going on
in Washington now. What makes you think they could get their acts
together sufficiently to accomplish anything?''
 &HT;    This was in April, at the expo's halfway point. The publicity
material had promised sites that were appropriately spooky _
airplane hangars, abandoned military bases and the like _ but the
Miami expo took place in the Coconut Grove Convention Center, a
windowless, nondescript hall that more often plays host to
gatherings of gun and knife sellers and people taking the postal
exam.
 &HT;    For atmosphere there was a dry-ice machine pumping out fog, and
a sound system loudly recycling Mark Snow's ``Twilight
Zone''-inspired ``X-Files'' theme song: woo woo woo woo WOO woo.
The exhibits consisted of a pretty skimpy prop museum (wardrobe
items mostly: Scully's trench coat, Mulder's sleeveless
sweatshirt), and a number of stations where you could have your
picture taken with a camera that supplied a digitalized background,
so that it looked as if you were sitting right in Mulder's basement
office, say, or standing on a lonely, spooky stretch of blacktop
and experiencing an interval of what the show calls ``lost time.''
 &HT;    I did encounter a couple of authentic weirdos at the Miami expo
_ a man in the autograph line, for example, carrying what looked to
be a fetus in a jar _ and I spoke to a University of Miami
undergrad who told me he was pretty sure that all the governments
in Europe had recognized the existence of extraterrestrials.
 &HT;    I also talked with a young man, a student at Miami Dade
Community College who was wearing a Hebrew-lettered ``X-Files'' cap
of his own design.
 &HT;    ``This is a show I can relate to,'' he told me. ``Sometimes I'll
just see an episode and I'll be saying, `That's me!' Like the
episode about the cockroaches _ anybody who knows my character
knows about me and cockroaches. I also see a lot of Mulder in me. I
used to think maybe I wanted to be a physicist _ that was when I
was watching `MacGyver' _ but now I think I might want to join the
FBI.''
 &HT;    Most of the crowd _ a preponderance of high-school and
college-age kids, but lots of grown-ups too _ was clean-cut and
normal-seeming. As far as I could make out, the chief
distinguishing characteristic of the expo attendees, the only thing
setting them apart from the rest of the citizenry, was their
detailed, encyclopedic knowledge of ``X-Files'' mythology.
 &HT;    They were extremely curious about the black oil, for example _
that strange toxic sludge that may just be the squeezings, in
effect, of the Tunguska meteorite, or may be a petroleum-based form
of shape-shifting alien intelligence. And many were alert to the
show's Sophoclean subtext _ the vexed question of Mulder's true
parentage.
 &HT;    In truth, the ``X-Files'' mythology, which has evolved
accidentally, and partly in response to real-life exigencies
(Scully's disappearance during Gillian Anderson's brief maternity
leave, for example), defies mastery. Not even the show's writers
fully understand it. The narrative momentum is as much backward as
it is forward, continually revisiting old themes _ Samantha's
disappearance, UFO sightings, government experiments with tissue
obtained from smallpox vaccinations _ and uncovering additional
layers of duplicity.
 &HT;    You can't even be sure any longer who's dead and who isn't. That
icepick-like device that used to dispatch unwelcome aliens, causing
gook to seep from behind their ears, seems in retrospect to have
worked only temporarily. The Cigarette-Smoking Man, fatally wounded
a couple of months ago and exiled to a shack in Quebec, is now back
in Washington, plying his evil trade.
 &HT;    The new movie, it is said, will tie up a great many loose
threads and resolve some longstanding difficulties, but let's not
hold our breath. The show's constant revisitation of its own
material makes the reruns as valuable and as timely as the new
programs.
 &HT;    And except for Mulder, no one is really interested in getting at
the heart of things anyway. The true ``X-Files'' conspiracy is not
about who will rule the world. It's conspiracy for its own sake _ a
Penelope-like web constantly unraveling and then reknitting itself
_ and for the sake of making an otherwise random universe seem much
more weird and interesting.
 &HT;    Chris Carter, who is 41 and who edited a surfing magazine before
getting into television, grew up in Southern California, and among
his formative experiences, he has said, were horror movies,
programs such as ``The Twilight Zone'' and ``The Night Stalker''
and the televised Watergate hearings. We probably could have
guessed. ``The X-Files'' is in a way a melding of '70s politics and
special effects. Carter's genius has been to show us what paranoia
looks like, and it turns out to be the best-looking thing on
television. Rain-slicked blacktop, looming trees, lots of ice and
fog and mist.
 &HT;    ``The X-Files'' spends more on production values than do most
other hourlong dramas, and spends it in particularly original and
inventive ways. It's darker, shadowier and filmed from more unusual
angles than most movies, let alone TV shows.
 &HT;    Even the villains, those nameless middle-age men who not only
manipulate our government but also in effect run the solar system
from a mysterious, dark-paneled club on West 46th Street (it looks
a lot like the Council on Foreign Relations, actually), are
revealed as much by how they look as by what they do. The better
the haberdashery (as in the case of Well-Manicured Man, as he's
known), the more heinous the deeds. They all have a faintly jowly,
Nixonian cast to them, come to think of it _ even the possibly
well-intentioned fellow known as Deep Throat.
 &HT;    And it should be noted that originally, the most creepy of them
all, the deeply vile Cigarette-Smoking Man, didn't speak. He didn't
need to. The sight of him taking a drag on one of his ever-present
Morley's, inhaling so deeply that his eyes squinted, and then
letting the smoke leak from the corner of his mouth in snaky
gray-blue tendrils, was proof enough of his cancerous soul.
 &HT;    He lit up for the first time, we discovered last year, in a
self-congratulatory moment after successfully engineering the
assassination of JFK. (He was also, not surprisingly, behind the
death of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rodney King riots.) And
after kicking the habit for a while, he went back to the weed when
his attempt at making a legitimate go as a freelance writer, under
the nom de plume Raul Bloodworth, predictably came to naught.
 &HT;    What ``The X-Files'' really demonstrates, you might say, is what
the world would be like if global politics were more like office
politics, where the bad guys are always the suits, and if the
cosmic set designer had been the sort of person who watched a lot
of '70s television and read a lot of Whitley Strieber.
 &HT;    It's a darkly beautiful world, lighted by periodic explosions
and fireballs, where even the bees and the trees and the ground
underfoot may be less than benign, and it's a world that seems to
fairly thrum with energy, however unearthly, and possibility.
 &HT;    For all its hipness, though, ``The X-Files'' also has an
old-fashioned noirish quality. The gadgets are far from
cutting-edge, and the sci-fi elements _ flying saucers,
poltergeists, giant sewer-dwelling worms and the like _ are the
stuff of drive-in movies. The show transports us out of our
confused post-Cold War era to a time when the various ills of the
world come from somewhere else, and are so large and so pervasive
and so vague that they defy understanding.
 &HT;    In this mythic realm, conspiracies and government evildoing
become not the object of outrage, except among a chosen few, but
merely a fact of life, no more alterable than the weather.
 &HT;    If the world of ``the X-Files,'' with its all-encompassing
conspiracies, is strangely comforting, it is also enervating. Many
of the people you encounter literally have no wills of their own.
They respond robotically to signals received by mysterious bits of
metal implanted in their necks.
 &HT;    Others are animated not by passion, for the most part, but
simply by power or the quest for knowledge. Scully and Mulder
aren't just cool; they tend to operate at a lower emotional
temperature than any characters I can remember, either on
television or in movies and books.
 &HT;    It's not simply, as has so often been noted, that they have
shown no sexual interest in each other, Scully and Mulder don't
seem lastingly keen on anyone else either, and their relations with
everyone tend to be almost clinically flat and empty of affect.
Mulder is practically a zombie (Scully has lately, in response to a
cancer scare, manifested an occasional semblance of an inner life),
and he leaves us with the uncomfortable feeling that this is the
price that being a believer exacts.
 &HT;    It's a little like becoming an artist _ you have to give up
everything else. Think of the sexless, pasty-skinned Lone Gunmen,
the obsessive conspiracy theorists who turn up occasionally to
furnish Mulder with a crucial bit of microfilm: they seldom go out
except at night. This theme of loneliness and disconnection may be
the hidden message of ``The X-Files,'' in fact _ the show's real
secret: that true belief, of whatever sort, requires too much
self-surrender, and chances are that any belief will be mistaken
anyway.
 &HT;    The truth is not, as Mulder would have it, ``out there,'' but
rather right here, on our TV screens. ``The X-Files'' has taught us
that it's more entertaining, and probably more epistemologically
sound, to believe in everything and in nothing at all.

picture taken with a camera that supplied a digitalized background,
so that it looked as if you were sitting right in Mulder's basement
office, say, or standing on a lonely, spooky stretch of blacktop
and experiencing an interval of what the show calls ``lost time.''
 &HT;    I did encounter a couple of authentic weirdos at the Miami expo
_ a man in the autograph line, for example, carrying what looked to
be a fetus in a jar _ and I spoke to a University of Miami
undergrad who told me he was pretty sure that all the governments
in Europe had recognized the existence of extraterrestrials.
 &HT;    I also talked with a young man, a student at Miami Dade
Community College who was wearing a Hebrew-lettered ``X-Files'' cap
of his own design.
 &HT;    ``This is a show I can relate to,'' he told me. ``Sometimes I'll
just see an episode and I'll be saying, `That's me!' Like the
episode about the cockroaches _ anybody who knows my character
knows about me and cockroaches. I also see a lot of Mulder in me. I
used to think maybe I wanted to be a physicist _ that was when I
was watching `MacGyver' _ but now I think I might want to join the
FBI.''
 &HT;    Most of the crowd _ a preponderance of high-school and
college-age kids, but lots of grown-ups too _ was clean-cut and
normal-seeming. As far as I could make out, the chief
distinguishing characteristic of the expo attendees, the only thing
setting them apart from the rest of the citizenry, was their
detailed, encyclopedic knowledge of ``X-Files'' mythology.
 &HT;    They were extremely curious about the black oil, for example _
that strange toxic sludge that may just be the squeezings, in
effect, of the Tunguska meteorite, or may be a petroleum-based form
of shape-shifting alien intelligence. And many were alert to the
show's Sophoclean subtext _ the vexed question of Mulder's true
parentage.
 &HT;    In truth, the ``X-Files'' mythology, which has evolved
accidentally, and partly in response to real-life exigencies
(Scully's disappearance during Gillian Anderson's brief maternity
leave, for example), defies mastery. Not even the show's writers
fully understand it. The narrative momentum is as much backward as
it is forward, continually revisiting old themes _ Samantha's
disappearance, UFO sightings, government experiments with tissue
obtained from smallpox vaccinations _ and uncovering additional
layers of duplicity.
 &HT;    You can't even be sure any longer who's dead and who isn't. That
icepick-like device that used to dispatch unwelcome aliens, causing
gook to seep from behind their ears, seems in retrospect to have
worked only temporarily. The Cigarette-Smoking Man, fatally wounded
a couple of months ago and exiled to a shack in Quebec, is now back
in Washington, plying his evil trade.
 &HT;    The new movie, it is said, will tie up a great many loose
threads and resolve some longstanding difficulties, but let's not
hold our breath. The show's constant revisitation of its own
material makes the reruns as valuable and as timely as the new
programs.
 &HT;    And except for Mulder, no one is really interested in getting at
the heart of things anyway. The true ``X-Files'' conspiracy is not
about who will rule the world. It's conspiracy for its own sake _ a
Penelope-like web constantly unraveling and then reknitting itself
_ and for the sake of making an otherwise random universe seem much
more weird and interesting.
 &HT;    Chris Carter, who is 41 and who edited a surfing magazine before
getting into television, grew up in Southern California, and among
his formative experiences, he has said, were horror movies,
programs such as ``The Twilight Zone'' and ``The Night Stalker''
and the televised Watergate hearings. We probably could have
guessed. ``The X-Files'' is in a way a melding of '70s politics and
special effects. Carter's genius has been to show us what paranoia
looks like, and it turns out to be the best-looking thing on
television. Rain-slicked blacktop, looming trees, lots of ice and
fog and mist.
 &HT;    ``The X-Files'' spends more on production values than do most
other hourlong dramas, and spends it in particularly original and
inventive ways. It's darker, shadowier and filmed from more unusual
angles than most movies, let alone TV shows.
 &HT;    Even the villains, those nameless middle-age men who not only
manipulate our government but also in effect run the solar system
from a mysterious, dark-paneled club on West 46th Street (it looks
a lot like the Council on Foreign Relations, actually), are
revealed as much by how they look as by what they do. The better
the haberdashery (as in the case of Well-Manicured Man, as he's
known), the more heinous the deeds. They all have a faintly jowly,
Nixonian cast to them, come to think of it _ even the possibly
well-intentioned fellow known as Deep Throat.
 &HT;    And it should be noted that originally, the most creepy of them
all, the deeply vile Cigarette-Smoking Man, didn't speak. He didn't
need to. The sight of him taking a drag on one of his ever-present
Morley's, inhaling so deeply that his eyes squinted, and then
letting the smoke leak from the corner of his mouth in snaky
gray-blue tendrils, was proof enough of his cancerous soul.
 &HT;    He lit up for the first time, we discovered last year, in a
self-congratulatory moment after successfully engineering the
assassination of JFK. (He was also, not surprisingly, behind the
death of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rodney King riots.) And
after kicking the habit for a while, he went back to the weed when
his attempt at making a legitimate go as a freelance writer, under
the nom de plume Raul Bloodworth, predictably came to naught.
 &HT;    What ``The X-Files'' really demonstrates, you might say, is what
the world would be like if global politics were more like office
politics, where the bad guys are always the suits, and if the
cosmic set designer had been the sort of person who watched a lot
of '70s television and read a lot of Whitley Strieber.
 &HT;    It's a darkly beautiful world, lighted by periodic explosions
and fireballs, where even the bees and the trees and the ground
underfoot may be less than benign, and it's a world that seems to
fairly thrum with energy, however unearthly, and possibility.
 &HT;    For all its hipness, though, ``The X-Files'' also has an
old-fashioned noirish quality. The gadgets are far from
cutting-edge, and the sci-fi elements _ flying saucers,
poltergeists, giant sewer-dwelling worms and the like _ are the
stuff of drive-in movies. The show transports us out of our
confused post-Cold War era to a time when the various ills of the
world come from somewhere else, and are so large and so pervasive
and so vague that they defy understanding.
 &HT;    In this mythic realm, conspiracies and government evildoing
become not the object of outrage, except among a chosen few, but
merely a fact of life, no more alterable than the weather.
 &HT;    If the world of ``the X-Files,'' with its all-encompassing
conspiracies, is strangely comforting, it is also enervating. Many
of the people you encounter literally have no wills of their own.
They respond robotically to signals received by mysterious bits of
metal implanted in their necks.
 &HT;    Others are animated not by passion, for the most part, but
simply by power or the quest for knowledge. Scully and Mulder
aren't just cool; they tend to operate at a lower emotional
temperature than any characters I can remember, either on
television or in movies and books.
 &HT;    It's not simply, as has so often been noted, that they have
shown no sexual interest in each other, Scully and Mulder don't
seem lastingly keen on anyone else either, and their relations with
everyone tend to be almost clinically flat and empty of affect.
Mulder is practically a zombie (Scully has lately, in response to a
cancer scare, manifested an occasional semblance of an inner life),
and he leaves us with the uncomfortable feeling that this is the
price that being a believer exacts.
 &HT;    It's a little like becoming an artist _ you have to give up
everything else. Think of the sexless, pasty-skinned Lone Gunmen,
the obsessive conspiracy theorists who turn up occasionally to
furnish Mulder with a crucial bit of microfilm: they seldom go out
except at night. This theme of loneliness and disconnection may be
the hidden message of ``The X-Files,'' in fact _ the show's real
secret: that true belief, of whatever sort, requires too much
self-surrender, and chances are that any belief will be mistaken
anyway.
 &HT;    The truth is not, as Mulder would have it, ``out there,'' but
rather right here, on our TV screens. ``The X-Files'' has taught us
that it's more entertaining, and probably more epistemologically
sound, to believe in everything and in nothing at all.

 By JAMES BANDLER  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    Jody Williams opened the door of her office and looked in at an
alarming scene.
 &HT;    Everything from the furniture to Rolodexes, Coke bottles, coffee
cups, and spoons was missing, and holes had been punched in the
walls and ceiling. It was November 1989, and rebel forces in El
Salvador had launched their most serious offensive on the capital
in 10 years of civil war.
 &HT;    Williams' San Salvador office at Medical Aid for El Salvador was
among several humanitarian agencies that were sacked and robbed.
 &HT;    Williams, an intense and determined Vermont native, had no doubt
about who was responsible for the looting. Government forces had
long suspected that humanitarian groups were sympathetic to the
rebel cause, and Williams believed they had used the rebel
offensive as an opportunity to search the offices for propaganda
and weapons. When the fighting in the capital eased, she drove to
the headquarters of the Salvadoran military's high command, a drab,
cement-block building atop a man-made hill, overlooking a
shantytown of cardboard shacks.
 &HT;    Escorted into a sparsely furnished room, she stood face to face
with six colonels in camouflage, the leaders of the armed forces in
El Salvador.
 &HT;    ``I remember clearly thinking that if they could kill me, then
and there, for what I represented or for what they believed I
represented, they would,'' Williams recalls.
 &HT;    Williams wanted restitution for the damages and a written
apology. She left without getting either, but a few days later, the
chief of staff of the Salvadoran defense forces, Col. Rene Emilio
Ponce, did the unthinkable: He wrote a letter of apology, in effect
admitting that the government had sacked the office and noting his
support for Medical Aid for El Salvador's work.
 &HT;    ``You have no idea how important that letter was to us,''
recalls Mario Velasquez, Williams' boss at Medical Aid. ``We used
to call it the Golden Letter. With this letter, we gained the
respect of the military, so they were no longer messing with us.''
No one else in El Salvador had the courage to confront the
colonels, Velasquez says. ``Jody Williams did.''
 &HT;    Since her days as a young girl, when she defended her deaf and
schizophrenic brother from the tin cans and taunts of neighborhood
kids, Williams has cast herself as a foe of bullies and a Lone
Ranger for peace.
 &HT;    For years, she toiled in obscurity: first, trying to alleviate
the suffering caused by the ``Reagan-Bush wars,'' as she called the
conflicts in the '80s in Central America; later, in the job that
would win her world renown, as a top organizer of an international
coalition dedicated to the elimination of land mines around the
world.
 &HT;    In six years, the coalition that Williams helped assemble grew
from a handful of humanitarian groups into a campaign that
encompassed more than 1,000 organizations. It enlisted the support
of mine victims and mine-clearance experts, peace and disarmament
groups, sympathetic politicians, diplomats, four-star generals and,
most famously, the late Princess Diana.
 &HT;    To recognize this extraordinary effort, the Nobel committee in
Oslo, Norway, bestowed its Peace Prize last year jointly on
Williams and on the coalition that she helped build, the
International Campaign to Ban Land Mines. Two months after the
prize announcement, 122 nations signed an international treaty in
Ottawa banning the production, sale and use of anti-personnel land
mines.
 &HT;    ``Jody acted as the nerve center of the campaign,'' says
Susannah Sirkin, of Physicians for Human Rights, in Boston, one of
the six founding organizations of the campaign. ``She was driven by
a single-minded focus to keep this thing going, literally staring
down those who would stand in the way.''
 &HT;    But the same character traits that catapulted the now
47-year-old Williams to Nobel glory _ her brashness, bluntness and
lone-wolf style of leadership _ have made her a lightning rod for
controversy.
 &HT;    She has been attacked in the press by former colleagues as an
imperious self-promoter and as an out-of-control employee who
hogged all of the credit and half of the prize money. She's been
accused of betraying the ideals of the land-mine campaign and
flouting the wishes of the campaign's steering committee by putting
herself forward for the peace prize.
 &HT;    At the center of this unhappy drama is Williams' rift with her
former employer, Robert O. Muller, the head of the Vietnam Veterans
of America Foundation, the Washington, D.C.-based group that hired
her to coordinate the land-mine campaign. Muller, whom Williams had
at one time described as her best friend and mentor, fired Williams
three days before the prize was announced. The dismissal was the
culmination of months of mounting tension between the activists.
 &HT;    ``Jody is the ultimate loner,'' Muller says. ``You can only go
so far by yourself. That's part of the problem. She doesn't work
well at all with a team.''
 &HT;    Williams, lashing back, accuses her former colleagues of
jealousy and sexism, because, as she told one reporter, ``girls do
all the work, boys want the recognition.''
 &HT;    One of the unspoken commandments of humanitarian and peace work
is: Thou shalt not seek celebrity. And if fame comes, renounce it
quickly. Otherwise, beware thy colleagues' wrath.
 &HT;    U.N. mediator Ralph Bunche understood the importance of humility
when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950 for his efforts
to bring an end to the war between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. ``I
am one man working for the United Nations,'' he said, firmly
rebuffing suggestions that he was a hero. ``Without the U.N., I am
nothing.''
 &HT;    Williams, critics say, has failed the Bunche test miserably.
They say she drove to Vermont from her apartment in suburban
Virginia just before the Nobel recipients were announced, so that
she could greet the international press corps alone, far from her
Washington, D.C., colleagues. Williams, who notes that she'd been
fired three days before the Nobel announcement, says that she drove
to Vermont to celebrate her birthday.
 &HT;    Whatever her intentions, the choice of location made for
brilliant theater: She stood alone in her grassy yard near a beaver
pond, barefoot and wearing a black tank top, blasting the president
of the United States as a ``weenie'' for refusing to buck the
Pentagon and support a land-mine ban.
 &HT;    Many of the articles that ran in the next day's newspapers
portrayed Williams as a hard-charging, backwoods hero who, by
tapping into the Internet from her ``rustic farmhouse,'' had
single-handedly galvanized citizens to rise up against an insidious
weapon _ all in defiance of the United States, the world's sole
remaining superpower.
 &HT;    The story made good copy, but it was, at best, misleading. Many
people played critical roles in the success of the campaign,
including Thomas Gebauer, of the German group Medico International
and Muller, of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, who
conceived the idea; sympathetic politicians such as U.S. Sen.
Patrick Leahy, of Vermont and Lloyd Axworthy, the Canadian foreign
minister; Princess Diana, who focused international attention on
the cause; and hundreds of mine victims and mine-clearance experts
around the world.
 &HT;    But Williams _ who was an employee of Muller's foundation, which
paid her $70,000-a-year salary and travel expenses _ sees herself
as the key figure in the effort. ``It started with me,'' she
asserts, ``and five years later, there were 1,200 non-government
organizations in 60 countries involved.''
 &HT;    Williams also angered many colleagues by keeping her $500,000
share of the prize money, thereby violating another activists'
commandment: Thou shalt not get rich. And Williams' public
complaints about the $230,000 tax bill she faced struck a sour
note.
 &HT;    Critics say she could have donated her share of the prize to the
campaign or to land-mine victims. Instead, almost half of her prize
money will go to the U.S. Treasury and much of it will be spent by
the Pentagon, which has opposed the land-mine treaty from the
outset.
 &HT;    Muller, a former Marine lieutenant, who was determined to rid
the world of land mines, had been paralyzed below the waist in
1969, while shot through the chest, charging a hill in South
Vietnam. His anger and activist fire were forged during his
rehabilitation at the Veterans Administration medical center in the
Bronx, where he was appalled at the filthy conditions and despair.
 &HT;    He joined the antiwar movement and was thrown out of the 1972
Republican National Convention for attempting to shout down
President Richard M. Nixon. He led the campaign to secure financial
restitution for U.S. soldiers who were victims of Agent Orange and
headed the first delegation of American veterans to return to
Vietnam, in 1981.
 &HT;    He was the hero of the 1975 Vietnam documentary ``Hearts and
Minds'' and a real-life inspiration for the ``cool rockin' daddy''
of Bruce Springsteen's anthem, ``Born in the U.S.A.'' A man of
almost messianic charisma, Muller inspires fierce devotion among
his staff.
 &HT;    During visits to Cambodia in the 1980s, Muller was stunned by
the number of land-mine victims _ according to one recent estimate,
one out every 236 people in that country is an amputee _ and by the
appalling lack of care. Muller's organization, the Vietnam Veterans
of America Foundation, which he founded in 1980, set up a
prosthetics clinic in Cambodia, but the catastrophic toll exacted
by hidden mines convinced him that victim assistance was only a
Band-Aid for a problem that demanded much more.
 &HT;    All over the world, workers from humanitarian groups were
reaching similar conclusions. The Red Cross estimates that 24,000
people are killed or maimed by land mines each year, most of them
civilians and many of them children. According to the U.S. State
Department, there are between 80 million and 110 million land mines
buried in 71 countries around the world, most in developing
countries.
 &HT;    In October 1991, Muller and Thomas Gebauer, of the German aid
group Medico International, decided to try to unite numerous
humanitarian, development, and peace groups under the banner of an
international campaign. The goal, as framed by Muller and Gebauer,
was an international ban on antipersonnel land mines.
 &HT;    A month later, impressed by Williams' intensity and organizing
track record at Medical Aid for El Salvador, Muller asked her to
come on board as the campaign coordinator.
 &HT;    Within a year of the hiring of Williams, four other
non-governmental organizations _ Human Rights Watch, Handicap
International, the Mines Advisory Group and Physicians for Human
Rights _ joined the campaign. Together with Medico International
and Muller's veterans foundation, these organizations formed a
steering committee to provide direction to the effort to ban land
mines.
 &HT;    Volatile and self-assured, Williams had a famous exchange during
the Ottawa Conference, in 1996, a strategy session for banning land
mines that brought together representatives from 70 governments.
The head of the French delegation, Michel Declos, an Old
World-style diplomat, told the conference that France supported a
ban but reserved the right to use land mines when militarily
necessary.
 &HT;    Several delegates signaled for Williams to stand up and rebut
him. Leaning toward the microphone, Williams said that the
``distinguished representative'' of the French delegation could not
have it both ways: supporting a ban in peacetime but using mines in
wartime. His proposal, she said, was ``better than a stick in the
eye, but not much.''
 &HT;    It was an extraordinary moment: a member of a non-governmental
organization lecturing a diplomat. With Williams leading the
charge, other participants at the conference began denouncing the
French proposal. On the last day of the conference, Lloyd Axworthy,
the Canadian foreign minister, astonished everyone with a heady
challenge: He called on the nations of the world to return to
Ottawa in 14 months to sign an international treaty outlawing land
mines.
 &HT;    However, once close friends, Muller and Williams were barely
speaking during 1997, and the gulf between their strategies was
widening.
 &HT;    The two had very different world views. Muller believed that a
treaty to ban land mines would be a hollow victory without American
support, because the United States was the only country in the
world with the clout and credibility to persuade nations such as
Russia and China to sign on and to ensure adherence to the treaty.
Williams disagreed. The most important countries to have on board,
she believed, were nations that used mines: the Angolas and
Cambodias of the world. The United States could sign later if it
wanted.
 &HT;    The two also disagreed about tactics. Muller had hired a
lobbying team of pollsters and media experts, headed by former
White House aide Patrick Griffin. Williams called the group ``the
sleaze team.'' The campaign, she felt, was being cited as a new
model of diplomacy, one in which average citizens and
non-governmental organizations forced governments to agree to a
weapons ban. She did not think it needed a Beltway PR machine.
 &HT;    Muller thought Williams and her allies were naive about the way
Washington worked. Conservative members of Congress and Army
generals were not going to be swayed by grass-roots campaigning.
Still, he agreed that Griffin's work should be kept as low-profile
as possible.
 &HT;    On Oct. 7, 1997, Muller fired Williams officially. Three days
later, at 4 a.m., the phones at her Vermont home started ringing.
Williams and the campaign had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
In December, the historic Ottawa treaty was signed by 122 nations,
banning the use of antipersonnel land mines.
 &HT;    In May, in an important policy shift, the Clinton administration
announced that the United States will sign the Ottawa treaty as
soon as it finds alternatives to its mixed landmine systems. It has
set a goal of the year 2006.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, since the controversy over the landmine campaign and
the Nobel Prize hit the pages of the Los Angeles Times, the
Washington Post and The New York Times, Williams has been besieged
with requests for interviews. This is the last personal interview
she will be granting for a while, Williams promises; she will not
further indulge a ``media story gone amok.''
 &HT;    ``I'm not interested in talking about me,'' she says. ``Contrary
to what some in the campaign think, I'm not into being a famous
person.''
 &HT;    Williams says she will spend her time working as one of the
campaign's official unpaid ambassadors, formulating political
strategies and giving speeches to ensure that the treaty signed in
Ottawa is ratified, implemented and enforced.

 By ROYAL FORD  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    Watch Quania's eyes.
 &HT;    Dark beneath her broad forehead and furrows of braid, they
reveal nothing. She keeps them distant.
 &HT;    As the bus called ``the 28'' rumbles along Blue Hill Avenue
toward Grove Hall, Quania looks straight ahead. She does not watch
the chattering groups of other teen-age girls, doesn't look at
anyone's clothes or face, certainly doesn't cast a glance at any
boy sitting with a girl.
 &HT;    Later at Grove Hall, where a building of squat shops curves
around a corner, two girls face each other in a darkened doorway,
their backs to the doorposts. Quania's glance in their direction is
too stealthy to be seen: ``I almost looked over at them, but I
looked right back away,'' she says, her tone almost apologetic.
 &HT;    At 15, Quania Daniel, a sophomore at Boston English High School,
already has learned the danger of a misinterpreted glance _ a
glance mistaken for superiority or haughtiness, for a sneer at
another girl's appearance or for flirting with someone's boyfriend.
 &HT;    Here in Grove Hall, behind the Beulah Holmes Holiness Center, a
girl pulled a knife on Quania one night a few months back. It was a
confrontation sparked by a glance Quania might have cast _ though
she doesn't remember it _ at the Chez Vous roller rink up the
avenue.
 &HT;    When the knife came out, she walked away. Chicken, some girls
called her. Smart, she calls herself.
 &HT;    But the next night, she happened to run into the girl again at
Grove Hall, and this time they did fight, fist-to-fist _ ``up and
up,'' as Quania says, distinguishing it from fights with weapons or
fights where a group of girls jumps a lone victim. ``I didn't lose
that fight'' is all she will say about it.
 &HT;    She was lucky to have a fight end so cleanly. One of her
friends, tied by rumor to another girl's boyfriend, had her face
slashed with a box cutter just a block down from Doyle's, the
Jamaica Plain tavern where warm friendships and conviviality
abound.
 &HT;    Until about 10 years ago, teen-age girls seldom fought each
other _ even with fists. They did not carry knives and razors and
box cutters. They did not form roaming packs and attack other
girls. They did not fight with sticks, bats, bricks.
 &HT;    Today they do. And that has made the world of many girls like
Quania a terrain of fear, a place where caution is essential. The
threat is not just in the cores of cities. It exists in
Massachusetts at the Quincy Center MBTA stop; at a trailer park in
Concord, N.H.; at a school in York, Maine.
 &HT;    Violence by teen-age girls is not yet a deluge, but its steady
escalation, even as overall crime rates in the nation are falling,
is troubling.
 &HT;    Consider these recent crimes by girls:
 &HT;    In Roxbury, Mass., two 15-year-olds use razors to slice the arms
and forehead of a 16-year-old girl.
 &HT;    In Concord, N.H., four girls surround a 14-year-old girl as she
gets off a school bus at the mobile-home park where she lives and
beat her with baseball bats.
 &HT;    In Revere, Mass., a state trooper is brought down by a
15-year-old girl who jumps him from behind after he stops her
father for a minor traffic violation.
 &HT;    In Cromwell, Conn., two 18-year-olds are charged with using box
cutters to slash the necks of two other teen-age girls.
 &HT;    In Rhode Island, a girl who was 13 at the time of the killing is
sentenced to 45 years in prison for the murder of a 23-year-old
single mother she shot in the head in a fight over a man.
 &HT;    And in Springfield, Mass., a teen-age girl holds up a young
mother at gunpoint, then beats her victim's 18-month-old child with
the pistol.
 &HT;    Kathleen M. O'Toole, the state's secretary of public safety,
recalls that when she was a Boston street cop in the 1970s and
'80s, girls were arrested rarely, and then only for nonviolent
crimes such as shoplifting. In the mid-1980s, however, that began
to change, and the rise in violence has been steady.
 &HT;    Since 1987, according to the FBI, the number of violent crimes
committed annually by boys under 18 has risen from 51,653 to 78,853
_ a 53 percent increase. But that is less than half the percentage
increase among girls during the same period: Violent crime by girls
under 18 climbed 118 percent, from 6,418 incidents to 13,995.
Aggravated assaults were up 124 percent; robberies, 117 percent.
 &HT;    Guns are rarely the weapon of choice for girls _ at least for
now. They opt for less deadly weapons, such as razors, box- and
carpet-cutting knives, sticks, bats, fists. Before teen-age boys
turned to guns, sometime in the mid-1980s, they too used knives and
razors, and that leaves open the question of whether girls will
also turn to guns as the taboo on violent female behavior fades.
 &HT;    Still, the total number of girls committing violent crimes is
small compared with boys. Meda Chesney-Lind, professor of women's
studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and co-author of the
recent book ``Girls, Delinquency, and Juvenile Justice,'' cautions
that the perceived increase in teen-age female violence may be
partly a result of greater attention to the problem by police and
the news media.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the shift has been perceptible enough that
educators, social workers, judges and police are worried that if
the trend continues, girls might achieve a perverse equality in
crime, an achievement nobody would cheer.
 &HT;    Now Quania is in a program trying to stay out of violence and
help other kids do the same. But she knows it's not easy.
 &HT;    Time was, a teen-age girl living in bad circumstances did one of
two things: She either retreated into herself, becoming the
hollow-eyed waif who said little in school and maybe even quit
altogether, walking through the days full of pain and
submissiveness; or she got pregnant, because pregnancy meant escape
and, with another life dependent on her, a vestige of power.
 &HT;    Today, girls have a third way to go wrong: by striking out in
violence.
 &HT;    The triggers can seem trivial. A girl might attack someone she
thinks looks down on her clothes, her hair, her family. Somebody
sizes up her boyfriend, maybe. Or somebody looks as if she wants to
rise above their shared lot, by dressing well, studying hard,
refusing to hang in the neighborhood or joyride on the streets or
country roads.
 &HT;    Most girls who turn to violence are reacting to the same
circumstances that have long been blamed for breeding violence
among boys. They come from dysfunctional families, learning at home
about abuse: of their bodies, of drugs and alcohol, of their own
esteem. What they don't learn there they pick up on the streets.
They form cliques that a decade ago might have been merely vocally
abusive but today are assault squads.
 &HT;    This generation of girls spends many hours after school without
parental supervision. But what is new is that they do it in the
company of boys, and as the equals of those boys. Just as some boys
and girls hang together today in positive ways, as groups of
friends, not couples, so others hang together in destructive
pursuits.
 &HT;    ``They're acting like they do because of the way the boys
behave. They don't want the boys to have one up on them,'' says Joe
Mascaritolo, the assistant director at Madison Park
Vocational-Technical High School, in Boston. ``You see it more in
groups of boys and girls all being together, all trying to be
equals.''
 &HT;    But there is irony in this, says Sibylle Artz, a professor of
children and youth care at the University of Victoria, in British
Columbia. The girls who become violent and so feel they are
achieving power do it not by becoming powerful young girls but by
stepping out of gender, by acting like violent young men.
 &HT;    Part of the influence on girls is the music that many listen to,
as well as the movies, television shows, fashion ads and news
programs that emphasize power and violence. Artz points
specifically to music videos, which entered the culture shortly
before the first increase in violence among girls was noted.
Perhaps significantly, many videos portray women as powerful by
virtue of their potential violence.
 &HT;    Complaints about the effects of pop culture are not new, but the
level of violence among girls is rising just as girls are tuning in
to this culture in record numbers. In 1997, for the first time,
more girls bought CDs, records and tapes than boys. Li'l Kim, the
rap singer, calls herself the Queen Bitch and sings of sex and
excess _ to the sound of a gun being cocked.
 &HT;    Quania recalls a number with the refrain ``slice you up'' and
marvels that one song she loved by Master P turned out, once she
got past the beat and heard the lyrics, to be a recipe for
producing crack cocaine.
 &HT;    ``These girls are not becoming violent out of thin air,'' says
Martha P. Grace, chief justice for the Massachusetts juvenile-court
system. They emerge from ``a constellation of parental neglect,'' a
world where they have ``either witnessed violence endlessly on TV,
in their home, or they have been violated by a parent or someone
else.''
 &HT;    ``Women judges may sometimes be the first women they encounter
who are not powerless,'' Grace notes. This is so even though women
today are more powerful than ever in business, medicine, the law,
the trades, sports and many other realms. Women in these roles
often exist beyond the ken of troubled teen-age girls. But a shadow
of that social shift has fallen across their world: Girls now see
they can rise in the world of violent crime.
 &HT;    Frenia learned most of her bad ways on the street, or in classes
where she wasn't always paying attention. Like Quania, she is
working hard to keep her own life in order and help others at the
same time.
 &HT;    To that end, eight teen-age girls are at ease, sitting around a
make-believe living room. Bone-Net, played by Charlene Johnson, has
invited her girlfriends in to watch TV, and they're finger-flicking
through the channels. The flashing images trigger memory and
reaction in each of the girls.
 &HT;    One by one, they rise on the makeshift stage in the cafeteria of
the Clarence R. Edwards Middle School, in Charlestown, Mass. Each
has a lesson in danger to present to an audience of her peers.
 &HT;    A young woman named Precious stands to tell of her dilemma: Her
friends Trisha and Toya are at each other, she says, and she is
worried that their vocal dispute will turn violently physical. Toya
has already threatened Trisha: ``You're that girl who was talking
bad trash about me,'' and ``I'm going to beat your behind,'' with
eight other girls to help.
 &HT;    Caught in the middle of impending violence between two friends,
Precious asks the audience what she should do. ``I don't want to
get cut up over nobody.''
 &HT;    Several hands shoot up immediately. Talk to your friends, one
student suggests. Tell them violence is no way to go, remind them
that they are friends. Get them to sit down and talk this out.
 &HT;    Precious's real name is La 'Toshia Leathers; she's a member of a
traveling troupe of high school students. The group puts on skits
illustrating some of the dangers teen-age girls face, then invites
the audience to talk about avoiding such pitfalls. Called teen-age
Girls InFormed, the troupe was put together by the Massachusetts
Prevention Center, at the Medical Foundation in Boston, and is
supported by the public school system.
 &HT;    A discussion such as this is one of several ways in which
schools and public officials are beginning to confront the problem
of escalating violence among adolescent girls. Some programs are
aimed specifically at them, while others that once targeted boys
have been expanded to include girls.
 &HT;    In some communities, teen-agers are recruited as peer leaders in
their schools; in others, officials have set up downtown drop-in
centers for troubled youths. Still other programs, such as teen-age
Girls InFormed, hope their cautionary tales will reach young people
before violence happens.
 &HT;    The audience on this afternoon, at least, appears to be engaged
in Precious' story. Later, other characters rise: Blue, whose real
name is Marilyn Jean, acts the part of a drunk, telling how she
forced a girl who didn't drink to slug down some liquor. ``It's not
my fault she choked on her vomit,'' she says. ``It's not my fault
she died.'' The audience groans in disapproval.
 &HT;    As the session continues, actors come forward to talk of date
rape, of more drinking, of more violence. They ask the audience to
respond: Who was at fault in the date rape? Should a drunken mother
be reported to the social service department? How do you stop
drinking? How do you stop fighting?
 &HT;    Today, Frenia is a peer leader for Teen Empowerment, a South
End-based outreach program with offices in three Boston high
schools: Madison Park, English and Dorchester. Peer leaders try to
help steer troubled youngsters away from violence by teaching them
to express their anger and frustrations in ways that are vocal, not
violent.
 &HT;    ``They learn violence at home,'' Frenia says. ``They aren't
respected and they end up not respecting themselves. And how are
you going to respect anybody else if you can't respect yourself?''
 &HT;    Teen Empowerment tries to teach self-respect by encouraging kids
to talk about what is troubling them, in casual gatherings after
school, without dictating solutions. Instead, a peer leader, such
as Frenia or Quania, uses her own experience to help peers work out
answers for themselves.
 &HT;    While programs such as these seem promising, no one is sure yet
what will work best. Yet the studies that Artz and others have
done, in both Canada and the United States, offer some clues to
what might work. It seems the skits presented by teen-age Girls
InFormed are useful because they present tangible problems, inspire
discussion and propose nonviolent options.
 &HT;    The issue is critical, because the question that logically
follows the surge in violence among girls is frightening: Will the
trend continue, mimicking the level of mayhem among boys?
 &HT;    Hopefully not. Moreover, girls appear to learn from one another
in ways that boys, long ingrained with the notion that
aggressiveness is natural, do not. Many are hoping this will be a
key to the battle.

 By ROYAL FORD  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    Watch Quania's eyes.
 &HT;    Dark beneath her broad forehead and furrows of braid, they
reveal nothing. She keeps them distant.
 &HT;    As the bus called ``the 28'' rumbles along Blue Hill Avenue
toward Grove Hall, Quania looks straight ahead. She does not watch
the chattering groups of other teen-age girls, doesn't look at
anyone's clothes or face, certainly doesn't cast a glance at any
boy sitting with a girl.
 &HT;    Later at Grove Hall, where a building of squat shops curves
around a corner, two girls face each other in a darkened doorway,
their backs to the doorposts. Quania's glance in their direction is
too stealthy to be seen: ``I almost looked over at them, but I
looked right back away,'' she says, her tone almost apologetic.
 &HT;    At 15, Quania Daniel, a sophomore at Boston English High School,
already has learned the danger of a misinterpreted glance _ a
glance mistaken for superiority or haughtiness, for a sneer at
another girl's appearance or for flirting with someone's boyfriend.
 &HT;    Here in Grove Hall, behind the Beulah Holmes Holiness Center, a
girl pulled a knife on Quania one night a few months back. It was a
confrontation sparked by a glance Quania might have cast _ though
she doesn't remember it _ at the Chez Vous roller rink up the
avenue.
 &HT;    When the knife came out, she walked away. Chicken, some girls
called her. Smart, she calls herself.
 &HT;    But the next night, she happened to run into the girl again at
Grove Hall, and this time they did fight, fist-to-fist _ ``up and
up,'' as Quania says, distinguishing it from fights with weapons or
fights where a group of girls jumps a lone victim. ``I didn't lose
that fight'' is all she will say about it.
 &HT;    She was lucky to have a fight end so cleanly. One of her
friends, tied by rumor to another girl's boyfriend, had her face
slashed with a box cutter just a block down from Doyle's, the
Jamaica Plain tavern where warm friendships and conviviality
abound.
 &HT;    Until about 10 years ago, teen-age girls seldom fought each
other _ even with fists. They did not carry knives and razors and
box cutters. They did not form roaming packs and attack other
girls. They did not fight with sticks, bats, bricks.
 &HT;    Today they do. And that has made the world of many girls like
Quania a terrain of fear, a place where caution is essential. The
threat is not just in the cores of cities. It exists in
Massachusetts at the Quincy Center MBTA stop; at a trailer park in
Concord, N.H.; at a school in York, Maine.
 &HT;    Violence by teen-age girls is not yet a deluge, but its steady
escalation, even as overall crime rates in the nation are falling,
is troubling.
 &HT;    Consider these recent crimes by girls:
 &HT;    In Roxbury, Mass., two 15-year-olds use razors to slice the arms
and forehead of a 16-year-old girl.
 &HT;    In Concord, N.H., four girls surround a 14-year-old girl as she
gets off a school bus at the mobile-home park where she lives and
beat her with baseball bats.
 &HT;    In Revere, Mass., a state trooper is brought down by a
15-year-old girl who jumps him from behind after he stops her
father for a minor traffic violation.
 &HT;    In Cromwell, Conn., two 18-year-olds are charged with using box
cutters to slash the necks of two other teen-age girls.
 &HT;    In Rhode Island, a girl who was 13 at the time of the killing is
sentenced to 45 years in prison for the murder of a 23-year-old
single mother she shot in the head in a fight over a man.
 &HT;    And in Springfield, Mass., a teen-age girl holds up a young
mother at gunpoint, then beats her victim's 18-month-old child with
the pistol.
 &HT;    Kathleen M. O'Toole, the state's secretary of public safety,
recalls that when she was a Boston street cop in the 1970s and
'80s, girls were arrested rarely, and then only for nonviolent
crimes such as shoplifting. In the mid-1980s, however, that began
to change, and the rise in violence has been steady.
 &HT;    Since 1987, according to the FBI, the number of violent crimes
committed annually by boys under 18 has risen from 51,653 to 78,853
_ a 53 percent increase. But that is less than half the percentage
increase among girls during the same period: Violent crime by girls
under 18 climbed 118 percent, from 6,418 incidents to 13,995.
Aggravated assaults were up 124 percent; robberies, 117 percent.
 &HT;    Guns are rarely the weapon of choice for girls _ at least for
now. They opt for less deadly weapons, such as razors, box- and
carpet-cutting knives, sticks, bats, fists. Before teen-age boys
turned to guns, sometime in the mid-1980s, they too used knives and
razors, and that leaves open the question of whether girls will
also turn to guns as the taboo on violent female behavior fades.
 &HT;    Still, the total number of girls committing violent crimes is
small compared with boys. Meda Chesney-Lind, professor of women's

recent book ``Girls, Delinquency, and Juvenile Justice,'' cautions
that the perceived increase in teen-age female violence may be

the news media.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the shift has been perceptible enough that

hollow-eyed waif who said little in school and maybe even quit

   Japan's economic performance in the 1990s continues to be
disappointing, frustrating and worrisome. Tokyo's economic
sluggishness is souring life at home and setting off international
reverberations.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Japan's financial weakness is mirrored in other Asian
countries. More important, Japan's failure to deal with its
economic woes provides a hint of the resistance to reform that may
be expected elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among bureaucrats and politicians there remains a strong
faith in the Japanese style of capitalism and a resistance to truly
liberating financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Japanese public clamoring for deregulation. It
associates such reform with unemployment and instability in
personal lives _ but the Japanese have spent the past half-century
trying to reduce such uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the 1990s were started by the bursting of the
real-estate and stock-market bubbles of the 1980s. The government
deserves much of the blame for the financial excesses and the
stagnation that has followed, but its dogmatically conservative
attitudes are delaying recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The financial sector is swamped by a mind-boggling array of bad
debts and underfunded pension liabilities, amounting to as much as
$1.5 trillion. Scandal after scandal exposes unethical or illegal
behavior. And many of the policies being adopted to clean up this
mess will delay resolution of the bad debts and counterproductively
increase government control.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the torrent of pronouncements from Tokyo about economic
stimulus and deregulation, the world will be disappointed with the
results. While some financial deregulation will occur, those who
believe that Japan will adopt an American economic model are
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bureaucrats and politicians, including the elite at the
Ministry of Finance, continue to be in deep denial. They do not
comprehend the extent of reforms necessary to restore the nation to
economic health. Instead they regard their current problems as a
passing incident with no fundamental implications for the ongoing
overall system.
</P>
<P>
   These problems harbor a variety of international ramifications.
The International Monetary Fund's bailout for Indonesia, Thailand
and South Korea includes substantial reform of their financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Japan will not be a firm supporter of this
initiative. Nor will Japan import many more goods and services as
Southeast Asia attempts to export its way out of trouble. Japan has
damaged its self-assumed role as a leader of Asia and will prove a
weak international partner for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's present economic problems and reluctance to reform
follow an era of roughly 10 percent annual growth, which ended in
1973. After that, the economy grew at a more modest 4 percent until
the early 1990s. The Japanese slowdown has brought a gradual,
piecemeal unraveling of the postwar financial boom.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for new business, large commercial banks moved into real
estate lending in the 1980s with the Ministry of Finance's explicit
support and guidance. Along with insurance companies and securities
firms, they invested aggressively overseas as regulatory
restrictions fell.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the banks were faced with
unfamiliar loan clients, but they continued to assume that the
Ministry of Finance would guarantee their viability. Their
recklessness fed the real-estate and stock-market speculation of
the late 1980s, which caused both urban real-estate and stock
prices nearly to triple in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Japanese financial institutions' penchant for
making investments based on long-term personal or corporate
relationships had serious repercussions, especially when banks
sought new clients. Banks began financing new borrowers with the
same assumption _ that personal relationships would suffice as a
screening mechanism. The herd instincts of Japanese banks took the
place of hard-nosed financial analysis.
</P>
<P>
   This explanation, however, puts the most charitable face on what
was happening behind the scenes in Japan in the 1980s. The scandals
that have emerged in the 1990s have revealed shocking examples of
indiscretion and malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   Favored investors at securities firms were given guaranteed
returns on their equity portfolios. Huge loans went to small
businesses for speculation in the stock market and real estate.
Large banks eagerly introduced crooked clients to subsidiary banks
or credit co-ops in order to keep questionable loans off their own
books while hoping to benefit from the business.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions continued to pay off racketeers who
threatened to reveal negative information at annual shareholder
meetings. Ministry of Finance officials told banks when to expect
inspections, in exchange for lavish entertainment and other favors.
And there have been allegations that the Ministry of Finance
approved and recommended illegal schemes to hide financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
   These scandals go far beyond isolated incidents. They suggest a
debilitating fear of disclosing bad news, illegal dealings between
financial institutions, politicians and bureaucrats, and the
involvement of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably much of this behavior took place earlier, but both
the need for new outlets for lending and the euphoria created by
the stock and real-estate bubbles drastically increased its
prevalence.
</P>
<P>
   When the bubbles burst, the fallout included enormous bad debts,
the magnitude of which is still not known, mainly because of
Japan's loose requirements on reporting bad, or nonperforming,
loans. In late 1997, the Ministry of Finance admitted that problem
loans totaled some 79 trillion yen ($630 billion), about 15 percent
of all Japanese bank lending and an enormous 16 percent of the
gross domestic product. These levels of bad debt resemble those in
Indonesia or Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news may be coming since Japanese banks hold roughly
one-third of international loans to South Korea, Thailand and
Indonesia. Officially, Japanese lending to Asian countries totals
some $125 billion, but it may be larger. An unknown portion of
these loans are bad, but if Japanese banks behaved with the same
imprudence as elsewhere, the prognosis is not good.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Japan's situation is not encouraging. An outright
financial collapse with many banks going belly-up is unlikely, if
only because of the lengths to which the government will go to
prevent it. But the more likely scenario _ Japan muddling along
with substandard growth and an unstable financial sector _ is
hardly more encouraging. Neither scenario is good for Japan, Asia
or the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seriousness of Japan's financial troubles, neither
Tokyo nor the public believes in the American economic model. And
Japan's reluctance to undertake reform may send conflicting signals
to other Asian nations as the crisis moves into its next stage.
This is all the more unfortunate since Japan is a leading member of
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Japan's economic stagnation suggests that it will
do little to revive Asia's health. Asia's struggling economies will
try to recover by increasing their exports. As the world's
second-largest economy, Japan could play a helpful role by
absorbing a portion of those exports.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the rub: Japan is following the same strategy as its
poorer Southeast Asian neighbors. Rather than absorbing more
imports, Japan will shift its burden through more exports to the
United States. Despite any rhetoric about a global partnership,
Tokyo is quite willing to let the United States underwrite the
Asian recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The international ramifications of Japan's financial weakness
extend beyond economics. The Japanese are now absorbed by domestic
problems; they have little interest in the problems of the rest of
Asia. Japan was noticeably silent during the recent crisis over
Iraq, articulating only the request that any military action be
postponed until after the Nagano Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of South Korea's economic crisis, Japan chose to
press a petty dispute over fishing rights. Just a few years ago,
Japan was awash in talk of playing a larger role in the world, and
the government mounted a modest campaign to become a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council. Today there is little interest
expressed in international diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has found it difficult to exert pressure on Tokyo.
But it is time for the United States to send less-than-subtle
signals to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship includes broad consulting arrangements, within
which American officials could simply stop providing advice.
Through canceled meetings, unreturned telephone calls and a lack of
advance notice of American policy moves, the United States can send
the message that it no longer regards Japan as a global partner.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like a heavy-handed way to treat the world's
second-largest economy, but under present circumstances it may be
the only way to move Japan off a path that is destructive for us
all.

FOR SHORT-TERM SAVINGS, MUTUAL FUNDS ARE TOO AGGRESSIVE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing; originally moved June 12.)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 26. My long-term goal is to retire very comfortably, and
my short-term goal is to purchase a home around age 30. I invest
$90 a week in my 401(k) account, and have a current balance of
$6,000 that is 60 percent invested in the George Putnam Fund of
Boston and 20 percent each in Putnam OTC and Emerging Growth and in
Fidelity Advisor Overseas. I also have $2,000 in a savings account,
and when it reaches $3,000 I plan to put it in Vanguard's Balanced
Index fund, adding $500 monthly. Am I on the right track to reach
my goals? How much will I have for my retirement years?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A.A., Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You are certainly on the right track and over the long term
you should do very well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you likely won't attain the retirement goal without
additional savings, and the purchase of your first house may be
closer to five years away than four.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how I calculate. If you continue saving for retirement by
putting away $4,680 a year, you would amass $2,060,438 over 39
years, presuming average 10 percent annual growth. Invested to
produce an income stream (at a portfolio average 7 percent), you
could expect an income of $144,230 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble comes when you adjust for inflation. At 4 percent
average annual inflation, that $144,230 wilts down to the buying
power of $31,243 in today's money. If inflation averaged only 3
percent, the current value would be $45,541 _ still probably not
enough for a very comfortable lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that you needn't fret. I suggest you calculate
the percentage of your current income that is going toward
retirement and then maintain that percentage during your working
years.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, every time you get a raise, you bump your contributions to
the retirement pool. The result is that if your raises tend to
match or beat the inflation rate, you will thus be countering the
effect of inflation, and will indeed be very comfortably fixed in
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   As for the house savings, I advise against moving to a mutual
fund, even an excellent one such as Vanguard Balanced Index. For
short-term savings, mutual funds are too aggressive; a market
downturn could take a serious bite out of your savings over the
short term.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you stick with money markets, CDs, US Treasury
securities, and the like for your home-purchase savings. If you
contribute $500 a month to this pool and achieve average annual
returns of 5 percent, over four years you would accumulate $28,883,
which is probably enough for a condo down payment; after five
years, you would have a more comfortable $36,464, which would widen
your purchase options _ and remember that the higher your down
payment is, the lower the interest rate you are likely to get on
the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   As for your 401(k) funds, it seems mostly solid, but I would
watch Putnam OTC and Emerging Growth fairly closely. After
excellent performance from 1992 to 1995, it fell to bottom-quartile
results the next two years. Its performance has improved this year,
but it is still running slightly behind the average for its mid-cap
growth peers.
</P>
<P>
   If there are attractive alternatives in the small-cap or mid-cap
arena on your 401(k) menu, and if your fund doesn't soon return to
superior performance, I'd consider a change.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 54, married, and looking for retirement advice. My
current retirement portfolio consists of a 401(k) plan that
contains $110,000 invested in Putnam Growth and Income and $107,000
in Putnam High Yield Advantage funds. Other assets include $124,000
in common stocks and $115,000 parked in a money market fund. I also
have a life insurance annuity that will pay out $80,000 in the year
2002. At retirement, besides Social Security payments estimated at
$1,400 a month, I will also have a small pension of $300 a month.
My goal is to have at least $60,000 annual income in retirement.
What do you recommend I do with the 401(k)? Other available funds
are Putnam's Voyager, OTC and Emerging Growth, and International.
Do we need more than the 401(k) savings to reach our goal?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; F.T., Duxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You should be in fine shape with your savings at the current
level.
</P>
<P>
   With the $9,500 annual additions, the 401(k) should grow to
$669,881 over 11 years, presuming an average 8 percent annual
return. If we make the same assumption for your common stocks, that
segment of the portfolio would be worth $289,123 after 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   If you simply let that $115,000 rot in a money fund _ and the
truth is I would not be a whole lot more aggressive _ it would add
up to $196,689.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you were to invest the annuity payout that comes in
2002 in a good GNMA fund yielding 6.5 percent a year, you could
expect that to grow to $124,318 over the next seven years. That
takes us to a grand total of $1,280,011 _ a great deal more than
you will need to supply your expected needs.
</P>
<P>
   As for investments, I'm going to presume your current portfolio
reflects a pretty conservative guy _ after all, you have about 55
percent of your savings in fixed-income holdings. As I said, I'm
not very positive about stocks at this point, so I won't argue.
</P>
<P>
   But I would at least move the money market funds to Fidelity
Spartan GNMA or Vanguard GNMA. This should get you about a 1.5
percentage point better yield than a money market fund, and over 11
years the interest-rate bumps to which bond funds are prey should
balance themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the difference between a 5 percent yield on $115,000
and a 6.5 percent yield on the same investment works out to $33,313
_ enough to give you some comfort even if things don't work as I
presume.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you put this money (as well as annuity proceeds when
they arrive) in such a fund, by the time you retire the fixed
income side _ these funds plus the Putnam High Yield Advantage
account _ will have grown to a size sufficient to meet your
projected income needs.
</P>
<P>
   You could thus leave the balance of the portfolio in equities to
protect you against the likely effects of inflation after
retirement.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Q. I have been building UTMA accounts for my children, aged 10
and 11, since 1991. Each account now is worth a little more than
$19,000, and each contains 400 shares of Vanguard Asset Allocation
fund, 220 shares of Janus Fund, and 135 shares of T. Rowe Price
Blue Chip Growth fund. I currently add $100 a month to each
account. I had always intended this to be the children's college
fund, but now I am considering tapping into these accounts,
beginning in 2001, to pay their tuition at a private high school.
This would cost a little more than $5,000 a year. I would continue
to save college money, but perhaps in my own name, since much has
been made of the decreased potential for financial aid when college
savings are in a child's name. Does this plan raise any red flags?
If it is sound, I think I should move out of an almost all-stock
portfolio into investments that will protect principal, but I don't
know what type of fund would be best. Obviously a money market fund
will protect principal, but I can stand a little more risk in the
short term. Should I make any changes all at once, or in phases?
</P>
<P>
   E.M., Windham, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The only substantial red flag I can see is that by spending
the lion's share of the educational savings on a private high
school, you will have relatively little accumulated for them by the
time they're ready for college. If you were to continue at your
$100 a month pace for each, but this time putting it in your own
name and paying any taxes the accounts accrued, you might have
$9,126 for the older child by the time of his or her freshman year,
and $11,099 for the younger at the same period. These projections
are based on an assumption of average annual returns of 8 percent,
and that might be optimistic since you correctly anticipate moving
these investments to more cautious vehicles as the time you will
require the funds draws closer.
</P>
<P>
   So the first question is whether you can afford this course,
which entails either saving more now for the college years, coming
up with funds for college from other sources, or leaving the kids
largely to their wits when it comes college time -- i.e. hoping for
scholarships and grants to carry the bulk of the load. But just as
a point of reference, if you kept the current college savings pool
working until their freshman years, with the ongoing $100 monthly
contributions and average returns of 8 percent, the elder child
would have $39,279 at the beginning of the freshman year, and the
account for the younger would be $43,661.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you decide, it would indeed be wise to switch the
further savings into your own name. And if you go with the plan for
private secondary education, I agree that the portfolios would be
fairly sharply realigned. All three of your funds concentrate on
large- cap stocks (although Vanguard Asset Allocation has 40
percent of its portfolio in long-term bonds). If the funds are to
be used in the next six years, I'd suggest something like this:
retain 25 percent in Vanguard Asset Allocation and then divide the
balance between Vanguard High-Yield Corporate and Vanguard
Intermediate-Term U.S. Treasury funds.
</P>
<P>
   (Similar portfolios could be designed using funds from the other
families.) This would seem to me to satisfy your willingness to
accept ``a little more risk'' while at the same time sharply
reducing your reliance on the large-cap stock category.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to work out the tax effect of making these moves.
</P>
<P>
   Although the current $19,000 balances are probably more than
double the amount of your cash contributions, remember taxes have
been paid on distributions each year as the accounts grew, and the
amount of those reinvested distributions increases your base cost.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the tax bill comes out to, it's probably prudent to pay
it now and reduce the risk.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide against a private high school, I would still
reduce the portfolio's risk, but not as dramatically -- probably
retaining the Asset Allocation position as is and move about half
the money in the all-stock funds into a high-yield bond fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I graduated from college a year ago and will be 23 at the end
of next month. I want to get an early start on retirement planning.
I am involved in a family real estate development business and have
a good earning potential. I plan to set up a Keough plan next year.
If I were to put $10,000 or $15,000 into this plan every year, what
kind of a nest egg would I be looking at when I am both 43 and 53
years old? My thought is to go strictly with growth funds because
of my age. What strategy would you advise if I am able to save this
much cash?
</P>
<P>
   J.C., Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A 20-year investment program with contributions of $833 a
month (or $10,000 a year) would grow to $589,942, assuming 10
percent average annual contributions; bump the monthly
contributions up to $1,250, or $15,000 a year, and the sum would be
$898,417.
</P>
<P>
   But it's in the next decade that the cash really begins to pile
up, taking the kitty to $1,720,378 with the lower level of
contributions, and to $2,570,578 at the $15,000 annual level.
</P>
<P>
   I agree that growth funds are the ticket for a fellow your age,
but you'll want to spread your bets among various sectors of the
market. In my example, I'll cite Fidelity funds, but you could
build a similar portfolio with most other major fund families.
</P>
<P>
   I'd start with the dominant and boring end -- putting half of
the contributions into Fidelity Spartan Market Index fund, which
simply seeks to track the Standard and Poor's 500 Index. (If you
don't like the idea of an index fund, you might consider another
solid large-cap dominated fund such as Fidelity Growth and Income,
but I would go with the index.) Then I would add 20 percent in a
good small-cap fund, such as Fidelity Low-Priced Stock.
</P>
<P>
   I would split the final 30 percent equally among an
international fund such as Fidelity Overseas, and two sector funds
-- Fidelity Select Health Care and Fidelity Select Technology. Both
of these latter funds are likely to provide bumpy rides at times,
but with your very long outlook, you can afford to ride them out.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ignore the markets. What you are doing is effectively
embarking on a twenty- or thirty-yeasr dollar-cost averaging
program, and what you want to do it stuff away the $833 or $1,250 a
month regardless of the state of the markets -- reasoning that
whatever price you pay now will look mighty attractive a decade or
two hence.
</P>
<P>
   Simply refuse to allow yourself to get spooked if a market turns
sour and you find yourself moving backwards for a quarter, or even
a year or so. Also, be realistic in your projection of
contributions. You'd be far better off settling for the lower
figure and sticking to it doggedly than by aiming high, making the
payment this month, missing it next month, and reducing it the
third.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you tell me the best way to go with a $1,000 gift I plan
to make to a granddaughter on her graduation?
</P>
<P>
   H.L., Marblehead, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If this is a high-school graduation and she plans to go on to
college, I simply suggest a check made out to the college, with
your granddaughter's name on the memo line of the check. But if
this is a college graduation, I have two suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you have a particular use in mind for the money, why not
simply give it to her and let her determine what to do with it.
Typically a new college graduate has never been so broke in her
life.
</P>
<P>
   Her future is ahead and bright, but the present often looks
uncertain and rocky. Mom and Dad have just heaved a giant sigh of
relief at the last of the college bills, and they are probably
thinking to themselves, ``Sweetie, you're finally emancipated.' So
$1,000 could be just the thing to tide her over from the glory of
graduation day to her first paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   But let's suppose you want this money to stay with your
granddaughter and become the seed from which her future financial
security grows. In that case I suggest this: Tell her that after
she has reached $1,000 in earned income, you will give her a check
made out to a mutual fund company which will represent the
beginning of her retirement savings. I would suggest a Roth IRA
invested in either Vanguard Index 500 fund or Fidelity Spartan
Market Index fund -- almost identical offerings which simply seek
to track the course of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index. A modest
gift? Well, let's suppose she is 21 years old and leaves the money
there until she's 65. If the fund produces average annual returns
of 10 percent over those 44 years, the nestegg would be $66,264
when she is 65.

US TO PRESS CHINA QUIETLY ON DISSIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a significant tactical shift, President Clinton
will press his demands for the release of over a dozen Chinese
dissidents at next week's summit in China in closed meetings, not
in the media.
</P>
<P>
   After years of wrangling publically with China over human
rights, the administration has decided to take a different approach
for the nine-day summit, which starts June 26. This stance is based
in part on the fact that China no longer holds dissidents who are
well-known outside of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The change is also an admission that the old US policy did not
work. As celebrated dissidents were freed from prison, others were
put behind bars. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will stress that Washington wants basic legal reforms in China, not
simply a trickle of prisoner releases in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Once they settled in the United States, many of the former
dissidents lost their effectiveness as protesters. They spent more
of their time in school or making money or squabbling among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China continues to release people on the condition that
they go into exile, even the administration realizes they can't
point to that as a real sign of success,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk,
Washington director of Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the administration has worked with non-governmental
groups in compiling a high-priority list of dissidents to be freed.
But their names have not been released. This is in sharp contrast
to last fall's Sino-American summit in Washington, when the White
House made no secret of its desire to see the release of Wei
Jingsheng and Wang Dan, prominent democracy activists.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wei and Wang were exiled to the United States after the
summit, supposedly because of their deteriorating health. Last
year, under pressure from the United States, China revised its laws
so that ``counter-revolutionary'' activities are no long illegal.
In other words, many of the demonstrators jailed after the 1989
protest at Tiananmen Square did not commit crimes after all _ but
the revision is not retroactive.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, the Chinese government made it illegal to
``endanger state security.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese prison cells are filled with other political prisoners.
By the government's count, some 2,200 remain locked up. The Clinton
administration has put special emphasis on several of them because
of the severity of their sentences or the unjust circumstances
surrounding their arrests. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _Liu Nianchun, a labor activist who was arrested in 1995 after
petitioning the National People's Congress to ``rectify'' human
rights abuses. Even though Liu's three-year sentence should have
ended last month, he is being detained in a ``re-education through
labor camp'' outside of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   _Chen Longde, a human rights worker who was arrested in 1996 for
writing to the People's Congress about corruption and lack of
democracy. After suffering torture by electric shocks and beatings,
Chen jumped from a two-story platform at a labor camp. Barely
mobile because of two broken hips and a damaged kidney, he is still
forced to do labor, according to Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   _Gau Yu, a journalist who was arrested in 1993 for writing in
Hong Kong publications about disputes among senior Chinese
officials. She was sentenced to six years for revealing ``state
secrets,'' and friends say she is in poor health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government thinks that journalism is propaganda,
and so all real journalists are dissidents and criminals,'' said
Wang Juntao, a friend and former colleague of Gau Yu. They were in
the same prison before Wang was exiled in 1994. This summer, he is
living in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   There are also people like Ngawang Choephel _ hardly a household
name here. Choephel, who who spent the 1992-93 academic year
studying and teaching ethnomusicology at Middlebury College in
Vermont on a Fulbright scholarship, was unfairly imprisoned by
China two years ago, according to US officials.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1995 trip to Tibet, his homeland, he worked on a
documentary about music and dance. Chinese authorities arrested him
and charged him with spying. He was sentenced in 1996 to 18 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Friends in Vermont worry about Choephel (pronounced Chope-pell).
They describe him as an artist who did not dwell on politics. ``The
charges are completely made up, fake, false, and baseless,'' said
Jon Barlow, who took a music workshop with Choephel while at
Middlebury.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to make an example of Tibetian political prisoners, China
rarely, if ever, releases them before their sentences end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since we heard about his arrest, we've been trying in
every conceivable way to try to convince the Chinese they made a
grave mistake,'' said Tim Rieser, an aide to Patrick Leahy of
Vermont, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Operations
Committee. Leahy mentioned the case in a 1996 meeting in Beijing
with top Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups are divided about whether the US government
should concentrate on behind-the-scenes pleas for the release of
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to use quiet diplomacy in the months leading up
to the summit, but the administration has used quiet diplomacy for
years in Choephel's case and it hasn't worked,'' said John Ackerly,
president of the Internatioinal Campaign for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have assured foreign diplomats that fewer
political dissidents are being imprisoned than in previous years,
according to US officials. While that might well be true, the
Chinese appear to be sending more dissidents to the
``re-education'' camps. The Clinton administration says 200,000
Chinese are in such places. Aides say Clinton and Albright will
complain to President Jiang Zemin and other officials about the
widespread use of the camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really nasty thing about the Chinese system is that as
they pass amendments for criminal procedure law, they rely
increasingly on administrative justice, which doesn't have due
process,'' said an official familiar with China.
</P>
<P>
   The Jiang government maintains that the camps are useful for
turning misfits into productive citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Tong Yi served as a secretary and researcher to Wei Jingshen,
the dissident. While Wei was imprisoned, she was dispatched to a
camp for more than two years. She never had a chance to dispute the
charges against her or to appeal her conviction.
</P>
<P>
   At the camp, Yi says she was beaten for refusing to work more
than eight hours a day. She was forced to do she calls ``useless
busy work'' yanking the threads from old clothes. But she considers
herself lucky. She says that friends worked in grimy factories,
making clothes and batteries for export.
</P>
<P>
   The only re-education occurred when visitors toured the sites
and the guards pretended to teach lessons in Communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The re-education is really a joke,'' says Yi, 30, who was
released two years ago and went into exile in New York. ``The irony
is that even though it's called re-education, the police used all
the labor to make more profits.''

COUSY AT 70 STILL A MAN FOR THE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time the next basketball season starts, The Cooz will be
(gulp) 70.
</P>
<P>
   Is this possible?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the old cliche, `You're only as old as you feel,'''
says Bob Cousy, who will be 70 Aug. 9. ``It's true. I went back to
Holy Cross for a reunion this year, and although it's 48 years
later, I said, `Didn't we just do this?' I thank God for a lot of
things, and general good health is one of them. I have my aches and
pains, sure, but it is hard to believe I'm creeping up on 70.
Someone could say, `You turning 50?' and I'd say, `Of course.'''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Joseph Cousy, without whom there would have been no
Boston Celtics for Bill Russell to lead in the direction of those
11 championships, played his final game as a Celtic on April 24,
1963. He had sprained an ankle during the game, but he returned
with his team in trouble against a good Lakers team. With The
Cooz's firm hand on the tiller, the Celtics nailed down
championship No. 6 that night in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Cousy played seven years with Russell. He played one with John
Havlicek, who once told me that as a rookie, ``all I did was run
around and make layups on passes from Cousy.'' He never played with
Dave Cowens, Larry Bird, or Antoine Walker. In the eyes of young
fans, he is a name from the musty past.
</P>
<P>
   He played for the Boston Celtics, which means that his No. 14 is
just one of 18 retired numerals. So many great players have
performed for this team that it is understandable if the names and
achievements all sort of run together after a while. It is hard now
to conjure up the circumstance of the early '50s, when the Celtics
had no cachet in this town and the only reason most people went to
see the team play was the electrifying and magnetic presence of the
game's best passer, ballhandler, and thinker. Absent Cousy, the
Celtics would have quite literally ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Along with George Mikan, he was the NBA to the first generation
of professional basketball fans. This is why among People of a
Certain Age, Bob Cousy remains an airport traffic stopper. Bob
Cousy is one of the great American sports heroes of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Much like his old coach, Red Auerbach, The Cooz respects the
past but does not wallow in it. He is, without question, more
knowledgeable about the modern NBA than any of his contemporaries
because he has left it only once in the 35 years since his
retirement, that being his six-year stint as coach at Boston
College (117-37). He coached the Cincinnati Royals from 1969
through the 23d game of the 1973-74 season, and before that
campaign was over, he began a local broadcast career that continues
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   He could have taken what he would call ``the path of least
resistance.'' He could have been simply Bob Cousy and acted as a
pontificator. That would have been more than enough to make a go of
it in this town. But he never even considered doing that.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who has covered the Celtics in the last
quarter-century knows, The Cooz still does his homework. He goes to
home games in order to look over opponents he'll be discussing in
his road telecasts. He keeps voluminous files on every team. He is
always on top of the new talent. He doesn't settle for being a
raconteur. He is always current. The next night he mails in a
performance will be the first.
</P>
<P>
   We can naturally assume he'll be back in the headset for another
few years. I mean, he (itals)is(unitals) Bob Cousy, is he not?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'd like to come back, of course,'' says Cousy. ``But
I'm not certain. The Channel 38 contract is completed, and nothing
has been settled for next year. I spoke with Paul Gaston a month or
so ago, and he said, `As far as I'm concerned, you'll always have a
job with us,' but nothing has been nailed down yet. I've spent 37
of the last 48 years in association with the Celtics, and I'd
definitely like to keep doing it for a few more years.''
</P>
<P>
   He has played against, played for, or witnessed every great team
the NBA has had to offer in the past five decades, which makes him
the ideal person to discuss the historic placement of the Chicago
Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never disputed the fact that the modern athlete is
bigger, faster, and stronger than they were in my day,'' Cousy
says. ``To my knowledge, the only old-timers who continually
challenge the idea that their game is better today is baseball
players, and I'm just not qualified to discuss that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Michael Jordan, well, what do you think?
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the world that Michael Jordan is the best thing
we've seen on the basketball court since Naismith invented the
game,'' Cousy asserts.
</P>
<P>
   But The Cooz will not sign on to the proclamation that the Bulls
are the greatest thing ever to come along or that their six titles
in eight years is an equivalent achievement to the Celtics' 11
championships in 13 seasons from 1957-69.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to make three points,'' Cousy begins. ``One, whether
the talent of the time was just as good is irrelevant to this
discussion. I believe the Celtics' accomplishment of 11 in 13 years
was more difficult because the talent was not spread out the way it
is today. They started out in an eight-team league and ended in a
14-team league. It was much more difficult to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, I was once on a team that had eight Hall of Famers.
Michael Jordan will have played with one _ Scottie Pippen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. The 1962-63 Celtics included Russell, Cousy, Tom
Heinsohn, Havlicek, Frank Ramsey, Sam Jones, K.C. Jones, and an
end-of-career Clyde Lovellette, all of whom have been inducted into
the Basketball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   But the one I really like is The Cooz's final insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe the key positions in basketball are center and
point guard, and this Chicago team doesn't have either,'' he points
out. The Bulls consist of Jordan, Pippen, and 10 role players. If
any of the rest of them were placed on other teams and told they
had to score 20 points or do some other things, they would not be
able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousy believes he has seen several better teams, including the
'66-67 76ers, the '71-72 Lakers, and both the great Celtics and
Lakers teams of the '80s. ``I am on the Michael Jordan bandwagon,''
he says. ``But I'm not on the Luc Longley and Bill Wennington
bandwagons. The Bulls are an excellent team and they would give any
of the other great ones a go, but they are simply not the best
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   That's (itals)my(unitals) expert witness.
</P>
<P>
   Who's yours?

A NOTE OF APOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA SMITH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My father used to read me newspaper stories at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I thought it was weird, too. But I was so enamored of him,
so much the dictionary definition of a daddy's girl, that I
obediently snuggled up 'neath the covers while he cracked open the
city section of the Chicago Daily News and enthusiastically related
tales of robbery, murder, natural disasters, and political
malfeasance. The terse blocked type below the headlines became
living, breathing stories. ``Where do you think this woman was
going when she got robbed?'' my father would ask. ``What was in her
bag? Who was waiting at home for her? Do you think the robber feels
guilty now?'' and the stories would stretch infinitely in either
direction, without clear beginnings or endings.
</P>
<P>
   My daddy gave the newspaper a pulse. He taught me to love its
changing canvas, its omnipotent eye, its infinite throat. And since
one long-ago tabloid featured his obituary, it is much too late to
apologize to him for compromising that love.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not too late to apologize to you.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time in my metro column, to create the desired
impact or slam home a salient point, I attributed quotes to people
who didn't exist. I could give them names, even occupations, but I
couldn't give them what they needed most _ a heartbeat. As anyone
who's ever touched a newspaper knows, that's one of the cardinal
sins of journalism: Thou shall not fabricate. No exceptions. No
excuses.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are always excuses. Usually they point to the
cursed fallibility of human beings, our tendency to spit in the
face of common sense, zigging when the world says zag. Sometimes
excuses reveal real or imagined inadequacies, or the belief that
the world, if it is to be conquered, must be conquered
singlehandedly.
</P>
<P>
   I've already heard from dozens of people in search of an
official sound-byte, a hook upon which to hang the newly fallen
wordsmith. The (itals)reason.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   It may ring hollow _ after the fact, excuses always do _ but I
always believed that I needed to do it all. Instead of popping out
of J-school in a nice, neat, byline-ready package, I was fueled by
a heady mixture of naivete, ambition, and an almost insane love for
the powers of language. To make up for the fact that I didn't get
that ``correct'' start in journalism, I set out to be 10 times as
good by doing 10 times as much. Write columns. Author books. Write
and perform poetry. Make films. Pen and star in plays. Gig at
Scullers with a jazz band. And as accolades poured in, I strained
to accomplish more.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't establish priorities, and the first casualty was
time. In Boston, my face was my column. I wanted the pieces to
jolt, to be talked about, to leave the reader indelibly impressed.
And sometimes, as a result of trying to do too much at once and
cutting corners, they didn't. So I tweaked them to make sure they
did. It didn't happen often, but it did happen. And if it had only
happened once, that was one time too many.
</P>
<P>
   I will survive this knowing that the heart of my columns was
honest and heartfelt. None of the pieces considered for the
American Society of Newspaper Editors award or this year's Pulitzer
Prize were doctored in any way. I will write as long as I breathe,
despite the dire predictions that this indiscretion spells the end
of my career. In the course of living this flawed life, I've
stepped into the lives of remarkable people. They will always live
in me.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that changes what happened.
</P>
<P>
   So to the welders, the B-boys, the preachers, and the surgeons,
to the grocery clerks and bartenders and single mothers, to the
politicians, PR flacks, spokespersons and secretaries, to my dear
husband and family and friends, I am sorry for betraying your
trust. To the editors who supported and encouraged me, as well as
those who jumped ship when the mighty USS Smith began to take on
water, thanks for the lessons. To those colleagues and readers who
salivated daily at the thought of my head on a platter, congrats.
And to the hundreds of real people who honored me with their time
and stories, you are my salvation and I will hold you tight during
this trial.
</P>
<P>
   To every single reader, young and old, black and white, who
opened their papers on Monday and Friday and trusted me to be
truth, know this: You were the truth all along.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'd like to apologize to the memory of my father, Otis
Douglas Smith. He burns in my soul through this, and beyond this.
</P>
<P>
   And that's his real name. You can check it.

REELING IN RUSSIA 
By Fen Montaigne 
St. Martin's, 275 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early on in what is one of the most engaging and unique books
about post-Soviet Russia to emerge in recent years, Fen Montaigne
describes that vast country as ``an affliction, an incurable
habit.'' But his is not a novelistic world of tormented,
Dostoyevskian self-introspection.
</P>
<P>
   In three rugged months spent fly-fishing from Murmansk to
Magadan and beyond, Montaigne plunges into the method and madness
of an addictive world he has come to love through years of
reporting out of Moscow for the Philadelphia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   From deserted Stalinist labor camps with secret trout canals to
the depths of the Siberian taiga, Montaigne traverses some of the
world's most beautiful and least-seen terrain, experiencing a side
of Russia all but forgotten amid the literature of struggle and
rebirth after seven decades of communist rule. ``Reeling in
Russia'' _ part travel adventure, part window onto the soul of the
wild life of a country forever teetering on the brink of disaster _
is brimming with some of the most spellbinding and accurate
portraits ever of modern Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of this highly accessible book lies in Montaigne's
sense that to parse Russia, one must at some point escape the big
cities and venture into villages and wilderness. Montaigne is no
tea-drinking urban intellectual in need of the theater to
understand the fatalism and laughter-through-tears ethic that make
this country tick.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the hearty souls in his book, Montaigne is a
(itals)muzhik(unitals) _ a ``real'' man, swilling vodka, traveling
across roads resembling a lunar landscape, warding off poachers,
predatory artists, and intestinal parasites, and boldly striding
into the rough-and-tumble world of Klondike capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   In a tone engaged but distanced, and in a language denuded of
adornment, Montaigne details the lives of hermits and truckers,
fishermen and madmen. This is not an idyllic version of pastoral.
Montaigne writes, accurately, of a country awash in hopelessness,
alcoholism, and a conviction that rules are for the weak. But he
also shows the real Russia to be generous, friendly, and, at times,
hard-working.
</P>
<P>
   At a 19th-century nobleman's former country estate, converted
into an insane asylum where inmates live on subsistence-level
rations, a wheelchair-bound patient greets Montaigne by proffering
a treat of four apples. ``In Russia, we don't give a guest just
one,'' the patient smiles.
</P>
<P>
   The writer's friend Chumak, an extraordinarily foulmouthed but
endearing farmer in southern Russia, typifies the medieval
conditions of this former agricultural powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the depths of far eastern Siberia, scrappy, entrepreneurial
long-haul truckers who make their living transporting Korean
cookies to villages in the middle of nowhere take Montaigne along
for the ride, generously sharing provisions. These truckers, for
whom a breakdown in 50-degrees-below-zero winters can be deadly,
listen to their rickety Kamaz engines as carefully as a Bolshoi
Theater-goer does a symphony.
</P>
<P>
   And in a scene simply stunning for its beauty and rawness,
Montaigne tracks down a 72-year-old hermit in the Siberian taiga
who lives by trapping furs, fishing, and receiving occasional
provisions. In 1946 Fyodorovich was thrown into a nearby Stalinist
labor camp for the crime of visiting his mother after the war.
After serving his sentence, he simply stayed. ``I just got used to
it here,'' the friendly hermit tells Montaigne, whom he treats to
moonlit feasts and musings on life.
</P>
<P>
   Montaigne is not always the cultural anthropologist a journalist
should be, especially when he dismisses Soviet monuments and
slogans as nonsense or resorts to stale asides about the
Bolsheviks. And he is a novice of a fly-fisherman, maladroit in the
art of deceiving one's prey _ at least in Russia. But the blunt,
direct style that for most of his journey yields him few trout
serves him well as a narrator, and one need not be a fisherman or a
Russophile to gain pleasure from this book.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Montaigne describes himself as bitten by the
fishing bug, enraptured by the art of beguiling his quarry. But
what has really captured and enchanted Montaigne's soul is Russia.
His is an adventure of which well-heeled Western anglers _ kitted
out in costly accouterments and tangled up in expectations that the
world must be ordered and rational to make sense _ can only dream.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Hav Plenty is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
HAV PLENTY 
Written and directed by: Christopher Scott Cherot 
Starring: Christopher Scott Cherot, Chenoa Maxwell, Hill Harper,
Tammi Katherine Jones, Robinne Lee, Reginald James 
Running time: 88 minutes 
Rated: R (adult situations) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere within the mess that is ``Hav Plenty'' is a sweet,
funny film struggling to get out.
</P>
<P>
   This is apparent because ``Hav Plenty'' actually has a number of
sweet, funny moments, but far too few to make the film worth the
time and effort. That's a shame since it continues the positive
trend, begun last year with ``love jones'' and ``Soul Food,'' of
elevating the urban comedy beyond booty calls and boys in the
'hood.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, newcomer Christoper Scott Cherot, who wrote, directed,
and stars in the failed screwball comedy, should have found one job
he was good at, and stuck with it. He's spread himself too thin,
and just about every seam shows, with often clunky dialogue, flat
direction, and airless performances, save for Tammi Katherine
Jones's hilarious film debut, as one of the women eager to jump the
bones of Cherot's Lee Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is a would-be writer with a monster case of writer's block.
He's also homeless at the moment, resigned to keeping a roof over
his by housesitting and visiting friends. One of those friends is
Havilland Savage (Chenoa Maxwell, saddled with as absurb movie name
as you'll find), who is attractive, rich, and engaged to a annoying
boyfriend Michael (Hill Harper), an annoyingly pompous singer on
that rub-you-down, quiet storm R'n'B tip.
</P>
<P>
   When Hav invites Lee to ring in the New Year with her, things
begin to get complicated. Hav and Lee have that love-hate thing
going on, which, at least in the movies, always leads to happily
ever after. But before that, every woman in Lee's presence _ from
Hav's newly married sister, Leigh (a luminous Robinne Lee) to her
self-involved Francophile pal, Caroline (Jones) can't resist his
charms, whatever they may be. If anything, ``Hav Plenty'' seems
proof of the severe man-shortage plaguing many women. Sure, he's
attractive enough in a shaggy, uncombed sort of way. But really,
are there sisters out there clamoring for a man who doesn't have a
job, wears the same old sweater day-in and day out, and seems
relationship-phobic? It's every male fantasy: no matter how big a
waste of flesh a man is, he is endlessly desirable to any and all
women.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all of this might have been disgestible had Cherot not
resorted to the creaky tactic of speaking directly to the audience
_ a lot. With rare exception, this is a screenwriter's way of
plugging the plot holes and narrative failings his lack of
creativity could not. If a movie is any good, it usually doesn't
need one of the characters acting as the play-by-play announcer.
</P>
<P>
   The film's conclusion _ and the title's a dead giveaway _ is
cheap and unbelievable, and has the audacity to attempt a Profound
Statement about an artist's integrity vs. commercial success. Yeah,
right.
</P>

HOLBROOKE: AIDES SEE STRONGER US VOICE AT UN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton nominated Richard Holbrooke as
ambassador to the United Nations Thursday, to energize the US
foreign policy team as crises loom in Asia, the Balkans and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The current UN ambassador, Bill Richardson, has not provided the
punch Clinton wants, according to some administration officials.
``Richardson has not been dynamic or forceful, he's been solid and
competent,'' said one who, like others who have worked with
Richardson and Holbrooke, asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton chose Holbrooke, a hard-charging diplomat and investment
banker, because the United States is struggling to reform the
United Nations while prodding allies to take tougher approaches
against pariah countries such as Iraq. At the same time, the
administration wanted a forceful advocate to urge Congress to pay
back dues of more than $1 billion to the UN.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's experience in business will help ``shape a UN that
is leaner, more efficient, better equipped'' and prepared for the
21st century,'' Clinton said as he announced the nomination in a
Rose Garden ceremony Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. More to the point, ``Foreign policy is going to get a
lot more interesting with (Holbrooke) in the mix,'' said James
Gibney, managing editor of Foreign Policy, a publication that
Holbrooke once edited.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has openly campaigned for a high-level job foreign
policy job in the administration for two years. Officials who
followed the decision-making said the traits that initially hurt
him _ including an oversized ego and a reputation for stirring
things up _ worked to his advantage this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton and Gore want Holbrooke's energy and they'd like a new
approach on problems such as Kosovo and dealing with the UN
Security Council,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The ascension of Holbrooke, a friend of both Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, comes as the administration tries to recover
from several foreign policy setbacks. The Middle East process is
stalled, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's top advisers
fear a resurgence of terrorism against Israelis. Nuclear tests by
India in May caught the United States by surprise, despite what had
been regarded as a close relationship with the government in New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   At the UN, the administration is frustrated by European
governments' reluctance to impose harsh sanctions on Iraq. And many
of Clinton's advisers agree with Holbrooke's assertion that ethnic
fighting in the Kosovo province of Serbia will spill out to
neighboring countries unless the West quells the violence soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton Thursday called his foreign policy team
``cohesive,'' Albright, Secretary of Defense William Cohen and
National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger have at times
disagreed over such issues as how to contain Saddam Hussein and how
long to keep 8,000 US troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters Thursday, Richardson expressed
frustration at his failure to persuade Congress to pay the UN dues
owed by America. ``I thought I could make a difference,'' he said.
``I regret I couldn't be ambassador a little bit longer. The
president asked me about this (Energy Department) job. I'm
interested in domestic policy.... I'm not a professional foreign
policy person. I'm basically a politician and proud to be. I'd like
to run for office again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with India's new government this spring, Richardson
reportedly spent little time talking about the prospect of nuclear
tests and said the United States wanted to broaden its
relationship. Just a few weeks later, India conducted five atomic
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   US officials disagreed about exactly what Richardson had said
during his private meetings in New Delhi, and several said the
State Department had unfairly blamed him for failing to send clear
signals to India.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that in 1996, Albright resisted suggestions
that Holbrooke serve at the UN because of his reputation for
working on his own and bucking his superiors. But after a year and
a half as Secretary of State, Albright apparently feels comfortable
enough to share the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Since John F. Kennedy appointed Adlai Stevenson ambassador to
the UN in 1961, most political appointees in the post have been
made members of the Cabinet. Although in theory they report to the
secretary of state, they sit at Cabinet meetings and give their own
recommendations on policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's chatter today that Madeleine must be upset because she
might find herself challnged more often by Dick, but that's
nonsense,'' said James F. Hoge, editor of Foreign Affairs. ``There
is a strengthening of the foreign policy team, not a change in
direction. Dick brings quite a body of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As a diplomat, Holbrooke has been involved in major events from
the Paris Peace Talks that ended the Vietnam war to the Dayton
talks that brought a fragile peace to Bosnia. Currently the vice
president of Credit Suisse First Boston, he served as a young
diplomat under then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, worked as a
Peace Corps country director in Morocco, assistant secretary of
State for Asia and ambassador to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A devout believer in the UN, NATO and other organizations,
Holbrooke likes to quote one of the architects of European unity,
Jean Monnet, who said, ``Nothing is possible without men, but
nothing is lasting without institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans agree that without Holbrooke's
constant prodding, the Bosnian peace accord would not have been
signed in 1995. But not everyone is a fan of Holbrooke or the
peacekeeping mission he engineered.
</P>
<P>
   ``His crown jewel is a failure,'' James M. Inhofe, a Republican
from Oklahoma who chairs the Senate Armed Forces Readiness
Committee, said in an interview Thursday. Holbrooke, he said,
``wants to leave the troops in Bosnia until the policy works or
until everyone is worn out.''
</P>
<P>
   James Henderson, who monitors European policy at the cnservative
Heritage Foundation, cautioned against reading too much into the
nomination. ``This says as much as domestic policy as anything
else,'' he said. ``Holbrooke is positioning himself as Secretary of
State for the Gore administration, if that comes to pass.''

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the end was drawing near for the historic
antitobacco plan, three dozen Republican senators huddled Wednesday
in the ornate office of Senate majority leader Trent Lott,
searching for an ``exit strategy'' from the volatile issue.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers had saturated the airwaves with a $40 million
assault on the plan. The measure had mushroomed from a $368.5
billion blueprint to a $516 billion package stuffed with so many
special-interest extras that not even its staunchest supporters
would defend it in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   And House Speaker Newt Gingrich had recently sent a chilling
message to his Senate colleagues. With Republicans at risk of
losing control of the House in the November elections, Gingrich
wanted no part of the high-stakes debate over the plan to punish
the tobacco industry for the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't ignore the House on this,'' Senator Chuck Hagel, a
Nebraska Republican, said as he left the pivotal strategy session.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the sweeping plan aimed at curbing youth smoking
was dead. The Marlboro Man was still standing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Lott and Gringrich said they will try to move forward
a narrower, less costly tobacco bill, while supporters of the
Senate bill launched a prolonged effort to revive the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The continued skirmishing is part of a saga rich with
legislative infighting, political intrigue, and competing
presidential ambitions. And though the antitobacco plan's official
cause of death was listsed as a one-two parliamentary punch by
Senate Republican leaders and their allies, an examination of the
plan's brief, tumultuous life showed many other factors contributed
to its demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a classic case of everybody overreaching,'' said Mike
Moore, the Mississippi attorney general who led the effort to reach
a landmark settlement last year with the tobacco industry. ``They
loaded everything onto this like it was a Christmas tree, and it
couldn't handle the weight.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a year ago Saturday that Moore, the attorneys general
from 39 other states, and lawyers for smokers with tobacco-related
illnesses reached an agreement with the cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gave the industry what it wanted: financial stability
that would come with immunity from future class-action lawsuits and
a $5 billion annual cap for individual liability claims.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the cigarette companies agreed to pay $368.5
billion over 25 years to help states pay for smoking-related
medical costs and antismoking initiatives. The industry also would
stop most of its marketing practices, including the use of Joe
Camel and the Marlboro Man. And the Food and Drug Administration
would be granted authority to regulate nicotine as a drug, with the
power to ban it as early as 2010.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton was poised to seize the
issue as a centerpiece of his second-term agenda. As early as 1995,
Clinton's former consultant, Dick Morris, had begun trying to
interest the administration in the tobacco fight. One aide
described Morris's vigorous lobbying proceeding ``through back
doors and front doors and side doors and windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris had worked in Mississippi for trial lawyer Richard
Scruggs, polling on the tobacco issue in preparation for a
potential lawsuit. The polling, Morris said Thursday, showed that
even smokers favored greater restrictions on teenage smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Although Morris's mother died in 1993 from smoking-related
cancer, he said he raised the issue with the Clinton administration
in purely political terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a liberal issue,'' Morris said. ``I felt the
stuff we were doing on balancing the budget and welfare and crime
would stop the Republicans from opening an edge on their turf, but
I knew we would have to win the election on the left.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, by many accounts, a novel and potentially effective
idea, one with a clear villain and an obvious beneficiary _ take on
the mammoth tobacco companies for the sake of America's children.
</P>
<P>
   Morris drew then-FDA chief David Kessler into the fray, who
lobbied Vice President Al Gore for his support. With Gore as the
leader, the group made a strong case to Clinton in the spring of
1995. Gore, a Tennessee native, persuaded Clinton he could survive
the issue in the tobacco-growing states in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept grinding away at the president,'' said one senior
aide. By the summer, they won Clinton's support, and soon the
administration announced its plan to designate nicotine as a drug
and regulate it under the auspices of the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Clinton had a reelection issue. And by the time the
tobacco settlement unfolded last year, Clinton was positioning
himself as the leading antismoking president.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the accord, Clinton called on Congress to approve
it so he could sign it into law. But the settlement was never again
the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Lott said he would recuse himself from the
tobacco debate because Scruggs, who stands to make millions of
dollars in fees for helping Moore win the Mississipi case, is his
brother-in-law. Lott appointed a deputy, Senator Don Nickles,
Republican of Oklahoma, to handle the issue.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the tobacco plan was so broad that seven Senate
committees claimed jurisdiction over it. Several chairmen wrangled
behind-the-scenes for months for control of the bill before Senator
John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Commerce Committee,
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, who is considering running for president, the
assignment was a powerful opportunity to boost his national
profile. But in the Senate, where 15 other members have either
sought the presidency or expressed interest in running in 2000, the
job also stirred the competitive fires of some potential foes.
</P>
<P>
   One prospective GOP contender, Senator John Ashcroft of
Missouri, was the only member of the Commerce Committee to oppose
the tobacco bill when the panel approved it 19-1 in April. And
Ashcroft joined a former Republican presidential aspirant, Senator
Phil Gramm of Texas, in leading the fight against the measure on
the Senate floor. ``There's no question some senators couldn't
stand the thought of McCain succeeding,'' said a senior Senate
aide.
</P>
<P>
   But other opposition arose. When McCain's bill cleared the
committee, it dwarfed last year's settlement with the states,
raising the price by nearly $150 billion and removing immunity from
future class-action suits.

 WASHINGTON: ... action suits.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Public health activists pushed for the more punitive provisions,
a tactic that may have backfired. ``Their arrogance overtook
them,'' said John Coale, a Washington lawyer who helped negotiate
last year's settlement on behalf of smokers with tobacco-related
illnesses. ``Nothing was enough for them, and they drove away the
tobacco companies, who you need if want to address youth smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a week after McCain's bill passed in the committee, the
tobacco industry vowed to kill the measure. That was no idle threat
on Capitol Hill, where big tobacco has long succeeded in defeating
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   With 200 lobbyists on its payroll _ or two for each of the 100
senators _ the industry quickly went to work. But the lobbyists
needed help, and the industry soon launched an unprecedented
advertising blitz to turn voters against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was modeled after the campaign used by business
groups to kill Clinton's sweeping health-care proposal in 1994,
demonizing the tobacco plan as big-government intrusion and a
massive tax hike. In the health campaign, business groups spent an
estimated $14 million on television commercials featuring Harry and
Louise, two average people worried about the cost and impact of the
president's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But the tobacco industry nearly tripled the size of the Harry
and Louise blitz, saturating targeted areas with the campaign.
``Washington's tobacco legislation, what's in it for you?'' the
commercials said. ``Half a trillion dollars in new taxes, new
federal spending, cigarettes at $5 a pack, creating a black market.
No wonder it's opposed by millions of hard-working Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign was only the start. In a surprising tactic, the
industry ads attacked McCain, even though he seemed an unlikely
target as a former prisoner of war in the Vietnam War whom many
consider a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the strategy to go after McCain clearer than in the
first-primary state of New Hampshire. ``If you see Senator McCain,
ask him why he wants to sock consumers with $500 billion in new
taxes,'' said one radio ad.
</P>
<P>
   The spot was paid for by the Virginia-based National Smokers
Alliance, which calls itself a ``grass-roots'' organization with 3
million smokers. In fact, the National Smokers Alliance receives
significant funding from the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's strategy reveals much about the way the industry
defeated the bill. The group was primarily responsible for a
massive letter-writing campaign against the legislation. But the
alliance also paid for print and radio advertisements in many
states, including several states with early presidential primaries
and caucuses, such as New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina. The
ads also aired in tobacco-growing states, such as Kentucky, and
swing states represented by senators who could play a key role in
the vote, such as Kansas and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Auxier, senior vice president of the National Smokers
Alliance, said his group's strategy was to change the debate from
being about underage smoking into one about a tax hike. ``We
exposed enough of it so the US Senate came around,'' Auxier said
Thursday. ``I couldn't be happier.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign provided critical support for Ashcroft, Gramm, and
Nickles as they blasted the measure on the Senate floor as the
worst tax-and-spend fiasco in decades.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the tobacco industry flooded Republicans with
campaign contributions. In the current campaign cycle, as of April
1, the industry gave $3.4 million to Republicans and $933,016 to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions had an impact on the senators, according to
Public Citizen, a watchdog group. The organization found that the
34 senators who voted mostly in favor of the tobacco industry
received seven times as much political action committee money as
the 40 senators who voted against the industry most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain's fragile coalition slowly crumbled. As the
Senate's GOP majority passed a series of amendments by Gramm,
Ashcroft, and other foes of the measure, the bill's breadth and
cost rose, alienating some of the centrists McCain and his allies
were counting on.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters said one of the most damaging amendments,
sponsored by Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican,
stripped a provision that would have capped the tobacco industry's
annual liability from individual lawsuits at $8 billion. Critics
said the amendment could bankrupt the tobacco industry, a major
concern to a dozen senators from tobacco-growing states, many of
whom once supported the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain people went south when that vote took place,'' said
Senator John F. Kerry, the Democratic point man on McCain's bill.
``They were part of the critical coalition we need to pull back
together.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, when Lott summoned the GOP senators to his office
to consider killing the bill, Republican pollster Linda DiVall had
completed a survey that ran counter to nearly every poll on the
tobacco issue.
</P>
<P>
   DiVall's findings showed respondents, by a margin of 57 percent
to 34 percent, opposed the McCain bill when they were told it would
raise the price of cigarettes by $1.10 a pack over five years and
expand the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   After months of surveys showing overwhelming support for
McCain's bill, several Republican senators cited the DiVall poll in
expressing their opposition to the measure after meeting with Lott.
</P>
<P>
   They rejected a warning made during the meeting by Senator
Olympia Snowe of Maine, who cautioned that Republicans would suffer
at the polls in November if they killed the bill. ``This is our
only opportunity to t a comprehensive settlement that does
something about smoking in America,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many of her GOP colleagues believed they had done enough.
``The important thing is that we tried to deal with this issue as
best we could in a divided Senate,'' said Florida Senator Connie
Mack. ``Was it a pretty sight? No. But we made a significant
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lott's meeting, White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles
tried to salvage the bill by placing two urgent calls to the
majority leader to lay out the administration's position in
uncharacteristically pointed tones. ``Bowles said you're doing the
wrong thing for the wrong reasons, and we're going to kick you
around real hard,'' said a senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton was speed-dialing to personally lobby
11 senators _ 10 Republicans and a Democrat. White House aides,
declining to divulge the identities of those called, said he won
most of those votes, but not all.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who called the McCain
bill ``totally unacceptable'' after the Commerce Committee approved
it, emerged as one of its strongest supporters as he pursued a
strategy that called for passing the measure, so a better plan
could be designed in a conference committee with the House.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain resigned himself to the bill's death, Kennedy
and Kerry Thursday vowed to try to revive the measure, which
earlier had survived numerous near-death experiences.
</P>
<P>
   And Moore, the Mississippi attorney general, said public support
for the plan could make it possible. ``They could pronounce this
thing dead, dig a grave for it, put the corpse in the ground, and
we still could dig it back up,'' he said. ``Look how many times
we've done it already.''

VIRTUAL UNREALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hide the Big Dig? Put the Boston Garden demolition
under wraps?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, why not build a ``Truman Show'' kind of set when the
Democratic National Committee comes to town next week?
</P>
<P>
   Create a virtual Boston. That will make it even easier to
promote the ideal city that doesn't exist _ instead of the
charmingly imperfect one that does.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the city's best foot forward is a noble goal in the
effort to convince the DNC to pick Boston for its year 2000
convention. Conventions are big business and spinoff from a
national political convention is estimated at $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   But how much of our collective soul should we sell to grab it?
And if we really want to shield DNC honchos from the city's
negative points, why stop the cover-up at the Big Dig or the
Garden's sad and dusty remains?
</P>
<P>
   Throw a tarp on lower Washington Street, where what's left of
the Combat Zone spills into an unsightly hodgepodge between the
Lafayette Hotel and Kneeland Street. And while we're at it, drape
another tarp over graceless Kenmore Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Garden is delightful. But the Boston Common,
especially bordering Tremont Street, is a bit ragged. Surely, we
need to spruce it up. If we can't find temporary homes for the
homeless who camp out there, maybe we can outfit them in camouflage
suits _ the better to blend in with the greenery.
</P>
<P>
   There's good food and atmosphere, not to mention Paul Revere's
house, in the North End. But there are also truckloads of trash.
Better keep the DNC off the Freedom Trail and out of that Boston
neighborhood _ as well as most others, if you fear reality.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever walked through Haymarket after the pushcart
vendors are done for the day? If so, you have heard the sound of
scampering feet and seen the small shadows _ cast not by children,
but by rats. That's another eyesore we wouldn't want to foist upon
the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   And rats aren't the only living creatures worthy of disguise. We
can fill up our perfect virtual city with perfect virtual people.
For instance: how about a mayor who speaks poetry instead of _ how
shall we put it _ prose?
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, that's ridiculous. Our plain-speaking mayor, is, in
fact, the driving force behind Boston's bid. It takes
nuts-and-bolts planning and old-fashioned strategizing, not flights
of fanciful speech or thinking, to sell a city, thank goodness.
</P>
<P>
   It's just as ridiculous for the city to try to ignore the
elephant in the living room that is known as the Big Dig. Anyone
who sets car or foot in the city knows it's impossible to avoid,
let alone ignore. And the 50 or so DNC represenatives who will
begin arriving Monday, will quickly find that out, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, perhaps this is the appropriate moment to suggest that
whatever the cost and aggravation of this massive public works
project, the planning behind it seems to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Cranes dot the skyline. Gaping holes loom behind safety
barriers. At times it seems the city has been taken over by
construction workers and their plodding equipment. Even so, Boston
is not gridlocked. At least not every moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to hide it,'' insists Kelley Quinn, one of
the city officials heading the effort to woo the DNC. ``The reality
is, I agree that psychologically it could be a barrier, but
physically it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Guzzi, president of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce,
says the convention bid has allowed the business and political
communities to rally in a very positive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to get it,'' says Guzzi. But if
Boston doesn't win this bid, he and others believe politics with a
capital ``P,'' not logistics will be the more likely reason.
</P>
<P>
   Six other cities besides Boston are in the mix for the DNC
convention: Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New Orleans,
and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The other cities will, doubtless, be doing what Boston is doing,
too. As Patrick Moscaritolo, who heads the Greater Boston
Convention and Visitors Bureau, points out, ``In any marketing
campaign, you always show your top assets. The `wows.'''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger trick is to turn an ``ow'' into a ``wow.'' Perhaps a
Big Dig theme park?

HOLBROOKE: AIDES SEE STRONGER US VOICE AT UN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton nominated Richard Holbrooke as
ambassador to the United Nations Thursday, to energize the US
foreign policy team as crises loom in Asia, the Balkans and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The current UN ambassador, Bill Richardson, has not provided the
punch Clinton wants, according to some administration officials.
``Richardson has not been dynamic or forceful, he's been solid and
competent,'' said one who, like others who have worked with
Richardson and Holbrooke, asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton chose Holbrooke, a hard-charging diplomat and investment
banker, because the United States is struggling to reform the
United Nations while prodding allies to take tougher approaches
against pariah countries such as Iraq. At the same time, the
administration wanted a forceful advocate to urge Congress to pay
back dues of more than $1 billion to the UN.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's experience in business will help ``shape a UN that
is leaner, more efficient, better equipped'' and prepared for the
21st century,'' Clinton said as he announced the nomination in a
Rose Garden ceremony Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. More to the point, ``Foreign policy is going to get a
lot more interesting with (Holbrooke) in the mix,'' said James
Gibney, managing editor of Foreign Policy, a publication that
Holbrooke once edited.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has openly campaigned for a high-level job foreign
policy job in the administration for two years. Officials who
followed the decision-making said the traits that initially hurt
him _ including an oversized ego and a reputation for stirring
things up _ worked to his advantage this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton and Gore want Holbrooke's energy and they'd like a new
approach on problems such as Kosovo and dealing with the UN
Security Council,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The ascension of Holbrooke, a friend of both Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, comes as the administration tries to recover
from several foreign policy setbacks. The Middle East process is
stalled, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's top advisers
fear a resurgence of terrorism against Israelis. Nuclear tests by
India in May caught the United States by surprise, despite what had
been regarded as a close relationship with the government in New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   At the UN, the administration is frustrated by European
governments' reluctance to impose harsh sanctions on Iraq. And many
of Clinton's advisers agree with Holbrooke's assertion that ethnic
fighting in the Kosovo province of Serbia will spill out to
neighboring countries unless the West quells the violence soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton Thursday called his foreign policy team
``cohesive,'' Albright, Secretary of Defense William Cohen and
National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger have at times
disagreed over such issues as how to contain Saddam Hussein and how
long to keep 8,000 US troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters Thursday, Richardson expressed
frustration at his failure to persuade Congress to pay the UN dues
owed by America. ``I thought I could make a difference,'' he said.
``I regret I couldn't be ambassador a little bit longer. The
president asked me about this (Energy Department) job. I'm
interested in domestic policy.... I'm not a professional foreign
policy person. I'm basically a politician and proud to be. I'd like
to run for office again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with India's new government this spring, Richardson
reportedly spent little time talking about the prospect of nuclear
tests and said the United States wanted to broaden its
relationship. Just a few weeks later, India conducted five atomic
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   US officials disagreed about exactly what Richardson had said
during his private meetings in New Delhi, and several said the
State Department had unfairly blamed him for failing to send clear
signals to India.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that in 1996, Albright resisted suggestions
that Holbrooke serve at the UN because of his reputation for
working on his own and bucking his superiors. But after a year and
a half as Secretary of State, Albright apparently feels comfortable
enough to share the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Since John F. Kennedy appointed Adlai Stevenson ambassador to
the UN in 1961, most political appointees in the post have been
made members of the Cabinet. Although in theory they report to the
secretary of state, they sit at Cabinet meetings and give their own
recommendations on policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's chatter today that Madeleine must be upset because she
might find herself challnged more often by Dick, but that's
nonsense,'' said James F. Hoge, editor of Foreign Affairs. ``There
is a strengthening of the foreign policy team, not a change in
direction. Dick brings quite a body of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As a diplomat, Holbrooke has been involved in major events from
the Paris Peace Talks that ended the Vietnam war to the Dayton
talks that brought a fragile peace to Bosnia. Currently the vice
president of Credit Suisse First Boston, he served as a young
diplomat under then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, worked as a
Peace Corps country director in Morocco, assistant secretary of
State for Asia and ambassador to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A devout believer in the UN, NATO and other organizations,
Holbrooke likes to quote one of the architects of European unity,
Jean Monnet, who said, ``Nothing is possible without men, but
nothing is lasting without institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans agree that without Holbrooke's
constant prodding, the Bosnian peace accord would not have been
signed in 1995. But not everyone is a fan of Holbrooke or the
peacekeeping mission he engineered.
</P>
<P>
   ``His crown jewel is a failure,'' James M. Inhofe, a Republican
from Oklahoma who chairs the Senate Armed Forces Readiness
Committee, said in an interview Thursday. Holbrooke, he said,
``wants to leave the troops in Bosnia until the policy works or
until everyone is worn out.''
</P>
<P>
   James Henderson, who monitors European policy at the cnservative
Heritage Foundation, cautioned against reading too much into the
nomination. ``This says as much as domestic policy as anything
else,'' he said. ``Holbrooke is positioning himself as Secretary of
State for the Gore administration, if that comes to pass.''

   WASHINGTON _ As the end was drawing near for the historic
antitobacco plan, three dozen Republican senators huddled Wednesday
in the ornate office of Senate majority leader Trent Lott,
searching for an ``exit strategy'' from the volatile issue.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers had saturated the airwaves with a $40 million
assault on the plan. The measure had mushroomed from a $368.5
billion blueprint to a $516 billion package stuffed with so many
special-interest extras that not even its staunchest supporters
would defend it in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   And House Speaker Newt Gingrich had recently sent a chilling
message to his Senate colleagues. With Republicans at risk of
losing control of the House in the November elections, Gingrich
wanted no part of the high-stakes debate over the plan to punish
the tobacco industry for the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't ignore the House on this,'' Senator Chuck Hagel, a
Nebraska Republican, said as he left the pivotal strategy session.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the sweeping plan aimed at curbing youth smoking
was dead. The Marlboro Man was still standing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Lott and Gringrich said they will try to move forward
a narrower, less costly tobacco bill, while supporters of the
Senate bill launched a prolonged effort to revive the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The continued skirmishing is part of a saga rich with
legislative infighting, political intrigue, and competing
presidential ambitions. And though the antitobacco plan's official
cause of death was listsed as a one-two parliamentary punch by
Senate Republican leaders and their allies, an examination of the
plan's brief, tumultuous life showed many other factors contributed
to its demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a classic case of everybody overreaching,'' said Mike
Moore, the Mississippi attorney general who led the effort to reach
a landmark settlement last year with the tobacco industry. ``They
loaded everything onto this like it was a Christmas tree, and it
couldn't handle the weight.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a year ago Saturday that Moore, the attorneys general
from 39 other states, and lawyers for smokers with tobacco-related
illnesses reached an agreement with the cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gave the industry what it wanted: financial stability
that would come with immunity from future class-action lawsuits and
a $5 billion annual cap for individual liability claims.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the cigarette companies agreed to pay $368.5
billion over 25 years to help states pay for smoking-related
medical costs and antismoking initiatives. The industry also would
stop most of its marketing practices, including the use of Joe
Camel and the Marlboro Man. And the Food and Drug Administration
would be granted authority to regulate nicotine as a drug, with the
power to ban it as early as 2010.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton was poised to seize the
issue as a centerpiece of his second-term agenda. As early as 1995,
Clinton's former consultant, Dick Morris, had begun trying to
interest the administration in the tobacco fight. One aide
described Morris's vigorous lobbying proceeding ``through back
doors and front doors and side doors and windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris had worked in Mississippi for trial lawyer Richard
Scruggs, polling on the tobacco issue in preparation for a
potential lawsuit. The polling, Morris said Thursday, showed that
even smokers favored greater restrictions on teenage smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Although Morris's mother died in 1993 from smoking-related
cancer, he said he raised the issue with the Clinton administration
in purely political terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a liberal issue,'' Morris said. ``I felt the
stuff we were doing on balancing the budget and welfare and crime
would stop the Republicans from opening an edge on their turf, but
I knew we would have to win the election on the left.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, by many accounts, a novel and potentially effective
idea, one with a clear villain and an obvious beneficiary _ take on
the mammoth tobacco companies for the sake of America's children.
</P>
<P>
   Morris drew then-FDA chief David Kessler into the fray, who
lobbied Vice President Al Gore for his support. With Gore as the
leader, the group made a strong case to Clinton in the spring of
1995. Gore, a Tennessee native, persuaded Clinton he could survive
the issue in the tobacco-growing states in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept grinding away at the president,'' said one senior
aide. By the summer, they won Clinton's support, and soon the
administration announced its plan to designate nicotine as a drug
and regulate it under the auspices of the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Clinton had a reelection issue. And by the time the
tobacco settlement unfolded last year, Clinton was positioning
himself as the leading antismoking president.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the accord, Clinton called on Congress to approve
it so he could sign it into law. But the settlement was never again
the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Lott said he would recuse himself from the
tobacco debate because Scruggs, who stands to make millions of
dollars in fees for helping Moore win the Mississipi case, is his
brother-in-law. Lott appointed a deputy, Senator Don Nickles,
Republican of Oklahoma, to handle the issue.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the tobacco plan was so broad that seven Senate
committees claimed jurisdiction over it. Several chairmen wrangled
behind-the-scenes for months for control of the bill before Senator
John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Commerce Committee,
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, who is considering running for president, the
assignment was a powerful opportunity to boost his national
profile. But in the Senate, where 15 other members have either
sought the presidency or expressed interest in running in 2000, the
job also stirred the competitive fires of some potential foes.
</P>
<P>
   One prospective GOP contender, Senator John Ashcroft of
Missouri, was the only member of the Commerce Committee to oppose
the tobacco bill when the panel approved it 19-1 in April. And
Ashcroft joined a former Republican presidential aspirant, Senator
Phil Gramm of Texas, in leading the fight against the measure on
the Senate floor. ``There's no question some senators couldn't
stand the thought of McCain succeeding,'' said a senior Senate
aide.
</P>
<P>
   But other opposition arose. When McCain's bill cleared the
committee, it dwarfed last year's settlement with the states,
raising the price by nearly $150 billion and removing immunity from
future class-action suits.

US TO PRESS CHINA QUIETLY ON DISSIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a significant tactical shift, President Clinton
will press his demands for the release of over a dozen Chinese
dissidents at next week's summit in China in closed meetings, not
in the media.
</P>
<P>
   After years of wrangling publically with China over human
rights, the administration has decided to take a different approach
for the nine-day summit, which starts June 26. This stance is based
in part on the fact that China no longer holds dissidents who are
well-known outside of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The change is also an admission that the old US policy did not
work. As celebrated dissidents were freed from prison, others were
put behind bars. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will stress that Washington wants basic legal reforms in China, not
simply a trickle of prisoner releases in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Once they settled in the United States, many of the former
dissidents lost their effectiveness as protesters. They spent more
of their time in school or making money or squabbling among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China continues to release people on the condition that
they go into exile, even the administration realizes they can't
point to that as a real sign of success,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk,
Washington director of Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the administration has worked with non-governmental
groups in compiling a high-priority list of dissidents to be freed.
But their names have not been released. This is in sharp contrast
to last fall's Sino-American summit in Washington, when the White
House made no secret of its desire to see the release of Wei
Jingsheng and Wang Dan, prominent democracy activists.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wei and Wang were exiled to the United States after the
summit, supposedly because of their deteriorating health. Last
year, under pressure from the United States, China revised its laws
so that ``counter-revolutionary'' activities are no long illegal.
In other words, many of the demonstrators jailed after the 1989
protest at Tiananmen Square did not commit crimes after all _ but
the revision is not retroactive.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, the Chinese government made it illegal to
``endanger state security.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese prison cells are filled with other political prisoners.
By the government's count, some 2,200 remain locked up. The Clinton
administration has put special emphasis on several of them because
of the severity of their sentences or the unjust circumstances
surrounding their arrests. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _Liu Nianchun, a labor activist who was arrested in 1995 after
petitioning the National People's Congress to ``rectify'' human
rights abuses. Even though Liu's three-year sentence should have
ended last month, he is being detained in a ``re-education through
labor camp'' outside of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   _Chen Longde, a human rights worker who was arrested in 1996 for
writing to the People's Congress about corruption and lack of
democracy. After suffering torture by electric shocks and beatings,
Chen jumped from a two-story platform at a labor camp. Barely
mobile because of two broken hips and a damaged kidney, he is still
forced to do labor, according to Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   _Gau Yu, a journalist who was arrested in 1993 for writing in
Hong Kong publications about disputes among senior Chinese
officials. She was sentenced to six years for revealing ``state
secrets,'' and friends say she is in poor health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government thinks that journalism is propaganda,
and so all real journalists are dissidents and criminals,'' said
Wang Juntao, a friend and former colleague of Gau Yu. They were in
the same prison before Wang was exiled in 1994. This summer, he is
living in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   There are also people like Ngawang Choephel _ hardly a household
name here. Choephel, who who spent the 1992-93 academic year
studying and teaching ethnomusicology at Middlebury College in
Vermont on a Fulbright scholarship, was unfairly imprisoned by
China two years ago, according to US officials.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1995 trip to Tibet, his homeland, he worked on a
documentary about music and dance. Chinese authorities arrested him
and charged him with spying. He was sentenced in 1996 to 18 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Friends in Vermont worry about Choephel (pronounced Chope-pell).
They describe him as an artist who did not dwell on politics. ``The
charges are completely made up, fake, false, and baseless,'' said
Jon Barlow, who took a music workshop with Choephel while at
Middlebury.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to make an example of Tibetian political prisoners, China
rarely, if ever, releases them before their sentences end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since we heard about his arrest, we've been trying in
every conceivable way to try to convince the Chinese they made a
grave mistake,'' said Tim Rieser, an aide to Patrick Leahy of
Vermont, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Operations
Committee. Leahy mentioned the case in a 1996 meeting in Beijing
with top Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups are divided about whether the US government
should concentrate on behind-the-scenes pleas for the release of
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to use quiet diplomacy in the months leading up
to the summit, but the administration has used quiet diplomacy for
years in Choephel's case and it hasn't worked,'' said John Ackerly,
president of the Internatioinal Campaign for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have assured foreign diplomats that fewer
political dissidents are being imprisoned than in previous years,
according to US officials. While that might well be true, the
Chinese appear to be sending more dissidents to the
``re-education'' camps. The Clinton administration says 200,000
Chinese are in such places. Aides say Clinton and Albright will
complain to President Jiang Zemin and other officials about the
widespread use of the camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really nasty thing about the Chinese system is that as
they pass amendments for criminal procedure law, they rely
increasingly on administrative justice, which doesn't have due
process,'' said an official familiar with China.
</P>
<P>
   The Jiang government maintains that the camps are useful for
turning misfits into productive citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Tong Yi served as a secretary and researcher to Wei Jingshen,
the dissident. While Wei was imprisoned, she was dispatched to a
camp for more than two years. She never had a chance to dispute the
charges against her or to appeal her conviction.
</P>
<P>
   At the camp, Yi says she was beaten for refusing to work more
than eight hours a day. She was forced to do she calls ``useless
busy work'' yanking the threads from old clothes. But she considers
herself lucky. She says that friends worked in grimy factories,
making clothes and batteries for export.
</P>
<P>
   The only re-education occurred when visitors toured the sites
and the guards pretended to teach lessons in Communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The re-education is really a joke,'' says Yi, 30, who was
released two years ago and went into exile in New York. ``The irony
is that even though it's called re-education, the police used all
the labor to make more profits.''

 WASHINGTON: ... action suits.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Public health activists pushed for the more punitive provisions,
a tactic that may have backfired. ``Their arrogance overtook
them,'' said John Coale, a Washington lawyer who helped negotiate
last year's settlement on behalf of smokers with tobacco-related
illnesses. ``Nothing was enough for them, and they drove away the
tobacco companies, who you need if want to address youth smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a week after McCain's bill passed in the committee, the
tobacco industry vowed to kill the measure. That was no idle threat
on Capitol Hill, where big tobacco has long succeeded in defeating
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   With 200 lobbyists on its payroll _ or two for each of the 100
senators _ the industry quickly went to work. But the lobbyists
needed help, and the industry soon launched an unprecedented
advertising blitz to turn voters against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was modeled after the campaign used by business
groups to kill Clinton's sweeping health-care proposal in 1994,
demonizing the tobacco plan as big-government intrusion and a
massive tax hike. In the health campaign, business groups spent an
estimated $14 million on television commercials featuring Harry and
Louise, two average people worried about the cost and impact of the
president's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But the tobacco industry nearly tripled the size of the Harry
and Louise blitz, saturating targeted areas with the campaign.
``Washington's tobacco legislation, what's in it for you?'' the
commercials said. ``Half a trillion dollars in new taxes, new
federal spending, cigarettes at $5 a pack, creating a black market.
No wonder it's opposed by millions of hard-working Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign was only the start. In a surprising tactic, the
industry ads attacked McCain, even though he seemed an unlikely
target as a former prisoner of war in the Vietnam War whom many
consider a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the strategy to go after McCain clearer than in the
first-primary state of New Hampshire. ``If you see Senator McCain,
ask him why he wants to sock consumers with $500 billion in new
taxes,'' said one radio ad.
</P>
<P>
   The spot was paid for by the Virginia-based National Smokers
Alliance, which calls itself a ``grass-roots'' organization with 3
million smokers. In fact, the National Smokers Alliance receives
significant funding from the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's strategy reveals much about the way the industry
defeated the bill. The group was primarily responsible for a
massive letter-writing campaign against the legislation. But the
alliance also paid for print and radio advertisements in many
states, including several states with early presidential primaries
and caucuses, such as New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina. The
ads also aired in tobacco-growing states, such as Kentucky, and
swing states represented by senators who could play a key role in
the vote, such as Kansas and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Auxier, senior vice president of the National Smokers
Alliance, said his group's strategy was to change the debate from
being about underage smoking into one about a tax hike. ``We
exposed enough of it so the US Senate came around,'' Auxier said
Thursday. ``I couldn't be happier.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign provided critical support for Ashcroft, Gramm, and
Nickles as they blasted the measure on the Senate floor as the
worst tax-and-spend fiasco in decades.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the tobacco industry flooded Republicans with
campaign contributions. In the current campaign cycle, as of April
1, the industry gave $3.4 million to Republicans and $933,016 to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions had an impact on the senators, according to
Public Citizen, a watchdog group. The organization found that the
34 senators who voted mostly in favor of the tobacco industry
received seven times as much political action committee money as
the 40 senators who voted against the industry most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain's fragile coalition slowly crumbled. As the
Senate's GOP majority passed a series of amendments by Gramm,
Ashcroft, and other foes of the measure, the bill's breadth and
cost rose, alienating some of the centrists McCain and his allies
were counting on.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters said one of the most damaging amendments,
sponsored by Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican,
stripped a provision that would have capped the tobacco industry's
annual liability from individual lawsuits at $8 billion. Critics
said the amendment could bankrupt the tobacco industry, a major
concern to a dozen senators from tobacco-growing states, many of
whom once supported the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain people went south when that vote took place,'' said
Senator John F. Kerry, the Democratic point man on McCain's bill.
``They were part of the critical coalition we need to pull back
together.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, when Lott summoned the GOP senators to his office
to consider killing the bill, Republican pollster Linda DiVall had
completed a survey that ran counter to nearly every poll on the
tobacco issue.
</P>
<P>
   DiVall's findings showed respondents, by a margin of 57 percent
to 34 percent, opposed the McCain bill when they were told it would
raise the price of cigarettes by $1.10 a pack over five years and
expand the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   After months of surveys showing overwhelming support for
McCain's bill, several Republican senators cited the DiVall poll in
expressing their opposition to the measure after meeting with Lott.
</P>
<P>
   They rejected a warning made during the meeting by Senator
Olympia Snowe of Maine, who cautioned that Republicans would suffer
at the polls in November if they killed the bill. ``This is our
only opportunity to get a comprehensive settlement that does
something about smoking in America,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many of her GOP colleagues believed they had done enough.
``The important thing is that we tried to deal with this issue as
best we could in a divided Senate,'' said Florida Senator Connie
Mack. ``Was it a pretty sight? No. But we made a significant
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lott's meeting, White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles
tried to salvage the bill by placing two urgent calls to the
majority leader to lay out the administration's position in
uncharacteristically pointed tones. ``Bowles said you're doing the
wrong thing for the wrong reasons, and we're going to kick you
around real hard,'' said a senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton was speed-dialing to personally lobby
11 senators _ 10 Republicans and a Democrat. White House aides,
declining to divulge the identities of those called, said he won
most of those votes, but not all.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who called the McCain
bill ``totally unacceptable'' after the Commerce Committee approved
it, emerged as one of its strongest supporters as he pursued a
strategy that called for passing the measure, so a better plan
could be designed in a conference committee with the House.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain resigned himself to the bill's death, Kennedy
and Kerry Thursday vowed to try to revive the measure, which
earlier had survived numerous near-death experiences.
</P>
<P>
   And Moore, the Mississippi attorney general, said public support
for the plan could make it possible. ``They could pronounce this
thing dead, dig a grave for it, put the corpse in the ground, and
we still could dig it back up,'' he said. ``Look how many times
we've done it already.''

JAPAN'S SINKING ECONOMY, AND ITS DRAG ON THE US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Japan's damaged economy suffers from the banking equivalent of a
hole in the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The once mighty financial houses that bankrolled Asia's
decade-long growth spurt have a deep dark secret: bad loans. Debts
that are unlikely to be repaid have rotted out the underpinning.
With the Japanese yen spiralling down against the dollar, the
United States this week was frightened into a dramatic policy
shift.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury began buying yen with dollars _ propping up the
currency of the world's second-largest economy. Uncle Sam's timely
rescue snapped a stock market plunge, triggering a nifty rally on
the world exchanges. We still don't know all that the Clinton
administration extracted from Japan's sclerotic government in terms
of agreements to reform the Japanese economy. But you can only
throw so many dollars into a hole in the boat. The recurring
problem is still Japan's inability to clean up its banking system.
Like the savings and loan collapse that the US endured a decade
back, corruption and overconfidence in a key banking sector can sow
tremendous damage throughout what had been a thriving economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's political system is a precariously balanced house of
cards. Decades-long customs of bribery, payoff, winking at
regulations, and overly cozy relationships between bureaucrats on
one hand and businessmen or gangsters on the other have minimized
the cleansing and purgative effects of market forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashimoto government is wildly unpopular. Right now there is
insufficient political cohesion. No leader or party can effectively
take charge. The interests that profit off construction projects
have engineered a massive government public works splurge. But that
does nothing for banking reform.
</P>
<P>
   Until Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin convinced President
Clinton to approve the dollar-for-yen emergency bailout, the US
emphasis had been on trying to knuckle Tokyo into initiating a big
tax cut to spur domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese consumer is different from the American
consumer,'' explained a Japanese government official Wednesday. For
reasons of culture, history, and social custom, the Japanese save
more money than do Americans. The United States argued that
increased demand would kick-start the economy, increase job
creation and domestic bank lending, as well as reduce the export to
the US of distress-sale manufactured goods, whose low prices
undercut US products.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese don't think US-style tax cuts would cut loose a
lot of wild-and-crazy domestic consumption. ``The Japanese consumer
would take his tax cut money and save it,'' said a Japanese
official. The spending habits of Asians have more influence here
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Companies and consumers in Asia were buying a lot of stuff that
Americans manufacture. But the downward spiral caused those
customers to stop buying. That slump in turn has clipped profits of
US firms, and fears of that sort of downward spiral chopped almost
600 points off the Dow Jones from the May 13 highpoint of 9211,
before Wednesday's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of 3M Co., one of America's largest manufacturing
firms, amplified in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal. One sixth of
3M's revenue, and nearly one-quarter of its earnings last year came
from Asia. But weakness in Asian sales, aggravated by currency
shifts, forced 3M to warn three times in the last six months that
sales and profits were being hurt by the Asian turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   With the yen sinking, Asian customers had to pay higher and
higher prices for the same product. ``The situation in Asia is
deeper and longer than we had anticipated,'' 3M chairman L.D.
De-Simone told the Journal. ``And we had anticipated a poor
situation.'' 3M estimates its earnings will drop 10 percent as a
result, which may lead to layoffs here among the 75,000 employees.
And the stock got walloped, dropping nearly 7 percent one day this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had seen the bottom and that it wasn't going
anywhere lower,'' DeSimone said. ``That is not the case now.'' He
doubts things can turn around before year's end. The Asian turmoil
has already affected some New England companies. Many of the
region's high tech firms will be unable to replace Asian customers
who cancel orders. That means less business for the chip suppliers,
board fabricators, the parcel guy who trucks cartons to the
airport, the baggage handler at Logan. Yet there may be some
upside.
</P>
<P>
   Outfits like Fidelity are expanding their operations in Japan,
thanks to pressure exerted by the Clinton administration. And many
Japanese will presumably decide to shove their money into American
stocks and mutual funds, preferring to ride out the typhoon in the
safer harbor of US investments.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're selling mutual funds in Tokyo, you may find
customers. But if you're selling plywood or computers or swordfish,
you're not selling there what you sold last year. If you're the 3M
guy, or one of his about-to-be-laid-off workers, you're thinking
all this is going to get worse before it gets better.

</P>
<P>
   This morning I woke up in a hospital bed. Through the window
next to my bed and I could see tiny wisps of clouds in a delicate
pattern that again reminded me of God's marvelous handiwork. I felt
blessed to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, I was in the same hospital (on the same floor,
with the same gentle nurses) to have an orange-sized tumor removed
from my colon. The surgery went well and in five days I was home.
The cancer had passed through the wall of the colon, but had not
entered my lymph system. Doctors debated about whether I should
take chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Some said that since I had a 70 percent chance of recovery, I
was taking a needless risk of infection by taking a treatment that
would weaken my resistance to disease, and which at best could push
my survival odds only to 75 percent. Others said I was healthy
enough to take the risk, so I did.
</P>
<P>
   But last week I had to have emergency surgery because my body
had been invaded by a rare bacteria, a disease called necrotizing
fasciitis, that actually eats one's flesh and can be fatal.
Surgeons had to cut out two pockets of dead flesh. The care of
these wounds was very painful at first, but is now tolerable. And
antibiotics seem to have halted the bacteria's spread.
</P>
<P>
   At a time like this one is tempted to feel utterly helpless. My
life is in the hands of others. But I had complete confidence in
the medical team, and in God, who I felt was not yet ready to
``take me home.'' I feel absolutely at peace.
</P>
<P>
   However, Romans 8:28 kept running through my head: ``..in all
things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been
called according to his purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   But what has been God's purpose in these illnesses?
</P>
<P>
   A friend who visited said, ``Sometimes God allows terrible
things like this to happen to get your attention. In 1955 Eli
Wiesel was hit by a taxi. In his long recovery, he also recovered
his faith that was lost at Auschwitz. I think God is calling you to
a new level of holiness. The Lord wants you to develop a closer
walk with Him.''
</P>
<P>
   So I've been reading more Scripture. My son, Adam, asked me to
read Psalm 18:32-33:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to
stand on the heights.''
</P>
<P>
   That has certainly been my experience. But how does one convince
the skeptical of such matters? During these weeks I've been reading
a wonderful book with answers called ``God: The Evidence'' by
Patrick Glynn.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his faith in high school, went to Harvard and emerged a
convinced agnostic, which later hardened into convinced atheism.
``Reason, I thought, was the only path to truth. No God in the
personal sense, no afterlife, no soul, no inherent justice in the
universe. We were on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he read a book called ``Life After Death'' by a
psychiatrist named Ray Moody recounting ``near-death experiences,''
deathbed visions of people who ``died and made a comeback.''
Victims of heart attacks, crashes, etc. described what they called
a realm beyond death. Most said they felt a sudden sense of peace
and detachment, an absence of pain. Some said they felt they were
floating over an operating table, then moved down a tunnel to a
heavenly landscape and encountered a ``Being of Light'' that some
described as Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Some even felt they underwent a detailed review of their lives,
a replay of every thought and action -- and its consequences for
good or ill on others.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Sabon, a cardiologist, was critical of Moody's
methodolgy. So he decided to ask his own patients who claimed
``near-death experiences'' detailed questions that would not be
known to laymen. Some said they had observed surgeries on their own
heart and described details they could not possibly have observed
while unconscious on the operating table.
</P>
<P>
   A significant number also described ``hellish'' near-death
experiences that prompted some to change their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Those who felt they encountered Christ were struck by an
overwhelming sense of unconditional love and compassion along with
His firm sense of right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn's conclusion: ``Near-death research offered the first
systematic body of evidence suggestive of the existence of a
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites similar persuasive evidence for the existence of God in
physics, astronomy and medicine, which I will examine in next
week's column.
</P>
<P>
   I did not need Patrick Glynn's research to have faith in God.
But others do.

PROJECT TRACES THE HISTORY OF JEWS IN DIXIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ Under a canopy of stately oaks, a Jewish
cemetery occupies a half-acre of land in the little south
Mississippi town of Summit, its century-old headstones representing
the last traces of a vanished society.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish peddlers helped settle Summit in the early 1800s and
established its first stores. ``Louis Alcus and Isaac Scherck,''
wrote a local historian, ``were second to none in contributing to
the building up of the town.'' Nineteen Jewish men went off from
Summit to fight for the Confederate cause in the Civil War and came
home to organize Congregation Ohaveh Shalom (Lovers of Peace) in
1870.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, their descendants drifted away, moving to
nearby New Orleans. A tornado destroyed the synagogue building in
1924, and today no Jews are left in Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jews have disappeared from dozens of villages in the
Baptist-dominated ``Bible Belt,'' Jewish communities are thriving
in cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, N.C., Charleston, S.C., and
New Orleans, while Memphis is home to the largest Orthodox
congregation in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to preserve their legacy in the deep South, the
Museum of the Southern Jewish Experience has just opened a
summer-long exhibition in Jackson that follows the 19th century
immigration of thousands of Jews from their homes in the Alsace, a
disputed region that provoked clashes between France and Germany,
to a corridor along the Mississippi River between New Orleans and
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alsace to America: Discovering a Southern Jewish Heritage''
demonstrates in displays and oral histories how the European Jews
found comfort in the French culture of New Orleans, then spanned
across Dixie in search of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Because they did not eat pork, a staple of the region, the Jews
were called ``egg-eaters'' and considered curious newcomers. Still,
they put down stakes in the tough frontier country.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, their names, emblazoned on their general stores,
became the names of the towns: Marks, Miss.; Kaplan, La.
Eventually, many became cotton brokers, landowners, leaders of the
mercantile class, and burghers of their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to this country with nothing more than their
education,'' says Louise Glickman, director of development for the
museum. ``They learned to adapt to the land and to talk with the
people. They were so determined to become part of the community
that a disproportionate number of Jews fought on the Confederate
side despite their abhorrence of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Eli Evans, president of the Charles H. Revson Foundation in New
York, wrote of his Southern roots in ``The Provincials.'' Jews and
Southerners were both ``stepchildren of anguished history,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this braided identity of being Southern and Jewish,''
Evans says. Despite differences in religion and social views from
the Protestant conservatives, ``Jews were not aliens, but blood and
bones part of Southern history.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Southern Jews were keenly aware that their families were
the only ones in the community not to worship on Sunday, and in
their zeal to become bona fide Americans they grew more secular.
The reform movement, a more liberal strain of Judaism, was founded
in the South and more than 100 reform congregations still exist in
the deep South.
</P>
<P>
   But the same demographics that changed the face of the South in
the years after World War II devastated the commercial
underpinnings of Jewish communities in small towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was not killed by the boll weevil was killed by
Wal-Mart,'' says Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   In Clarksdale, a Mississippi Delta city, Temple Beth Israel had
a full-time rabbi and 100 families attending services in the 1960s.
``Today, there are probably 25 members,'' says John Levingston, who
owns a furniture store there. ``During the school year, we contract
for a student rabbi and have services every two weeks. The younger
generation moved away to pursue economic opportunity. Many members
of my family left. They've not been replaced. With our aging,
shifting population, the congregation will probably not exist in a
few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy B. Hart, executive director of Museum of the Southern
Jewish Experience, says he started the institution in 1989 to
provide a home for Torah scrolls and other religious artifacts left
behind as synagogues were abandoned. ``There has been a dwindling
Jewish presence,'' he says, as Jews moved to cities or married
non-Jews and were assimilated into Christian Southern society.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mark Greenberg, the museum historian, the Jewish
population in Mississippi has declined from 4,600 in 1937 to 1,400
recorded in the 1996 American Jewish Yearbook. In Arkansas, there
are only 1,700 Jews compared to 6,500 sixty years ago. The numbers
in Tennessee have fallen from 25,000 to 18,000 over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Jewish population of Atlanta has expanded
dramatically. From the time Sam Massell, a prominent Jewish
businessman was elected mayor in 1969, the number of Jews in the
city has tripled, from 24,000 to 77,000.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the number of Jews in the South has increased from
200,000 in 1937 to 1 million today, but Florida has accounted for
most of that increase. The state's Jewish population is estimated
at 650,000 _ up from 21,000 in 1937 _ and most are concentrated on
the east coast of Florida, an areawhich is as distinct from
Southern culture as the Lower East Side of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson show focuses on the Mississippi River states of
Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee. ``The story of
Southern Jews is the story of rural America,'' Hart says. ``We have
a rich legacy, like all small-town folks, and it's important to
protect our history.''
</P>
<P>
   The current exhibition, which celebrates Jewish life in small
Southern towns, was timed to coincide with the ``Splendors of
Versailles,'' another summer attraction in downtown Jackson that is
drawing thousands of visitors. Many of the tourists are crossing
the street to attend ``Alsace to America,'' too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exhibition is about memory,'' says Glickman. ``We want to
show that we're more alike than different.''

DESPITE INNOVATIONS, FEWER VIEWERS FOLLOWED THE PUCK 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPN and Fox took substantial hits in their NHL playoff
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN aired 32 games and averaged a rating of 1.2, down 29
percent from last year's 1.7. Its Stanley Cup finals coverage
suffered a bigger hit. The cable outlet's three games earned a 2.6
rating, down 37 percent from last year's finals.
</P>
<P>
   Fox did a little better. Its coverage of Game 1 between the
Washington Capitals and Detroit Red Wings earned a 3.3, down 17
percent from last year's opener.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing numbers overshadow considerable effort to
improve hockey's image on television.Both Fox and ESPN have
attempted to bring the game closer to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The much-discussed FoxTrax is a case in point. Designed to give
viewers a better way to keep track of the puck, FoxTrax has been
derided by hockey connoisseurs and applauded by new fans. NHL
commissioner Gary Bettman told reporters recently that he wasn't a
fan, but if the blue streak that followed the path of the puck
helped attract viewers, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN producer Larry Kristiansen applauds Fox's attempts and
points out that his network also has employed several new toys.
Instead of using only two cameras to cover the action, ESPN uses
all sorts of robotics and goalcams, allowing viewers to watch the
proceedings as if they were goalies. The goalcam also allows
viewers to watch power plays unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN also added a camera to give viewers a feel for the speed of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Kristiansen says the process is still evolving and he for one
would like to see cameras installed along tracks to enable viewers
to get a better sense of the speed as well as the action.
</P>
<P>
   That innovation will be some time in coming _ as, apparently,
will higher television ratings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Record numbers
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Game 6 of the NBA Finals earned a 22.3 rating and 38 share,
making it the highest-rated game in NBA history, according to
Nielsen Media Research. That number overtakes 1988's Game 7 between
the Pistons and Lakers, which drew a 21.2 rating and 37 share on
CBS. NBC estimates that 72 million viewers watched all or part of
the Bulls' win over the Jazz Sunday. NBC averaged a national rating
of 18.7 throughout the series, also a record ... Longtime network
executive Ken Schanzer was appointed president of NBC Sports
Thursday, succeeding Dick Ebersol, who becomes chairman of the
sports division and new Olympics division ... ABC pulled a 4.7
rating for its World Cup soccer broadcast of Germany's 2-0 win over
the United States Monday. That number is significantly lower than
those earned during the first round of the 1994 World Cup when
US-Romania achieved a 7.8 rating and US-Switzerland pulled a 5.9
... Pity Warner Wolf. Last week the 38-year veteran of television
sports had his worst day ever. During a broadcast on New York's
WCBS, his new dentures popped out. His sportscast started well
enough. But when he went to his trademark, ``Let's go to the
videotape,'' he began to mumble. The embarrassment ended when he
wrestled the plate into place. Of course, the New York Post was
watching. Its headline: ``Let's go to the Poli-grip.''

<P>
   Of all people to own a movie production company, it's Reggie
White. The last time we heard from the minister, he was making a
complete fool of himself in front of the Wisconsin State Assembly.
To this day, he stands by his gibberish on race and ethnicity. But
the Lord moves in strange ways. He blessed this fool with a deal
that will allow him to build Reggie White Studios in Denver. White
and his partners, Colorado Rockies vice chairman Richard Monfort
and Denver businessman Rodney Linafelter, are trying to raise $100
million to produce major motion pictures, made-for-television
movies, and original cable television programming ... ESPN's
Classic Sports airs nonstop Wimbledon moments Sunday from 2-10
p.m., starting with Arthur Ashe's historic 1975 victory over Jimmy
Connors ... CNN/SI's Nick Charles teams with veteran analyst Gil
Clancy for TBS's quarterfinal coverage of the Goodwill Games boxing
tournament. The telecasts from New York's Madison Square Garden are
July 27-28 at 8:05 p.m. ... Red Auerbach appears on CNN/SI Saturday
at 11 a.m. with Charles to discuss NBA dynasties.

BAER A CLASSIC FIGURE BEHIND LOUDON CLASSIC

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOUDON, N.H. _ Before it became known as the Loudon Classic
and before it was held at New Hampshire International Speedway,
where the 75th anniversary of America's oldest motorcycle race will
be staged this weekend, motorcycle enthusiasts from all over New
England and points beyond knew it, quite simply, as the ``Laconia
Races.''
</P>
<P>
   But to those who knew him, it might as well have been called
``Fritzie's Races,'' because the late Fritzie Baer was generally
regarded as the man responsible for fathering the first American
Motorcycle Association event in New England.
</P>
<P>
   NHIS owners Bob and Sandy Bahre and their son Gary, the
speedway's president, may very well be the closest thing to the
First Family of auto racing in New England. And the Baers _
Fritzie; his wife, Louise; and their five children _ rank as New
England's First Family of motorcycling.
</P>
<P>
   A factory dealer for the Indian Motorcycle Co. in Springfield,
Mass., Baer organized a motorcycle club in 1933 called ``Fritzie's
Roamers'' that was recognized a year later by the AMA as the most
active and successful in the nation. Through his contacts with the
AMA and as president of the New England Motorcycle Dealers
Association, Baer helped bring motorcycle racing to the Laconia
Region at Belknap Recreation Area, now Gunstock Ski Resort.
</P>
<P>
   After resigning from the Indian Motorcycle Co. in 1950, Baer
signed on as managing director of the Belknap Recreation Area,
where he staged his motorcycle events and became affectionately
known as ``The Man in the Red Hat.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to spot Baer at the Belknap races. He was a large,
gregarious sort who loved to smoke cigars. And he always wore a red
hat, hence the nickname.
</P>
<P>
   When a new race venue had to be found in the early '60s, Baer
was instrumental in persuading Keith Bryar to build a facility that
could stage the Loudon Classic. In so many words, Baer persuaded
Bryar that if he built a new track _ Bryar Motorsports Park _ the
motorcyclists would come. And they did _ in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, in addition to being a motorcycle dealer, was also a
promoter and he did the announcing for all the races, so he was
very active in motorcycles,'' said Butch Baer, 71, the third of
Baer's four sons, who lives in Monson. ``His whole life revolved
around motorcycles, really. It didn't matter, really, whether it
was Indian or Harley or whatever, he was very strong at promoting
whatever he could to help the motorcycle industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorcycles _ particularly those made by the Indian Motorcycle
Co. _ were intertwined with the Baer family history.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after starting work at the Indian factory, Baer, a
native of Clinton, Mass., earned enough money to buy a new 1923
Indian Chief with a Princess sidecar. One day, while tooling
Worcester with a friend, the 21-year-old Baer spied two pretty
women standing at a street corner. One was a 16-year-old who became
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``They courted for about a year when they decided they were
going to get married,'' said Butch. ``She put on her riding clothes
and they got on the cycle sidecar and they headed for Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stopped at a gas station that was across the street from
the Town Hall in Albany, and she got out and changed clothes in the
gas station. Then they went into the Town Hall and got married.
They went back to the gas station, changed back into their riding
clothes, and went off on their honeymoon.''
</P>
<P>
   The newlyweds hit the open highway on a blissful motorcycle tour
that took them through the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York.
``In five years' time, my mother had four children,'' Butch said.
``Each time, she was brought to the hospital in the sidecar and the
baby was brought home in the sidecar. That's why we're motorcycle
people.''
</P>
<P>
   When Baer died in 1984 at age 83, his ashes were spread at
Gunstock. ``We did it somewhat surreptitiously,'' said Tom Baer,
73, of Goffstown, N.H., the second oldest of Baer's four surviving
offspring. ``But his ashes are spread on the Red Hat ski trail,
which was named after him.''
</P>
<P>
   When the race gained a bad reputation for the unseemly behavior
that took place once it became a gathering spot for hell-on-wheels
riders who came to Laconia every June to trample upon it, ``it
really saddened my dad,'' Butch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was `Animal Land' up behind Bryar's track. It was
unbelievable. `Animal Land,' that's what they called it. People
just went up there to get spaced out, drunk, start bonfires,
destroy some automobiles _ oh God, it was horrible. I was ashamed
to be a motorcyclist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a barrel of apples; it only takes a couple of bad
ones ...'' Butch added. ``But that's all gone now. It's become much
more family-oriented. You see more people going up for a vacation
and to have fun. The race is only a small part of the whole
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Fritzie Baer ever have imagined that it would last this
long? That what began as the Laconia Races would become the
nation's oldest motorcycle event?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad? Oh sure, Dad would,'' Butch said. ``As far as Dad was
concerned, it was going to last hundreds of years.''

THE ROCK IS OK BY OK BY ME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ When Ok By Me captured the New Hampshire
Sweepstakes Handicap at Rockingham Park last year, he had ``future
star'' written all over him. Ok By Me stormed past a good horse
named Influent, the 6-5 favorite, to win with authority, and it
seemed likely he would go on to upstate New York and become the
scourge of Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   But something happened at The Spa. First Ok By Me finished fifth
at 9-5 in the Fourstardave Stakes. Then he finished sixth in the
Bernard Baruch Handicap at 2-1. It turned out that ``something''
was an injured ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was up at Saratoga, he had a little chip removed from
his left front ankle,'' said trainer H. James Bond, who laid up Ok
By Me from August until March. ``But he's doing pretty good now.
He's run against some pretty tough horses. Hopefully, he'll show
what he's made of at Rockingham.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ok By Me, a 5-year-old chestnut son of Canadian champion
With Approval, will be back at Rock Saturday to defend his
championship in the $200,000 Sweeps, run at 1 1/8 miles over the
turf. Without a win since, he has an excellent chance to get back
on track over a surface he relishes. ``He just seems to really like
the New Hampshire course,'' said Bond. ``We've been pointing for
this race.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Ok By Me has run poorly since having the chip
removed. In his three starts this year, he has a second and two
thirds against top company. He gained the place in the Bouginvilea
Handicap at Hialeah March 29 in his return, then earned the show in
both the Royal Palm Handicap at Hialeah May 3 and the Connaught Cup
at Woodbine May 30. All three of his post-surgery starts have come
in Grade III events, like the Sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``His best race this year was his first one back at Hialeah,''
said Bond. ``He made a strong move and just got beat (by a
half-length). I admit his second Hialeah start, when he lost the
lead, wasn't as good. But by then, maybe he didn't want to run in
the heat. His race in Canada was pretty good. He went up there a
little sluggish, but I think he could have won it with a little bit
better racing luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bravo, who was aboard Ok By Me when he took the Sweeps last
year, will be back up Saturday after Frank Lovato rode him at
Woodbine. The Rock turf course was firm for the Sweeps in 1997, but
its condition for Saturday is uncertain and it could be soft. The
Rock meeting opened June 7, but there have been only four races run
over the turf course so far during a meet which has seen three
cards canceled because of torrential rains. Two races were taken
off the turf Thursday and none were carded for the early portion of
last night's program, so no one knows what the turf course will be
like Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bond is unconcerned about the footing. ``He's got a big
old flat foot on him,'' the trainer said. ``There'll be no problem
with the course. He seems to run on anything. If it's soft or
whatever, he'll get used to it. He likes to run at a horse, and
there looks like there's some speed in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of racehorse in him. We can't hold him in the
barn right now. When he's right, he usually fires a big shot. We'll
see what happens.''

A POPULARITY, AND EGO, FIT FOR THE WORLD STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The BBC has produced and aired an astonishing hourlong
documentary about Boston Philharmonic Orchestra conductor Benjamin
Zander. Called ``Living on One Buttock,'' an allusion to
Zander's &UR;  &LR; habit of half rising from the bench in his emphatic piano
playing, the show revels in the many activities Zander pursues
outside our ken. When not blasting Mahler symphonies out the BPO's
Cambridge office window, Zander keeps up a busy international
concert schedule, is a peripatetic teacher of gifted musical
students, and has carved out a lucrative and unusual sideline as a
motivational speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary, recently sold to the Bravo channel, is a
veritable goulash of Zander testimonials. Sources as diverse as
Mahler's granddaughter and Zander's neighbor Alan Dershowitz praise
his abilities. And a US Army colonel from the Fort Leavenworth war
college extols Zander's speech before several hundred officers,
whom the conductor persuaded to sing ``Ode to Joy,''
enthusiastically if not harmoniously. Zander is also shown revving
up execs from Textron and British Telecom. (My favorite moment in
the show is Zander explaining to his Youth Philharmonic charges the
proper response to corrective criticism from an elder: ``How
fascinating.'')
</P>
<P>
   Zander's motivational lectures _ he calls them
``transformational'' talks _ will soon be gathered in a book,
``Pathways to Possibility,'' co-authored with his partner and
former wife, the psychotherapist Rosamund Zander. The two are
separated, but remain pals and collaborators. ``We're like England
and France, living on Appleton and Brattle streets,'' he explains.
``We're close, but we're separated by a channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Zander is indeed big box office in England; so why isn't he a
bigger deal in the land of Seiji and Keith? The musicians I spoke
with praised his inspirational abilities and his musicianship, but
faulted his considerable ego. The knock: Does not play well with
others. ``People either love him or they hate him,'' one fellow
explained. ``There's no middle ground. He has a lot to offer
musically, and it's a shame he hasn't done more around here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
How fascinating
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The silly cryonicists, who loathe me for poking fun at them in a
recent column (``Immortality and the Chosen, Frozen Few,'' June 3),
have been dying for me to correct two factual errors in that piece.
The male-female ratio of withered, defrosted corpses in AD 2100
will not be 25 to 1, as I wrote, but closer to 22 to 4. Also,
Berkeley academic Robin Hanson thinks he has a 5 percent chance of
being revived after the deep freeze, not a 0.5 percent chance, as I
wrote.

<P>
   When the Boston Computer Society folded in September 1996, the
staff closed up shop in six weeks. After they finished selling off
furniture and the like, they summed up the BCS's financial position
for the board of directors: The society had about $10,000 in debts,
$10,000 in receivables, and a cash surplus of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The $50K was entrusted to BCS lawyer and board member Harris
Luscomb, with the understanding that it would find its way to the
Computer Museum. That's the law; when a nonprofit goes under and
has assets left, they must be donated to another nonprofit. The
Computer Museum has earmarked the money to upgrade its best
Software for Kids exhibit, but, explains director emeritus Oliver
Strimpel, ``we haven't received the money yet.''
</P>
<P>
   What's taking so long? Luscomb is famous for not returning phone
calls, and he didn't return mine. Real estate magnate Arthur
Nelson, the last chairman of the BCS, says, ``The money is in the
bank, and it cannot be released until the attorney general approves
the final audit.'' Neither the audit nor the dissolution papers
have been submitted to the AG, explains Office of Charities
attorney Deirdre Rosenberg. Some members of the BCS suspect
skulduggery, although there is no evidence of such yet. Rosenberg
says these dissolutions can take 10 years or more. Nonetheless, she
adds: ``There are a lot of unhappy people out there.''

SHEEDY SHINES IN HIGHLY ORIGINAL `HIGH ART' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
HIGH ART 
Directed and written by: Lisa Cholodenko 
Starring: Ally Sheedy, Radha Mitchell, Patricia Clarkson, Bill
Sage 
Running time: 102 minutes 
Rated: R (strong sexuality, pervasive drug use, language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lisa Cholodenko's ``High Art'' is an impressively original take
on a far from unexamined scene _ young careerists interacting with
derailed druggies in SoHo. It's raised from semi-documentary
funkiness to something haunting, thanks mostly to what goes on in
the eyes of Ally Sheedy, making the career re-entry of the year as
a sensitive and complictaed photographer caught between the
competing needs of her former and current lovers. The film pivots
on Sheedy's astonishing Lucy Berliner, a talented photographer
fleeing the wear and tear and exploitation that go with fame by
plunging into drugs with a coterie she has gathered in a
fashionably seedy salon financed by a trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   When a downstairs neighbor, Radhi Mitchell's Syd, knocks on her
door to complain about a leak, Lucy finds herself invigorated _ or
as invigorated as her fragile, disillusioned nature can allow her
to be _ by the young ambitious assistant editor, who wants to
launch her own career by reviving Lucy's after the latter's 10-year
layoff. Never so zoned out that she can't quickly calculate the
quid pro quo in an emotional transaction, Lucy decides to let Syd
use her because she's attracted to Syd. It's more of a risk to
Lucy. There are reasons for Lucy's withdrawal, one being her
world-weary girlfriend, Greta, an ex-Fassbinder trouper played with
a sub-Dietrich growl in enervated but sympathetic fashion by
Patricia Clarkson.
</P>
<P>
   Syd, meanwhile, drops her boyfriend and begins a subtle mating
dance with Lucy, whose ability to get to us rests largely on her
open-eyed view of exactly what's going down as the two women decide
how much of themselves to expose and parcel out to one another. Not
that it's all a series of power transactions. By never having the
characters say too much, and entiocing us to read a wide range of
feelings from their faces, Cholodenko convinces us as well of the
physical urgency of their relationship, just as Sheedy convinces us
that part of Lucy's calculation involves figuring out just how
close to dance to the flame of a physical attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lucy's flight from expectations, Cholodenko makes clear
in a brilliant scene, involves her Holocaust-survivor mother,
played with real iron by Tammy Grimes, who maintains a lifelong
drop on Lucy by praising her as gifted, then deprecating her as
passive. Whatever else is going on in Lucy's eyes, however, Sheedy
convinces us she's a character who knows her own worth, even if she
has difficulty mustering the will to achieve. The physicality and
storminess of the emotions boiling up from beneath the
sensation-muffling drug haze are startlingly yet seductively
urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever makng it apparent, Cholodenko and Sheedy yank what
could have been downtown cliche into something fresh and raw and
slightly subversive, which tells us we're in the presence of
something vital and unafraid of embracing contradictions. Mitchell
impressively reminds us as well that there needn't necessarily be
any incompatibility between wholesomeness and ruthlessness. In all,
``High Art'' is an invigorating look at the cost of emotional
demands _ and the cost of feeding one's appetites. I can't believe
there'll be a handful of performances all year that will approach
Sheedy's. She's unforgettable as a woman not thick-skinned enough
for her environment.

PREDICTABILITY LEAVES SWEET `DREAM' EMPTY

DREAM FOR AN INSOMNIAC 
Written and directed by: Tiffanie DeBartolo 
Starring: Ione Skye, Jennifer Aniston, MacKEnzie Astin, Michael
Landes, Seymour Cassel 
Running time: 88 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dream for an Insomniac'' is a slight, sweet, promising debut
film in which acting outdistances structure. As an ensemble piece
it's disarming, with charm and freshness carrying it past an almost
sitcom predictability as it canters through its boy-meets-girl
stuff. You keep wishing newcomer Tiffanie DeBartolo would venture
more frequently outside the coffee shop where much of the action
takes place. This would increase the film's fluidity and San
Francisco charm and make it seem less like a film of a one-set
play.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps DeBartolo's best move was to sign MacKenzie Astin, Ione
Skye, and Jennifer Aniston as the leads. Astin, whose career seems
to be growing in soft leaps and bounds, in direct proportion to his
range, keeps things light as a blocked writer who wanders into the
coffee shop owned by Frankie's (Skye's) uncle. He arrives just in
time, it seems, to fill the romantic gap in her life, or at least
read her to the sleep she never gets enough of as an insomniac,
which she has been since her parents died years ago in a car crash.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges between them are marked by tenderness, and played
against the tart repartee allotted to Aniston's sidekick, waiting
for Frankie to get it together so both can go to LA to pursue
acting careers. There's a subplot of sorts involving Frankie's gay
cousin, Rob, who convinces us he really hates the idea of hurting
his Sinatra-worshipping father's feelings by declaring his sexual
preference, especially in view of the old man's increasingly
heavy-handed hints about how much he'd like to see some
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The film spins its wheels with an altogether unconvincing faked
romance, between Rob and Aniston's resolutely heterosexual Allison,
designed to throw the old man off the track. While it can't be said
that the main love story is exactly surprising or urgent, it at
least convinces you that Skye's character, and Astin's, have their
thoughtful sides. Personality is what carries ``Dream for an
Insomniac,'' not content. DeBartolo seems more at ease in
moment-to-moment work with actors than developing or sustaining a
tonal overview, but the perhaps inevitable awkwardness of her airy
first feature is offset by the bright, sunny energies that come off
the screen.

SMALL TOY COMPANY SEEKS NET ADVANTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: eToys is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WALTHAM, Mass. _ Many small retailers are trying to figure out
how to make the Internet work for them. Holt Co. thinks it's found
a way.
</P>
<P>
   When Roz and Ed Holt started Holt Co. in 1979, the small Waltham
firm sold school furniture and equipment, such as overhead
projectors, to private schools. Today, the couple's son, Paul,
presides over a toy retailer and school supplier that aims to sell
most of its merchandise over the Internet, rather than from its
cramped Holt Educational Outlet store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to grow this company,'' says Holt, president
of the $10 million private firm. ``The research I have done says
the fastest, most economical way to grow was the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Holt Educational's technological refocusing, which
Holt estimates cost the company $300,000, is a tale of a successful
foray onto the World Wide Web, a medium that has brought mixed
sales results for both the toy industry and businesses in general.
This month, Holt plans to launch version 2.0 of its Web site, along
with separate sites for its subsidiaries. In a few years, Holt
says, he intends to take the privately financed company public.
</P>
<P>
   And Holt, which sells its products over the Internet, through a
mail-order catalog, and in its retail outlet, is anticipating
on-line growth. Currently, 10 percent of Holt's sales are from the
Web site; Paul Holt predicts those sales will rise to 50 percent of
the total next year.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say Holt Educational, unlike other educational
and general toy stores, found profits on the Web because of its
integrated financial and ordering systems and its attention to
customer preferences in designing the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's specialization in educational toys, particularly those
for children with learning disabilities, has also helped the
company create its own niche: developmental toys for busy,
well-educated, high-income parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents who are on the Internet have no time,'' says David
N. Lord, promoted from chief financial officer to chief executive
just this week. ``It's a lot harder to buy an educational toy than
to buy a Barbie.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, Holt Educational has branched out from educational
supplies, creating a school furniture division, Holt Furniture
Environments, and a communications hardware subsidiary, GroupCom,
which markets videoconferencing equipment and related items.
</P>
<P>
   But the core business remains Holt Educational, run out of a
basement miniwarehouse below Holt's corporate offices, packed with
toys, teachers' supplies, and brightly colored stickers. Unlike
Toys ``R'' Us and other mass retailers, Holt concentrates on toys
that develop skills, such as reading or coordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't sell the metal trains with a generator,'' Lord says.
``We sell the wooden ones which the child puts together. My
three-year-old daughter plays with her wooden train every night.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the modernization of this division that Paul Holt decided
to tackle first. That was almost three years ago. Holt Educational
already had a mail-order catalog business, but adapting to Internet
commerce required a technological overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   First, Holt hired Lord, a former department store executive with
a degree in accounting, as finance chief and chief information
officer. Lord, like all members of Holt's senior management team,
has young children.
</P>
<P>
   The plan Holt and Lord devised called for scrapping the
company's old computer system and buying new hardware. Of paramount
importance was integrating the new accounting and Web commerce
software so orders coming in over the Internet would not have to be
typed into a separate inventory system.
</P>
<P>
   With the Great Plains accounting program and Microsoft's Site
Server 3.0, which Holt Educational was the first to test in April,
the outlet's Web site reduced transaction costs from $2.25 to 50
cents, Lord says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you order on our Web site, it automatically prints out a
packing list and we ship it,'' Holt says.
</P>
<P>
   Holt Education has 20,000 products available on its Web site; by
year's end, Lord says, 50,000 toys will be available. Holt's
12-member Web development team also included what Lord calls
``value-added'' features, like a regular advice column written by a
Lesley College education professor. The site's gift registry has
10,000 child subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's site also allows customers to search for toys by several
criteria, including price, manufacturer, and category. Buyers can
track the status of their orders on a special FedEx package
tracking page. The company is continuously tailoring the site to
consumers' interests: when management discovered that longtime
store customers were printing their order forms off the Web site
and bringing them into the store to avoid paying shipping costs,
Holt decided to plan an in-store fulfillment center for this
year's &UR;  &LR; holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   And the efforts are paying off, Holt and Lord say: the average
site visitor looks at 21 pages, and 50 percent of Web hits are
return visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a year from now, we feel the Internet will overtake the
catalog,'' he says. The company is growing about 20 percent a year,
with sales for next year projected to be about $12 million. Of
that, about $2 million are expected to come from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Building on what they see as a successful formula, Holt and Lord
say the site's updated version will include customer profiling,
allowing the company's computers to automatically show specific
products that individuals have ordered or looked at previously.
``It makes it easier to shop on our site,'' Holt says.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Holt is not the largest toy company around, nor has
its Web site established itself as the most popular place to buy
toys on the Internet. Indeed, the market leader, Paramus,
N.J.-based Toys ``R'' Us Inc., this week launched its own Web site,
which will sell mainly mass-market toys such as Barbie. And other
competing Web sites abound, particularly those that sell Beanie
Babies and other hot toys.
</P>
<P>
   eToys, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based Web toy seller financed by
venture capital, launched a site in March 1997 that features both
educational and mass-market toys. While the company won't release
sales or Web hits figures, eToys says it sells 3,000 products over
the 'Net. It recently bought rival Toys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Jane E. Saltzman, vice president for merchandising at eToys,
says sites like hers combine the interactivity of a retail store
with the 'Net's search capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's really great about being on the Internet,''
she says, is that the addition of eToys' keyword searches lets
customers ``recreate the absolute best experience of being in a
land-based store.''
</P>
<P>
   Fierce competition on the Internet also forces retailers to
constantly monitor prices, making toys cheaper, says Jerry
Bloomberger, who owns La Toys Etc., a Cedarhurst, N.Y.-based retail
store and Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the airline system, where you can get a Delta flight
for $100 and then you see a USAirways flight for less,'' says
Bloomberger, who specializes in Beanie Babies and other hot toys.
</P>
<P>
   But some retailers say the future of toy stores may not depend
on Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The folks I now that have gone on the Internet haven't had a
tremendous amount of success with it,'' says Sally Lesser, owner of
two Henry Bear's Park toy stores in Cambridge and Newton, and
president of the American Specialty Toy Retailing Association, a
trade group with 700 members. ``I'm not sure that the people on the
'Net, once they visit your site, are going to become your
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   And industry specialists disagree over whether the Web is an
effective medium for marketing toys at all. Some argue that even if
the Web does hold promise for toy sellers, Holt may not be the
best-positioned company to do business on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe value is inherent in the product, my sense is
that people are looking for more than a discount,'' says David L.
Hesel, a toy store owner and industry consultant in Concord, and
past president of ASTRA, who calls Holt ``a nonplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   At Holt Educational Outlet, nonetheless, Holt and Lord see the
Internet as their future. Indeed, they say, only differentiation
from other companies' Web sites will ensure their success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years from now, every company will be on the Internet,''
Lord predicts. ``It goes back to adding value.''

GABELLI AT ODDS WITH INVESTING'S MICHELANGELO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Famed money manager Mario Gabelli calls Boston's Richard A.
Smith a Michelangelo among investors.
</P>
<P>
   Gabelli says he has been investing in Smith's companies for 30
years and has made ``a ton of money'' along the way. Gabelli
currently has stakes in all three companies Smith heads: publisher
Harcourt General Inc.; Neiman Marcus Group, the fancy retailer; and
GC Cos., a movie-theater operator.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, at the age of 73, Dick Smith remains ``the
intellectual giant'' behind the companies, says Gabelli.
</P>
<P>
   But the two extraordinarily successful investors part company on
Smith's decision to plow nearly $100 million in cash from the
theater unit into a series of venture capital investments that have
ranged from a drive-through coffee chain to a Russian telephone
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is a mistake, and I am dead-set against it,''
says Gabelli, whose 13 percent stake in CG Cos. makes him the
second-largest holder behind the Smith family, which owns 29
percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith wants to play venture capitalist, Gabelli says, he
should do it privately. ``Venture capital should not be
accomplished using a public vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than pouring money into start-ups, Gabelli would like to
see the company follow through on its pledge, announced in December
1996, to buy back up to 1 million shares of GC stock. A new company
filing this week showed GC had repurchased only about 119,000
shares at a cost of $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, though extemely private, is something of an icon in the
world of investing. He built a fortune -- estimated by Forbes
magazine last year at $515 million -- by skillfully shuffling from
beverage bottling to movie theaters, and then into high-end
retailing and publishing. He is among the most respected executives
in the Boston business community, serving on the boards of Liberty
Mutual, Harvard Management Co., a host of charities, and, until
recently, BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With his record, criticism of Smith is rare. And Gabelli tempers
his own remarks, saying there is only ``a degree of difference''
with Smith. ``The stock (of GC) is incredibly cheap,'' Gabelli
says.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, as always, won't comment. ``Mr. Smith does not talk to
reporters,'' his assistant told us Thursday. In the company's
second-quarter report last month, Smith said ``we are very pleased
with the results of our investment group activity,'' citing the
initial public offering of one of the company's holding.
</P>
<P>
   That IPO marked the biggest score since Smith started using GC's
General Cinema theaters as a cash cow to fund the venture
operation. Global TeleSystems Group Inc., whose biggest owner is
hedge fund manager George Soros and his affiliates, turned out to
be a hot deal, and GC's $25.2 million investment is now worth about
$75 million. The company is selling telephone service in Russia and
Europe; its stock has risen to 42 1/8 from its opening price of 20
in February.
</P>
<P>
   GC's venture picks seem to be improving after some early
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those was a investment, along with others, in a
chain of drive-through coffee stands being rolled out by George
Naddaff, the man who helped make Boston Chicken a national chain.
General Cinema has since written off its entire $2.9 million
investment. Another goof was a $5 million investment in a chain of
children's clothing stores in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, GC has had gains on the sales of a chain of radio
stations and of an eyeglass retailer. Last year, GC made its
biggest bet yet, investing $30 million in American Capital Access
Holdings, a New York company that insures debt that is either not
rated or of borderline investment-grade quality.
</P>
<P>
   GC's chief financial officer, Gail Edwards, would not comment on
the overall rate of return in the venture business. That business
is run by Smith along with John G. Berlyson, his son-in-law who
once worked at Advent International, the big Boston venture firm.
Smith's son, Robert, is president and chief operating officer of
GC, which runs both the theaters and the venture unit.
</P>
<P>
   While Harcourt General and Neiman Marcus are doing well, the
theater business is struggling. Earnings have fallen for four
quarters in a row compared with the same periods a year earlier.
Last quarter the company lost $4.1 million compared with a profit
of $1.6 million the previous year. Revenue fell to $89 million from
$108 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company blames the results on the dearth of strong movies
and stiff competition in some of its markets. Analysts say General
Cinema has not been putting enough money back into the theaters to
keep up with the competition. Only one analyst currently rates the
stock a buy; three rate it a ``hold,'' the equivalent of sell in
Wall Street jargon.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the stock closed a 48, down 3/4, on volume that was
more than 25 times the average trading. There was no news to
explain the heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   Gabelli would like to see GC sell its 1,150 domestic screens,
considering the fat premiums consolidators are now paying, and look
for another business. He likes Smith's push into the theater
business abroad. As for the venture investments, he says: ``It's
coffee here, children's clothes there. There's no rhyme or reason
to it.'

   Interviewers, as might be expected, stumble onto incredible
tales. One manager said the former employee was great but he was
just getting too old. Another employer claimed his former employee
had stolen merchandise and was a drug addict.
</P>
<P>
   A number of clients, such as the former employee who learned his
age was the reason for the termination, are able to use the
information as proof of discrimination and file lawsuits against
their former employers. Other clients threaten their former
employers with a character defamation lawsuit if they continue to
spread untrue stories to potential employers.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I wrote a column about how brilliant the service
was after checking with former clients. Since then, several readers
have complained about Documented Reference Check's service.
</P>
<P>
   One engineer read that column two years ago and thought
Documented Reference Check might be able to tell him why he was
having such a hard time finding a job. The engineer, who asked not
to be identified, said an employee at a personnel firm said she
couldn't recommend him for a job opening because of what a previous
boss had said.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer paid Documented Reference Check $616.65 in October
to check seven references going back several years. The engineer
said he waited three months and then began calling and writing
letters. He said he never received a reference report or a refund.
</P>
<P>
   Report came too late
</P>
<P>
   Another client in Hempstead paid $157.90 to have her references
checked and was upset because the process took so long that she no
longer needed the information. She had initiated legal action
against her former employer and needed the reference report fairly
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls took a week or more to return, she said, asking not
to be identified. Finally, she said, she was told by a
representative that the report already had been mailed, but she
never received it. Several months later, the former regional sales
director for a medical care provider said, a report arrived but she
returned it unopened, hoping for a refund she never got.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau in Colton, Calif., rates the company
as ``having an unsatisfactory business performance record'' and has
received 51 consumer complaints since 1995. The company responded
to 37, 11 are unresolved and three weren't answered.
</P>
<P>
   According to the bureau, customer complaints allege failure to
provide reports, inability to contact customer service
representatives regarding delays and dissatisfaction with
incomplete reports.
</P>
<P>
   Company defends record
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rankin, chief service officer of Documented Reference
Check, said he isn't surprised by those complaints and argues that
51 complaints in seven years in business isn't a bad record.
</P>
<P>
   Clients who use his company's services typically are upset to
begin with and they're often looking to Documented Reference Check
to provide some bad references so they can initiate a lawsuit or
support one ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make up the references,'' he said, adding that the
interviewers just report what they are told by former employers. He
suspects that clients open up the report, don't like what they see
and then claim they never got it.
</P>
<P>
   Some reports are positive _ they'd hire the former employee back
in a second. Sometimes clients provide the wrong phone number or
name so the reference report comes up empty.
</P>
<P>
   The company does about 1,300 reference checks a month and at
least one report comes back undeliverable, he said. Rankin said he
assumes others get lost and is happy to fax a copy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company's initial order line clearly states no
messages are retrieved and instructs clients to call the customer
service department for individual help. Some people don't pay
attention and every day several people still leave a message, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He provided a copy of the engineer's seven references, which
show that they were performed in early November. And like other
reports that Documented Reference Check has done, they clearly
spell out what the former bosses thought of the engineer.

BEST IN THEIR CLASS STILL AREN'T PERFECT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp.'s Pentium II chip finally has made it into notebook
computers, which is something of an engineering feat. Anyone who's
seen what the Pentium II desktop chip looks like _ it's remarkably
similar in size and shape to a video game cartridge _ can
appreciate what it takes to cram it into a portable machine.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of Pentium II-based notebook computers have two other
challenges with this chip. First, it runs hot _ very, very hot. The
heat sink, a metal device that draws heat away from the chip, is
massive on the desktop version, further complicating the portable
design issues.
</P>
<P>
   And the Pentium II is a hungry chip. In order to provide lots of
computing power, it gobbles battery power.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered these problems the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   I use a portable computer to take notes when I conduct
interviews, and I often don't have a table to work on when I'm
talking to subjects. By the end of my first lap-based interview
using a Pentium II system, I was holding the notebook by the edges
with my knees to keep from scalding my thighs. Yeow!
</P>
<P>
   And flying from Houston to New York and trying to write this
column, I realized I'd better type fast. Trying to write on a plane
became a race against the clock. While traditional Pentium-based
notebook computers routinely get 3 to 4 hours of battery life, I
was hard-pressed to eke 2{ hours out of either of the Pentium II
notebooks I tried.
</P>
<P>
   Other than those two downsides _ and they are substantial _ both
systems I looked at were impressive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IBM ThinkPad 600 _ $4,350, IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the aforementioned heat and power problems and a
couple of glitches, the ThinkPad 600 comes pretty close to
fulfilling my elusive dream of finding the perfect notebook
computer. This is one fine portable.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried had a 266-megahertz Pentium II chip, 32
megabytes of memory, a four-gigabyte hard drive, a built-in 56K
modem, stereo sound and speakers, a 13.3-inch active matrix
display, a removable CD-ROM drive that could be replaced by a
floppy disk, all the ports you'd expect and headphone and
microphone jacks.
</P>
<P>
   As with all ThinkPads, it uses the TrackPoint pointing device,
and it remains the best implementation of this style of pointer.
The TrackPoint, which looks like an eraser jammed between the G, H
and B keys, is responsive, yet precise.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard has a near-perfect feel _ not too mushy, but not so
stiff that your fingers tire quickly. The layout is nice, too _ I
didn't find myself accidentally bumping the wrong keys, or hitting
the backspace key when I meant to hit delete.
</P>
<P>
   The 600 is relatively small for a Pentium II notebook _ most of
the others I've seen and tried are full-sized machines. This is
thin, about an inch, with a relatively small footprint. It weighs
about five pounds when stripped down to its barest essentials.
</P>
<P>
   However, it can be frustrating to use. It would not run my word
processor of choice, WordPerfect 8, no matter how many times I
reinstalled or applied service patches to the software. And the
modem was a bit flaky, occasionally refusing to connect to a
variety of other systems.
</P>
<P>
   The ThinkPad comes with all kinds of goodies. The modem can be
used as a speakerphone, and there's software support on board for a
video phone.
</P>
<P>
   But, there are the heat and power issues. The ThinkPad couldn't
make the Houston-to-New York run without petering out. And you can
keep your coach-class meal quite warm by resting it on the
ThinkPad's bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Latitude CPi _ $3,300, Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Latitude is Dell's bread-and-butter business portable, the
one it aims at big companies. Dell plans to keep its design the
same for some time, so computer departments don't go nuts trying to
keep up with the changes.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean this isn't a state-of-the-art machine. The
Latitude is fast _ it really approaches desktop power. It also has
a sleek, classy design, being only 1{ inches thick. Although it's
the same size as most other full-sized notebooks, its curved
corners and sculpted cover make it look more compact than it is.
Like the ThinkPad, it weighs about five pounds when stripped for
travel.
</P>
<P>
   The Latitude I tried was similar in configuration to the
ThinkPad, though it came with 64 megabytes of memory, which is
standard. It lacked the ThinkPad's built-in modem _ in fact, one is
not even available from Dell, which I think is a mistake. Dell will
sell you a PC card, but PC-card modems get lost and damaged. I'd
rather have one built inside the unit. However, it does have a
built-in Ethernet connection.
</P>
<P>
   The Latitude also has a relatively dark screen. Even at full
strength, it wasn't as bright as the ThinkPad. And if you turn it
down to save battery life, you'll find yourself squinting a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Latitude uses a flat touch panel as its pointer. It's a
rather poor implementation of that technology. Fiddling with the
settings, I could never get it right _ it was either sluggish or it
zipped across the screen at the slightest touch.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard, though, is as nice as the ThinkPad's. It's got a
softer touch, but still has a solid feel.
</P>
<P>
   The Dell got quite toasty on the bottom _ it was the model that
had me gripping its sides with my knees _ and its battery life was
dismal. I averaged about two hours with it, mainly because I didn't
want to turn the screen down to save power.
</P>
<P>
   While the power of these systems is undeniable _ with the
exception of the G3-based Apple PowerBooks, these are the fastest
portables you can buy _ heat and poor battery life make them
underachievers when it comes to the needs of road warriors. They'd
probably be fine as desktop replacements if the furthest you take
them from the office is your own living room.

PARTITIONING COULD ADD CAPACITY, BUT NOT A WHOLE NEW HARD DRIVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN &QL; 
1998c. Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a 1.2-gigabyte hard disk with 1 GB used up. I was told
I could effectively have a 2- or 3-GB hard disk by partitioning it.
True? If so, how do I go about it? And if I want to add a 5- or
6-GB hard drive, how can I tell if my system would support it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Someone gave you some bad information. It would be wonderful
if partitioning a hard disk could double its capacity, but no,
that's not true.
</P>
<P>
   Partitioning breaks a large hard drive into what appears to your
system to be multiple, smaller drives. It's like building a wall on
your drive, and saying everything on one side of the wall is drive
C, and everything on the other is drive D. You don't get two 1-GB
drives; instead, your 1.2-GB drive becomes two 600-MB drives _ or
however you configure them if they are not identical sizes.
</P>
<P>
   You can gain some hard drive space by partitioning, though. As
I've written in this space before, in the original File Allocation
Table system used with MS-DOS and early Windows 95, smaller drives
require less overhead per file, known as clusters. Bigger drives
require bigger clusters, so more space is wasted per file. The
wasted space, known as ``slack,'' can be as much as 40 percent of a
big drive.
</P>
<P>
   You don't necessarily need to partition, however, if you have
the right operating system. FAT32, a kind of file system found in
the most recent versions of Windows 95 and in the upcoming Windows
98, reduces cluster size on larger disks. When I converted a 1.2-GB
drive that was about 66 percent full to FAT32 recently, I gained
about 120 MB from the smaller cluster size! The amount of reclaimed
space varies, depending on the size and number of files on your
hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your system will support an extra-large drive depends on
the operating system and the system's BIOS, which manages a PC's
most basic systems. Check with the manufacturer of your computer to
see what it will support. You probably can use special software
that would come with such a disk that would let an older PC see all
of the large drive's capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a computer about a year ago that came with USB
ports. I haven't had a need to use them until now. I bought a
digital camera that uses USB and I can't get it to work. My system
doesn't see the USB ports, even though I have the add-in for
Windows 95 that enables USB support. What am I doing wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A. Many early systems with USB ports were shipped with the
feature turned off in the BIOS. Check the manual for your PC to see
how to get into the BIOS' setup feature. From there, look for a
setting to toggle your USB ports on or off.
</P>
<P>
   However, be aware that doing this will take up one of the
interrupt settings in your system, also known as IRQs. These are
the doorways through which your system's various devices talk to
the main processor. The USB ports, fortunately, take only one IRQ _
each device you add to the USB ports (they will hold more than
120!) will not require a separate IRQ.
</P>
<P>
   If you are out of available IRQs, you may have to do some
juggling, and even disable other devices, to turn your USB ports
on.
</P>
<P>
   Although most PCs have only two USB ports, you can now buy USB
hubs _ boxes with multiple ports that attach to the main port on
your PC. Like the hub used in an Ethernet network, it requires a
power supply. It has the benefit of bringing your USB ports up to
your desktop, instead of being stuck on the back of your CPU. Then,
you can plug several devices at once _ say, your digital camera, a
scanner, maybe even a mouse and keyboard _ into the hub.

MCLACHLAN HOPES LILITH FAIR'S SECOND YEAR WILL RAISE EVEN MORE FOR
CHARITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sarah McLachlan is the kind of person who usually trusts her
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it feels right, I just do it,'' she says. ``And then I let
the chips fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, McLachlan launched an all-woman summer concert tour
dubbed Lilith Fair. Despite a summer overcrowded with packaged
tours, Lilith Fair was a critical and commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started off as such a simple idea,'' the singer-songwriter
said by phone from her home in Vancouver, B.C. ``I thought,
wouldn't it be fun to get a bunch of women together and play a
bunch of shows? And from there, it just blossomed.''
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan, who is bright, thoughtful and quick to make fun of
herself, wasn't out to prove anything. But the success of Lilith
Fair erased any doubts about the commercial viability of a
large-scale all-women tour. Lilith Fair grossed nearly $17 million
in a summer when other packaged tours were hurting for ticket
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan celebrated by giving away tons of money to some of her
favorite charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an amazing feeling that comes from giving a local
women's shelter $25,000 and having them tell you that this is going
to help keep their shelter open for six months,'' McLachlan said.
</P>
<P>
   Success has given McLachlan the clout to launch a bigger 50-date
tour this year. The trek, featuring a rotating lineup, includes two
concerts this weekend at The Gorge Amphitheatre in Goerge, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's show features headliners McLachlan, Natalie Merchant,
Indigo Girls, Erykah Badu and Me'Shell N'degeocello. Sunday's
concert is the same, except that Sinead O'Connor substitutes for
N'degeocello.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Stage lineup includes K's Choice, Billie Myers and
Lhasa both days. At the Village Stage, it's Tara MacLean, Sinead
Lohan and Felicia Loud tomorrow, and MacLean, Lohan and J.R.
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Other dates will feature such artists as Missy Elliott, Paula
Cole, Shawn Colvin, Bonnie Raitt, Liz Phair, Lisa Loeb, Martina
McBride, Mary Lou Lord, Joan Osborne, Queen Latifah, Angelique
Kidjo, Victoria Williams, Neko Case and Luscious Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a challenge putting together this lineup because
everyone has very busy summer schedules,'' McLachlan said. ``But
you put the word out there and you phone everyone up, and then you
try to juggle their schedules.''
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop star Missy Elliott is representative of this year's
diverse lineup. McLachlan saw Elliott perform last year in Miami.
``She just blew the roof off the place,'' McLachlan said. ``I'd
never felt such energy in a live show.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I invited her to join this year's Lilith tour, she was
totally into it. She said she didn't want to confine herself to the
hip-hop world. She wanted to be universal, to break out and cross
over.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, McLachlan, Merchant,
Phair, Elliott and Cole were startled when asked if there was any
truth to the rumor that Ginger Spice had quit the Spice Girls to
join Lilith Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of EW's question, McLachlan laughed out loud. ``I am
Ginger Spice,'' she said. ``It's true. I had to quit because Lilith
was starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lilith Fair raised more than $700,000 for charities.
McLachlan hopes to double that amount this year with the help of
additional corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have a responsibility to give whatever we can. ...
(Lilith) is a big money-making thing. And I think a lot of
companies and businesses have a responsibility to give something
back. (Lilith) is a really great vehicle for doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's corporate sponsors include Biore, Excite, Royal
Neighbors of America, Starbucks Coffee, Tower Records, VH1, Levi's
and Volkswagen of America.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's sponsored the Lilith Fair Acoustic Talent Search, but
McLachlan is miffed at the company for its portrayal of her and
several tourmates in an eight-page ad section in the current issue
of Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan, who is shown with her hand down her jeans, explained
she was trying to adjust her underwear when the photographer
snapped her picture. Naturally, that was the photo Levi's chose to
use in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went away from that shoot feeling pretty bad about it,''
McLachlan said. ``I was thinking, this is exactly what I don't
want. We're supposed to be strong, independent individuals. And
there we were, looking like tramps in a brothel.''

MOUSEBOARD EASES USER STRAIN 
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN    
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger    
 c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two products in today's column offer a new way of doing things.
One of them is a different approach to the keyboard. The other
takes the mouse off the desktop and puts it on your leg.
</P>
<P>
   First, the desktop-to-leg mouse move:
</P>
<P>
   There are some times during a computer session that the keyboard
is rarely used. The mouse is the only input device used. Playing
solitaire is one example. Navigating the Internet is another. Some
games rely on mouse movements and clicks.
</P>
<P>
   MouseBoard allows users to move the mouse from the desktop to
their leg or lap. The MouseBoard is about the size of a desktop
mouse pad and made of stiffer material. The board is mounted on a
thick piece of foam that's concave on its bottom so that it fits
the contour of the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Alan K. Lovejoy, founder of Medias &AMP; Co., a Colorado company
that makes the MouseBoard, said the product is particularly
appealing to ``designers and engineers on Abode or Quark who were
getting very sore arms after a busy day. Lately, we've started
getting calls from retired folks who love to surf the Internet, but
are troubled by arthritis or an arm injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovejoy said he came up with the idea when a friend of his,
Charlee King, was using the mouse to play Hearts on the computer.
``She said her arm was getting sore,'' said Lovejoy, adding that
when she placed a book on her leg and moved the mouse to it, the
shift in position provided some relief. Keeping the book in place
was the problem. MouseBoard's saddle-like shape solved that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works well with a mouse with a cord on it,'' said Lovejoy,
``but if you have a cordless mouse that gives you a lot of freedom,
it really works well. That lets you lean back and get
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   MouseBoard is most useful in situations where control is totally
with the mouse. ``If you're going to be switching back and forth
between the mouse and the keyboard, it's more convenient to leave
the mouse next to the keyboard,'' said Lovejoy. ``But for those
times when you're using just the mouse, MouseBoard lets you relax
instead of leaning toward the computer all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   I use a trackball instead of a mouse, but the MouseBoard works
equally well with either. It's main function is to reposition the
device being used, so it really doesn't matter if a mouse or
trackball is being moved to a more comfortable location.
</P>
<P>
   The MouseBoard weighs about four ounces, has a 7{-by-10-inch
surface available in blue, black, red or purple, and costs $19.95
plus shipping and handling. It is available on the Internet
(www.mouseboards.com) or by telephone at (303) 814-1973.
</P>
<P>
   NATURAL, YET ODD LOOKING
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Natural Keyboard still looks strange, even after
being around since 1994. Microsoft grouped the keyboard into two
parts, splitting it between the 5-6, t-y, g-h and b-n keys. Then it
bent those two sections at a slight angle so the wrists sit
straighter when typing.
</P>
<P>
   The design is supposed to give a more relaxed typing position.
More than 3 million of the keyboards have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite is the successor to that
keyboard. It was introduced at the first of the year, and retains
the odd look of its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, following the computer trend of smaller and
cheaper, with new features.
</P>
<P>
   The Elite takes up slightly less desk space than the original.
It connects to the computer only through a PS/2 connection _ the
end of the connector is round and about the thickness of a pencil.
If you have one of the standard keyboard connectors about as thick
as the end of a thumb, the Elite doesn't use it. It does, however,
come with a Universal Serial Bus adapter to turn the PS/2
connection into a USB connection.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard has three more keys than found on standard 101-key
keyboards. There are two keys that work with Windows operating
systems, allowing users to bring up the ``start'' menu and to use
Windows' shortcuts. A third key functions as a right-mouse button
without having to leave the keyboard to use the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated street price of the keyboard is about $55-$65.

   COMPUTER-BOOKS (Undated) _ Clerking at a book shop one afternoon
15 years ago, a novelist named Kitty Florey watched two customers
approach the display racks. ``I get tired of these after a while,''
one said, indicating a stack of best sellers, ``but I don't know
what else to read.'' Ms. Florey proposed a few titles by Anne Tyler
and Barbara Kingsolver. Her manager suggested Ms. Florey's own
latest book. On a recent morning, the same Kitty Florey typed into
a computer the catalogue information and plot summary of ``The Man
in the Box,'' Thomas Moran's novel about an Austrian family that
shelters a Jewish doctor from the Nazis. Then she listed the book
under such categories as ``caring and caretaking,'' ``fugitives''
and ``Holocaust survivors.'' All the material became part of Muze's
data base, which some 300 bookstores offer to customers. Ms.
Florey's evolution parallels American society's: from an
old-fashioned, personal brand of taste-making to a high-tech
variety made possible by the advent of what is known as agent
software. By Samuel G. Freedman.

   WANING-CRITICS (Undated) _ These should be the best of times for
critics. The arts in America are exploding, culture has been
democratized and just about anything can be called ``art.'' Who
else but the professional critic has the expertise and the
perspicacity to go through it all, to determine what is art and
what is a masquerade, and to explain why? Yet in today's highly
commercialized society, celebrities often hold as much sway as
critics _ at least in determining popular success. Are critics
losing their influence? By Judith H. Dobrzynski.

   FATHER-ADVICE (Undated) _ Advice to mothers is as plentiful as
air. There are hundreds of books and thousands of old wives' tales.
What about advice to fathers? Tucked into books for mothers about
what they should expect from their babies and children are usually
a few pages telling them what they should expect from fathers
(usually very little). There is also a growing shelf of books of
advice for fathers: books encouraging them to take a greater part
in the children's lives, books ordering them to take back their
traditional roles and books jokingly telling them how to handle
their unpredictably moody wives and children. By Sarah Boxer.

WINDOWS 98 OFFERS LITTLE FOR HOME USER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN    
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger    
 c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's all the fuss about Windows 98? Unless you're an attorney
with the U.S. Justice Department, should you, a home user, care?
The big rollout will come June 25. Should you be in front of your
favorite computer store with a lawn chair to get in line for the
early copy?
</P>
<P>
   I won't be. Not because I already have a reviewer's beta copy,
but because I'm less enthusiastic about Windows 98's arrival than I
was about Windows 3.0 or Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the giant leap from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95, the move
to Windows 98 is only a small step _ at least for today's home
user.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Windows 98 does boot up faster. (Macintosh users love to
say, ``That's a great feature? You can re-boot quicker after a
crash?'') It does a little more than Windows 95. Some things are
easier to do.
</P>
<P>
   Some applications pop up quicker _ in some cases 50 percent
faster _ under Windows 98 than Windows 95. But is it all that
important to my computing session to have America Online start up
in 15 seconds instead of 30?
</P>
<P>
   Does Windows 98 run on my everyday workhorse computer? Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   It probably will in the future, perhaps even this year. But not
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 can run two or more monitors from a single computer.
It's a nice feature _ one that is more enticing to business users
who might be doing spreadsheets and databases at the same time _
than it is a home user. It has a more efficient file-management
system to save hard drive space. But with hard drives holding
gigabytes now instead of megabytes, home users may not find the
space need as pressing these days.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 still wants to have a good-size chunk of real estate
on the hard drive. A typical installation takes about 195
megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 also supports USB _ the universal serial bus. The USB
is wonderful: Got a new scanner? Plug it into the USB, and Windows
98 automatically knows the brand, model and what communications
ports are available for it. More stuff to add on? Simply plug it
in.
</P>
<P>
   There are some peripherals that are USB compatible, but right
now, there are more that aren't than are. In that respect, Windows
98, to steal a boast from Panasonic, is just slightly ahead of its
time.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 has many advantages over Windows 95. If I were a
systems manager, I'd be looking at its possibilities by the end of
the month. But unlike Windows 95, which had immediate advantages
for both home and business users, Windows 98 seems to pave new
roadway for business while filling in potholes in the road of home
computing.

<P>
   ``Godzilla'' wasn't much of a movie but the big, ugly monster is
winning better reviews as a parenting tool.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randall E. Osborne, an associate professor of psychology at
Indiana University-East, writes in ``The Official Godzilla
Compendium'' about how he taught his 2-year-old lessons in life
with the help of old Godzilla movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many examples in Godzilla movies of characters
helping each other,'' Osborne writes. ``Anguirus comes to
Godzilla's aid in battling Gigan and Ghidrah. I explain to my son
that it is important to know that people have different ideas and
preferences than we do, but that we must also be able to put those
differences aside ... for more important goals. He can then watch
examples of this when Rodan and Godzilla work together to defeat
Ghidrah in `Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne's son learned family values in ``Son of Godzilla'' when
``we see a poignant portrait as Godzilla tries to protect his son
from the freezing weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental consciousness? ``My son understood what pollution
was by the time he was 2 years old,'' Osborne writes. ``His
understanding, of course, came from watching the film `Godzilla vs.
Hedorah' '' in which Godzilla saves Tokyo from a giant amoeba that
evolved from industrial sludge.
</P>
<P>
   I have always been of the opinion that children will eventually
learn all of life's important lessons if you force them to watch
enough movies and TV.
</P>
<P>
   For example, from watching ``Baywatch,'' my 12-year-old learned
two valuable lessons:
</P>
<P>
   1) Always take binoculars when you go to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   2) Your binoculars could be as powerful as the Hubble Space
Telescope and you still wouldn't see any women who looked remotely
like Pamela Lee.
</P>
<P>
   When he was younger, he picked up two valuable life-lessons from
the TV show ``Mighty Morphin Power Rangers:''
</P>
<P>
   1) If you karate kick a playmate, there is a very real chance
that he or she will try to karate kick you back.
</P>
<P>
   2) Girls can kick a lot harder than you'd think.
</P>
<P>
   From watching ``Jeopardy!'' he learned:
</P>
<P>
   1) Celebrities are, as a group, astonishingly stupid.
</P>
<P>
   2) Questions about opera or ballet? Ask mom.
</P>
<P>
   From watching the horror movie, ``Halloween,'' he learned:
</P>
<P>
   1) If you think there is a deranged, psychopathic killer loose
in your house, the first thing you should do is turn off all the
lights.
</P>
<P>
   2) If, after turning off all the lights, you are still having
trouble locating the deranged, psychopathic killer, go down in the
basement (by yourself, of course) or try backing slowly into a
room.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Road Runner'' cartoons he learned:
</P>
<P>
   1) Do not jump with springs on your feet while standing under a
rock overhang.
</P>
<P>
   2) Be suspicious of any merchandise mail-ordered from Acme as it
is prone to blowing up in your face, rocketing you head-first into
a rock wall, catapulting you off a mile-high cliff or otherwise
causing you grievous bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   From the movie ``Jaws'' he learned:
</P>
<P>
   1) It is not a good idea to go skinny-dipping in the ocean at
night when there are reports of a 40-foot, man-eating, great white
shark in the area.
</P>
<P>
   2) If you are swimming and suddenly hear cello music, get out of
the pool fast.

<P>
   HONG KONG, China _ The company that has called itself the ``900
pound gorilla'' of American electric utilities is finding Asia a
cruel and trackless jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Thorns in the form of generator glitches continue to torment the
reliability of Southern Co.'s giant Shajiao C power plant in
China's booming southern industrial strip.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere throughout the continent, nettles from the Asian
financial crisis have stung the prospects of three out of the four
largest future power projects that Southern took on when it bought
control of its Asian subsidiary two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been out here in times of turmoil, and if you're
sitting back in the United States, you would probably look out here
and say, `Asia is not the place where you would like to be,''' said
F.D. ``Rick'' Kuester, who was sent out from Mississippi Power to
become a top executive in Southern's Hong Kong-based Asian
subsidiary, Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA).
</P>
<P>
   Yet dreams about electrifying the Orient still drum loud in
Southern's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the per-capita consumption of electricity
compared to anywhere else in the world,'' Kuester said, ``you can
see tremendous opportunities for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Southern's fire-breathing optimism about Asia is
not without reason.
</P>
<P>
   Its shareholders have just tasted their first Asian profits,
less than two years after Southern invested $2.1 billion to buy
into a Hong Kong billionaire's Asian power enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The initial payback on one of the biggest investments in
Southern's 75-year history was something short of gargantuan. An
earnings report for January through March showed Southern collected
$15 million in Asian profits, or about one-twentieth of Southern's
worldwide earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Southern says this is a felicitous omen because its
Asian venture wasn't expected to add to per-share earnings until
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the happiest tidings have come from the Philippines.
CEPA's mid-sized Philippines plant, the 735-megawatt coal-fired
Pagbilao Power Station, has been churning out virtually all of the
Asian profits that Southern has reported.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Shajiao C plant in China that is still hampered by
startup glitches, the Philippines' Pagbilao plant ran smoothly
enough to generate 100 percent of its contracted electrical
generating capacity from January through March.
</P>
<P>
   And Southern's much bigger 1,200 megawatt Sual coal-fired power
station in the Philippines, now under construction, is on schedule
and nearing completion on Luzon Island. Its first unit will enter
commercial operation in June 1999, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Then just last week, Southern signed an agreement to invest
about $100 million in Thailand to purchase 28 percent of a
nearly-completed 1,400-megawatt coal-fired power station on the
Thai west coast. Final details are expected to be wrapped up this
summer, Southern's Asia chief executive, Raymond Hill said late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For Southern, the most painful aspect of its venture into Asia
has been its inability to expand beyond the footprint of power
plant investments that it bought from Hong Kong entrepreneur Gordon
Wu in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Especially frustrating has been China, which Southern viewed as
its most promising patch for building new power plants because of
the country's explosive growth and its 1.2 billion potential
electricity-users.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's Hong Kong office now acknowledges that a
five-year-old joint venture that predated the Wu transaction, a
plan to build a coal-fired plant in China's Jiangsu Province ``has
been shelved for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   And in nearly two years, no new Southern Co. power plant deals
in China have been concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``China obviously needs power _ a lot of it,'' mused Kuester.
``Why then is the China market so difficult to crack?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Kuester and the rest of Southern's 16-member Asian
executive corps may be nearing an answer. After rattling the bamboo
in China for more than a year, Southern is reportedly close to
announcing one or two breakthrough deals _ perhaps as early as
during the upcoming nine-day visit to China by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One deal close to blossoming is for a Southern Co. investment in
a mid-sized Chinese 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant near the
mouth of a coal mine in the northern province of Shanxi, 150 miles
west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For about six months Southern has been pursuing this Shanxi
contract in partnership with former U.S. Senator J. Bennett
Johnston's Washington-based energy company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically in a joint venture with him on that one,''
said Kuester, referring to the former chairman of the U.S. Senate
Energy Committee who went into the energy business after retiring
from the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kuester declined to predict when the Shanxi negotiations might
conclude, saying ``it is premature to announce anything now.''
About three weeks ago, Southern's Chinese partners are known to
have suggested that the Shanxi deal be signed during the coming
Clinton visit. Southern even ordered contingency plans for a
Beijing signing ceremony. But as of Friday, Southern contract
specialists were still not satisfied, and the signing has been put
on hold.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Southern's Hong Kong-based go-getters have been
rushing to complete a significantly larger deal in China, this time
apparently without Johnston's participation and clout.
</P>
<P>
   This spring Southern dispatched a technical team to visit two
existing Chinese coal-fired power plants in coastal Shandong
province, as part of a broader, more ambitious plan to invest in
generating power for that fast-growth region between Beijing and
Shanghai. Though the deal was fairly close to completion in late
May, the recent turmoil in the Hong Kong stock market has
reportedly bumped any announcement until this fall or later.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, a report on China's official Xinhua news agency
appeared to boost Southern's chances for the Shanxi deal. It
disclosed that Shanxi Province has budgeted $8.4 billion to expand
10 coal-fired power plants and make the province a major
electricity exporter over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coal is expected to continue to provide 70 percent of the
country's energy needs well into the next century as China has few
alternatives to satisfy fast-expanding demand for power,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of cheery intelligence that first attracted
Southern to open a small business development office in Hong Kong
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The first three years of Southern's Asia business prospecting
yielded meager results. So in October 1996, Southern chairman A.W.
Dalhberg decided to risk a quantum leap by concluding a $2.7
billion contract to buy 80 percent of Wu's CEPA.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year Southern's profits were so robust that
Dahlberg could tell shareholders that Southern was the ``900-pound
gorilla'' of the American power business, and was intent on
becoming a global ``1,800-pound gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu, who needed cash to pare down debts from other heavily
leveraged ventures, received $2.1 billion from Southern, plus a
$600 million one-time cash dividend from CEPA's treasury.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Southern expected to operate CEPA indefinitely in
partnership with Wu, who was counted on to add his vision and his
Rolodex of power industry contacts to Southern's base of technical
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   But the Asian financial crisis, starting with a tsunami wave of
Asian currency devaluations last summer, pressured Southern and Wu
to part ways.
</P>
<P>
   Though the full story of their breakup remains tightly held, one
seed of tension was their diverging appraisals about the future
profitability of CEPA'S Tanjung Jati B power project in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Wu _ contending that Tanjung Jati B would ultimately yield $20
billion in gross income _ had pressed Southern to deliver a $138
million contingency payment that had been part of the original $2.7
billion CEPA price tag.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern said no, on grounds that the Indonesians had not
made a binding commitment on how much they would pay for Tanjung
Jati B's electricity once the plant was built.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Asian currency crisis was starting to explode last
July, Southern bought out Wu's remaining 20 percent of CEPA for
$150 million in cash, plus Southern's share of the CEPA rights to
develop the disputed Indonesian Tanjung Jati plant.
</P>
<P>
   For Southern, this second deal with Wu came in the nick of time.
Within weeks, Indonesia's economy was sucked into a whirlpool that
would squeeze out three-quarters of the value of the Indonesian
currency and help cause this spring's ouster of President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanjung Jati B plant, now back in Wu's portfolio, is on
indefinite hold, and Southern is one of the few international
electric power companies that emerged from the Indonesia debacle
unscathed. Indonesia's state-owned electricity distributor declared
this month that it ``has no money'' to pay foreign-based power
companies for contracted generating plants in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, Wu has congratulated himself on getting the
better of the deal in the two-stage takeover by Southern.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sold CEPA, it was based on this principle: we already
had completed contracts and there was a whole bag of receivables on
hand,'' Wu told the South China Morning Post last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comment at the time was that I had sold the family jewels.
At $18.50 (the price per share Southern paid for CEPA), I was a
happy seller. I'd be lucky to get half that price today.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern's Hong Kong executives prefer not to publicly dispute
Wu's judgment about what CEPA was really worth.
</P>
<P>
   However, a footnote in Southern's 1997 annual report informs
stockholders that Southern's $2.1 billion net cost for acquiring
100 percent of CEPA ``exceeded the fair market value of net assets
by approximately $1.6 billion.'' The annual report explained that
the excess over market value in buying the Asian subsidiary _
$1.649 billion _ was entered onto Southern Co.'s books as an
``increase in goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances have increased that Southern may never receive a payback
on three out of the four biggest future Asian power plant projects
that were on Wu's drawing boards when he sold his company to
Southern.

   In addition to Indonesia's Tanjung Jati B that Wu reclaimed, the
potential non-performers are:
</P>
<P>
   -- A proposed $1.6 billion Keti Bandar coal-fired power plant in
Pakistan. This Wu-initiated plant ``is basically at a standstill,''
Kuester acknowledged in an interview. ``They (the Pakistanis) don't
need any more power, they don't want any more power, and we are not
pushing ahead on that because it doesn't make sense for the country
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A proposed $5.5 billion electricity mega-plant in India.
Kuester said the new Indian government has signaled a willingness
to proceed with some electricity mega-plants. But the India
``memorandum of agreement'' that Southern inherited from Wu was not
a fully negotiated deal. ``We still have to stand back and assess
the situation _ is that a project that makes sense for us,
economically?'' said Kuester.
</P>
<P>
   When Southern bought CEPA, it also acquired a billion tons of
coal reserves in a remote mine in Austria. Southern is weighing
construction of a coal-fired power station near the mine, which
would convert the coal into revenue-producing electricity without
today's high transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
   Prickly though Southern's path has been, Kuester believes the
American utility giant is gradually becoming more comfortable in
its new Asian habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so different in Alabama or Mississippi or Georgia,''
Kuester said. ``You don't walk into somebody's office and all of a
sudden do a business deal and make friends. It takes a while to
develop a relationship ... The fact that they didn't know who we
were and didn't trust us when we walked in the door, and that it
took some time, that didn't surprise me.''

<P>
   HONG KONG, China _ The company that has called itself the ``900
pound gorilla'' of American electric utilities is finding Asia a
cruel and trackless jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Thorns in the form of generator glitches continue to torment the
reliability of Southern Co.'s giant Shajiao C power plant in
China's booming southern industrial strip.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere throughout the continent, nettles from the Asian
financial crisis have stung the prospects of three out of the four
largest future power projects that Southern took on when it bought
control of its Asian subsidiary two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been out here in times of turmoil, and if you're
sitting back in the United States, you would probably look out here
and say, `Asia is not the place where you would like to be,''' said
F.D. ``Rick'' Kuester, who was sent out from Mississippi Power to
become a top executive in Southern's Hong Kong-based Asian
subsidiary, Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA).
</P>
<P>
   Yet dreams about electrifying the Orient still drum loud in
Southern's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the per-capita consumption of electricity
compared to anywhere else in the world,'' Kuester said, ``you can
see tremendous opportunities for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Southern's fire-breathing optimism about Asia is
not without reason.
</P>
<P>
   Its shareholders have just tasted their first Asian profits,
less than two years after Southern invested $2.1 billion to buy
into a Hong Kong billionaire's Asian power enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The initial payback on one of the biggest investments in
Southern's 75-year history was something short of gargantuan. An
earnings report for January through March showed Southern collected
$15 million in Asian profits, or about one-twentieth of Southern's
worldwide earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Southern says this is a felicitous omen because its
Asian venture wasn't expected to add to per-share earnings until
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the happiest tidings have come from the Philippines.
CEPA's mid-sized Philippines plant, the 735-megawatt coal-fired
Pagbilao Power Station, has been churning out virtually all of the
Asian profits that Southern has reported.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Shajiao C plant in China that is still hampered by
startup glitches, the Philippines' Pagbilao plant ran smoothly
enough to generate 100 percent of its contracted electrical
generating capacity from January through March.
</P>
<P>
   And Southern's much bigger 1,200 megawatt Sual coal-fired power
station in the Philippines, now under construction, is on schedule
and nearing completion on Luzon Island. Its first unit will enter
commercial operation in June 1999, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Then just last week, Southern signed an agreement to invest
about $100 million in Thailand to purchase 28 percent of a
nearly-completed 1,400-megawatt coal-fired power station on the
Thai west coast. Final details are expected to be wrapped up this
summer, Southern's Asia chief executive, Raymond Hill said late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For Southern, the most painful aspect of its venture into Asia
has been its inability to expand beyond the footprint of power
plant investments that it bought from Hong Kong entrepreneur Gordon
Wu in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Especially frustrating has been China, which Southern viewed as
its most promising patch for building new power plants because of
the country's explosive growth and its 1.2 billion potential
electricity-users.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's Hong Kong office now acknowledges that a
five-year-old joint venture that predated the Wu transaction, a
plan to build a coal-fired plant in China's Jiangsu Province ``has
been shelved for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   And in nearly two years, no new Southern Co. power plant deals
in China have been concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``China obviously needs power _ a lot of it,'' mused Kuester.
``Why then is the China market so difficult to crack?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Kuester and the rest of Southern's 16-member Asian
executive corps may be nearing an answer. After rattling the bamboo
in China for more than a year, Southern is reportedly close to
announcing one or two breakthrough deals _ perhaps as early as
during the upcoming nine-day visit to China by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One deal close to blossoming is for a Southern Co. investment in
a mid-sized Chinese 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant near the
mouth of a coal mine in the northern province of Shanxi, 150 miles
west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For about six months Southern has been pursuing this Shanxi
contract in partnership with former U.S. Senator J. Bennett
Johnston's Washington-based energy company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically in a joint venture with him on that one,''
said Kuester, referring to the former chairman of the U.S. Senate
Energy Committee who went into the energy business after retiring
from the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kuester declined to predict when the Shanxi negotiations might
conclude, saying ``it is premature to announce anything now.''
About three weeks ago, Southern's Chinese partners are known to
have suggested that the Shanxi deal be signed during the coming
Clinton visit. Southern even ordered contingency plans for a
Beijing signing ceremony. But as of Friday, Southern contract
specialists were still not satisfied, and the signing has been put
on hold.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Southern's Hong Kong-based go-getters have been
rushing to complete a significantly larger deal in China, this time
apparently without Johnston's participation and clout.
</P>
<P>
   This spring Southern dispatched a technical team to visit two
existing Chinese coal-fired power plants in coastal Shandong
province, as part of a broader, more ambitious plan to invest in
generating power for that fast-growth region between Beijing and
Shanghai. Though the deal was fairly close to completion in late
May, the recent turmoil in the Hong Kong stock market has
reportedly bumped any announcement until this fall or later.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, a report on China's official Xinhua news agency
appeared to boost Southern's chances for the Shanxi deal. It
disclosed that Shanxi Province has budgeted $8.4 billion to expand
10 coal-fired power plants and make the province a major
electricity exporter over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coal is expected to continue to provide 70 percent of the
country's energy needs well into the next century as China has few
alternatives to satisfy fast-expanding demand for power,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of cheery intelligence that first attracted
Southern to open a small business development office in Hong Kong
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The first three years of Southern's Asia business prospecting
yielded meager results. So in October 1996, Southern chairman A.W.
Dalhberg decided to risk a quantum leap by concluding a $2.7
billion contract to buy 80 percent of Wu's CEPA.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year Southern's profits were so robust that
Dahlberg could tell shareholders that Southern was the ``900-pound
gorilla'' of the American power business, and was intent on
becoming a global ``1,800-pound gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu, who needed cash to pare down debts from other heavily
leveraged ventures, received $2.1 billion from Southern, plus a
$600 million one-time cash dividend from CEPA's treasury.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Southern expected to operate CEPA indefinitely in
partnership with Wu, who was counted on to add his vision and his
Rolodex of power industry contacts to Southern's base of technical
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   But the Asian financial crisis, starting with a tsunami wave of
Asian currency devaluations last summer, pressured Southern and Wu
to part ways.
</P>
<P>
   Though the full story of their breakup remains tightly held, one
seed of tension was their diverging appraisals about the future
profitability of CEPA'S Tanjung Jati B power project in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Wu _ contending that Tanjung Jati B would ultimately yield $20
billion in gross income _ had pressed Southern to deliver a $138
million contingency payment that had been part of the original $2.7
billion CEPA price tag.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern said no, on grounds that the Indonesians had not
made a binding commitment on how much they would pay for Tanjung
Jati B's electricity once the plant was built.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Asian currency crisis was starting to explode last
July, Southern bought out Wu's remaining 20 percent of CEPA for
$150 million in cash, plus Southern's share of the CEPA rights to
develop the disputed Indonesian Tanjung Jati plant.
</P>
<P>
   For Southern, this second deal with Wu came in the nick of time.
Within weeks, Indonesia's economy was sucked into a whirlpool that
would squeeze out three-quarters of the value of the Indonesian
currency and help cause this spring's ouster of President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanjung Jati B plant, now back in Wu's portfolio, is on
indefinite hold, and Southern is one of the few international
electric power companies that emerged from the Indonesia debacle
unscathed. Indonesia's state-owned electricity distributor declared
this month that it ``has no money'' to pay foreign-based power
companies for contracted generating plants in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, Wu has congratulated himself on getting the
better of the deal in the two-stage takeover by Southern.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sold CEPA, it was based on this principle: we already
had completed contracts and there was a whole bag of receivables on
hand,'' Wu told the South China Morning Post last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comment at the time was that I had sold the family jewels.
At $18.50 (the price per share Southern paid for CEPA), I was a
happy seller. I'd be lucky to get half that price today.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern's Hong Kong executives prefer not to publicly dispute
Wu's judgment about what CEPA was really worth.
</P>
<P>
   However, a footnote in Southern's 1997 annual report informs
stockholders that Southern's $2.1 billion net cost for acquiring
100 percent of CEPA ``exceeded the fair market value of net assets
by approximately $1.6 billion.'' The annual report explained that
the excess over market value in buying the Asian subsidiary _
$1.649 billion _ was entered onto Southern Co.'s books as an
``increase in goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances have increased that Southern may never receive a payback
on three out of the four biggest future Asian power plant projects
that were on Wu's drawing boards when he sold his company to
Southern.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Indonesia's Tanjung Jati B that Wu reclaimed, the
potential non-performers are:
</P>
<P>
   -- A proposed $1.6 billion Keti Bandar coal-fired power plant in
Pakistan. This Wu-initiated plant ``is basically at a standstill,''
Kuester acknowledged in an interview. ``They (the Pakistanis) don't
need any more power, they don't want any more power, and we are not
pushing ahead on that because it doesn't make sense for the country
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A proposed $5.5 billion electricity mega-plant in India.
Kuester said the new Indian government has signaled a willingness
to proceed with some electricity mega-plants. But the India
``memorandum of agreement'' that Southern inherited from Wu was not
a fully negotiated deal. ``We still have to stand back and assess
the situation _ is that a project that makes sense for us,

coal reserves in a remote mine in Austria. Southern is weighing

American utility giant is gradually becoming more comfortable in
its new Asian habitat.

<P>

Kuester said. ``You don't walk into somebody's office and all of a

   GUANGDONG PROVINCE, China _ ``The people who run power plants
are exactly alike all over the world,'' says Jim Webber, a 39-year
Southern Co. veteran who left retirement to help knock the kinks
out of Atlanta-based utility giant's first power plant in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the same, they have the same hobbies, they are all
engineers,'' Webber said. ``China is very much like Turkey. Turkey
was very much like Italy. Italy is very much like the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can walk into any plant in the world. I know the equipment.
And if I know a guy's position in the plant, I basically know how
he thinks. It's basically the way I think. This is all a very large
family, if you will. We all have the same purpose in life, and that
is to produce power.''
</P>
<P>
   At 57, Webber is one of five Southern Co. engineers and
technicians assigned to monitor operations in the new Shajiao C
coal-fired power plant in Guangdong Province, about 50 miles north
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   When Southern bought the controlling share of Hong Kong
entrepreneur Gordon Wu's Asian power venture, it inherited a
32-percent interest in this 1,980-megawatt coal-fired power plant.
So far, it is Southern's only beachhead in China.
</P>
<P>
   Wu's company had built the plant for the Guangdong Province
Power Bureau, and it became Southern's contractual duty to its
Chinese joint venture partner to make sure the enormous mechanism
is tuned to deliver power at peak efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The Shajiao C plant functions. But not yet at 100-percent
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   When Wu sold out to Southern, he left behind a plant still in
the start-up phase which had more than 120 mechanical,
environmental and structural shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   As of early this month, Southern engineers had managed to trim
Shajiao C's ``punch list'' to 107 flaws that needed fixing before
the Chinese would accept the plant as fully operational.
</P>
<P>
   One recurring problem has involved the three pairs of huge air
fans that blow powdered coal into the three 80-foot-tall combustion
chambers called boilers.
</P>
<P>
   Variation in the demand for power occasionally causes one the
fans to shut down. When that happens, an automatic control box is
supposed to stop some of the unit's coal pulverizing equipment so
that the unit can ``stabilize'' at a 50-percent power output.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons Southern hasn't fully diagnosed, the pulverizing
units sometimes fail to shut down. This causes one of the remaining
fans to heat up and get overloaded, until it shuts down and knocks
one of Shajiao C's three power-producing units out of production.
</P>
<P>
   Except for trying to remedy the defects, Southern has no role in
the day-by-day operations of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The control room is run by Chinese plant operators employed by
the Guangdong Province Power Bureau, who earn about 17 yuan (about
$2.10) per hour, compared to $20 an hour for a coal-fired power
plant operator in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese engineer in charge of operating Shajiao C, Zheng
Linfu, said he's pleased with Southern's progress in addressing the
plant's defects, even though the remaining problems are ``not a
few.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time Southern took over, the relationship on the
technical level has improved greatly,'' Zheng said.

DADDY'S GIRLS: TO THEM, HE'S RICH AS COSBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One recent Sunday, my daughters were complaining _ again _ that
I never have any money.
</P>
<P>
   And as always when they're done running me down, they offered up
a long list of the attributes that make their father the wonderful
man that he is. Included among those is the fact that he is rich.
As in, say, Bill Cosby rich _ and just as generous and
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   I shared this little bit of information with a friend recently,
and when she could stop laughing, she told me it reminded her of
her relationship with her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father could do no wrong,'' she told me. ``I was definitely
a Daddy's girl. I still am.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how you might describe my daughters, Jamila and Asha. I
don't know when it happened, and so it seems to me that it was
always that way. I birthed them. He stood by with tears in his
eyes. I cook them meals. Jimmy eradicates the nutrients from their
foods. I wash their clothes. He fades them. I discipline. He loves.
</P>
<P>
   I'm certain that my daughters love me, but sometimes I'm green
all over when I consider their relationship with Jimmy. I don't
recall either of them ever crying into the phone for me to come
home, or jumping out of bed to greet me the minute the key turned
in the door. If I miss a goodnight kiss, I have to get it while
they sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I am eternally grateful they love him the way they do,
that they believe in him and trust him to love them.
</P>
<P>
   And I wonder how it is that African-American men like Jimmy are
not known for their good parenting skills, for the way they love
and care for their children.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to forget the disproportionate number of them who are
behind bars, who make up the unemployment lines. But there are a
great many of these men who, every day, try hard to get it right,
to be there for their children.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen them, and I've talked to them. I've heard the pride in
their voices, seen it on their faces when they talk about their
children. They go to PTA meetings. They attend ballet and piano
recitals. They help with homework and visit the schools. They go on
class field trips and help at school parties.
</P>
<P>
   As I write this, a long chain of faces dances in my memory like
a kite on a string. They smile back at me because they are not just
faces, they are the men I know. They are not perfect, but they are
good and decent like Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, while they were visiting me at work, I asked
Jamila and Asha to write part of this column. I asked them to tell
you why they love their father. You should've seen their little
faces light up.
</P>
<P>
   Once we settled on which of them would write first, the typical
childlike responses _ ``He takes me places and he makes me happy''
_ poured forth with the kind of heart and vigor usually witnessed
only on the playground.
</P>
<P>
   ``He buys me things even when I don't ask,'' Asha wrote. ``OH! I
all most forgot. Sometimes he plays with me and he takes me to my
friends' parties and to the movies. He does special things.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Jamila: ``I love my dad because he loves me and he takes
care of me. He gives me $20.00 each month. And of all the dads, I
must confess, I think he is the very best.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't dare tell Jamila and Asha that their father isn't rich.
They'll discover that on their own.
</P>
<P>
   What I will try to teach them is that the love and time their
father lavishes on them is what makes THEM rich.

entrepreneur Gordon Wu's Asian power venture, it inherited a
32-percent interest in this 1,980-megawatt coal-fired power plant.
So far, it is Southern's only beachhead in China.
</P>
<P>
   Wu's company had built the plant for the Guangdong Province
Power Bureau, and it became Southern's contractual duty to its
Chinese joint venture partner to make sure the enormous mechanism
is tuned to deliver power at peak efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The Shajiao C plant functions. But not yet at 100-percent
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   When Wu sold out to Southern, he left behind a plant still in
the start-up phase which had more than 120 mechanical,
environmental and structural shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   As of early this month, Southern engineers had managed to trim
Shajiao C's ``punch list'' to 107 flaws that needed fixing before
the Chinese would accept the plant as fully operational.
</P>
<P>
   One recurring problem has involved the three pairs of huge air
fans that blow powdered coal into the three 80-foot-tall combustion
chambers called boilers.
</P>
<P>
   Variation in the demand for power occasionally causes one the
fans to shut down. When that happens, an automatic control box is
supposed to stop some of the unit's coal pulverizing equipment so
that the unit can ``stabilize'' at a 50-percent power output.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons Southern hasn't fully diagnosed, the pulverizing
units sometimes fail to shut down. This causes one of the remaining
fans to heat up and get overloaded, until it shuts down and knocks
one of Shajiao C's three power-producing units out of production.
</P>
<P>
   Except for trying to remedy the defects, Southern has no role in
the day-by-day operations of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The control room is run by Chinese plant operators employed by
the Guangdong Province Power Bureau, who earn about 17 yuan (about
$2.10) per hour, compared to $20 an hour for a coal-fired power
plant operator in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese engineer in charge of operating Shajiao C, Zheng
Linfu, said he's pleased with Southern's progress in addressing the
plant's defects, even though the remaining problems are ``not a
few.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time Southern took over, the relationship on the
technical level has improved greatly,'' Zheng said.

   SHANGHAI _ China's movers and shakers will activate a global
re-education campaign when President Bill Clinton reaches the
country on Thursday with an entourage expected here to number more
than 1,000 aides, congressmen, journalists, industrialists and
think-tankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The images of China in the United States are not yet
adequate,'' said Zhou Mingwei, director general of Shanghai's
foreign affairs department, a branch of the Chinese foreign
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important opportunity at this moment, at the
end of this century and the beginning of the new century, for
America to have a better idea about China.''
</P>
<P>
   Image _ that was the word most-repeated by a range of Chinese
interviewed about the importance to their country of Clinton's
unprecedented nine-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   This trip is China's hope for blotting out the image of a
monolithic, unyielding communist power, the image freeze-framed in
millions of Western minds in the shape of a man standing defiantly
alone in the path of a tank during the bloody crackdown that ended
the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989. It happened three
months after then-U.S. President George Bush walked on Chinese
soil, but assured that nearly a decade would lapse before another
president dared to return.
</P>
<P>
   In full concert with the White House, China is orchestrating a
tour competitive with Madison Avenue's deftest ad campaigns, one
aimed at reforming Western views of China on a scale grander than
the ``re-education'' of urbanites dispatched to learn from the
peasants in the harrowing 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   From the glories of ancient culture to the high-tech marvels of
tomorrow, the president will discover China.
</P>
<P>
   But images are cast in two directions, and Chinese intellectuals
who believe America has wrongly snubbed their country for a decade
are warning Clinton to beware that the impression he leaves does
not come across as arrogant and preachy to China's 1.2 billion
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton should not say America is the beacon of democracy in
the world, and China should follow. That's finished,'' said Yang
Jiemian, director of American studies at the Shanghai Institute of
International Studies, a think tank that advises the nation's
leaders. ``You have to have new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese business leaders expect the presidential visit to
build investor confidence, or even to yield new deals like the $4.2
billion worth of contracts announced when China's President Jiang
Zemin visited America last October.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for Clinton to ring the opening gong on the Shanghai
Stock Exchange elated Yang Guoping, general manager of the Shanghai
Dazhong Taxi Co., Ltd., a booming transportation, hotel and biotech
conglomerate listed on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mr. Jiang rang the opening bell at the New York Stock
Exchange, the stocks in the United States soared 20 percent,'' he
said, ``so we think this will be helpful for the stocks in
Shanghai. Though maybe not so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he joined other Chinese in assessing that deals and
communiques take a backseat to ending what one academic called
``the abnormal situation'' characterized by a decade of tension,
continuing sanctions and irregular top-level exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese will do their best to depict a nation that is
jumping a time warp, advancing through generations worth of
technological and economic development in an atmosphere freer than
ever before. And they are expecting to have a broad audience of
Americans who will take home the official snapshot of changing
China.
</P>
<P>
   The exact numbers in the Clinton entourage may never be added
up, but the Chinese are ready for a friendly invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total numbers that will accompany the president are
different every day,'' said Yang Jiemian, the American studies
expert. ``The minimum I think is 1,200 and the most I heard is
about 3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai foreign affairs office, tasked with keeping track
of such visitors, at last count was expecting 1,400 people,
including the press corps, to arrive in the wake of the first
couple and daughter Chelsea. Another 300 aides and U.S. Secret
Service agents were due here early to finish last-minute advance
work.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House is declining to give an estimate, that
number will far exceed the body count of the official delegation.
Ancillary visitors will include aides to Cabinet officials,
journalists outside the tent of the White House press corps,
business executives eying a new locus of world economic growth and
academic China specialists drawn to the summit as a magnet that
well may set the compass of U.S.-Sino relations for coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai is the broadest stroke of the new sketch China wants to
beam out to the world via the scores of opinion-molding visitors
and through the television clips and news stories that will fill
media across the continents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will spend two days and three nights in this showcase
city of 13 million people, the metropolis that China's leaders
calculated only six years ago should become the preeminent
financial and high-tech center of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulous plotting of how and where to grow the city has
created a skyline studded with skyscrapers and a smart lifestyle
totally alien to China just a decade ago. Nearly $20 billion of
infrastructure investment has produced elegant new bridges,
elevated cross-city highways and a central public square lined by
City Hall, an extraordinary Shanghai Museum and a new Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Development of the Pudong New Area, where multinational industry
and financial institutions are enticed by liberal export policies,
helped Shanghai's gross domestic product reach $41 billion in 1997
after six years of annual double-digit growth rates. Since 1991,
retail sales have grown an average of 21.8 percent a year, and
industrial output value 17.1 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, we didn't know what the stock market is,''
said Tu Guangshao, the 40-year-old president of the Shanghai Stock
Exchange. ``The only thing we knew is that the stock market was a
product of capitalism, and that is something we must resist.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Tu said the financial community is hoping Clinton
will trail along a group of American chief executives to engage in
more ``cooperative relationships'' with their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet below the surface of this new China lie some of the same old
approaches and sticky issues that have frustrated good relations
with Americans.
</P>
<P>
   An example is the soon-to-open General Motors plant, a joint
venture with Shanghai's government-run car company that will
produce a variant of the Buick Regal.
</P>
<P>
   GM tried mightily to lure Clinton to the factory, but the big
U.S. strike this month _ based largely on workers' protests against
GM's cheap, non-domestic operations, just like this one _ seems to
have sunk hopes for a presidential drop-in. Celebrated as a pride
of Shanghai, the plant is a potential embarrassment to an American
president.
</P>
<P>
   The entire super-structure of economic development here is a
different animal from Western capitalism, one carefully controlled
and still dominated by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The stock exchange, in most countries the herald of free
enterprise, lists almost exclusively state-run companies. Set up to
draw capital to state enterprises, it shuts out the most daring of
China's fledgling capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies hoping to manufacture goods for sale within
China had better find a Chinese partner, and that means a
government-run company, with which they will share the profits and
more importantly the technology they are required to hand over.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the most important bases of China's new great
leap into the 21st Century: the technology Westerners are bringing
to the building of everything from cars to computers to nuclear
power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction of Shanghai itself has been approached in the
typical command-plan manner of a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people living where skyscrapers should rise? One
million people were forced to move from the center city to the
suburbs. Shanghai Vice Mayor Zhou Mu Yao, who said another million
families have yet to be relocated, emphasized that they are moving
from substandard to bigger, better housing.
</P>
<P>
   That is surely the case, yet stories abound of Shanghai
residents awakened at 5 a.m. by construction workers who bundle
them out to a truck and start whacking down the walls.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the visions President Clinton and the attendant
world audience will absorb beginning this week.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the sharp young students, ambitious farmers
and savvy business executives Clinton will meet on his China tour
are unrepresentative. But they won't tell the whole story of a
nation still stretching out of old ways and means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance is to realize how we who have different
concepts can live together, can work together,'' said Zhou Mingwei
of the Chinese Foreign Affairs Department. ``I think China is not a
place for limited imagination. It is especially not a place for
limited imagining of China-U.S. relations.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ Here is a chronology of previous presidential visits
to China and how they came about:
</P>
<P>
   April 1971 _ China used ``Ping-Pong diplomacy'' to signal
China's readiness for a thaw with Washington after two decades of
animosity following the Korean War. Premier Zhou Enlai invited 15
American table tennis players and three reporters to Beijing for
what Zhou called ``a new page'' in U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
   July 9, 1971 _ President Richard Nixon's national security
adviser, Henry Kissinger, vanishing on a trip to Pakistan, secretly
flew to Beijing. Kissinger and Premier Zhou Enlai tentatively
agreed that their countries should cease being enemies. At
Kissinger's insistence, the Chinese agreed to refrain from dealings
with Nixon's political rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 21, 1972 _ Nixon electrified the world by stepping off Air
Force One in Beijing and shaking hands with Premier Zhou Enlai,
thus symbolizing America's de facto recognition of the Chinese
Communist revolution of 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 28, 1972 _ Nixon and Zhou Enlai issued a ``joint
communique'' in Shanghai committing the United States to
``normalization'' of relations between the U.S. and mainland China.
In it the United States accepted that ``there is but one China and
Taiwan is a part of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 15, 1978 _ President Jimmy Carter announced
``normalization'' of relations in Washington, carrying out Nixon's
pledge. Carter promised the withdrawal of the last 750 U.S. troops
from Taiwan. Congress responded a few months later with the Taiwan
Relations Act, which obligates the United States to defend Taiwan
in case of aggression from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   April 30, 1984 _ President Ronald Reagan ended a seemingly
symbolic six-day trip to China that turned out to be a turning
point. In the next five years, trade and security cooperation
blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 25-26, 1989 _ President George Bush was glowingly received
in Beijing by Chinese Premier Li Peng. But Chinese police stopped
dissident astrophysicist Fang Lizhi from reaching a presidential
dinner to which he had been invited at the U.S. embassy. Bush
publicly expressed ``regret'' to Chinese leaders over the incident.
</P>
<P>
   June 4, 1989 _ Chinese troops killed 500 to 1,000 people in
Beijing while quelling a pro-democracy uprising centered on
Tiananmen Square. Appalled at the violence, Congress and the Bush
Administration imposed sanctions on trade and military cooperation
with China, some of which still remains in effect.

   BEIJING _ This is the city central to your China trip.
</P>
<P>
   From the chaotic alleys called hutongs to the grace of the
Forbidden City built for the emperor and his entourage, China's
capital can keep you happily occupied for five days. After that, it
gets to be work.
</P>
<P>
   An aimless stroll or float across the lake in Beihai Park will
put you in the company of Chinese relaxing away an afternoon. Or
try hunting down the Niujie Mosque, where tranquil gardens date
back to the 15th Century, and the nearby Fayuansi Buddhist temple
to see an ancient spiritual dimension of modern Chinese life.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recommendations specific to Beijing touring:
</P>
<P>
   Take care if attracted by the colorful, fun-looking pedi-cabs
whose drivers will drive you crazy with their constant pitch to
ride. They're safe enough, but at the end of the trip the peddlers
will find some reason to charge you more than the promised price.
It's unpleasant and worth avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   You will want a day trip to climb the Great Wall and can choose
one of three places to do it. Pass up Badaling if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mutianyu is a site half an hour further from the center of
Beijing, but is much less crowded and more majestic. Even further
from downtown is Simatai, which we find most impressive. Both
Mutianyu and Simatai run cable cars up the steep ridges to the
wall, but Simatai still requires a taxing half-hour climb up stone
stairs from the top of the cable. The wall itself has not been
repaired for the last couple of centuries, so walking the entire
open section is real exercise and not recommended on a wet day. Yet
the isolation of the place, small numbers of tourists, and
unspoiled mountain vistas are magnificent. Plus, the ride out gives
an intriguing glimpse of village and farm life.
</P>
<P>
   Our most important advice is to get a hotel as close to the
center as possible, which means the environs of the Forbidden City
and Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of luxury hotels string out toward the airport in the
northeast, but they are best reserved for business travelers whose
duties take them to the new high-rise office buildings also located
there. Most are a 40-minute to one-hour drive from the center, and
offer little to visit unless the Hard Rock Cafe is your top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Hotel and Palace Hotel are in the lively Wangfujing
shopping district about a 15- to 20-minute walk from the entry of
the Forbidden City. The Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (the chain's only
hotel in the center) is in the same area, and all three are well
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   However, our favorite is the place we're living, the Beijing
Hotel. Although a Chinese government hotel, it used to be the only
place foreigners could stay. It isn't a five-star luxury hotel, but
has nearly all the amenities you could need. It is surrounded by
shops and restaurants and is within two blocks of Tiananmen Square.
The hotel's gift shops are reasonable and have a huge selection,
should you chose not to spend hours digging through Beijing's
eclectic markets.
</P>
<P>
   Its selection of foreign-language television is limited mostly
to CNN, but the view from your balcony will be much more beguiling
than any television program. When making a reservation, have your
travel agent request a room on a high floor ending in the numbers
36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43 or 44, which all face the western hills.
</P>
<P>
   From these rooms, you will directly overlook the red and yellow
pitched roofs of the Forbidden City, and with binoculars can see
details of the morning flag-raising on Tiananmen Square. The scene
is unmatched.

<P>
   BEIJING _ If you know China, don't bother reading this. You are
already convinced that from megalopolis to mist-shrouded
mountaintop, China is an engaging place.
</P>
<P>
   This is written for the couple of hundred million other
Americans who may love to knock about in bizarre places but haven't
yet made it to the Middle Kingdom. You'll find that China offers
spectacular travel _ riveting vistas, exotic cultures embracing
thousands of years and enticing food on almost every corner of
every city.
</P>
<P>
   If the news coverage surrounding President Clinton's trip to
China June 25-July 3 intrigues you _ whether it's an aged peasant's
creased smile or the serenity of a Guilin lagoon that sinks the
hook in your wanderlust _ make a plan and go for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the three months we've been living and working in China,
we've managed a sampling of some not-to-miss places. China is more
tourist-friendly than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But you should also recognize that this still isn't a country
for the haphazard traveler _ except one who is very experienced,
very patient, or well-versed in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist infrastructure is still building, which means the
Chinese working the taxis, trains and hotels often aren't equipped
to meet the needs of the traveler without a group or a guide.
</P>
<P>
   You will be hard-pressed to find an English speaker even at a
place as cosmopolitan as the Beijing train station. (Our lessons in
Mandarin proved critical the first night we arrived in Beijing. Our
train was two hours late, and the travel agent who was supposed to
meet us at the train station had deserted, leaving us to track down
luggage in an unmarked back room, then negotiate a little-used
customs office and find a midnight taxi at a remote corner of the
station.)
</P>
<P>
   And few cities outside Beijing and Shanghai bother to
transliterate street signs into pinyin, the Latin equivalent of
Chinese characters that enables westerners to follow a map.
</P>
<P>
   That said, even the most inexperienced tourist can select from
the huge palette of sites available in China and create a wonderful
vacation. It requires some groundwork, but then so does most
foreign travel.
</P>
<P>
   In our wanderings here, we've come up with a few tips that may
help.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most relaxing aspects of touring China _ and one of
the most essential _ is reading the guidebooks. Compared to the
travel books on many parts of the world, those about China are
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   These are good reads even if you're not planning a trip, but
just interested in the world's most populous nation with one of the
world's oldest cultures.
</P>
<P>
   We have four recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   -- The newly updated ``Fodor's China'' may be the best
all-around book for an American tourist, giving evocative history
and cultural notes along with hotel and restaurant listings that
you can count on to meet U.S. comfort standards.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Lonely Planet'' includes lower-budget listings and
information that may appeal more to the younger traveler.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Rough Guide'' presents a breezier British style, and in
addition to the typical sites and accommodations, it covers places
slightly off the well-trod western tourist track. It also has a
good section on Chinese phrases.
</P>
<P>
   -- The ``Blue Guide'' is useful for its typically exhaustive
descriptions of every tourist site.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever book you choose, you can believe their descriptions
that defy the stories travelers brought home just 10 or 15 years
ago about austere Chinese hotels and lousy restaurants. That isn't
true today.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a package tour or travelling independently may be a
harder decision in China than elsewhere. You will almost certainly
run into glitches if you go it alone. The question is how easily
you can adjust to complications.
</P>
<P>
   Your American travel agent can make bookings if you opt out of a
group trip, but normally cannot hand over to you in advance the
tickets for internal China transportation. Foreign travel agencies
must rely on the government's China International Travel Services
(CITS), which tries hard but may fall a dab short of success.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before flight time, we have been handed tickets with the
wrong return flight. We've also encountered other travelers who
either got incorrect tickets or were missing tickets when CITS
delivered them to the hotel. One obstacle is that CITS insists on
parcelling out tickets as you travel through your itinerary, rather
than issue a full set when you arrive. That leaves scant time for
fixing errors.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is arranging transportation as you go along.
It sounds daunting, but is remarkably easy. Travel agencies have
offices in most major hotels and can write air and train tickets on
the spot, though making such late reservations carries a small
chance of your chosen flight being fully booked. One pitfall: you
will probably find the departure city and the destination written
in Chinese characters. To get around this, ask the travel agent to
give you a computer printout of the itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a guide to walk you through major airports, since
signs and announcements are in both Chinese and English. Flight
attendants also use both languages, but communication much beyond
``coffee'' or ``beer'' might strain the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is a confidence-building experience. Many airlines
use Boeing jets on internal routes, and all follow international
standards _ no goats on board or passengers sitting on suitcases in
the aisles, as happens in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is whether you can handle a flight that
gets diverted. We ran into a Canadian couple who related the
harrowing experience of making an unscheduled landing at a small
regional airport near Chongqing due to weather. No one spoke
English, and local Chinese verged on a brawl because even they
could get no information for hours on when flights might resume.
</P>
<P>
   But these chance complications are minimal and normally can be
overcome with patience. Many travelers _ us among them _ much
prefer such risks to the homogenization of group travel. We would
rather spend time harassing a CITS agent than waiting for 200
people to get on and off the buses. Travelers choose their own
trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you're travelling outside a tour group, you may
well find it worth the cost to stay at an internationally
recognized hotel. The guidebooks list plenty, and your travel agent
can add hundreds more now that good hotels are proliferating across
China. Outside Beijing and Shanghai, a nice room costs about $120 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   One easy pick is the Holiday Inn, which is not the priciest and
offers fully two dozen hotels in China. These are true havens when
you come back exhausted from crowded, dusty streets, having seen
one fried chicken foot too many, and find yourself longing for a
chef's salad in front of an in-house movie in English. Yet the Inns
carry a local flavor, including their Chinese restaurants that are
as savory as those on the street and have more reliable sanitation
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Inn is so attuned to western needs that it is the
only hotel we've seen with conspicuous signs in every room warning
not to drink the tap water. Our advice: never drink tap water
anywhere, unless your hotel tells you water has been safely
purified in its own plant.
</P>
<P>
   A western hotel also can help arrange a city or museum tour,
whether they have such excursions scheduled or must ring an agent
to find you a personal guide. For the latter you may have to pout a
bit, but there usually is an English-speaking concierge who can be
convinced to help.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is that staff are always willing to assist you
getting around their city. They gladly give directions. More
importantly, they will write in Chinese the address you are
seeking, so you can simply hand the paper to the taxi driver _ who
likely won't speak English _ or to a passer-by if you're lost on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   As for restaurants, 100 flowers are blooming. They're
everywhere. And we have yet to stumble across a truly bad one. Ten
years ago, tourists complained that they had to stop in Hong Kong
or San Francisco to eat good Chinese food. Not so today.
</P>
<P>
   You do, however, want to take care in ordering. Chinese cuisine
in China isn't necessarily the same as what appears on the table in
Austin, West Palm Beach, or Atlanta. (EDITORS: YOU MIGHT SUBSTITUTE
THE NAME OF YOUR CITY.) At one of our favorite places in Beijing,
the waitress jokes about bringing us snake _ and she wouldn't have
to go far because they're sitting in the window tank next to the
eels.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you read Chinese, you ought to ask if a restaurant has an
English-language menu before you sit down to dine. What you want is
a ``ying-wen de cai dan'' (pronounced ``ying wen de tsai dan'').
Otherwise you may end up with pig ears or the ubiquitous chicken
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood restaurants are usually much better, as well as
much cheaper than most hotel eateries with dumbed-down cuisines. We
usually dine out for less than $10 for two of us.
</P>
<P>
   One other tip on water: most Chinese will use a kleenex to wipe
off the little plates, rice bowls, glasses and even chopsticks set
out on restaurant tables, to sop up any rogue drops of tap water
left from washing. We do, too.
</P>
<P>
   We also try to bring along an extra paper napkin or tissue,
since the only napkins supplied at most restaurants are single-ply
paper sheets measuring about four inches square.
</P>
<P>
   We also strongly advise that you consider at least one leg of
travel by boat or train. Either will give you a close-up view of
the countryside where two-thirds of China's 1.2 billion people
live.
</P>
<P>
   Chugging through rice paddies by rail you sense the solidity and
longevity of China, watching scenes impossible to imagine from the
cityscapes of Beijing or Shanghai or Xian. Straw-hatted peasants
squat in water-logged fields or urge a water buffalo to lumber
home. How different could it have looked 1,000 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   The best tourist cruise is down the Yangtze River, passing the
mystical sheer cliffs of the Three Gorges and the terraced farm
lands that generations of Chinese painstakingly built up the
mountainsides. A new dam will alter the character of this famous
landscape after the year 2003, raising the river the height of a
60-story building. The beauty will not be fully erased, but the
drama will be gone. Go soon.

information that may appeal more to the younger traveler.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Rough Guide'' presents a breezier British style, and in
addition to the typical sites and accommodations, it covers places
slightly off the well-trod western tourist track. It also has a
good section on Chinese phrases.
</P>
<P>
   -- The ``Blue Guide'' is useful for its typically exhaustive
descriptions of every tourist site.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever book you choose, you can believe their descriptions
that defy the stories travelers brought home just 10 or 15 years
ago about austere Chinese hotels and lousy restaurants. That isn't
true today.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a package tour or travelling independently may be a
harder decision in China than elsewhere. You will almost certainly
run into glitches if you go it alone. The question is how easily
you can adjust to complications.
</P>
<P>
   Your American travel agent can make bookings if you opt out of a
group trip, but normally cannot hand over to you in advance the
tickets for internal China transportation. Foreign travel agencies
must rely on the government's China International Travel Services
(CITS), which tries hard but may fall a dab short of success.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before flight time, we have been handed tickets with the
wrong return flight. We've also encountered other travelers who
either got incorrect tickets or were missing tickets when CITS
delivered them to the hotel. One obstacle is that CITS insists on
parcelling out tickets as you travel through your itinerary, rather
than issue a full set when you arrive. That leaves scant time for
fixing errors.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is arranging transportation as you go along.
It sounds daunting, but is remarkably easy. Travel agencies have
offices in most major hotels and can write air and train tickets on
the spot, though making such late reservations carries a small
chance of your chosen flight being fully booked. One pitfall: you
will probably find the departure city and the destination written
in Chinese characters. To get around this, ask the travel agent to
give you a computer printout of the itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a guide to walk you through major airports, since
signs and announcements are in both Chinese and English. Flight
attendants also use both languages, but communication much beyond
``coffee'' or ``beer'' might strain the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is a confidence-building experience. Many airlines
use Boeing jets on internal routes, and all follow international
standards _ no goats on board or passengers sitting on suitcases in
the aisles, as happens in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is whether you can handle a flight that
gets diverted. We ran into a Canadian couple who related the
harrowing experience of making an unscheduled landing at a small
regional airport near Chongqing due to weather. No one spoke
English, and local Chinese verged on a brawl because even they
could get no information for hours on when flights might resume.
</P>
<P>
   But these chance complications are minimal and normally can be
overcome with patience. Many travelers _ us among them _ much
prefer such risks to the homogenization of group travel. We would
rather spend time harassing a CITS agent than waiting for 200
people to get on and off the buses. Travelers choose their own
trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you're travelling outside a tour group, you may
well find it worth the cost to stay at an internationally
recognized hotel. The guidebooks list plenty, and your travel agent
can add hundreds more now that good hotels are proliferating across
China. Outside Beijing and Shanghai, a nice room costs about $120 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   One easy pick is the Holiday Inn, which is not the priciest and
offers fully two dozen hotels in China. These are true havens when
you come back exhausted from crowded, dusty streets, having seen
one fried chicken foot too many, and find yourself longing for a
chef's salad in front of an in-house movie in English. Yet the Inns
carry a local flavor, including their Chinese restaurants that are
as savory as those on the street and have more reliable sanitation
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Inn is so attuned to western needs that it is the
only hotel we've seen with conspicuous signs in every room warning
not to drink the tap water. Our advice: never drink tap water
anywhere, unless your hotel tells you water has been safely
purified in its own plant.
</P>
<P>
   A western hotel also can help arrange a city or museum tour,
whether they have such excursions scheduled or must ring an agent
to find you a personal guide. For the latter you may have to pout a
bit, but there usually is an English-speaking concierge who can be
convinced to help.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is that staff are always willing to assist you
getting around their city. They gladly give directions. More
importantly, they will write in Chinese the address you are
seeking, so you can simply hand the paper to the taxi driver _ who
likely won't speak English _ or to a passer-by if you're lost on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   As for restaurants, 100 flowers are blooming. They're
everywhere. And we have yet to stumble across a truly bad one. Ten
years ago, tourists complained that they had to stop in Hong Kong
or San Francisco to eat good Chinese food. Not so today.
</P>
<P>
   You do, however, want to take care in ordering. Chinese cuisine
in China isn't necessarily the same as what appears on the table in
Austin, West Palm Beach, or Atlanta. (EDITORS: YOU MIGHT SUBSTITUTE
THE NAME OF YOUR CITY.) At one of our favorite places in Beijing,
the waitress jokes about bringing us snake _ and she wouldn't have
to go far because they're sitting in the window tank next to the
eels.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you read Chinese, you ought to ask if a restaurant has an
English-language menu before you sit down to dine. What you want is
a ``ying-wen de cai dan'' (pronounced ``ying wen de tsai dan'').
Otherwise you may end up with pig ears or the ubiquitous chicken
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood restaurants are usually much better, as well as
much cheaper than most hotel eateries with dumbed-down cuisines. We
usually dine out for less than $10 for two of us.
</P>
<P>
   One other tip on water: most Chinese will use a kleenex to wipe
off the little plates, rice bowls, glasses and even chopsticks set
out on restaurant tables, to sop up any rogue drops of tap water
left from washing. We do, too.
</P>
<P>
   We also try to bring along an extra paper napkin or tissue,
since the only napkins supplied at most restaurants are single-ply
paper sheets measuring about four inches square.
</P>
<P>
   We also strongly advise that you consider at least one leg of
travel by boat or train. Either will give you a close-up view of
the countryside where two-thirds of China's 1.2 billion people
live.
</P>
<P>
   Chugging through rice paddies by rail you sense the solidity and
longevity of China, watching scenes impossible to imagine from the
cityscapes of Beijing or Shanghai or Xian. Straw-hatted peasants
squat in water-logged fields or urge a water buffalo to lumber
home. How different could it have looked 1,000 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   The best tourist cruise is down the Yangtze River, passing the
mystical sheer cliffs of the Three Gorges and the terraced farm
lands that generations of Chinese painstakingly built up the
mountainsides. A new dam will alter the character of this famous
landscape after the year 2003, raising the river the height of a
60-story building. The beauty will not be fully erased, but the
drama will be gone. Go soon.

AS EMPLOYEE LOYALTY DROPS, BOSSES NEED TO MEND FENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bosses have long suspected their workers are getting less loyal.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is evidence.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study released this week, American workers are
less committed to their employers and more likely to switch jobs
for small increases in pay, a trend that is making it increasingly
difficult for companies to hang on to their best employees in a
tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a raise of 10 percent or less to make nearly a
quarter (22 percent) of employees switch their jobs. And more than
half (58 percent) would switch for a 20 percent raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employee loyalty as we have known it is a thing of the past,''
said Dr. David Stum, co-founder of Aon Consulting Inc., a national
human resources firm that has studied worker commitment for the
past several years. ``Today's workers are more educated,
entrepreneurial and independent than ever, and are more discerning
in choosing where to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Stum's group surveyed more than 1,800 workers to see how their
loyalty index had changed since last year.
</P>
<P>
   The index is based on six loyalty components that include, among
other things, whether workers would recommend their organizations'
products and services, whether they would recommend their
organizations as one of the best places to work in their
communities, whether they intend to stay with their companies for
several years, and what it would take for them to switch jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed a decline of 2.2 points in the index compared
with last year's benchmark baseline of 100.
</P>
<P>
   That should be a significant concern for companies, even if they
don't think they're having problems with turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retention doesn't equal commitment,'' Stum said. ``Companies
want to do things `better, faster, cheaper,' but that doesn't come
from people who just show up.''
</P>
<P>
   The best ideas and results come from people who want to work for
an organization, are dedicated to its values, and who bring more
than a time-clock attitude to the table. That's real loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a number of factors contributing to an overall
decline in worker commitment, Stum said.
</P>
<P>
   The first is job-related stress.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of employees reporting job-related burnout
increased from 39 percent in 1995 to 53 percent in 1998. Days lost
to stress increased from 1.1 days to 1.5 days a year during the
same time frame, a 36 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   In a related finding, conflict between work and family
responsibilities also has increased. The number of days lost to
care for sick children, elderly relatives, or because child care
had fallen through increased from 3.6 days a year to 4.6 days a
year between 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Work stress and family conflicts erode people's ability to give
their best to their jobs, Stum said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was done to help companies figure out ways to improve
employee commitment and win loyalty back by better addressing
employee needs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the study found the No. 1 way for companies to
build loyalty was by recognizing the importance of personal and
family time, Stum said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies need to insist that managers respect the family
responsibilities of employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that they want the company to fix the
problem, just to recognize it's tough,'' he said. ``Interpersonal
indifference is causing people to turn away from companies.''
</P>
<P>
   A second way managers can work to improve commitment is by
making sure employees understand the mission and culture of the
organization. Tying employee rewards to the success of the
organization also helps build loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities for personal growth, including training and skills
development, also help improve loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The first loyalty of employees today is to `Me Inc.,''' Stum
said. Employees stay when they feel a company is investing in them.
</P>
<P>
   Providing ways for employees to give feedback about their jobs
and the direction of the organization also builds commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Employees want two-way dialogues _ and information.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found is there is a real hunger for the truth,'' Stum
said. Workers want to know where the company stands and where it's
going.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic that companies spend more time and energy trying to
gain customer loyalty than the loyalty of their employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a fundamental truth about commitment: It takes some
to get some.

EVEN CHECKER GETS BAD REFERENCES 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Running your own business can be rough, but it's doubly hard
when your clients are a group of unhappy people.
</P>
<P>
   Documented Reference Check is in the business of checking
references. If you're having trouble finding a new job, for
example, and you worry your old boss may be saying something nasty
about you, interviewers from the Diamond Bar, Calif., company will
call your old boss, mumble something about checking your references
and ask what kind of employee you were.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewers, as might be expected, stumble onto incredible
tales. One manager said the former employee was great but he was
just getting too old. Another employer claimed his former employee
had stolen merchandise and was a drug addict.
</P>
<P>
   A number of clients, such as the former employee who learned his
age was the reason for the termination, are able to use the
information as proof of discrimination and file lawsuits against
their former employers. Other clients threaten their former
employers with a character defamation lawsuit if they continue to
spread untrue stories to potential employers.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I wrote a column about how brilliant the service
was after checking with former clients. Since then, several readers
have complained about Documented Reference Check's service.
</P>
<P>
   One engineer read that column two years ago and thought
Documented Reference Check might be able to tell him why he was
having such a hard time finding a job. The engineer, who asked not
to be identified, said an employee at a personnel firm said she
couldn't recommend him for a job opening because of what a previous
boss had said.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer paid Documented Reference Check $616.65 in October
to check seven references going back several years. The engineer
said he waited three months and then began calling and writing
letters. He said he never received a reference report or a refund.
</P>
<P>
   Report came too late
</P>
<P>
   Another client in Hempstead paid $157.90 to have her references
checked and was upset because the process took so long that she no
longer needed the information. She had initiated legal action
against her former employer and needed the reference report fairly
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls took a week or more to return, she said, asking not
to be identified. Finally, she said, she was told by a
representative that the report already had been mailed, but she
never received it. Several months later, the former regional sales
director for a medical care provider said, a report arrived but she
returned it unopened, hoping for a refund she never got.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau in Colton, Calif., rates the company
as ``having an unsatisfactory business performance record'' and has
received 51 consumer complaints since 1995. The company responded
to 37, 11 are unresolved and three weren't answered.
</P>
<P>
   According to the bureau, customer complaints allege failure to
provide reports, inability to contact customer service
representatives regarding delays and dissatisfaction with
incomplete reports.
</P>
<P>
   Company defends record
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rankin, chief service officer of Documented Reference
Check, said he isn't surprised by those complaints and argues that
51 complaints in seven years in business isn't a bad record.
</P>
<P>
   Clients who use his company's services typically are upset to
begin with and they're often looking to Documented Reference Check
to provide some bad references so they can initiate a lawsuit or
support one ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make up the references,'' he said, adding that the
interviewers just report what they are told by former employers. He
suspects that clients open up the report, don't like what they see
and then claim they never got it.
</P>
<P>
   Some reports are positive _ they'd hire the former employee back
in a second. Sometimes clients provide the wrong phone number or
name so the reference report comes up empty.
</P>
<P>
   The company does about 1,300 reference checks a month and at
least one report comes back undeliverable, he said. Rankin said he
assumes others get lost and is happy to fax a copy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company's initial order line clearly states no
messages are retrieved and instructs clients to call the customer
service department for individual help. Some people don't pay
attention and every day several people still leave a message, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He provided a copy of the engineer's seven references, which
show that they were performed in early November. And like other
reports that Documented Reference Check has done, they clearly
spell out what the former bosses thought of the engineer.

MCLACHLAN HOPES LILITH FAIR'S SECOND YEAR WILL RAISE EVEN MORE FOR
CHARITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sarah McLachlan is the kind of person who usually trusts her
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it feels right, I just do it,'' she says. ``And then I let
the chips fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, McLachlan launched an all-woman summer concert tour
dubbed Lilith Fair. Despite a summer overcrowded with packaged
tours, Lilith Fair was a critical and commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started off as such a simple idea,'' the singer-songwriter
said by phone from her home in Vancouver, B.C. ``I thought,
wouldn't it be fun to get a bunch of women together and play a
bunch of shows? And from there, it just blossomed.''
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan, who is bright, thoughtful and quick to make fun of
herself, wasn't out to prove anything. But the success of Lilith
Fair erased any doubts about the commercial viability of a
large-scale all-women tour. Lilith Fair grossed nearly $17 million
in a summer when other packaged tours were hurting for ticket
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan celebrated by giving away tons of money to some of her
favorite charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an amazing feeling that comes from giving a local
women's shelter $25,000 and having them tell you that this is going
to help keep their shelter open for six months,'' McLachlan said.
</P>
<P>
   Success has given McLachlan the clout to launch a bigger 50-date
tour this year. The trek, featuring a rotating lineup, includes two
concerts this weekend at The Gorge Amphitheatre in Goerge, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's show features headliners McLachlan, Natalie Merchant,
Indigo Girls, Erykah Badu and Me'Shell N'degeocello. Sunday's
concert is the same, except that Sinead O'Connor substitutes for
N'degeocello.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Stage lineup includes K's Choice, Billie Myers and
Lhasa both days. At the Village Stage, it's Tara MacLean, Sinead
Lohan and Felicia Loud tomorrow, and MacLean, Lohan and J.R.
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Other dates will feature such artists as Missy Elliott, Paula
Cole, Shawn Colvin, Bonnie Raitt, Liz Phair, Lisa Loeb, Martina
McBride, Mary Lou Lord, Joan Osborne, Queen Latifah, Angelique
Kidjo, Victoria Williams, Neko Case and Luscious Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a challenge putting together this lineup because
everyone has very busy summer schedules,'' McLachlan said. ``But
you put the word out there and you phone everyone up, and then you
try to juggle their schedules.''
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop star Missy Elliott is representative of this year's
diverse lineup. McLachlan saw Elliott perform last year in Miami.
``She just blew the roof off the place,'' McLachlan said. ``I'd
never felt such energy in a live show.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I invited her to join this year's Lilith tour, she was
totally into it. She said she didn't want to confine herself to the
hip-hop world. She wanted to be universal, to break out and cross
over.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, McLachlan, Merchant,
Phair, Elliott and Cole were startled when asked if there was any
truth to the rumor that Ginger Spice had quit the Spice Girls to
join Lilith Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of EW's question, McLachlan laughed out loud. ``I am
Ginger Spice,'' she said. ``It's true. I had to quit because Lilith
was starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lilith Fair raised more than $700,000 for charities.
McLachlan hopes to double that amount this year with the help of
additional corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have a responsibility to give whatever we can. ...
(Lilith) is a big money-making thing. And I think a lot of
companies and businesses have a responsibility to give something
back. (Lilith) is a really great vehicle for doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's corporate sponsors include Biore, Excite, Royal
Neighbors of America, Starbucks Coffee, Tower Records, VH1, Levi's
and Volkswagen of America.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's sponsored the Lilith Fair Acoustic Talent Search, but
McLachlan is miffed at the company for its portrayal of her and
several tourmates in an eight-page ad section in the current issue
of Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan, who is shown with her hand down her jeans, explained
she was trying to adjust her underwear when the photographer
snapped her picture. Naturally, that was the photo Levi's chose to
use in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went away from that shoot feeling pretty bad about it,''
McLachlan said. ``I was thinking, this is exactly what I don't
want. We're supposed to be strong, independent individuals. And
there we were, looking like tramps in a brothel.''

BUSH BUILDS BRIDGES, BUT SHIES FROM PRESIDENTIAL TALK IN
WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A crush of Republican heavyweights helped Texas
Gov. George W. Bush raise about $1 million for his re-election
campaign in a single day, fueling more speculation that he will run
for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made up my mind whether I'm going to seek the
presidency,'' Bush told reporters Thursday as he met powerbrokers
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor insists that he is taking seriously his
campaign against Democratic opponent Garry Mauro. But a poll out
this week showed that Bush holds a 53 percentage-point lead over
Mauro, the state's Land Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will leave no stone unturned,'' Bush said while conceding
that the presidential speculation will continue ``because I haven't
said no.''

   ``I'm doing everything I can to dampen the speculation,'' he
said, ``but I sense that as long as I leave the door open, there
will be speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like what I tell my fellow Texans: `You have to calculate
this ... when you head into the booth in November, and make it part
of the equation.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, more than 600 people attended a reception at the
Willard Hotel, two blocks from the White House. Many on the guest
list _ including C. Bowden Gray, a former presidential adviser, and
Carla Hills, the former trade representative _ served in the
administration of his father, President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A $5,000-per-plate dinner was held after the reception for about
100 people. Bush aides said the fund-raisers were expected to add
``over a million'' to his $15 million war chest for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, by contrast, has raised $2.2 million and is far leagues
behind the governor in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Texas Poll shows Bush backed by 70 percent of
the 691 potential voters surveyed. Seventeen percent favored Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   And of those surveyed, 67 percent said a possible Bush run for
the presidency would have no impact on their vote in the
gubernatorial race this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``People appreciate the job I'm doing,'' Bush said of the survey
results.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ``amazed'' and ``mystified'' by national polls
that pick him as the top contender for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said Bush is seen by Republicans in
Congress as the ``best prospect, the front-runner and the one most
likely to be elected'' in a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   It is that popularity at home and nationally that sent lobbyists
scurrying to the fund-raising events for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington special-interest groups are trying to build bridges
now in case he does run for president,'' said Paul Hendrie, a
spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics, which advocates
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists and special-interest groups also are signing up for a
June 23 Washington reception and dinner for Mauro, who has enlisted
the help of his friends of 25 years, President Clinton and first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore will headline a reception for Mauro in El
Paso, Texas, on June 25. The events for Mauro are expected to raise
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both candidates are seen as players on the national stage,''
Hendrie said, adding that the Texas gubernatorial race this fall is
being seen as a ``dress rehearsal for the presidential campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Opponents will be looking for weaknesses, to uncover some
issues that will play out in a national election,'' he said.

WELCOME TO OUYR HYPHENATED COMMUNITY 
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES    
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune    
 c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am reluctant to comment on Money magazine's recent
best-places-to-live survey since I have been accused, by a reader,
of writing too many negative columns about Florida, which as we all
know is the closest thing you can find to paradise except during
hurricane season or love bug season or during those periods when it
is too hot, too cold, too changeable or all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   So I will make every effort to be positive in this piece, though
it won't be easy given the fact that Money magazine basically rated
the Sarasota-Bradenton area somewhere between Love Canal and that
place in Ohio with the vulture problem.
</P>
<P>
   That's a slight exaggeration, of course. Money actually ranked
Sarasota-Bradenton between Fort Myers-Cape Coral and
Charleston-North Charleston, S.C., which strikes me as good news
for Fort Myers and bad news for Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the ranking would be nothing to get worked up about
were it not for the fact that our fair hyphenated community
finished dead last of all the mid-sized Florida cities that made it
on the (BEGIN QUOTE)Best of the South(END QUOTE) list.
</P>
<P>
   That means we were beaten out by Pensacola, Tallahassee, Daytona
Beach, Melbourne-Titusville-Palm Bay, Lakeland-Winter Haven, West
Palm Beach-Boca Raton, Fort Pierce-Port St. Lucie and the
aforementioned Fort Myers-Cape Coral.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear to me, if not to the editors of Money magazine, that
Sarasota-Bradenton (I'm resisting the urge to call us Saraton since
that sounds too much like an asthma inhaler) is a far superior
place to any of those other Florida cities, especially Pensacola
which is basically in Alabama and should therefore be disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Two out of three medflies choose Sarasota-Bradenton over West
Palm Beach-Boca Raton, and well they should. Sarasota-Bradenton is
conveniently located near the Gulf of Mexico, which is something
that cannot be said about Daytona Beach or Lakeland-Winter Haven.
The Gulf beaches are nice to walk on when the red tide not too bad
and the sunsets are fabulous, thanks to the air pollution that
blows our way from St. Petersburg and Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Sarasota-Bradenton also has a sophisticated system of bridges
and highways, several of which may be open on any given day. There
are no major theme parks in Sarasota-Bradenton, true, but who needs
roller coasters and flume rides when you can take a spin down U.S.
41 during rush hour?
</P>
<P>
   If its quiet and solitude you seek, than the Sarasota-Bradenton
airport is the place for you. You can gaze into the fish tanks or
wander the deserted corridors and never have to worry that the
sound of an arriving or departing jet will shatter your reverie.
</P>
<P>
   Sarasota is also known as the ``arts capital'' of Florida. While
some cynics might argue that that title is a dubious distinction in
a state that treats professional wrestling as a cultural event,
Sarasotans take great pride in their artistic sensibility to the
point that you can hardly build a self-serve car wash here without
running afoul of the Taste and Aesthetics Police. The ongoing
screaming match between the developers and the Taste Police makes
for great theater. Oh, and the stuff that gets put on stage isn't
too bad, either.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't even gotten into Sarasota-Bradenton's booming economy,
its magnificent weather, its outstanding schools and hospitals or
the high percentage of local politicians and business leaders who
have managed thus far to avoid indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that Fort Pierce-Port St. Lucie (wherever the
heck that is) can't begin to compare to the Greater Metropolitan
Area that we call home.
</P>
<P>
   After all, 100 million sterile medflies can't be wrong.

MODERN `ART' FULL OF SECONDHAND POSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeing Ally Sheedy in ``High Art'' _ and seeing the way she's
used _ is a shock. It's not like watching Judd Nelson unfurl his
nostrils in ``Suddenly Susan,'' where he's the best thing in the
show and he still isn't any good.
</P>
<P>
   Sheedy has often had an exposed quality, and when she works, her
nervous vulnerability can pull you in. As Lucy Berliner, the
withdrawn photographer, our awareness of her comes into play. She's
been burned by the public, and isn't eager to expose herself to
direct sunlight; her wrinkled pallor is frayed around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Under director Lisa Cholodenko, ``High Art'' brandishes a kind
of downtown chic, as if its cast spent too much time watching
documentaries on Weimar Republic Berlin, or high school drama class
versions of ``Cabaret.'' There are more gaunt cheekbones in this
movie than in a season of Calvin Klein ads, and the same level of
generic irony serves as the film's guiding sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Syd (Radha Mitchell) is a sleek and ambitious young charmer who
lives below Lucy; how's that for subtlety. Lucy's leaky tub is the
device that sets Syd into action. Curled up in her cave with her
girlfriend, Greta, a ruthlessly inert German actress played with
world-weariness by Patricia Clarkson, Lucy is lured out into the
open with Syd. Syd is determined to get Lucy back into the world,
or at least into the pages of ain't-it-cool ``Frame'' magazine,
where she works and where the eager editors would love to put Lucy
back in harness.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Art'' should be called ``High Arch.'' With its
college-girl pretensions and a notion of sophistication based on a
surface approximation of ennui, it's about as believable as LeAnn
Rimes' rendition of ``Purple Rain.'' Nearly everything feels
secondhand.
</P>
<P>
   If anything works, it's Sheedy's desperate wariness. She plays
Lucy with the fervor of a recovering alcoholic fighting to stay
away from a shot of single-malt scotch.
</P>
<P>
   Director Cholodenko shows a skill for exploitation; in a way,
this is the kind of movie that Syd would direct. When the two women
engage in a circle flirt, Lucy is sweaty and wounded, but can't
resist. The only things that keep Lucy protected are her drug habit
and a pack of equally burned-out friends _ a truly funny touch that
plays like a parody of a support group.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Sheedy has burned herself down to bone and sinew;
there's no flesh left to give her strength. It's a powerful if
one-note performance, an opportunity for a breakthrough that Sheedy
seizes greedily, and her neediness is the jolt that gives ``High
Art'' any spark.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Art'' is rated R for adult sexuality, adult language and
drug addiction.

GREEN RULES AT U.S. OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Philadelphia, San Antonio)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Golfers aren't the only ones scoring at the U.S.
Open championship. So are the purveyors of souvenirs, food and
drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' said an elated Kirk Dowdell, opening a bag of
souvenirs he brought at the tournament, being held at the Olympic
Club.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled out a ``Pope Scope'' _ a $10 must-have,
cardboard-and-glass gizmo invented for the pope's visit to San
Francisco in 1987. The contraption works something like a
periscope, allowing users to see over the view-obstructing heads of
the people standing in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   And it's perfect for watching the golf match, particularly when
the crowd favorites are on the course, drawing fans six and seven
deep on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already used it and it works. I was able to see Tiger Woods
play,'' said Dowdell, a Sacramento banker who spent Wednesday at
the Open with Lynn, his schoolteacher wife.
</P>
<P>
   And hey, for $10, the Pope Scope is practically a steal. Hardly
anything can be had for so little money at the U.S. Open
merchandise tent.
</P>
<P>
   There are the $114 wind-breakers, the $18-a-piece fuzzy club
covers and the $178 framed photos of the Olympic Club. The biggest
sellers, however, are logo U.S. Open caps _ in the $25 range _ and
golf shirts, many of them running $45 to $60. There's even a U.S.
Open tie-dye T-shirt for $28 that would look right at home on a
Dead Head.
</P>
<P>
   When the cost of souvenirs is added to the cost of tickets,
which run $60 or so a day, and food and drink, attending the U.S.
Open gets pricey. A beer runs $4 at the concession stand, a burger
$4.50. Bringing in food from outside the exclusive compound is
frowned upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought lemonade and pretzels. That was $13,'' said Dowdell,
the owner of the Pope Scope. ``It's not cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, said Bob Kelly, a Philadelphia attorney,
``When you come to an event like this, you spend money.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly forked over $400 for U.S. Open goodies _ before the
edibles and tickets. Luckily, he has family in the San Francisco
area so he doesn't have to worry about lodging.
</P>
<P>
   The rush for merchandise has been amazing, with the line to get
into the tent store nearly a block long at busy times. Inside,
hundreds of people jam the aisles, elbow-to-elbow. The bank of 40
cash registers never slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg and Theresa Mickus, of San Antonio, spent $700 for
souvenirs on one visit and came back to buy more.
</P>
<P>
   Cost? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already bought lots of shirts, caps, towels, tumblers.
You name it, we bought it,'' Theresa Mickus said. ``Now we're
looking for a vest.''
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Mike Brisky, is in the elite group of U.S. Open
players, and she was getting in some last-minute shopping before
watching him tee off.

   Drugs can leave a virus breathless. Researchers in the United
States have found that parts of the protein shell of the common
cold virus flap open in a motion they call ``breathing'' _ and
compounds that stop viruses from infecting cells can stifle this
flapping. The discovery could lead to rapid screening methods for
anti-viral drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A virus only shows real signs of life after it has infected a
cell. Once inside, the invader sheds its protective protein coat,
releases its genetic material and hijacks the cell's resources to
replicate itself. But according to the textbooks, viruses shut down
between infections, becoming as inanimate as a stone.
</P>
<P>
   But now Thomas Smith, a biochemist at Purdue University in
Lafayette, Ind., says that this is not the full story. Smith
studies the rhinovirus which causes the common cold. ``We know that
proteins move in solution,'' he says. ``But it's hard for most
people to visualize the virus as dynamic, so they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, many scientists were also convinced that the
fluctuations in viral shape that happened outside the cell were
probably minor and of little importance. So when Smith teamed up
with chemist Gary Siuzdak and his colleagues at the Scripps
Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., to probe the motions of the
virus coat, the best he hoped for was to reveal a tiny twitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even that, I thought, might be blue-sky thinking,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers treated the virus with an enzyme that chops up
proteins. They reasoned that if the breathing effect was only
small, exposing just the outermost atoms of the virus's coat, then
the first wounds the enzyme inflicted on the virus should be in
these layers.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, this turned out to be true. But to the team's
surprise, one protein, called VP4, was also an early victim _ even
though previous studies showed that it was usually buried inside
the virus, 25 atom lengths from the surface. ``That's a lot of
breathing,'' Smith says. ``You think, `How the devil could that get
out?'''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also studied the effect of WIN 52084, an
experimental drug discovered in a search for compounds which might
stop the cold virus infecting human cells. The breathing effect
stopped in the presence of the drug, and the virus took up to 18
hours to succumb to the enzyme's attack, rather than the minutes it
would usually take.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suspect the drug is effective because when the
surface cannot breathe, the virus cannot release its genetic cargo.
This suggests that enzyme digestion tests could replace laborious
cell-infection experiments as a first screen for promising new
drugs to combat the cold virus _ and perhaps other viruses as
well. &QL;

   The outer layer of our skin is normally impermeable, keeping
body fluids in and everything else out. Now researchers have found
that acoustic waves can make the skin temporarily permeable, so
doctors can sample body fluids or inject medication without
piercing the skin. They can generate these acoustic waves using
ultrasound or a shockwave from a pulsed laser.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials are already under way on an ultrasonic system
for measuring glucose levels in diabetics, developed at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. And just a
short distance away, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston is
testing a drug delivery system that uses laser technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sound waves temporarily change the structure of the impermeable
outer layer of skin, which consists of dead skin cells encased in
layers of fat molecules and is between 10 micrometers and 15
micrometres thick. A few minutes of low-frequency ultrasound _
sound greater in frequency than 20 kilohertz at the threshold of
human hearing _ creates tiny cavities.
</P>
<P>
   These holes allow large molecules to pass through the fat layer
for several hours, says Joseph Kost, a professor of chemical
engineering from Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheeva,
Israel, who is on sabbatical at MIT. At a meeting of the Acoustical
Society of America in Seattle next week, he will reveal how the
technique can deliver drugs and perform tests.
</P>
<P>
   With MIT's Bob Langer and Samir Mitragotri, Kost is focusing
initially on glucose testing.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians recommend that diabetics test blood glucose at least
three times a day, but few jab their fingers that often to draw
blood. The noninvasive acoustic technique makes it much easier _
all patients have to do is place a glucose-monitoring patch over
the permeable spot.
</P>
<P>
   Initial tests used a desktop device, but Kost and Langer have
formed a company to develop a hand-held, battery-powered ultrasound
generator for use at home. They plan clinical tests of a similar
system to deliver insulin or other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Apostolos Doukas at Massachusetts General is using
laser pulses to generate the acoustic waves that make the skin
permeable. He fires a short laser pulse at a plastic disc laid on
the skin, producing a stress wave that lasts 0.2 microseconds to
create the temporary pores. Drugs applied between the disc and the
skin can then diffuse through the pores while the barrier remains
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``For large molecules the barrier recovers in a couple of
minutes, for small molecules it can be 15 minutes to half an
hour,'' Doukas says. As with the ultrasonic technique, patients in
the trials said they felt no pain.
</P>
<P>
   Small pulsed lasers can also penetrate the skin, but they drill
holes which, like needle pricks, can cause pain and take time to
heal. &QL;

   It's no fun to tickle yourself because one part of the brain
tells another what's about to happen, brain scans reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah-Jayne Blakemore and her colleagues at the Institute of
Neurology in London used functional magnetic resonance imaging, or
fMRI, to look at how tickling affected the brains of three
volunteers. First, the subjects tickled themselves on the palm of
the hand with a specially designed tickling device. In another
test, a researcher operated the tickler.
</P>
<P>
   All the subjects rated the self-administered strokes as less
ticklish than the externally administered ones, and the fMRI scans
backed this up.
</P>
<P>
   When someone else was doing the tickling, there was much more
activity in the somatosensory cortex, the part of the brain that
processes tactile sensations. And the part of the anterior
cingulate that has been linked to pleasure lit up only when others
did the tickling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That explains why it feels better,'' Blakemore says.
</P>
<P>
   The scans also showed that only the self-tickle test activated
the cerebellum, part of the brain involved in planning. Blakemore's
team suspected that when people try to tickle themselves, the
cerebellum ruins the fun by sending urgent messages to the
somatosensory cortex warning it that a sensation is on its way.
</P>
<P>
   So Blakemore tricked the cerebellums of the subjects by retiming
the tickling machine so that self-administered tickles came later
than they expected. When delayed by 200 milliseconds, she says, the
self-tickle was just as good as an external one. ``The ticklishness
increased as the delays increased,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore now hopes to test volunteers with schizophrenia. Her
colleague Chris Frith suspects that schizophrenics will be able to
tickle themselves even without the delay, as there is evidence that
their cerebellums do not predict sensory consequences in the same
way as normal brains. &QL;

   A protein which helps heal broken bones and damaged kidneys now
looks as though it may speed the recovery of stroke patients. It
works by rewiring the connections around damaged brain cells. There
is also a chance that the protein may be able to improve memory in
Alzheimer's patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very encouraging at this point,'' says Marc Charette
of Creative BioMolecules in Massachusetts, the company that is
developing the protein. ``The region of the brain that's damaged
dies, but the protein rewires the circuitry around the damage,
through tissue surviving the stroke,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the experiment are reported in NeuroReport. The
researchers induced strokes in rats. Osteogenic protein-1, or OP-1,
was injected into their brains, and it quickly helped them to
recover lost movement in their limbs. OP-1 has already proved its
ability to help bridge gaps between broken bones, and Creative
BioMolecules is now close to having the procedure approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The company is also progressing
with work which shows that OP-1 helps to heal damaged kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   The substance, a member of a family of proteins called
transforming growth factor-b, seems to orchestrate the repair of
several types of tissue. The company has established that OP-1
directs primordial stem cells to differentiate into tissue that
matches the damaged tissue.
</P>
<P>
   When the company discovered that OP-1 triggers the growth of
tendrillike projections on neurons, called dendrites, it decided to
test the protein's potential for brain repair after strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dendrites receive signals from other neurons,'' Charette says.
``They behave like a switchboard, so you can rewire around the
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   To test OP-1 in rats after artificially induced strokes,
Charette and his colleagues from Massachusetts General Hospital and
Harvard Medical School injected it into the cisterna magna, a brain
cavity containing cerebral fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Through tests which measured how easily the rats could place
their limbs on a nearby platform, the researchers proved that rats
on the higher dose _ 10 micrograms _ recovered faster than those on
the one-microgram dose. All the rats receiving OP-1 recovered far
faster than those in the control group.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that other substances which repair neurons _ such
as nerve growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor _ have
been shown to repair axons, the fibers that transmit nerve signals.
But OP-1 is the first protein that seems to repair dendrites.
</P>
<P>
   In Alzheimer's disease, dendrites that are vital to memory are
destroyed, so the company is conducting experiments on rats to see
whether memory can be improved through the use of OP-1.
</P>
<P>
   Charette says it may be possible to begin clinical trials in a
year's time, once safety and toxicological tests on animals have
been completed. &QL;

   A protein which helps heal broken bones and damaged kidneys now
looks as though it may speed the recovery of stroke patients. It
works by rewiring the connections around damaged brain cells. There
is also a chance that the protein may be able to improve memory in
Alzheimer's patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very encouraging at this point,'' says Marc Charette
of Creative BioMolecules in Massachusetts, the company that is
developing the protein. ``The region of the brain that's damaged
dies, but the protein rewires the circuitry around the damage,
through tissue surviving the stroke,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the experiment are reported in NeuroReport. The
researchers induced strokes in rats. Osteogenic protein-1, or OP-1,
was injected into their brains, and it quickly helped them to
recover lost movement in their limbs. OP-1 has already proved its
ability to help bridge gaps between broken bones, and Creative
BioMolecules is now close to having the procedure approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The company is also progressing
with work which shows that OP-1 helps to heal damaged kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   The substance, a member of a family of proteins called
transforming growth factor-b, seems to orchestrate the repair of
several types of tissue. The company has established that OP-1
directs primordial stem cells to differentiate into tissue that
matches the damaged tissue.
</P>
<P>
   When the company discovered that OP-1 triggers the growth of
tendrillike projections on neurons, called dendrites, it decided to
test the protein's potential for brain repair after strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dendrites receive signals from other neurons,'' Charette says.
``They behave like a switchboard, so you can rewire around the
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   To test OP-1 in rats after artificially induced strokes,
Charette and his colleagues from Massachusetts General Hospital and
Harvard Medical School injected it into the cisterna magna, a brain
cavity containing cerebral fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Through tests which measured how easily the rats could place
their limbs on a nearby platform, the researchers proved that rats
on the higher dose _ 10 micrograms _ recovered faster than those on
the one-microgram dose. All the rats receiving OP-1 recovered far
faster than those in the control group.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that other substances which repair neurons _ such
as nerve growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor _ have
been shown to repair axons, the fibers that transmit nerve signals.
But OP-1 is the first protein that seems to repair dendrites.
</P>
<P>
   In Alzheimer's disease, dendrites that are vital to memory are
destroyed, so the company is conducting experiments on rats to see
whether memory can be improved through the use of OP-1.
</P>
<P>
   Charette says it may be possible to begin clinical trials in a
year's time, once safety and toxicological tests on animals have
been completed. &QL;

TUNE IN TO TOP DOG TRAINER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Uncle Matty's proud _ very proud.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Margolis has not only trained more than 30,000 dogs in
his 30-year career _ including pooches belonging to Elizabeth
Taylor, Goldie Hawn, Madonna, Cher and Whoopi Goldberg _ the Los
Angeles ``dog trainer to the stars'' has a new television series
beginning this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woof! It's a Dog's Life With Matthew Margolis'' premieres at 3
p.m. today (a preview aired June 13) on KCET (Channel 28). The
13-part series runs in half-hour episodes on consecutive Saturdays,
covering everything about dogs, including choosing a puppy, leash
breaking, learning about breed personalities, housebreaking,
evaluating acupuncture for dogs, handling aggressive dogs, baking
homemade dog treats and preventing fleas.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis _ known for his falsetto ``dog-ese'' praise (``Uncle
Matty's proud!'') that seems to make dogs his slavish followers in
seconds _ sees the TV series as a way to help dogs and their owners
live together more happily. There are an estimated 60 million dogs
in the United States, and most of those that end up in the pound _
and are eventually destroyed _ are simply dogs that have not been
trained properly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People initially want to discipline a dog rather than educate
it,'' said Margolis, who's co-written 15 books on dog training and
is ``Good Morning America's'' resident dog expert. ``Your dog loves
you and will do anything for you. You just have to teach it what
you want. I see a lot of dog problems and a lot of people problems.
A lot of times, the dogs are fine and the people are screwed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple: Teach the owner, teach the dog, practice 15
minutes a day.''
</P>
<P>
   In the series, Margolis works with dogs he's never met before
and, seemingly miraculously, banishes bad habits and teaches
correct canine behavior in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the first shows, presidential brother Roger Clinton
introduces Bear, a snarling, snapping shepherd; with proper
techniques, it takes Margolis less than five minutes to calm the
dog's viciousness while maintaining its watchdog outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to lose the spirit,'' Margolis explained. ``You
just want to solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The dog trainer also visits a dog obedience class in Van Nuys,
working with Valley residents and their owners to teach simple
commands. And he spends time with ``ER'' actress Ellen Crawford and
``All My Children'' star T.C. Warner to help solve their dogs'
problems. (Crawford's shepherd was an escape artist who learned to
sit and stay on command; Warner's small terrier was a problem child
who used her sofa for a bathroom until properly housebroken.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to solve a problem is obedience training,'' Margolis
said. ``When people get a puppy or a dog, they should go to the
library and get a book or a video and learn how to train it, not
just start yelling when the dog does something wrong. They seem to
think that if they yell long enough and loud enough, the dog will
understand. It doesn't work that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn how to teach your dog. Otherwise, it's like
trying to play the piano without knowing the keys.
!ital!That's!off! what I try to teach people.''
</P>
<P>
   The big three things to learn: Command (teach a dog what you
want him to do); correction (when he does it wrong, show him
again); and praise (with hugs and treats and delighted
exclamations).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not harsh training, it's love training,'' Margolis said.
``But you have to do it. After all, this dog is going to be your
soulmate for the next 10 to 15 years.''

NUCLEAR REACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   For release: June 21 or thereafter  
 By MAX FRANKEL  
 c.1998 The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much of my adult life, I have unwittingly encouraged the spread
of atomic weapons. Like most American reporters and editors, I have
been a mostly silent partner in my country's utopian but arrogant
diplomacy to limit membership in the nuclear club.
</P>
<P>
   We have conferred special status and prestige on nations that
know how to blow up the world and let American, British, Russian,
Chinese and French officials strut importantly in international
forums because they had the bomb. And yet we conspired in the
pretense that other nations could not be trusted with atomic
arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Now that India and Pakistan have made it unmistakable that they
possess the bomb _ and have surely aroused bomb envy in other
places _ it is time to give account for our folly.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the media have given universal support to the
utopian project known as Nonproliferation, a treaty-bound hoarding
of atomic weaponry by the self-appointed guardian nations.
</P>
<P>
   They are pledged to withhold nuclear-weapons secrets and fuels
from all other nations and to press them to renounce all A-bomb
ambition. The founding members have sat smugly inside the club;
those outside at midcentury were to be forever excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance, I fleetingly thought. While agitating to get other
governments to sign the global nonproliferation treaty, the nuclear
nations never once thought of giving up their own atomic bombs. The
treaty of 1968 promised ``progress'' to end atomic arms races ``at
an early date,'' but that was mere boilerplate.
</P>
<P>
   The haves were convinced from the start that their status in the
world, if not also their safety, required an atomic arsenal, even
as they lectured others to renounce the weapons for their own good.
This message affronted human nature as well as logic, but
nonetheless defined American policy.
</P>
<P>
   And we in the media routinely endorsed the flimflammery. Even as
we campaigned against every other kind of segregation and
discrimination, we rarely questioned the perverse logic of
nonproliferation: That exclusion was a benefit for the excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Groucho Marx said the only clubs he wouldn't join were the ones
that would have him, I once said to McGeorge Bundy, the national
security adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Don't you think
most human beings pine to join the clubs from which they are
barred?
</P>
<P>
   You're absolutely right, Bundy replied.
</P>
<P>
   For the long run, it's an unnatural, untenable policy. But it's
a delaying game. For now, the fewer the fingers on atomic triggers,
the better off we are.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their arguments for exclusivity, the founding members of
the nuclear club demonstrated multiple motives for acquiring the
bomb. The United States proved against Japan that a have-nation
could knock out a have-not overnight and save a million infantry
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, though impoverished at the end of World War II,
proved that nuclear and thermonuclear weapons made their country an
instant superpower. As Bundy later wrote in his history of the
A-bomb, the British wanted their own bomb not as a response to
military threat but out of an ``almost instinctive'' feeling that
it would define their strength in a post-colonial age.
</P>
<P>
   The French built A-bombs to gain a vote in the club about their
use, to match the British and to lord it over the Germans. And the
Chinese barged in to challenge the ``hegemonists'' in Moscow and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the United States and the American media proclaimed
``nonproliferation'' to be a virtue, and proliferation, open or
secret, a vice. We deemed it natural that the CIA should spy on
every nation's laboratories. We cheered when Congress decreed
economic punishment for nations caught building the bomb, whether
they were foes such as Iran, Iraq, South Africa, Libya and North
Korea or friends such as Argentina, Brazil, India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, more than 40 nations acquired the reactors
needed for nuclear research or power and probably a dozen acquired
the fuels and know-how needed to stockpile explosive ``devices''
that could be quickly turned into bombs. Israel did that to protect
itself in a sea of hostile neighbors but avoided sanctions by
denying it had ``a bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan started building atomic devices 25 years ago and India
tested one in 1974, probably to impress China after a brief border
war. There was thus no technological reason for India to
ostentatiously test an A-bomb last month. Like America and the
Soviet Union of the Sputnik era, it used engineering prowess to
raise the morale of its people and the stature of its politicians.
Then Pakistan, a weaker rival, could do no less.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advanced industrial nations, only Germany and Japan,
the big losers in World War II, responded to international pressure
and promised never to build atomic weapons. They chose, uniquely,
to gain global respect by building economically strong societies.
But even their restraint is unlikely to survive the atomic anarchy
now unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans, we should have insisted that ``I've got mine,
Jack'' is not a formula for communal safety. Precisely because we
give the world so much reason to admire our politics, our economics
and our culture, it also desires our weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The most practical argument against proliferation is that mere
possession of the bomb can never yield protection. True deterrence
of an enemy requires an atomic force that can survive an attack and
respond in kind. But as India and Pakistan are now proving, that
will only intensify the quest for better missiles and extend their
costly arms race.
</P>
<P>
   If I and other observers had resisted the nuclear club's double
standard and exposed its hollow assumptions about human nature, the
world might by now have devised more effective international
controls over atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The have-nots might have been appeased if they had been given a
major voice in a strong international inspection agency and the
right to pry even into the monopolists' stockpiles - including
ours. Instead we have wasted the half century since Hiroshima and
provoked a chain reaction that is truly prolific.

THE BERLIN PATIENT 
</HEADLINE>
   For release: June 21 or thereafter  
 By MARK SCHOOPS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When the Harvard AIDS researcher Bruce Walker first learned
about the Berlin patient last September, he had one overriding
thought: Get a sample of his blood.
 &HT;    He dashed off E-mails to the scientists studying the patient and
then phoned his research associates, saying, ``You won't believe
what I just heard.''
 &HT;    Word of the unusual German case quickly spread to a support
group for patients in one of Walker's clinical trials at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Since then the group has
had an extra, invisible member: The Berlin patient, who is
discussed and analyzed almost as if he were actually present.
 &HT;    ``I've never met him, and I don't even know his name, but I've
followed his case,'' says one member of the group. ``He is what we
want to be.''
 &HT;    The source of all this excitement is a young German man who
became infected with the AIDS virus just over two years ago and
quickly started taking a combination of anti-HIV drugs. After just
six months of therapy, however, he ignored the advice of his doctor
and stopped taking the drugs.
 &HT;    When that happens, the virus ordinarily comes roaring back,
resuming its advance to full-blown AIDS. What makes the Berlin
patient so intriguing is that his virus hasn't come back. The most
precise tests detect no HIV in his blood and only trace amounts in
his lymph tissue, the major reservoir for the virus. He harbors so
little HIV that in order to detect it in one of its hiding places,
Dr. Robert Siliciano, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, had to redesign his assay, making it five times
as sensitive.
 &HT;    What little virus remains in the patient is fully capable of
reigniting an infection, so he is not cured. But his immune system
is apparently suppressing HIV without drugs. He has not taken an
AIDS pill in a year and a half.
 &HT;    The Berlin patient fascinates researchers, who hope that clues
to this singular case may lead to new treatments, especially for
those patients lucky enough to get an early diagnosis. At the same
time, researchers are terrified that news of his case might
encourage other patients to abandon their drugs, a rash decision
that virtually always frees the virus to continue its destruction
of the immune system and, possibly, mutate into drug-resistant
strains.
 &HT;    Indeed, another patient in Berlin _ infected at nearly the same
time and treated by the same doctor with the same drugs _ similarly
stopped taking his pills. Immediately, his virus reared up. The
overwhelming majority of AIDS doctors agree with Marcus Conant, a
veteran AIDS doctor in San Francisco, who says, ``If someone comes
to me and says, `I want to go off drugs,' I look him in the eye and
say, `You're nuts.'''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, two world-class labs have confirmed that the Berlin
patient's viral infection is being held in check, and a third is
scrutinizing his immune system. Their interest reflects a recent
shift in thinking about the disease.
 &HT;    At the last international AIDS conference, held two years ago in
Vancouver, Dr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center in New York, projected a slogan onto the screen
that could have been a motto for HIV research at the time: ``It's
the virus!'' And, indeed, targeting the virus has led to a class of
antiviral drugs known as protease inhibitors, the primary force
behind a remarkable two-year decline in AIDS death rates.
 &HT;    No one is suggesting a retreat from this front, but as 10,000
researchers, doctors and advocates gather in Geneva June 28 for the
12th World AIDS Conference, the research focus is broadening from
simply attacking the virus to strengthening the immune system as
well. The Berlin patient, along with several similar, but less well
documented cases just now coming to light, are helping to spur this
shift.
 &HT;    Such cases are ``really pivotal for how we think about HIV,''
says Walker, an immunologist who obtained and analyzed the Berlin
patient's blood. ``What they're banging us over the head with is
that the immune system can control this virus.''
 &HT;    The renewed interest in the immune system comes at a time when
AIDS research has reached a plateau following the development of
protease inhibitors. Despite a presidential commitment to create a
vaccine, and despite the recent approval by the FDA to begin
large-scale testing of one experimental vaccine, there is
widespread sentiment that vaccine research lags behind drug
development.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, an estimated 16,000 people are infected with HIV
every day, and 90 percent of them live in developing nations that
can't afford the expensive new medications. At the same time, early
euphoria over protease inhibitors has been tempered by the
realization that they achieve a stalemate, not a victory. Cocktails
of two to four drugs can stop HIV from replicating and halt disease
progression but can't eliminate the virus, because it integrates
into the DNA of every cell it infects.
 &HT;    Scientists hoped that if HIV were paralyzed long enough, the
body might purge every infected cell. But that possibility dimmed
last year when three independent research teams found that HIV can
hide indefinitely in long-lived cells known as resting T cells.
 &HT;    So unless new strategies are developed, patients might have to
take their drugs for life. But the drugs can cause persistent
nausea and diarrhea, and frightening long-term side effects have
recently been emerging, including redistribution of body fat and
possible heart complications.
 &HT;    Moreover, the drugs currently fail to suppress HIV in as many as
a third of all patients, and that proportion may grow over time.
When drugs fail, it often means that the virus has mutated into a
strain that is resistant to many drugs, even ones the patient has
never taken, leaving few or no options for effective therapy.
 &HT;    ``We could be on a short-term euphoria,'' warns Dr. Ronald
Desrosiers of Harvard. If toxicities or drug resistance forces
enough patients off medication, he says, the two-year decline in
the AIDS death rate could prove short-lived. ``Ten years from
now,'' Desrosiers says, ``we could be back to where we were five
years ago.''
 &HT;    Yet despite their limitations, the drugs do pin down the virus,
at least for a while, thus providing a window of opportunity for
researchers to revive the overwhelmed immune system. Dr. Anthony
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases in Bethesda, Md., says that it might not be necessary to
decrease the viral level to zero.
 &HT;    ``You may just need to get it low enough so that the immune
system can kick in and keep it in check,'' he says. Ho agrees:
``Control without eradication might be something we could call
remission.''
 &HT;    That's why the Berlin patient, who seems to fit precisely this
description, is so exciting to researchers.
 &HT;    ``What we're looking for,'' Walker says, ``are clues,
experiments of nature that will allow us to understand how to tweak
the immune system so that it can control the virus. And it's
patients like this guy in Berlin who will give us those insights.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    At 30, he is still a student, and he dresses like one: jeans, a
plaid shirt open at the neck and, on his wrist, one of those
colorful cloth bracelets from Mexico. He has short, alfalfa hair
and eyes that often look away, for he is almost painfully shy. He
has never before spoken publicly about his situation and _ fearful
of discrimination against both himself and his parents, who still
live in a small town in southern Germany _ he agreed to talk only
if his identity were concealed.
 &HT;    I met the Berlin patient in his doctor's office, and we walked a
few blocks through the heart of West Berlin's gay neighborhood to a
cafe, where he explained how he became a celebrated medical
mystery. It began on May 10, 1996, when he had sex that wasn't
safe. Three weeks later, he came down with what is called primary
infection syndrome, the fever, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue
signaling that HIV is gaining an initial foothold.
 &HT;    Heiko Jessen, a Berlin doctor with a large AIDS practice,
suggested an HIV test. On June 20, Jessen delivered the bad news.
``I could not move,'' recalls the Berlin patient. ``I didn't even
cry.''
 &HT;    Ten days later, the Berlin patient started on a cocktail of
three drugs _ the protease inhibitor indinavir, ddI and an
experimental and controversial drug called hydroxyurea. The amount
of virus in his blood quickly plummeted.
 &HT;    Then, less than three weeks after starting his medication, he
developed a testicular infection requiring an emergency
hospitalization. But he hadn't taken his HIV pills with him. So for
several days he didn't take his medicine, and his virus popped
back, though only to low levels. Restarting the drugs squelched it.
 &HT;    After that the Berlin patient took his pills religiously until,
about four months later, he started feeling weak and eating began
to make him vomit. He had contracted hepatitis A, which forced him
to interrupt his medication again.
 &HT;    When he recovered two weeks later, Jessen advised him to resume
taking his HIV drugs. Curiously, the virus didn't come back as it
had during his testicular infection.
 &HT;    But it wasn't the lab tests that ultimately persuaded the Berlin
patient to take the dangerous step of ending his drug regimen.
 &HT;    ``When the hepatitis stopped,'' he says, leaning forward, ``I
felt so healthy. I remember especially one evening. I was listening
to some music, and it was really, really cold _ it was November _
but I opened the windows and I was breathing and I thought: `My
body, it's OK. Everything's fine.'''
 &HT;    After that he took his pills only half-heartedly. ``One day I
took all of them,'' he laughs, ``and the next day it was only two,
and some days I really took nothing.''
 &HT;    Jessen calls his patient a ``dream boy.'' Indeed, he relies on
intuition and feeling more than logic and fact. And before becoming
infected, he had never known anyone with HIV, and no one close to
him had ever died. So he is totally sincere when he says he was
``not so surprised'' that his virus didn't come back, because ``it
was almost my will to become healthy.''
 &HT;    With 400 AIDS patients under his care, Jessen couldn't afford to
be so naive. When the Berlin patient admitted, just before
Christmas 1996, that he wasn't taking his medicine regularly,
Jessen told him, ``This is not a good idea.''
 &HT;    Jessen tried to bargain, proposing that his patient postpone his
decision for a few more months. ``But he said he had definitely
decided,'' Jessen remembers with resignation. ``What could I do?''
 &HT;    Yet Jessen realized that something fascinating was happening in
his patient. The virus should have already come back. Indeed, a
concurrent infection such as hepatitis normally stirs up HIV. So
Jessen said: ``You must come at least twice a month to the office.
You owe me that.''
 &HT;    The Berlin patient has certainly fulfilled his debt to science,
according to Dr. Franco Lori, the principal scientist working on
his case and director of the Research Institute for Genetic and
Human Therapy in Washington and Pavia, Italy. Lori once joked that
the reason the Berlin patient has virtually no virus left is that
researchers have removed it all by drawing so much blood.
 &HT;    Yet he feels no larger debt, no new lease on life. ``I really
did not suffer,'' he says. ``Only the pills reminded me I was
ill.''
 &HT;    Lori first presented the Berlin patient's case at a September
1997 conference organized by the lab of Dr. Robert Gallo,
co-discoverer of HIV. Two similar cases had already been reported
in the British medical journal The Lancet, but many researchers
doubted those cases.
 &HT;    The lead scientist _ Dr. Jorge Vila, medical director at the
French drug company Compagnie de Developpement Aguettant in Lyons _
isn't well known to AIDS researchers. And Vila's two patients had
such small amounts of virus in their blood before starting therapy
that scientists even speculated that they might not have been
infected at all. (The Berlin patient had a substantial infection,
verified by two separate tests.)
 &HT;    But now there is growing evidence of more cases. David Ho
revealed in an interview that he is following two patients who,
like the Berlin patient, started treatment soon after they were
infected and then decided to stop therapy against medical advice.
 &HT;    Their virus, Ho says, has not returned ``in a detectable way
with traditional tests.'' He declined to give additional details
until he has studied them in more depth.
 &HT;    And Vila now says that he has eight additional patients who have
had no detectable HIV rebound three to 12 months after stopping
their medication. One was treated early, but the others are what
are known as A1 patients, meaning they have suffered no AIDS
symptoms and retain relatively strong immune systems.
 &HT;    All of them started therapy with blood tests showing HIV counts
of less than 10,000, a low number. None of these 10 new cases have
been formally presented in scientific conferences or journals. But
if they hold up, there could be 13 patients who are suppressing HIV
after stopping treatment.
 &HT;    ``That's not a trend,'' says Dr. Beatrice Hahn, a University of
Alabama AIDS researcher, ``but it's more than an anecdote. These
are some of the most important patients to study.''
 &HT;    The Berlin patient is the best documented of all, and clinical
trials are about to begin that, in essence, try to repeat certain
key elements of his case. As it stands, his luck is still
unexplained _ and still provisional.
 &HT;    ``I don't think the virus will come back,'' he says. ``We have a
German phrase for my situation, `uber den Berg','' over the hump.
``It's finished for me.''
 &HT;    Perhaps. But he must continue practicing safe sex because he
might still be infectious, and he went to his first HIV support
group only after he had stopped taking drugs and had suppressed the
virus. ``Once you are HIV-positive,'' he explains, less naive now,
``the virus is always in you.''

PRUNING IN SHORTS AND T-SHIRT WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 21)  
(lb) 
 By ROBERT KOURIK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grandpa never lied. When he said, ``Pruning trees in the summer
is bad, especially with fruit trees, because they might bleed to
death,'' he was just repeating an heirloom fallacy.
</P>
<P>
   While the conventional wisdom is that late winter and early
spring are the best times for pruning, in fact, most trees, shrubs
and perennials are helped by some pruning from late winter all the
way through late fall. And there are special benefits to pruning in
the summer:
</P>
<P>
   _ You can wear shorts and a T-shirt instead of the long johns
and sweaters that cold-weather pruning requires.
</P>
<P>
   _ Delaying some pruning till summer frees up time for the more
urgent gardening tasks of spring.
</P>
<P>
   _ The foliage is visible in summer, so dead, damaged or diseased
sections are easier to spot, and the effects of pruning on patterns
of light and shadow are more apparent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flowers will be abundant on spring-blooming plants, since the
plants aren't pruned before the buds open.
</P>
<P>
   _ The calluses that will eventually seal the wound are quicker
to form when the plant is growing and photosynthesis is active.
</P>
<P>
   There are some shortcomings. Pruning deciduous trees in leaf
makes it harder to see the branching pattern, for example, and
previously shaded young limbs may be damaged by the sun, because
they haven't developed tough bark. (Cut with discretion in areas
with hot summers, leaving enough foliage to protect the upper
branches and the main trunk.)
</P>
<P>
   Where winters are cold, pruning too late in summer will leave
any new growth vulnerable to freeze damage. And you might knock
some fruit off trees before harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Any pruning cut _ whether it's made in winter or summer _ can
admit diseases. That's another reason not to prune too late in
summer, so there's plenty of time for a callus to start forming.
Your Cooperative Extension Service or an arborist can advise you
about diseases specific to your area. And it's always a good idea
to disinfect the clipper blades with a 10 percent solution of
chlorine bleach between cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Pruning cuts should never be made flush with the trunk. Before
any cut, you should identify two parts: the branch collar and the
branch bark ridge. The collar is the slightly swollen area that
nearly encircles the shoot, branch or limb where it is attached to
the trunk. (The collar is usually especially prominent on
conifers.) Prune as close as you can to the outside of the collar
while leaving it intact.
</P>
<P>
   On some plants, the collar doesn't show clearly. In those cases,
use the branch bark ridge to figure out the approximate angle of
the cut. This ridge is the slightly raised or puckered area of
crusty bark extending partway around the sides of the trunk from a
point just above the branch.
</P>
<P>
   Draw an imaginary line from the top of the branch bark ridge
straight down the side of the trunk. Then notice the angle that
this line makes with the branch bark ridge. Your pruning cut should
angle out about as much as the branch bark ridge angles in.
</P>
<P>
   When you cut, don't leave a stub sticking out, because diseases
and fungi may colonize it and eventually enter the heart of the
branch or trunk. And don't worry about painting over the cut _
horticulturists now say that this doesn't help the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy summer pruning isn't for every plant. Hacking back a bush
or tree that flowers in mid- to late summer, for example, will ruin
its display of blooms, since the newly forming buds are chopped
off. Prune these plants while they are dormant, in late winter or
early spring. And remember that if you don't prune them, they're
likely to get leggy.
</P>
<P>
   Dormant pruning is used primarily to encourage new shoots, to
reinvigorate a plant that doesn't put out much new growth and to
stimulate multiple shoots to work with during the summer, when
unwanted or poorly placed shoots are best removed.
</P>
<P>
   But spring bloomers should be pruned immediately after they
bloom _ late spring for some plants, as late as midsummer for
others. These plants start forming their buds later in the summer,
so when they go dormant in late fall, they're ready for the big
display the following spring.
</P>
<P>
   Most summer pruning involves so-called thinning cuts _ taking
off branches all the way back to the branch collar. Winter, or
dormant, pruning mostly involves heading cuts, or the partial
removal of branches to stimulate and control the branching pattern.
</P>
<P>
   When you prune a plant in summer after it has bloomed, don't
spare the shears if the crown's foliage was too rangy or leggy the
previous summer. The farther back you prune the crown, the denser
it will be the next summer. As a general guideline, you can promote
more ornamental beauty _ or, in fruit trees, more bounty _ by
pruning so that shoots and branches angle up from the horizontal at
45 to 60 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the summer for pruning is when heat and lack of
water cause a slowing of new growth. In the most arid spots, this
tapering off can occur as early as mid-July. In areas with warm,
rainy summers, active growth can continue until fall. For guidance
on when to start pruning, consult experienced gardeners, the
Cooperative Extension Service or a good pruning book.

MERGER MANIA SHIFTS TO CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARTA IWATA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Merger mania and business unions are starting to
sweep the Internet, as big corporations pounce on smaller on-line
companies that offer gateways to a new medium and millions of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is talking to everybody else,'' said Ryan Jacob,
portfolio manager of The Internet Fund, an investment fund based in
New York. ``The Internet is growing so rapidly that media companies
realize they can't wait much longer, or they'll be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The headlines and broadcasts are filled with new deals and
partnerships: Walt Disney Co. executives said Thursday they agreed
to buy 43 percent of Infoseek Corp., the hot Santa Clara, Calif.,
on-line search service.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, General Electric's NBC network bought 60 percent of
the popular Snap on-line search directory for $38 million from CNET
Inc. of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. reportedly is in talks to buy America Online Inc.,
the world's leading on-line service provider.
</P>
<P>
   After uch skepticism, behemoth media companies finally are
making large investments in on-line commerce, hoping to shove more
of their content on line as the Internet keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
   The small Internet companies also benefit from the deals.
Infoseek, for instance, will gain Disney's world-class marketing
might and mass entertainment offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mutual necessity here,'' Jacob said. ``A lot of
Internet companies are finding it too expensive to (expand) their
business, and they really need deep pockets to finance them. They
can't keep selling their stock every six months to finance their
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet search companies must evolve into media companies and
broaden their brand name and products or face death, said Alan
Braverman, an analyst at CS First Boston in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, traditional media and telecommunications
companies realize the Internet is a strong medium that soon may
compete with television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Internet is readily available to the masses via
telephone, cable or satellite, analysts project that 50 percent to
80 percent of American households will be on line over the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   The big companies want to snap up the Internet companies while
they are still bargains, thus avoiding costlier acquisitions later
or building from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage of the game, these large media companies realize
it's cheaper to buy rather than try to build,'' Jacob said.

 &HT;    Key to keeping employees is a BMW
 &HT;    (ATTN: Financial, technology editors)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the sweepstakes to attract and keep employees, a metro
Atlanta computer software firm might have found the key: actually,
a set of keys to a brand new BMW Z3 or BMW 318i.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue Systems Inc. has leased a fleet of BMWs for its 40
full-time workers, from receptionists to computer programmers. The
cars, in the employees' choice of color and options, will be
available in September and are valued at about $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've hit the lottery,'' said John Challenger, executive
vice president of the national outplacement firm of Challenger,
Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc. in Chicago. ``That's the best I've heard
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In a metro area where 20,000 information technology jobs are
unfilled, the BMW is a recruitment tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of rewarding our people and it's for
establishing an environment in which our people are happy to be
where they are,'' said chief financial officer Charles Crumley, who
is one of the three owners. ``We have very few (turnovers), but
it's a very competitive market and I'm sure some of our people have
other offers from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   The company writes and sells software to state and local
governments and plans to hire 30 people in the next year. Chief
Executive Bill Glover, who drives a BMW Z3, came up with the idea
about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Details are still being worked out, but Crumley said the company
will most likely pay most of the insurance on the cars. By law,
leased company cars are considered taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   Finding workers has reached the proportion of television games
shows, with companies giving out free cruises, massage therapy at
the office, even in-house dry-cleaning, with cubicle-to-cubicle
delivery.

common, scores of Christian leaders live in labor camps or jails
for refusing to bow to government control. While the confirmed

   SOUTHERN-BAPTISTS-BOS (Undated) _ In each of the past three
years, the Southern Baptists' annual convention has been marked by
a defining declaration of the march rightward of the nation's

takeover of the denomination by those who believe the Bible must be
taken literally as the inerrant word of God. Starting nearly 20
years ago, they have pushed moderates out of the denomination's six
seminaries and its administrative bodies. By Diego Ribadeneira.

   BAPTIST-COX (Undated) _ Controversy provoked by the Southern
Baptist Convention's call for women to ``graciously submit'' to
their husbands was unexpected and unfounded, said the Rev. Frank
Cox, the leader of the Georgia chapter told his Lawrenceville
congregation Sunday. But any man who thinks the convention's action
``gave him the right to be a dictator in the home does not
understand the word of God,'' said Cox. By Jennifer Brett. Moved

   MEXICO-BISHOP-NYT (Chanal, Mexico) _ Chiapas Bishop Samuel Ruiz,
73, preaches a passionately egalitarian message, calling on Indians
to reject the virtual caste system under which they are routinely
abused or ignored. But many government supporters and followers of
other faiths reject Ruiz's message. When Ruiz comes to this town,
he wears a metal helmet as protection against bullets, and he walks

   CELIBACY-DEBATE-COX (West Palm Beach, Fla.) _ The two sides of
celibacy: is it liberating, or limiting? Some supporters say it

biological one. Some critics say it encouraes pedophilia. By Steve
Gushee. Moved 6-15.

<P>
   BAPTISTS-MORMONS-NYT (Salt Lake City) _ Over the last week,
members of two of the most determinedly missionary faiths in the
United States, the Southern Baptist Convention and the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, have been coming face to face in
what has been a courteous if somewhat wary encounter. That it has

   BAPTISTS-REVIEW-NYT _ The conspiracy theorists have it all
wrong. The U.S. government is not run by Freemasons. Or by the pope
or Jewish bankers. The American people are entitled to the truth:
the government is run by Southern Baptists, who were recently in

Pauk Pressler in a skybox in the Houston Astrodome. At the time,
moderates dominated the giant denomination, and they were basking
in the glow of fresh national attention brought on by the election
of President Jimmy Carter, a born-again Southern Baptist. But
working in the background were conservatives such as Patterson and
Pressler, who thought Baptists were on a liberal path to

   NEW YORK _ The short-sleeved dress shirt conjures an image of
pale crew-cut men, circa 1965, feeding punch cards into a mainframe
computer the size of a studio apartment. But these days, when the
high school computer nerd has probably become one of the richest
men in the United States, the look has a quirky appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Once declasse, the short-sleeved dress shirt has achieved the
status of anti-fashion icon _ just look at Dilbert, Drew Carey and
the alternative rock group the Presidents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Never to be left out of a trend, designers like Paul Smith and
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana are offering the short-sleeved dress shirt in finer
fabrics and flattering cuts. But even with a designer label, the
shirt is still the reigning symbol of mainframe chic, conveying the
aloofness from corporate dress standards that made the tattoo such
a popular decoration. Of course, the shirt carries a subtler
message.
</P>
<P>
   To emulate a moneyed nerd, only the best short-sleeved shirt
will do. The checked shirts at Paul Smith, 108 Fifth Ave., $155 to
$195, are neatly tailored and come in cheerful colors, perfect for
either Silicon Valley or SoHo. The classic short-sleeve in white is
available in a stylish version at Emporio Armani for $95. At Dolce
&AMP; Gabbana, 825 Madison Ave., an ultra-fitted white cotton shirt
with a pair of chest pockets is $165.
</P>
<P>
   Barneys New York carries several models, including a white
textured cotton shirt by Dries Van Noten that is now on sale for
$170. For the sexier computer jock, a sheer short-sleeved shirt is
$305 at Costume National, 108 Wooster St. in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   The cheapest places to find short-sleeved dress shirts are at
thrift shops. Metropolis, on Avenue B at Seventh Street, has an
especially good selection. But beware: A common problem with many
models dug up from clothes graveyards is an uncomfortably high
polyester count.
</P>
<P>
   And for the complete style download: cerebral-looking
eyeglasses, available at Paul Smith, $210 to $350, and at Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana, $240; simple, plain-front khakis at Banana Republic, $48,
and New Balance running shoes from Foot Locker, $59 to $125. A
shirt-pocket protector is optional.
</P>
<P>
   One last note: The top button should never, ever be closed. Geek
chic is one thing; Forrest Gump is another.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When James Huniford and Stephen Sills decided to
accessorize their weekend house in Bedford, N.Y., with the latest
suburban status symbol, they didn't fool around.
</P>
<P>
   Snaking around their 22-acre property is a massive stone wall
built by Spanish masons. It took two years to piece together the
rustic fieldstones without mortar. Such extravagance does not come
cheap. Huniford won't confirm the cost, but masons estimate the
price at more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love it,'' Huniford said. ``They stop all the time.
We've had tons of people talk about it. We've had people drive up
off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   That paradox _ that a large, imposing stone wall meant to keep
people out attracts attention and the occasional unknown caller _
is not lost on Huniford and Sills, who own the design firm Sills
Huniford in New York, with clients like Anna Wintour and Nan Swid.
They understand that their stone wall is not only functional (good
fences make good neighbors, as Robert Frost reported), but it is
also an emblem.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the stone wall _ imposing, massive, redolent of
Old World charm and New World money _ has become one of the most
important status symbols for the high-end home in woodsy northern
suburbs, right up there with Range Rovers and $12,000 custom-built
AGA stoves.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford and Mount Kisco lead the masonry market in New York; in
Connecticut, Greenwich has gone wall-crazy, along with New Canaan,
Darien and Westport.
</P>
<P>
   Randi Heine, a Bedford resident who has worked with a mason on
her stone walls and other landscaping projects for two years, says
Greenwich is so wall-obsessed that she calls it ``the walled
city.'' Stonemasons in Westchester County, N.Y., and Fairfield
County, Conn., report waiting lists _ some as long as a year _ and
stone suppliers have come to expect seasonal shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market went crazy, and people went crazy and started
building,'' said Carmine Luppino, a mason in Mount Kisco, whose
clients will wait a year for his services. ``It's a status symbol.
The bigger the wall you got, the bigger the piece of property you
got, the more money you got.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Tomlinson, an owner of Bedford Stone and Masonry Supply,
said: ``We've seen a major increase in the demand for stone in the
last five years. It's a status symbol, and it raises the value of
the house. Everybody is so busy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Huniford wanted to build a wall because it provided privacy, and
it helped to mute noise from Route 172, the busy two-lane road on
which his house sits. Tommy Hilfiger in Greenwich, Ralph Lauren,
Michael Crichton and George Soros in Bedford _ all of whom recently
built stone walls on their properties _ no doubt craved a similar
privacy. But less famous residents also say that a stone wall
provides security and a je-ne-sais-quoi sense of exclusivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Greenwich, every house has a wall,'' Mrs. Heine said. ``And
then next to that, you have a house with a wall and an eagle. Next
to that, you have a house with a wall, an eagle and a flag. The
idea of success is to have a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, aesthetically, they're just beautiful,'' Huniford
said. ``And I think people like the feeling of comfort it gives
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of the typical stone wall is enough to keep the
chain-link-fence industry alive. Luppino charges from $100,000 to
more than $1 million for a painstakingly jointed, hand-stacked
fieldstone wall, and he has charged one client $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for most masons begin at $20 a cubic foot and can climb
to $100 a cubic foot, depending on the mason's skill, the quality
of the material and the manner in which the wall is assembled.
(Dry-wall construction, in which stones are chiseled, then stacked
without mortar or cement, costs more.)
</P>
<P>
   Multiply that by hundreds or thousands of feet, and the
million-dollar tab doesn't sound so distant. Vincent Camuto, the
chief executive of the Nine West shoe-store chain, spent a little
less than $600,000 building walls on his property in Greenwich _
though his house is in a gated, walled community (the sign at the
front says ``propriete privee'') to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all luxury and lavishness and increasing the value of
your property,'' said Joe Coppola, a Stamford, Conn., mason who
built Camuto's and 500 other stone walls in Greenwich.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tales of stone-wall hysteria abound. Bill Stanton, a private
investigator hired to get the goods on a Bedford billionaire told
this story:
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire asked a mason to build walls on his property,
instructing the household staff to observe the masons at work. A
day later, he fired the masons and had the servants take over the
job.
</P>
<P>
   When Huniford and Sills wanted to build their wall, they had to
spend six months lobbying Bedford's zoning board because they
wanted to build higher than most.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Megna, the Bedford town building inspector, said that
the reason the town instituted a law on fence height was that the
high stone walls were creating a boxed-in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huniford Sills wouldn't have gone through any rigmarole if
they had stuck with the height laws,'' he said, adding that the
size of the wall had become the talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   Masons have their own analysis of the psychology of
wall-building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's because when you make money, you like to be in your
own little world,'' Coppola said. ``And these people like to
compete with one another _ who has the nicer curbing or better
coping stones or who has a nicer stone wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's been going on at a feverish pace for the
last four or five years,'' said Dan Ginnel, a Bedford real estate
agent. ``And when someone spends that kind of money, it doesn't
necessarily make a million-dollar differential, but generally they
do add to the overall value. Some walls add far more value.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone-wall fever is spreading. The pop singer Tina Turner took
one look at the Huniford and Sills wall and had to have one of her
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Bedford and saw that wall, and I didn't expect it to
be quite that awesome,'' Ms. Turner said. ``I thought, now that's
the wall I want to have!'' Huniford and Sills offered guidance on
the construction of a wall that now surrounds her house in France,
near Nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know, their wall looked so old,'' Ms. Turner said.
``They just don't make things like that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The decorators must not have told Ms. Turner the insiders'
secret of instantly creating a look of antiquity _ spray the stones
with buttermilk so moss will grow.

 CLINTON CHINA TRIP HAS LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION. WHERE'S THE SCRIPT?
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ORVILLE SCHELL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner +
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ When President Clinton steps onto Chinese soil this
week, he will be like a famed actor with a vast supporting cast
mounting a stage with a huge audience in attendance, but no real
script.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in his travels he will be able to create a credible
script that will lead to significant new agreements or
understandings will show the measure of his acumen as a leader
known for being able to think on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   While his curious slow-motion travels will help Clinton learn
something about this important and complex country, and while it
will certainly win favor in Beijing, it will also raise
expectations at home that something of consequence should result.
</P>
<P>
   But ticking through the list of issues that divide the two
nations _ Taiwan's status, Tibetan autonomy, Hong Kong's
democratization, human rights, intellectual property rights,
China's admission to the World Trade Organization, the
proliferation of missile and nuclear technology and the targeting
of nuclear warheads _ it is hard to discern where major agreements
could come.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, given the uniquely ritualized way in which Chinese
leaders have embargoed sensitive issues from serious discussion
with outsiders _ lest they appear to be caving in to foreign
pressure _ it is not likely that the president will be able to get
a glove on much of substance.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising areas of concord for the United States are in
the missile technology and nuclear proliferation field _ although
past agreements and understandings have not proven particularly
durable.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Chinese do have a script, and it involves
acting out a drama in which the president of the United States
journeys all the way to China, much as ``tribute missions'' from
abroad used to visit the Forbidden City to make offerings to the
emperor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will appear beside President Jiang Zemin in Tiananmen
Square, site of the 1989 crackdown against student protests, as a
sanctifying force for the Chinese Communist Party's post-Deng
Xiaoping leadership, as if to acknowledge China as a great nation
and to say, ``All is forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   For China, the photo-op and the appearance of uncritical
acceptance are enough. Words hardly need be spoken, and agreements
will be bothersome details that might cause the appearance of
unalloyed mutual respect and unity to be tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's problems is that Congress is in a state of
virtual warfare with Beijing over everything from satellite deals
and campaign contributions to religious persecution and other human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Further, because of its still-unrepudiated Maoist past, many
Americans still feel an uneasiness about the prospect of a powerful
China acting out on the world stage. Many also appear to feel a
certain ambivalence at the prospect of their president sanctifying
a regime that is so stubbornly resistant to reassessing its
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   China's real problems are shaping up as ones with which the
United States is ill-equipped to help or hinder. Most important is
the deepening Asian economic meltdown and how it might catalyze
dangerous social and political tensions within China itself.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, China has managed to remain almost miraculously
aloof from the Asian meltdown. But as Japan's crisis has deepened
and as troops backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers
entered Djakarta, Indonesia, last month, the world was left
wondering how China can continue to dodge the bullet.
</P>
<P>
   After all, China shares many of the same characteristics that
have led Indonesia to the brink: a poorly regulated but dynamic
economy, an autocracy that daily violates its people's rights; a
press controlled by the state; an economic system that is opaque,
nepotistic and steeped in cronyism and corruption; a poor
underclass menaced by rising unemployment; and a banking system and
financial markets that are poorly developed, inadequately regulated
and subject to wanton manipulation by elites.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the political legitimacy for both the
Chinese and Indonesian governments has been derived not from an
electorate or a credible political system, but almost exclusively
from their abilities to maintain high rates of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   On this front, Asia is now delivering some ominous news. Japan
is officially in recession. The plunging yen has even caused the
governor of the People's Bank of China, Dai Xianglong, to worry out
loud that its depreciation will have ``a very unfavorable effect on
China's exports and ability to attract foreign investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong is suddenly showing negative growth rates, its stock
market keeps breaking new lows, and increased pressure on the ``the
peg,'' which backs its currency at a fixed U.S. dollar rate and
provides one of the few firm points of reference in the whole Asian
imbroglio, is making everyone nervous.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to all this bad news, rumors have abounded that
China may have to devalue its currency, and equity markets
throughout Asia have gone into a further nosedive. ``It's a
bloodbath out there,'' declared Patrick Crammond, director of
equity capital markets for Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   So far, China has eluded this maelstrom because of its
relatively strong economic position vis-a-vis the rest of the world
and because enough of its old Maoist autarky has remained intact to
keep it somewhat insulated from the unpredictable and dangerous
flows of global capital that have led to collapse elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It has prudently kept its foreign debt low, roughly equivalent
with its foreign exchange reserves. Instead of being seduced like
other Asian nations into borrowing large amounts of short-term
capital from overseas banks, it has sought its foreign capital in
direct long-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is not now subject to the repayment crunches
facing so many of its neighbors. And because its financial markets
are still relatively small, panicked foreign investors fleeing
other Asian markets have not had the same destabilizing effect on
China.
</P>
<P>
   The non-convertibility of Chinese currency has also proven a
blessing, because international currency speculators have not been
able to attack it as they have in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, China's top leadership, now relatively stable, will
gather added sovereignty in the eyes of its own people as a result
of Clinton's visit _ even if he does engage in some plain talk on
human rights, which will certainly be censored in local reports.
</P>
<P>
   But China is nonetheless in jeopardy. Wariness about Asia's
economic future has already begun to squeeze the economy. Whereas
in 1993 its growth rate was 14 percent, before slipping to a more
reasonable 8.8 percent by 1997, it now hovers around 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the yen falling against the dollar and other Asian
currencies in sharp decline, it will become increasingly difficult
for Chinese products to compete in overseas markets. Indeed,
exports _ an important engine of China's technological development
and economic growth _ fell in May for the first time in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Should growth rates continue to decelerate, the nation will have
more difficulty providing jobs for the 6.5 percent of its workforce
that the government now acknowledges as unemployed _ the highest
official rate since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does that rate account for the 12 million to 15 million who
enter the job market each year; the millions of state workers who
have already been ``sidelined'' at a fraction of their normal
salaries, or the massive ``floating population'' of more than 100
million who have left their villages to seek manual labor in the
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the troubling fact that numerous outbursts of
protest involving disgruntled workers and peasants have already
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such demonstrations were to assume a political character,''
warned the World Bank's East Asian and Pacific region senior
adviser, Pieter Bottelier, ``they could become dangerous to
stability beyond the immediate area where they occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Still to come are the tens of millions of older workers slated
to lose their jobs as money-losing state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
are closed as part of Premier Zhu Rongji's ambitious program of
reform. The only thing still keeping SOEs alive are state banks,
which are used like giant cash registers to keep these unproductive
industries solvent so that angry workers don't take to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lardy, a Brookings Institution economist, believes that
these banks present ``the most serious threat to macroeconomic
stability in China.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent focus of the Chinese people on economics has left
them notably indifferent to politics, but it may not take long for
economic problems to begin manifesting themselves as political
disaffection.
</P>
<P>
   Recent events in Indonesia remind us that as long as the economy
is moving onward and upward, ordinary people can accept many
indignities. When economic growth begins to falter, however, things
can turn political very rapidly. Unless there are other sources of
political legitimization, leaderships can fall with astonishing
suddenness.
</P>
<P>
   China is paradoxically both more fortified and more vulnerable
to the highly contagious economic flu now deepening in Asia. But in
the last few weeks, its privileged isolation has begun to look
increasingly precarious.
</P>
<P>
   It is into this very complex situation that President Clinton is
now heading.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the West has unrealistically viewed China in
extreme terms, as either ``the sick man of Asia or the ``economic
miracle'' maker. Clinton has done well not to repeat this error and
to stay ``engaged,'' even as the relationship became bedeviled with
some very prickly issues.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of his historic trip, Americans would do well to
remember how Deng Xiaoping surprised almost everyone by navigating
his country away from the apocalypse of Tiananmen Square and how
economic czar Zhu Rongji astutely steered it past other treacherous
shoals to revive its economy.
</P>
<P>
   But China's leaders now confront a challenge in which external
and internal problems may combine to end this period of high growth
and optimism. If the protective bulwark that has shielded the
country from economic turmoil is in fact now in jeopardy, one can
understand why the Beijing leadership is seeking whatever outside
legitimization it can find.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, Clinton is not the pope, whose job it is to go
around the world sanctifying branches of the Catholic Church. His
job is to represent American interests. One of those interests is
to help promote stability in the world _ not by supporting every
status-quo regime, but rather by bolstering those governments whose
legitimacy comes from more than just their ability to promote
bursts of economic growth. As we are beginning to see in Asia,
while government is eternal, boom years tend to be cyclical.
</P>
<P>
   As recent events in Indonesia suggest, autocracies become
vulnerable when economic push comes to shove. It would be a pity if
Clinton's 1998 grand tour of China were to be remembered more as a
photo op than as a time when he spoke the truth about the
interrelation between free markets, the democratic process and
stability.
</P>
<P>
   There is an expression in Chinese _ tongchuang yimeng, or
``sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams.'' It is
an apt description of the way the Sino-U.S. summit seems to be
shaping up.

at UC-Berkeley, is the author of numerous books on China, including
``Mandate of Heaven'' and the forthcoming ``Virtual Tibet.'')

WINE THERAPIST TO THE STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 21)  
(lb) 
 By MELINA GEROSA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

   Christian Navarro has a talent that money can buy. When the
emptied, upended wine bottles rattled around in the ice bucket at
Table 90 at a charity gala in New York last month, the millionaires
seated in a circle turned to Navarro, their guest, to replenish the
supply. The pressure was on.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a black Gucci suit with his jet-black hair waxed to
porcupine perfection, Navarro slid his finger down the wine list
with more cool than Jon Bon Jovi was managing onstage. Moments
later, a Mondavi 1994 cabernet sauvignon and a 1996 chardonnay
arrived. Not exotic choices, but given the limits of the New York
Hilton and Tower's cellar, even Piero Selvaggio _ whose Los Angeles
restaurant Valentino won a James Beard award for best wine service
in 1994 _ nodded approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian's one of the most knowledgeable people about wine
I've ever met,'' said Emiel Petrone, executive vice president of
Philips Entertainment Group and Table 90's host at the gala, a
benefit for the T.J. Martell Foundation. ``He has knowledge beyond
his years.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Eagles want to party, when President Clinton is coming
to dinner or when Tom Cruise craves his favorite burgundy (1985
Domaine de la Romanee Conti), Navarro, 31, a partner in Wally's
Wine Shop in Los Angeles, is the man who often gets called. He is a
high-school dropout, who rose from sales clerk to self-taught
enophile to sommelier to the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian has built the most significant Hollywood base for
wine and spirits in the industry,'' said James Orr, a screenwriter
(``Three Men and a Baby''). ``He's a wine therapist. He listens to
what you want, and then he makes gentle recommendations. He has a
way of handling people so that they don't even know that they are
being handled.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr, who spends $75,000 a year to replenish his 4,000-bottle
cellar, has been a client of Navarro for eight years. He has
referred budding enophile friends, like Courtney Cox, Farrah
Fawcett and the producer Jack Rapke, to Navarro for just as long.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my guru,'' said Rapke, who first called Navarro five
years ago, when he was co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency. ``I
used him to send gifts to a lot of very visible and not-so-visible
people. Then I asked him to help me start my own cellar, and we've
been working together ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Creative Artist agents, like Michael Ovitz, the former
chairman, followed Rapke's lead. ``It got to a point where Mike
Ovitz would say, `I need to send something to Tom and Nicole.' And
I would say, `I know exactly what they like,''' Navarro said with
the cocksureness of a Tom Cruise character. ``And then Tom would
call Mike and say, `How did you know we love this wine?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz didn't know. But Navarro did, having developed a
meticulous list of preferences of 2,000 wine and spirits drinkers,
from Jack Nicholson to Jackie Chan. He does his homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``You call their assistants,'' he said. ``You call the people
who have worked with them. Anyone's secretary can send a bottle of
Dom, but when you send someone their exact, favorite wine, they
think you really thought about it. They don't know that I'm in the
middle, the guy behind the scenes,'' he said, flashing a gleaming,
gaptoothed grin.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro is careful to make his clients look good by including
personalized histories with the wines he sells them. ``This one
agent will have all these stars at his dinner, and he'll stand up
and say, `This particular wine, which I pulled out from my cellar,
was founded in the 1800s,''' Navarro said. ``He'll tell a whole
story about it, reading off of my little cheat sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the celebrities started coming in themselves.
Michael Keaton drops into Wally's to chat about red Provencales and
pick up a few bottles of Mas de Gourgonnier for his home in
Montana. Out-of-town deliveries are no problem. Navarro shipped
Robert De Niro's favorite tequila, Petron, to him on faraway sets.
``Let's say he's shooting a picture in Paris,'' Navarro said. ``I
get it there. When Emilio Estevez finished a movie in Spain, I sent
him wine to give as gifts.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood is only part of it. Navarro is also a consultant
to captains of finance. ``I started meeting the Wall Street guys,''
he said. ``Like the Hollywood guys, one would lead to another and
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Eli Broad, chairman of Sun America, the financial-services
company, seeks Navarro's advice for the Democratic Party
fund-raisers he holds at his palatial home in Brentwood, Calif.
``I'm not a great connoisseur, but I'm a client because I trust his
taste,'' said Broad, whose latest event raised $1.2 million for
House Democrats last month. The guests included Clinton, Michael
Douglas, Oliver Stone and Quincy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was $10,000 a couple, so I couldn't serve cheap wine, but
on the other hand, I didn't want to spend a lot of money,'' Broad
said. Navarro chose a 1995 Patz &AMP; Hall chardonnay at $30 a bottle.
Did the president comment on the selection? ``Not extensively,''
Broad said. ``He doesn't drink a lot of wine. But he likes white,
and he said it was good, or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most money, Navarro said, is spent on private parties for
rock stars and law firms. For the 1995 wedding of Don Henley of the
Eagles, 140 bottles of Krug Clos du Mesnil champagne, at $200 each,
and 120 bottles of Zonchera Barolo, an Italian red wine, at $40
each, were ordered for the four-day festivities. ``The sky was the
limit,'' Navarro noted.
</P>
<P>
   Although Navarro is quick to drop the names and expenditures of
his famous clients, he is more reticent when it comes to his own
financial data. His income, which includes a salary as well as an
ownership interest in Wally's, adds up to ``a fair amount,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day for him consists of a restaurant lunch, a couple
of house calls to clients assembling wine cellars, and fielding 40
or 50 phone calls. Sometimes he is called to the cellars of
divorcing clients _ a duty he dreads. ``When the wine appreciates,
sometimes you're talking a couple million dollars,'' he said, ``and
to have both parties arguing over each bottle, with me trying to
give the pros and cons of each one, that's ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before he learned the art of cellar mediation, Navarro's
talent was apparent. ``As a little kid, I used to smell everything
on the table, from the fork to the foods to the napkins,'' he said.
``My mother was always saying, `Put that down!'''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Mexico City and brought up in Palm Springs, Calif.,
Navarro spent his youth tagging along with his mother, a restaurant
and hotel consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would basically turn me loose in the kitchens,'' he said.
His first sip of wine came at the age of 10. ``I thought it was
grape juice, so I was shocked at the acids and mutated fruit
qualities,'' he said. His taste buds may have revolted, but his
nose found a favorite new forum. ``The cellar masters would ask me
to smell the different wines and I would say, `It smells like
smoke,' or roast beef, or whatever,'' he recalled. ``It became a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro dropped out of high school in 10th grade to travel in
Europe. He returned after a year and a half, settling in Los
Angeles, where he worked stocking shelves at the Wine House, a
retail shop.
</P>
<P>
   He read books on wine, peppered his colleagues with questions
and, after five years, took a growing list of his own clients to
Wally's Wine Shop on Westwood Boulevard. That same year, 1992,
fittingly for a Hollywood tale, he got a big break. When his boss,
Steve Wallace, became sick and couldn't make it to a tasting of
rare 19th-century wines by 40 distinguished enophiles, Navarro went
in his place. ``I was now on the fast track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, the majority owner of Wally's, said of Navarro, ``He's
our Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his nose?
</P>
<P>
   Wallace laughed. ``It has more to do with smelling out
customers,'' he said. ``He knows wine, but it's really about the
service. He carries a pager and a phone, and no matter where he is
in the world, he's obtainable. We'll be out of the country on a
buying trip, and he'll constantly be on the phone to the States,
calling back Eli Broad or Michael Douglas or whoever. He's always
following up.''

FARMS, RANCHES LOSE MORE THAN $500 MILLION AFTER MONTHS WITHOUT
ENOUGH RAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WORTH WREN JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The intense dry spell that has gripped most
of Texas for two months has created a corn, grain sorghum and
cotton disaster in parts of the state, agriculture officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Agricultural Extension Service estimates that
weather-related losses statewide already have cut farm and ranch
income by more than $500 million this year, and the losses will
likely mount. Typically, agricultural income in Texas ranges from
$13 billion to $15 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corn already is pretty well lost,'' said Bob Beakley, a
29-year farming veteran who has watched his 2,000 acres of corn
near Ennis wilt under the sun and hot winds since April.
</P>
<P>
   Beakley and his son, Steven, also raise cotton, wheat and
soybeans in southern Ellis County. He says they've lost more than
70 percent of their corn crop. And they say their 2,200 acres of
cotton and 800 acres of soybeans are ``on the cusp'' of disaster,
although their 800 acres of wheat produced above-average yields in
the recent harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cotton still has a little way to go,'' Bob Beakley said,
adding that a soaking rain within a couple of weeks during the
current crucial growth stage ``might revive the cotton to nearly
100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The extension service says farmers in Central and South Texas
stand to lose $150 million on corn and grain sorghum.
</P>
<P>
   Although spotty rains have offered relief in some areas, the big
losses are hitting most farmers without irrigation from the
southern fringes of the Metroplex to Mexico, and southeast and west
across most of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stalks that don't have ears and ears that don't have
kernels,'' said Gary Stanford, the Ellis County agricultural
extension agent. He estimated an 80 percent loss of corn production
potential on more than 40,000 acres countywide, but he still
offered hope for a good cotton yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The window has not closed on a cotton crop, yet,'' Stanford
said. But projected cotton losses across Central and South Texas
are already topping $150 million, the extension service reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Northwest Texas, where more than half the state's cotton is
planted, cotton and grain crops remain in earlier growth stages,
and losses have not been estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County farmers and ranchers have had more rain and are
faring better than their counterparts in many other areas, but they
also urgently need more rain, said John South, the county's
agricultural agent.
</P>
<P>
   Beakley said the rainfall has been unusual this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had El Nino all winter, giving us roughly twice the average
rainfall we normally get in December, January and February,''
Beakley said. ``March was probably about normal. April, he shut
off, and we didn't show a measurable drop of rainfall in May.''
</P>
<P>
   June hasn't been any better in most areas.
</P>
<P>
   Even the grasshoppers are getting picky about the parched corn,
which now stands 5 to 7 feet high when it should be about 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corn got dry like Post Toasties, and the grasshoppers
left,'' Stanford said.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, many North Texans are reporting waves of grasshoppers
chomping flowers and devouring leaves on shrubs, vegetables, trees
and even some cotton and grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 26 years, and I've never seen 'em this bad
before,'' said Bill Buxkemper, the Hill County agricultural
extension agent whose Hillsboro phone has been swamped with calls
about grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically,'' Buxkemper said, echoing a regional view, ``we're
coming off the best wheat crop we've ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   But the region's hay harvest cuttings are now also dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ain't raising much of anything this year,'' said Sammy
Hutcheson, a Grandview-area farmer. He said the heat and the
grasshoppers have swiped more than half of his normal hay,
cantaloupe, tomato, black-eyed pea, onion and other vegetable
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle ranchers in some areas are beginning to cull or consider
culling a greater-than-normal portion of their cattle as pasture
grasses weaken and hay prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy farmers, already in a price squeeze that has idled about
30 percent of the milk-producing farms in Texas since Jan. 1, 1995,
are seeing their forage costs rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now feeding as much hay as we expect to do in the
winter,'' said Peggy Van Zandt, who farms with her husband, Ray Van
Zandt, between Grandview and Cleburne in Johnson County. The farm
is buying more hay at higher prices _ spending twice as much as it
did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Van Zandt Dairy normally grows enough pasture grasses to cover
the cows' forage needs at this time of year, and it normally raises
50 percent of the cows' winter hay needs, Peggy Van Zandt said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a lack of moisture, she said, the farm is failing to
deliver on both those forage fronts.

SAN FRANCISCO CONSIDERS SHELTER FOR BATTERED GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A city supervisor wants to provide shelter for
gay men who are battered by their partners, and if the ordinance is
approved, it would make San Francisco the first city in the nation
to offer such services.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city has long assisted three women's shelters,
there has never been a safe place for homosexual men fleeing
domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Mark Leno proposed Thursday giving $37,000 to
Community United Against Violence to expand its counseling, legal
and shelter programs for same-sex victims of abuse in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today San Francisco will make history by committing itself to
having the only domestic violence shelter for gay men,'' Leno said.
He said the proposal has support from the Board of Supervisors,
which currently is divvying up the 1998-99 city budget.
</P>
<P>
   The plan doesn't envision a new shelter. Instead, it would pay
for four beds in an existing shelter for homeless men.
</P>
<P>
   The $37,000 also would allow Community United Against Violence
to add a part-time advocate to help both gay men and lesbians
escaping from violent homes to get legal protection and make the
transition to a more stable life.
</P>
<P>
   And it would fund one-time grants so domestic violence victims
to set up a new household.
</P>
<P>
   The need is undeniable, according to Leno and San Francisco
District Attorney Terence Hallinan, who last year stepped up his
office's response to domestic violence and made a special effort to
reach out to gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Studies suggest that homosexual couples experience domestic
violence at the same rate as straight couples, but only recently
has the gay community started to bring the problem to light.
</P>
<P>
   Community United's crisis hot line gets calls from 400 people a
year _ two-thirds of them gay men _ seeking help with abusive
partners. On average, 50 need emergency shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Lesbians who are victims of abuse from partners can move into
the women's shelters, if there is room, but ``right now the men
have no place to go,'' said Jeff Sheehy, an advocate for same-sex
victims in Hallinan's office.

   COLOMBIA-COCA-HERBICIDE (Bogota, Colombia) _ The Colombian
gGovernment, bowing to demands from anti-narcotics officials in
Washington, has agreed to test a granular herbicide to kill coca
crops, despite public warnings from the chemical's American
manufacturer against its use in Colombia. In the United States, the
herbicide, tebuthiuron, is used mostly to control weeds in areas
like railroad beds and under high-voltage lines far away from food
crops and people. The Environmental Protection Agency requires a
warning label on the chemical that says it could cause groundwater
contamination something Colombian environmental officials fear
could prevent peasants from growing food where coca once grew. By

   CONGRESS-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ In a significant test of

and drew an unexpectedly large number of Republicans to its side.
On one key test, 65 Republicans voted to preserve the legislation
sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan,

in a free-for-all over the campaign finance laws. By Alison

   MIAMI-CORRUPT (Miami) _ Bribery. Kickbacks. Voter fraud.
Cover-up. Even as law enforcement officials promise more arrests,
the city of Miami is now engulfed in a series of high-profile
investigations that have uncovered a wave of such pervasive public
corruption it is now often mentioned in the same breath as New York
during the so-called city scandals and Chicago during the heyday of
the Democratic machine. By Mireya Navarro.

Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has passed a resolution calling on the
denomination's 2.6 million members to ``work toward removing
handguns and assault weapons'' from their homes and communities.
Presbyterian officials and other church leaders said the assembly's

action by church members, rather than seeking governmental

income by more than $500 million this year, and the losses will
likely mount. Typically, agricultural income in Texas ranges from
$13 billion to $15 billion annually. By WORTH WREN JR. Story has

   REDMOND, Wash. _ Perched on a high stool, Steve Ballmer, the
hard-charging super-salesman who serves as Bill Gates's right-hand
man, pounds one fist into his palm when he is asked to describe the
forces that shape Microsoft's corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to tell your people to play to win,'' Ballmer
replies. ``You can't satisfy customers if you don't have any.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft critics say it's that kind of take-no-prisoners
competitive drive that last month entangled the software giant in
federal and state antitrust suits. But for the executive vice
president and his co-workers, spread out among 36 highly secure
sites here on the Microsoft campus, the case brought by the Justice
Department fails to compute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, this is a time of great distractions,'' Ballmer
concedes. ``But we're putting our heads down and we're doing our
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, that thing is Thursday's rollout of the Windows
98 upgraded operating system for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark case set for trial in early September, the federal
trust-busters charge that Microsoft Corp. has gone too far in
blending its Internet browser with Windows 98, allegedly seeking to
leverage its near-monopoly in the digital code that runs personal
computers into another monopoly in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest threat does not come from the government,''
Ballmer says, dismissing the suit with a wave of his hand. ``The
real danger we face is falling out of touch with our customers. And
our customers want products that work together. They see all that
(integration) stuff in a beneficial way. It means that Microsoft is
doing what otherwise customers would have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bundling practices of which Ballmer boasts are widely
seen as predatory by Microsoft critics and industry rivals. The
company makes no apology for using Windows to attain commanding
positions in new markets, such as interactive TV and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals say Microsoft's true aim is not to create new products
but rather to co-opt ideas and products developed by other firms,
such as the Netscape Navigator browser, and cobble all of them into
Windows. If Microsoft stays on this path, such features as speech
recognition, database searching and language translation are likely
to appear in future Windows releases.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, trustbusters have had limited success in curbing such
tactics. One notable exception: In 1995, Microsoft was obliged to
abandon its $2 billion acquisition of Intuit, maker of the leading
financial software Quicken, after the Justice Department threatened
to file suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyberspace may indeed offer the potential of untold consumer
choice _ if nobody gains a stranglehold,'' said Robert Kuttner, a
co-editor of American Prospect. ``But what Gates is attempting is
as old as the efforts to monopolize the steel, rail, oil, and
telephone industries in the robber baron era.''
</P>
<P>
   Such viewpoints are hotly contested here. ``Intellectual
property is not a scarce natural resource as is oil,'' said
Microsoft spokesman Greg Shaw. ``The barriers to entry in the
software industry are quite low.''
</P>
<P>
   In hiring and retaining the developers who wrote, tested and
debugged some 4 million lines of code that went into the design of
Windows 98, the company has cultivated a distinctly elitist image.
</P>
<P>
   A recruiting pitch that Gates helped draft reads: ``Microsoft
people are part brainiacs, part free-spirited individualists, and
100 percent passionate about technology. Here you're encouraged not
only to speak what's on your mind, but also to do it. You'll find a
place where anything can happen and most often does.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is a a defensive tone in the recruiting
message that appears on the Microsoft Web site:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you've heard the rumors. You have to give up your life.
We've grown so big that you could never make a difference. It rains
here. Okay, that's no rumor. But have you heard about the kind of
passion you can feel simply walking down any hallway? Or the
freedom to jump from one hot technology and one opportunity to
another, backed by the kind of resources unheard of anywhere else?
Or all the breakthrough products that could only have come from the
creative chemistry of brilliant minds?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsofties,'' as company employees invariably refer to
themselves, have some of the lowest turnover rates in the industry.
Corporate rivals in California's Silicon Valley _ where job hopping
is common _ scornfully refer to Gates's crew as ``microserfs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft at its core highly values intelligence,'' says Scott
Langmack, who joined up 30 months ago to head Microsoft's extensive
technical support effort, leaving a higher-paid and more
prestigious marketing position at Pepsi-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous positive input all the time from Bill
(Gates) on down, Langmack adds. ``There's some magic about working
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft moved from downtown Seattle to the Redmond campus in
1986, the same year its stock went public. Since then, new
construction at the 296-acre site has virtually never ceased.
Computerized ID cards are needed to enter every building. Access to
the most sensitive units, where the leading-edge development work
goes forward, is highly restricted even for longtime Microsoft
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Gates and Ballmer, both 42, rank among the most elderly members
of Microsoft's 17,000-member domestic employee pool. Nearly a third
of the firm's workers are 29 or younger, and more than half of them
are between 30 and 39, with the average age 34.4 years.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their ages, the dress code on campus is uniformly
casual, a custom that harkens back to the company's founding in
1975, when Gates would at times fall asleep on the floor after an
intense all-night bout of code-writing on the relatively primitive
computers of that era.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft crew often punctuates code-writing and
brainstorming sessions with pickup games of basketball, volleyball
or soccer on a dozen playing fields scattered among the highly
functional campus buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever it rains, as it often does here, workers on breaks
repair to state-of-the art video game machines that stand near the
row upon row of modestly-sized cubicles where nearly everyone _
including the peripatetic Gates _ puts in long, if flexibly
structured, workdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our products that define our culture,'' said Jeff Raikes,
Microsoft's vice president for sales and marketing, who was reared
on a farm in Nebraska and who ``started working with Bill,'' as he
puts it, 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cool business,'' Raikes added. ``I'm spending more
time on public relations work with people like you because of the
antitrust suit. But we're doing what our customers say they want us
to do. And we'll be spending $2.6 billion on research and
development this year to make sure we're not left behind after
we've pushed Windows 98 out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For the debut of Windows 98, Ballmer's marketers have crafted a
metaphor: If high technology travels down an open road of
innovation, then Windows 98 will be that major thoroughfare. The
updated operating system will be advertised with ``Route 98''
signs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dataquest, a leading independent analyst of software
trends for personal computers, estimated that Windows 98 upgrade
shipments will total 5.5 million units this year. By 1999,
Dataquest projects, Microsoft will enjoy a 95 percent share in
operating system shipments for all computers throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to reflect on how Microsoft has changed since he accepted
Gates's offer in 1980 to join the company, Ballmer said: ``We're
still into software for microprocessors, if that's what you mean.
Everything else has changed. But, you know, the culture hasn't
really changed in those 18 years. In fact, I'm struck by how
similar the place is to the time when I got here and we had only 27
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   From a financial standpoint, Microsoft's growth in the
intervening years has been good to Ballmer. Last year, averaging
65-hour work weeks, often on the road, he earned $587,000 in salary
and bonuses. At current market values, Ballmer's Microsoft stock is
worth around $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft wealth sweepstakes, that places him second only
to Gates, a former Harvard chum who has become the world's richest
man, and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, 45, who left the company
in 1982 and whose remaining stock holdings in the software firm are
now worth about $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   These high valuations have had an impact on how Microsoft is
viewed inside the company, within the industry and in the world at
large.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120 sites on the World Wide Web are devoted to bashing
Gates, often using the technology Microsoft sells and, in the case
of the Internet Explorer browser, gives away. Among them is a
``Bill Gates Personal Wealth Clock,'' which changes with the price
of Microsoft stock and which currently stands at about $52 billion.

<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For the debut of Windows 98, Ballmer's marketers have crafted a
metaphor: If high technology travels down an open road of
innovation, then Windows 98 will be that major thoroughfare. The
updated operating system will be advertised with ``Route 98''
signs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dataquest, a leading independent analyst of software
trends for personal computers, estimated that Windows 98 upgrade
shipments will total 5.5 million units this year. By 1999,
Dataquest projects, Microsoft will enjoy a 95 percent share in
operating system shipments for all computers throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to reflect on how Microsoft has changed since he accepted
Gates's offer in 1980 to join the company, Ballmer said: ``We're
still into software for microprocessors, if that's what you mean.
Everything else has changed. But, you know, the culture hasn't
really changed in those 18 years. In fact, I'm struck by how
similar the place is to the time when I got here and we had only 27
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   From a financial standpoint, Microsoft's growth in the
intervening years has been good to Ballmer. Last year, averaging
65-hour work weeks, often on the road, he earned $587,000 in salary
and bonuses. At current market values, Ballmer's Microsoft stock is
worth around $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft wealth sweepstakes, that places him second only
to Gates, a former Harvard chum who has become the world's richest
man, and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, 45, who left the company
in 1982 and whose remaining stock holdings in the software firm are
now worth about $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   These high valuations have had an impact on how Microsoft is
viewed inside the company, within the industry and in the world at
large.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120 sites on the World Wide Web are devoted to bashing
Gates, often using the technology Microsoft sells and, in the case
of the Internet Explorer browser, gives away. Among them is a
``Bill Gates Personal Wealth Clock,'' which changes with the price
of Microsoft stock and which currently stands at about $52 billion.

ASKING SOFTWARE TO RECOMMEND A GOOD BOOK
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clerking at a New Haven book shop one afternoon 15 years ago, a
novelist named Kitty Florey watched two regular customers approach
the display racks, their faces furrowed with consternation. ``I get
tired of these after a while,'' one said, indicating a stack of
best sellers, ``but I don't know what else to read.'' Ms. Florey
bounded across the Oriental rugs to propose a few titles by Anne
Tyler and Barbara Kingsolver. Her manager, just a pace behind,
suggested Ms. Florey's own latest book.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning in the TriBeCa offices of a software company
called Muze, the same Kitty Florey typed into a computer the
catalog information and plot summary of ``The Man in the Box,''
Thomas Moran's novel about an Austrian family that shelters a
Jewish doctor from the Nazis. Then she listed the book under such
categories as ``caring and caretaking,'' ``fugitives'' and
``Holocaust survivors.'' All the material became part of Muze's
data base, which some 300 bookstores offer to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Florey's evolution parallels American society's: from an
old-fashioned, personal brand of taste-making to a high-tech
variety made possible by the advent of what is known as agent
software. This software, sometimes described with the more specific
term ``collaborative filtering,'' compiles information that
consumers provide about their taste in the arts and past buying
patterns and analyzes the data to recommend books, videos, films
and CDs. It is used by such major retailers as the online bookstore
Amazon.com and the Columbia House music club. Microsoft recently
paid $40 million to acquire the agent-software company Firefly, and
Amazon.com just leased Muze's software for use in its new online
music store.
</P>
<P>
   As such developments demonstrate, artificial intelligence is
offering an alternative to _ or even a replacement for _
flesh-and-blood arbiters of culture. The consumer who decades ago
took cues from a critic like Edmund Wilson or a mass-audience
magazine like the original Life can now click on Muze or Firefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us feel a little uncomfortable,'' says Ms. Florey, the
senior fiction editor at Muze, ``because we all come from a
background of studying literature and believing great books are
beyond categorization. At the same time, you feel like you're
opening it up to people who wouldn't go down that path otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Florey's own divided feelings frame the larger debate. For
the creators and buyers of agent software, it gives consumers a
matchless tool for navigating through an overwhelming number of
choices to find art they will cherish. For critics, including those
conversant with computer technology, collaborative-filtering
software threatens to take the idiosyncratic process of forming an
esthetic and replace it with the soulless logic of code.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are losing their ability to really reason for
themselves, to look at things for themselves,'' says Patricia
Galvis Assmus, a fine-arts professor who directs the Center for
Research in Art and Technology at the University of Massachusetts.
``In one sense, collaborative filtering is not that different from
a bibliography at the end of a scholarly report. And that's fine.
The problem is that people rely on it solely and don't take the
initiative beyond the software. In this country, people are so
enthused with technology that browsing a library just isn't as
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Assmus' vision does not persuade fellow scholars like David
Thornburn, a professor of literature and director of the
Communications Forum seminar series at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. He has been pleased to click onto Amazon.com's Web
site and find its Netperception software presenting him with book
titles based on those he most recently bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel as if cultural value is threatened by this
software,'' Thornburn says. ``It seems not to have a judging
function but a consumer-advice function. I had bought `Cold
Mountain' for a gift, and the software was intelligent enough not
to offer me every other best seller. It didn't recommend Tom
Clancy. It recommended `The God of Small Things,''' also a first
novel of literary distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It made that distinction,'' he added. ``It was accurate about
the things I enjoy reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent software arose in the late 1980s from a mixture of
commercial and cultural motives. John Hey, later one of the
founders of the software company Likeminds, started out as an MIT
student and movie buff who wanted to be steered to films without
having to learn plot details from reviews or conversations. Hey
invented two forms of collaborative-filtering software, installed
them in kiosks and sold the kiosks to video stores in the Cambridge
area. The store's customers put in their ratings of films they
rented, forming a reservoir of data that could be matched to the
personal preferences entered by any user.
</P>
<P>
   Muze developed a different approach. It began by leasing and
digitizing printed catalogs of music and books. Then it hired
people like Ms. Florey to cross-reference the entries by themes,
categories, genres and subgenres. These range from such
conventional terms as literary/avant-garde to those Muze itself has
coined like galactic empires and space opera. Lately, the Muze
staff has passionately debated whether to add the designation angst
bunny for what Ms. Florey described as ``young women in the Village
with black clothes and lots of body piercings.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such discussions underscore the fact that the intelligence
behind the software is not artificial; the raw material was
provided by human beings, whether customers typing in their book
preferences or editors in computer companies deciding how to
categorize a particular book. What the software does, in computer
jargon, is ``find patterns in the noise'' _ use mathematical
formulas to determine which books or films or CD's had the greatest
probability of matching either a consumer's stated preferences or
actual record of purchases. Although not all retailers choose to do
so, they can have the software adjusted to put extra emphasis on
particular titles.
</P>
<P>
   In whatever variation, collaborative-filtering software surged
with the refinement of the Internet and the World Wide Web in the
early 1990s. Likeminds, for instance, went on line for such clients
as Columbia House, the cable network Cinemax and the Web site
Moviecritic.com. What customers got was convenience in choosing a
product; what retailers got was an identity and a marketing profile
of each buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Technological innovation, though, tells only half the story of
the agent-software bonanza. The software entered the cultural
marketplace just as the power of highbrow critics, general interest
magazines and television networks unchallenged by cable was
dissipating.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons for the mandarins and the shapers of
opinion in the past is that there were limitations on the
availability of information to people,'' says Stephen Kanzler, the
president and chief executive officer of Likeminds. ``Fifty years
ago, even 20 years ago, how many people actually got to go to the
Louvre or the Metropolitan Museum of Art? So if there was an
opinion needed on a work of art or a book or a cultural trend, we
were dependent on the people who had access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the information is ubiquitous. You can look at the Louvre
collection on the Net. The sifting of information and opinion is
the problem. It's the old drinking-from-the-fire-hose problem. How
do you sort through it? An agent can help a consumer get what he
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Florey of Muze speaks more bluntly. Speaking of the New
Haven bookstore, she says: ``At a place like the Foundry, we didn't
need machines. The guy who owned it prided himself on knowing. At
the superstores, there's nobody you can ask. They don't have
booksellers who make their career out of loving books.''
</P>
<P>
   But precisely because agent software intends to cater to
personal taste as a commercial strategy _ Likeminds' slogan is
``Every individual a market'' _ scholars like Carol Gigliotti of
Ohio State University criticize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the Firefly Web site, you'll see this phrase,
`loyal and dynamic communities built on shared interest,''' says
Gigliotti, a professor in the Advanced Computing Center for the
Arts and Design and the project director for an online journal
about computer ethics. ``What these dynamic communities are about
is brand loyalty. They're not about an idea, a value, a spiritual
concept. They're about the market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace, where the prevailing political philosophy seems
to be libertarian, the notion of a vast bazaar of information is
populist. Even as a literary critic himself, Thornburn of MIT
contends that the pre-eminent cultural critics of mid-century
America performed a disservice by creating ``a false dichotomy
between high culture and popular culture,'' stranding art forms
like jazz. Agent software, in comparison, weights any and every
opinion equally.
</P>
<P>
   Which is part of what disturbs Dr. Gigliotti. ``There's a big
difference between knowledge and wisdom,'' she says. ``And a great
deal of what's on the Web has to do with information, which is
confused with knowledge, which is confused with wisdom. Wisdom can
understand knowledge and decipher information. We're allowing a
very random, nonexperiential machine to say what we should like.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate proceeds, Kitty Florey writes novels by night and
enters data by day, her office shelves crowded with the London
Review of Books, the Threepenny Review and a cheese sandwich on
whole wheat. A few carrels over works Molly Siemers, the
genre-fiction editor. As an English major at Vassar, Ms. Siemers
wrote a thesis on the author Djuna Barnes' refusal to be
categorized for her blackness or lesbianism.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, Ms. Florey and Ms. Siemers have paused in their
categorizing duties to determine which books carried the most
cross-references. The winner, as well as they can reckon, is ``Tom
Jones,'' without about 150. Proust also ranks high, as does
``Middlemarch.'' And there are several unexpected competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given my own books dozens of themes,'' Ms. Florey says.
``I'm shameless.''

FATHERLY ADVICE FROM HOMER, HANK AND GRANDPA PICKLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's just a cartoon character, but Hank Hill of the Fox series
``King of the Hill'' knows enough about fatherhood to have written
a book, ``The Boy Ain't Right,'' out just in time for Father's Day.
In it, Hank offers his advice for raising a child _ specifically, a
son, because Hank wouldn't have any idea what to do with a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, other cartoon dads have sons, too, and we wanted to
hear what they had to say, even if we had to make some of it up.
</P>
<P>
   Our panel: Homer Simpson, the well-meaning, beer-swilling,
doughnut-loving doofus from ``The Simpsons''; Grandpa Pickles from
``Rugrats''; Dr. Jonathan Katz, the deadpan psychiatrist from
Comedy Central's ``Dr. Katz''; Duckman, the irresponsibly lecherous
private detective from USA Network's ``Duckman.''
</P>
<P>
   Their wisdom:
</P>
<P>
   Why is the sky blue?
</P>
<P>
   Hank Hill:0BN UMe that's one of the colors of the Dallas Cowboys
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Simpson: Can't talk _ eating.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa Pickles: In my day, the sky was bluer than this _ blue
as blue could be.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katz: Ben, you're 21 years old and all you do is lie around
all day. I'm not entirely convinced that you've ever seen the sky
long enough to determine that it actually ``is'' blue.
</P>
<P>
   Duckman: What are you, Carl Sagan all of a sudden? Shut up and
go watch TV!
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Is there a God?
</P>
<P>
   Hank Hill: Yes _ and he's watching everything you do.
Everything!
</P>
<P>
   Homer Simpson: Oh, yeah. Perfect teeth. Nice smell. A class act
all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa Pickles: Is the pope Catholic?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katz: Yes, and I pray every day that he will give you life.
</P>
<P>
   Duckman: I bet those mindless pod people who believe in that
kind of thing still wait up for the tooth fairy! They shouldn't _
because he's in a Turkish jail!
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Where do babies come from?
</P>
<P>
   Hank Hill: Ask me again when you're 21, Bobby. By that time
you'll be married, and you'll need to know.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Simpson: Bart, you're too young to know that they come
from your mother and I having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa Pickles: That's a good question, son. Go ask your
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katz: (Sigh.) Ben, you know those videos you watch all day
... ?
</P>
<P>
   Duckman: ... Uh, hey, Doc, can I borrow some of those videos?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   What do I do about bullies?
</P>
<P>
   Hank`H`ll: Kick their butts! And come and get me, and I'll kick
their dads' butts!
</P>
<P>
   Homer Simpson: First, you cry like a woman. Then, when he turns
away in disgust, you knock him down. Then, hit him in the back,
kick him in the ribs, and run. I9dpa Pickles: A man's gotta do,
what a man's gotta do.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katz: Sing this song: ``A boy, a bike, a heart so full/A
mom, a dad, and a little stuffed bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Duckman: Say, ``What the hell are you staring at?'' Then go hide
behind the nearest fat broad.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Can I borrow the car?
</P>
<P>
   Hank Hill: The car's OK, but keep your dang hands off the riding
mower!
</P>
<P>
   Homer Simpson: Do I have to get up? No? Then sure, knock
yourself out.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa Pickles: Only if you take me with you.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katz: Ben, you know a lot of the car manufacturers are
offering cars these days in exchange for money people have earned.
</P>
<P>
   Duckman: Uh, sure, just don't look in the trunk or the back
seat.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   How do I pick up women?
</P>
<P>
   Hank Hill: Uhhhhhhh ... wouldn't you rather just sell propane
and have them come to you?
</P>
<P>
   Homer Simpson: Pity. Ahhh, sweet pity. Where would my love life
be without it?
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa Pickles: Heh, heh, heh. You've come to the authority on
that one, son.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katz: Well, you know, Ben, they usually go for guys who are
employed and have their own cars. That would be a start.
</P>
<P>
   Duckman: There's no real technique, it just depends on how hard
you want to get slapped.

   Swimming in the Bluff
</P>
<P>
   At last it is possible to explore your nudist fantasies without
alarming fellow bathers. Rachel Crespin has created a flesh-toned
line of swimwear that makes beach bums look, well, naked. The suits
come in skin-matching shades for every ethnic group and in styles
ranging from string bikinis to this summer's popular one-shoulder
look.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crespin, a former fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar and
Vogue, got the idea a couple of years ago when she was visiting
friends upstate. ``I went to meet my boyfriend at the pool in
Woodstock, and everyone looked so golden and glowing,'' she said.
``As I got closer, I realized they were naked. I was so impressed!
I thought, wouldn't it be funny if . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Funny and sexy enough for Sports Illustrated to put the
almost-birthday suits in its swimsuit issue.

Fifth Avenue after that.

   Bigelow Goes Postal
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frustrated because your drugstore doesn't stock
garlic shampoo or J. Pickles hard-skin ointment? No worries. C.O.
Bigelow, the New York apothecary famous for its international
health and beauty products, is introducing a mail-order catalogue,
(800) 793-5433.
</P>
<P>
   After 160 years, the pharmacy at 414 Avenue of the Americas
(Ninth Street), where Mark Twain once filled prescriptions, is
offering by mail its ``apothecariana'': Portuguese soaps, T.
LeClerc powder, Boiron Camilia teething remedy. The catalogue was
created by popular demand when magazines, from Crain's New York
Business to Allure, cited Bigelow as a resource.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started calling, and we didn't know what to do with
them,'' Ian Ginsberg, an owner, said. ``We live in the best city in
the world, and we take it for granted that we can get sage-leaf
toothpaste. This catalogue helps us get it to the rest of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Sewing Circles
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tailored to a generation that can barely open a hotel
emergency sewing kit, Sew Fast Sew Easy at 147 W. 57th St. is a
school for needle dummies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to give back the techniques I learned from experts in
the fashion industry to these creative women who are rent-broke
with Prada taste,'' said Elissa Meyrich, a former sportswear
designer who opened the school in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers, artists, lawyers _ mostly women, ranging in age from 14
to 35 _ enroll to learn about making clothes to custom-fit their
style, budgets and bodies. A single three-hour class teaches how to
stitch up a chic nylon tote or crochet an evening bag (three nights
for a bikini). After four classes, even beginners can make a simple
skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Raffaele, a makeup artist, has graduated to the second of
the school's four levels and is hooked. ``I watch stylists fit
clothes all day with pins and clips, so I see that when clothes
really fit, they look a thousand times better,'' she said. ``The
skirt I made fits like a glove and looks expensive. I feel like a
Holly Hobby for the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   A Shady Deal on Guccis
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Downtowners who wouldn't be caught dead toting Louis
Vuitton knockoffs are embracing the newest Canal Street tourist
fodder: fake Gucci sunglasses. For $10 a pair (up to $170 less than
the real Gucci glasses), thrifty logo-maniacs are grabbing up
flashy pairs of brightly hued shades with gold interlocking G's a
la Lil' Kim, and the more authentic-looking Audrey Hepburn styles,
in black or tortoise.
</P>
<P>
   How to spot the phonies? Gucci won't comment for legal reasons.
But Robert Holmes, a fashion detective who sleuths for companies
with trademarks, explained how to identify them. ``A lot of the
counterfeit glasses have a gold G glued to them, which can be
popped off, and lettering that can be scratched off,'' he said.
``Gucci would never do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Uptown table vendors will try to pawn the glasses off as real,
Holmes said, while in Chinatown they assume buyers don't care if
they're fakes. Tom Sachs, an artist, keeps a pair for female
passengers on his Vespa. ``The great thing about buying them for
$10 is that when they go out of fashion, the sting isn't as hard,''
he said. ``The bad thing is you have to buy them four times because
they break.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody Hues
</P>
<P>
   Madonna and Naomi Campbell are women who are letting their
fingers do the talking with the first temperature-sensitive nail
polish, Polish Mood Shades. Its maker, Respect, says that each
two-tone polish switches colors as the wearer changes moods.
Bloated Blue becomes Pouty Pink, Gotta Have Chocolate turns to
Estrogen Emerald.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Darling, a model and a satisfied customer, reported that
the lacquer ``changes color when you talk about boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone likes this '90s rendition of the mood ring. A
Dayton Hudson store in Minneapolis recently pulled the polish off
its shelves because employees thought it was demeaning. But Jenai
Lane, Respect's president, said that PMS is meant to take ``the
negative names that women are often called and give them new,
positive meanings.'' ($12, available at 9 &AMP; Co., or from

<TEXT>
<P>
   My father never laid a hand on anyone in our home. The abuse he
committed was, instead, of the culinary variety. Growing up, I
would sit across from him at the table, offended to an almost
Oedipal level at his inability to leave my mother's cooking alone.
</P>
<P>
   He'd pour salad dressing on her lovingly prepared lemon chicken
or meatloaf. Then at dessert time, he'd rise from the table to
retrieve a trusty bottle of diet raspberry syrup to pour over
everything else, from Jell-O molds to cobblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gross,'' I'd mutter.
</P>
<P>
   It never stopped him. If, as the British proverb says, the first
service a child does his father is to make him feel foolish, my
services clearly were not wanted. ``Your father will eat
anything,'' my mother would say. ``Step on his foot, and he opens
his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't enough for him to enjoy his concoctions alone,
either. Others had to, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was gastronomic assault,'' one cousin recently recalled of
the ginger ale with apricot schnapps that Dad foisted on him. But
that was nothing. In my lifetime, I have seen everything from
coffee with milk and lemon (``very delicate flavor,'' Dad says) to
orange juice on cereal (``low-cholesterol breakfast'').
</P>
<P>
   Like a plumber with his box of tools, Dad travels with packets
in his wallet to improve upon whatever he is served. If my brother,
a formidable wine snob, pours him a serious cabernet or merlot, he
waits till nobody's looking, then sweetens it to taste. When he
isn't creating his delicacies at the table, he's inventing things
late at night, leaving them soaking in empty margarine tubs on the
kitchen counter, like so many science-fair projects.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he's into soaking strawberries and raisins in
Nutrasweet-ened water. It's a topping of sorts. ``Just taste it,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   I know it won't kill me. I know people eat far stranger things,
like each other, but somehow I can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Dad asks. Not long ago, it would have been easy to
tell him why not.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a world of peach wine coolers and raspberry microbrews,
it's harder. And of course, now that we have orange-flavored
Snapple and orange-flavored Stolichnaya, his habit of pouring
orange juice into tea seems as hip as the half-and-half (half iced
tea and half lemonade) now requested by Hollywood power lunchers.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that my father isn't a madman but a futurist in
beverages?
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between the age of Cool Whip and the age of Olestra,
it seems that the road has risen up to meet him. Like Aldous
Huxley, who accurately foresaw in ``Brave New World'' a society on
anti-depressants, Dad has anticipated a world of Cosmopolitans,
ice-blended mochas and pineapple salsa.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, I even find myself at expense-account lunches ordering
cognac with orange juice or at self-service markets mixing flavored
coffees to taste. The other day, when I didn't have tomato sauce, I
doctored some pasta with vinaigrette dressing and ketchup. My guest
loved it. I felt wickedly invigorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a boy of 14,'' Mark Twain wrote, ``my father was so
ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when
I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much he had learned in
seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for me, I guess. So Dad, now that I'm finally old
enough to know a thing or two, I not only forgive you your culinary
trespasses, I applaud them _ as long as I don't have to taste them.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Father's Day. Here's mud in your eye. And some Nutrasweet,
too.

FATHERLY ADVICE FROM HOMER, HANK AND GRANDPA PICKLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's just a cartoon character, but Hank Hill of the Fox series
``King of the Hill'' knows enough about fatherhood to have written
a book, ``The Boy Ain't Right,'' out just in time for Father's Day.
In it, Hank offers his advice for raising a child _ specifically, a
son, because Hank wouldn't have any idea what to do with a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, other cartoon dads have sons, too, and we wanted to
hear what they had to say, even if we had to make some of it up.
</P>
<P>
   Our panel: Homer Simpson, the well-meaning, beer-swilling,
doughnut-loving doofus from ``The Simpsons''; Grandpa Pickles from
``Rugrats''; Dr. Jonathan Katz, the deadpan psychiatrist from
Comedy Central's ``Dr. Katz''; Duckman, the irresponsibly lecherous
private detective from USA Network's ``Duckman.''
</P>
<P>
   Their wisdom:
</P>
<P>
   Why is the sky blue?
</P>
<P>
   Hank Hill: Because that's one of the colors of the Dallas
Cowboys uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Simpson: Can't talk _ eating.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa Pickles: In my day, the sky was bluer than this _ blue
as blue could be.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katz: Ben, you're 21 years old and all you do is lie around
all day. I'm not entirely convinced that you've ever seen the sky
long enough to determine that it actually ``is'' blue.
</P>
<P>
   Duckman: What are you, Carl Sagan all of a sudden? Shut up and
go watch TV!
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Is there a God?
</P>
<P>
   Hank Hill: Yes _ and he's watching everything you do.
Everything!
</P>
<P>
   Homer Simpson: Oh, yeah. Perfect teeth. Nice smell. A class act
all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa Pickles: Is the pope Catholic?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katz: Yes, and I pray every day that he will give you life.
</P>
<P>
   Duckman: I bet those mindless pod people who believe in that
kind of thing still wait up for the tooth fairy! They shouldn't _
because he's in a Turkish jail!
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Where do babies come from?
</P>
<P>
   Hank Hill: Ask me again when you're 21, Bobby. By that time
you'll be married, and you'll need to know.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Simpson: Bart, you're too young to know that they come
from your mother and I having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa Pickles: That's a good question, son. Go ask your
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katz: (Sigh.) Ben, you know those videos you watch all day
... ?
</P>
<P>
   Duckman: ... Uh, hey, Doc, can I borrow some of those videos?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   What do I do about bullies?
</P>
<P>
   Hank Hill: Kick their butts! And come and get me, and I'h, kick

A CENTURY OF ADVICE FOR DADS WHO COPED WITHOUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Ideas)  
(lb) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advice to mothers is as plentiful as air. There are hundreds of
books and thousands of old wives' tales. On top of that is the
daily unsolicited advice that mothers get from friends, relatives,
even strangers on the street.
</P>
<P>
   What about advice to fathers? Tucked into books for mothers
about what they should expect from their babies and children are
usually a few pages telling them what they should expect from
fathers (usually very little).
</P>
<P>
   There is also a growing shelf of books of advice for fathers:
books encouraging them to take a greater part in the children's
lives, books ordering them to take back their traditional roles and
books jokingly telling them how to handle their unpredictably moody
wives and children.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief (and very incomplete) sampling of some of this
century's wisdom about fathers and the advice that has been given
to them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; From minutes taken during a meeting of the Child Study
Association of America, 1910s: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was conceded that as a rule, fathers play no part in the
lives of child.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A joke told during the White House Conference on Child Health
and Protection, 1930: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The father was a traveling man only home on Sunday and the small
child went crying home to his mother, ``That man who is here on
Sundays spanked me!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dr. Benjamin Spock, in his ``Baby and Child Care,'' 1950s: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You can be a warm father and a real man at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bruno Bettelheim in ``The Uses of Enchantment,'' 1970s: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the usual course of family life, the father is often out of
the home, while the mother, having given birth to the child and
nursed him, continues to be heavily involved in all child care. As
a result, a boy can easily pretend that Father is not all that
important in his life. That is why replacement of an original
``good'' father by a bad stepfather is as rare in fairy tales as
the evil stepmother is frequent. Since fathers have typically given
much less attention to the child, it is not such a radical
disappointment when this father begins to stand in the child's way,
or to make demands of him. So the father who blocks the boy's
oedipal desires is not seen as an evil figure within the home, or
split into two figures, one good and one bad, as the mother often
is. Instead, the oedipal boy projects his frustrations and
anxieties onto a giant, monster, or dragon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tony Pastor, in ``Seven Promises of a Promise Keeper,'' 1990s: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you do is sit down with your wife and say
something like this: ``Honey, I've made a terrible mistake. I've
given you my role. I gave up leading this family, and I forced you
to take my place. Now I must reclaim that role.'' Don't
misunderstand what I'm saying here. I'm not suggesting that you ask
for your role back, I'm urging you to take it back. ... Be
sensitive. Listen. Treat the lady gently and lovingly. But lead!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; David Blankenhorn in ``Fatherless America,'' 1990s: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It strikes me that what really makes a man feel like he's being
a good man is going to lead him when the baby's born to get
panic-stricken over the issue of insurance. Why do men do that? Why
do women seem to become completely absorbed in caring for this new
infant and wanting to remake the world in order to have the
immediate needs met of this wonderful thing? You can say, that's
terrible and men need to be rewired so they think the same way. Or
maybe God wants it this way.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mark Bryan, in ``The Prodigal Father,'' 1990s: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When a father is separated from his children, a piece of himself
is ripped away, and he is haunted by that deep inner knowledge that
somewhere, somehow, this missing piece must be regained. ... I call
this marrow-deep memory the Haunting. It is a dramatic term, I
know. ... When a man loses a child to divorce, there are a million
small losses: his daughter's first dance class, his son's
nightmare, the braces, the bikes, the Band-Aids. His friends and
family often act as if he brought the loss on himself. ... The
first step in healing the Haunting is to acknowledge that it
exists. We need to come out of our denial about it and look as
squarely as we can at the emotions we are feeling.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Arlene Eisenberg, Heidi E. Murkoff and Sandee E. Hathaway, in
``What to Expect When You're Expecting,'' 1990s: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Act Pregnant. You don't have to show up for work in maternity
clothes or start drinking a quart of milk a day. But you can do
your wife's pregnancy exercise routine with her; give up junk food
for nine months; quit smoking, if you're a smoker. And when someone
offers you a drink, tell them, ``No thanks,'' we're pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; James Douglas Barron, in ``She's Having a Baby and I'm Having a
Breakdown,'' 1990s: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When you come home from work, kiss your wife and baby before you
do anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your camera loaded with film and readily available.
</P>
<P>
   Compliment your wife often.
</P>
<P>
   Hold your baby's foot or hand while he's breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Don't compare your sex life with everyone else's.

CLINTON SAYS NORMAL TRADE WITH CHINA YIELDS JOBS FOR AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton defended his decision to continue
normal trade ties with China, saying Friday that expanded U.S.
trade with the hard-charging nation of 1.2 billion means jobs for
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, noting a potentially vast market for U.S. products in
China, said the Chinese economy is ``growing _ and the American
people ought to be able to get the benefit of selling to the
Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke shortly after White House Press Secretary Mike
McCurry took a verbal swipe at congressional critics, including
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for opposing Clinton's June 3 request
for a year-long extension of the so-called ``most favored nation''
trading status that has been approved without interruption by four
American presidents since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton leaves next Wednesday for a 10-day, five-city visit to
China _ the first by an American president since Chinese communist
authorities cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators in
Tiananmen Square in 1989, leaving between 400 to 800 dead and
hundreds more imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the United States has far deeper disputes with
other nations with which the United States maintains normal trade
ties, known as ``most favored nation'' trading status.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that there is ``no principled, grounded
distinction'' between U.S. trade with China and U.S. trade with a
variety of unnamed nations with which the United States has
``serious disagreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``Keep in mind, we're not asking for anything
special for China here.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said ``most people don't respond very well to threats
and to isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conceded that economic sanctions yielded results in
forcing white-governed South Africa to turn over power to black
South Africans as well in forcing Iraqi compliance with
U.N.-mandated weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   But China is ``a case where I think we've got far more to gain
with a constructive engagement,'' Clinton said, adding: ``It's a
very great country with enormous potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman challenged congressional critics, saying
that the Republican Congress has been putting up ``isolationist
blinders'' that potentially imperil American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said ``a number of members of Congress'' are insisting
``that we should suspend normal trade relations with China _ which
is the thermonuclear device of economic diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   To threaten suspension of normal trading ties ``and to use it as
a penalty or to compel certain types of behavior is a very risky
thing to do,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry added that critics who urge an end to normal trade
relations with China ``are exactly those who are favoring
isolationism versus engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat, is a leading congressional
critic of administration policies toward China.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Pelosi's contention that China must earn normal
trading status with the United States by honoring human rights,
McCurry replied: ``That is purely and simply an isolationist view.
That is exactly how you isolate China in seeking that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry added: ``She would isolate China economically by way of
trying to compel different types of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Pelosi issued a statement saying that when Clinton and
``his people resort to characterizing those who oppose his failed
China policy as isolationist, they couldn't be further from
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said the U.S. trade deficit with China during the Clinton
presidency will exceed $250 billion by the end of the year. Pelosi
said China continues to sell technology for weapons of mass
destruction to other nations as well as repress human rights in
China and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has no real progress to show for his failed
China policy,'' Pelosi said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say about 120,000 American jobs are
dependent on U.S. trade with China, a nation of 1.2 billion with
one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will seek to ``create more interest in Congress'' in
expanding economic and political ties with China during the foray
to China, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress sometimes puts these isolationist blinders up and
they don't see these global problems as being connected to the
livelihoods of American families and the problems they're facing
when they sit around the kitchen table and worry about their
futures,'' McCurry said. ``We have to drive that point home.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry noted America's deepening trade deficit with Asia due to
the inability of faltering Asian economies to import U.S. products
and the ever-cheaper prices of Asian goods in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all the more reason why we've got to act in a very
disciplined way to address the needs of these economies,'' McCurry
said. ``It really is our livelihoods that are at stake _ not just
theirs. The president will be making that case during his trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has 90 days to vote to disapprove Clinton's extension
of normal trading status. The House is expected to take the initial
congressional action on Clinton's request after it returns from the
July 4 recess.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that the U.S. trade
deficit soared to $14.5 billion in April _ a new record for the
month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, concerned about the plight of Asian economies, ordered
the purchase of Japanese yen earlier this week in an effort to stem
the declining value of the Japanese currency, a situation that
threatened to escalate the 10-month old Asian crisis.

 EMILY WHALEY, 87, CHARLESTON GARDENER AND WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emily Whaley, a South Carolina woman with a green thumb and such
an eye for color that she helped show flowering Charleston there
was bloom beyond azaleas and camellias and turned her backyard into
one of the nation's most acclaimed private gardens, died June 15 at
her summer home in Flat Rock, N.C. She was 87 and had become
something of celebrity since the publication of a memoir, ``Mrs.
Whaley and her Charleston Garden,'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   Her family said the cause was a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   No one would mistake Mrs. Whaley's garden for, say, Longwood
Gardens, but as home gardens go, the one she maintained for more
than 50 years on a 30-foot by 100-foot plot behind her narrow 1754
white clapboard house at 58 Church Street, a block from the harbor
in Charleston's historic district, has been a perennial eye-popper.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things it has been featured in books by Rosemary
Vaerey and other garden writers and has been a fixture on the
Historic Charleston Foundation's annual garden tours.
</P>
<P>
   The garden has been considered special partly because it was
laid out in 1941 by a renowned landscape architect, Loutrell
Briggs, who took full advantage of a brick carriage house, a couple
of mighty oaks and a magnolia tree on neighboring properties as
backdrops of opportunity for a design that included five distinct
gardens, or ``rooms,'' as Mrs. Whaley called them.
</P>
<P>
   But mainly it was because Mrs. Whaley filled the Briggs design
with repeated flair, adding a statue here, ripping out a bed of
plants there and forever experimenting with new plants in varied
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   That was not, to be sure, because she hadn't gotten it right the
first time, but because her tastes changed every few years.
</P>
<P>
   Until her book, billed as ``a conversation with William
Baldwin,'' a South Carolina novelist, was published by Algonquin
Books last year, Mrs. Whaley's fame had been largely local, but
well established.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first local gardeners to dare to plant for year-round
blooms in a city whose signature azaleas and camellias lose their
blossoms in the torrid Charleston summers, Mrs. Whaley helped
establish a trend of planting perennials like roses, gerbera
daisies and hydrangeas, in front of the towering azalea and
camellia shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   She was also one of the first to open her garden to the public
to raise money for charities, a practice that attracted some 3,000
paying visitors a year and led some to call her garden the most
visited private garden in the country.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Whaley, an accomplished pianist and ballroom dancer who
helped start the Cotillion, a dancing school that has become a
Charleston social fixture, and once taught chess, gardening came
more than naturally. It was, she liked to say, in her genes.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a country doctor, Mrs. Whaley was born Emily
Kershaw in Pinopolis, a village about 40 miles west of Charleston,
and spent part of her childhood at her mother's family's Belvidere
Plantation, helping her mother tend a 13-acre garden even as her
mother had helped her mother garden.
</P>
<P>
   After attending the University of Georgia she married Ben Scott
Whaley, who became a prominent Charleston lawyer, served a term in
the state legislature, was United States Attorney for Charleston in
the Truman Administration and played a crucial role in creating his
wife's garden.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife confined to bed during a difficult pregnancy in
the summer of 1941, Mr. Whaley asked if there was some special
present she would like. She said yes, a garden designed by Loutrell
Briggs.
</P>
<P>
   It took a few years for Mrs. Whaley to turn the Briggs blueprint
into an actual garden, but once she got it growing, she did not
neglect it.
</P>
<P>
   Working for several hours a day with her longtime assistant,
Junior Robinson, she was a demon for pruning, a necessity in such a
small garden with narrow brick walks.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whaley was not sentimental about her plantings. Let a row
of Italian cypresses grow too tall for her tastes and whack, they
would be gone.
</P>
<P>
   A woman so attuned to the subtleties of nature that she was
forever commenting on the weather and could become ecstatic over
the feel of a gentle breeze on the back of her neck, Mrs. Whaley,
if her book can be trusted, seemed comfortable speaking in
epigrams.
</P>
<P>
   A secluded garden bench, for example, was ``a place to invite
your soul for a visit.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her love of gardening, it was hardly her only love or
her only talent. She also, its seems, had a way with the stove.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Algonquin is bringing out a second Whaley
collaboration with Baldwin, a book of recipes and family stories,
``Mrs. Whaley Entertains.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whaley, whose husband died in 1987, is survived by three
daughters, Emily Whipple, Anne Le Clercq and Martha Adams, all of
Charleston, and seven grandchildren.  &QL;

and other impurities may be leaching lead into glasses of water.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of 16 under-the-sink filters found that nine
contained brass parts that leached lead at levels above those
considered safe under California's tough anti-toxics law.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the filtration systems _ Omni and Franke _ leached lead
into water at 60 to 71 times the allowable level, according to a
study by the University of North Carolina's Environmental Quality
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that this product is something that people buy
specifically because it's going to protect them from lead,'' said
Michael Green, executive director of the Center for Environmental
Health, the San Francisco non-profit organization that commissioned
the study and released the data Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Franke, a North Wales, Pa., company that
sells several hundred filters each year in California, said it
could not dispute the results and would immediately conduct its own
tests. In the meantime, the company is recalling its under-the-sink
Uniflow water filtration system.
</P>
<P>
   The filtration systems cost $75 to $250.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently can contaminate the water if the small faucets
installed at the sink are made of brass, which contains varying
levels of lead that can leach into water, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   Lead has long been documented as a poison that retards
development in children and damages nervous and other systems in
adults.
</P>
<P>
   In the sampling of 16 of about 50 brands, researchers found that
nine contributed lead to the water above the daily exposure
permitted by California's Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking Water
and Toxic Substances Enforcement Act of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The filters manufactured by Omni and Franke added lead at levels
71 times and 60 times, respectively, higher than the state's
allowable level, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The product in question will be tested by an independent
laboratory in California to that state's Proposition 65 protocol,''
said Tom Smith Jr., division manager of Franke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until that testing is complete, and the results confirm that
Franke's Uniflow product is in compliance with (the proposition's)
limits, Franke is withdrawing the Uniflow product line from the
market. The company will accept the return of that unit from any
concerned consumer and refund the purchase price.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Ellison, president of Omni, said the Hammond, Ind.-based
corporation ``will investigate the test protocol, which is outside
the industry standards, and if there is any valid concern raised by
the results, Omni will do what is necessary to make sure the public
is protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Franke and Omni said their products were certified by the
National Sanitation Foundation, which oversees the filtration
industry's quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the results of the study, the Center for Environmental
Health on June 10 filed a lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court
against Omni, alleging that its filtration unit violates
Proposition 65.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said in an interview that ``Omni has always obeyed the
rules, and it's extremely unfair to drag a good company's name down
to get what they're after. The Model OT-2 already has been replaced
by a newer model, and we're currently a month away from introducing
a non-brass faucet.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Center for Environmental Health also said
they would sue Franke if the company did not replace its brass
faucets.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they would contact the seven other companies that
exceeded the state's allowable lead level in the University of
North Carolina study, asking for a switch to non-leaded faucets.
</P>
<P>
   The seven are Ametek, Amway, Aqua-Pure, Ecowater, Equinox, QMP
and Water Boss. Ametek, the largest manufacturer of the filtration
systems, already has agreed to switch to lead-free faucets, the
environmental group said.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the Environmental Quality Institute tested the
brands in a three-week test similar to one designed by the National
Sanitation Foundation, measuring water after it stands in the
system for 10 minutes, 30 minutes, two hours and 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lead leaches in very fast. In 10 minutes, you get about 26
percent of the lead that builds up over 16 hours,'' said Richard
Maas, research director at the North Carolina institute. ``What
that tells you is there's going to be a slug of lead almost every
time they are used.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that already use lead-free faucets include Calistoga,
Cuno, General Ecology, Kinetico and W.T.C. Ecomaster, the
environmental group said.

MAZDA'S REMADE MIATA IMPROVES ORIGINAL ROADSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The old adage ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it'' often applies
to the world of automotive design, which is why Mazda took a real
chance when it remade the popular Miata roadster for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But I have to agree with the gushing publicity material that
Mazda included with the test vehicle I drove last week. By golly,
they did improve the car, and they didn't mess anything up.
</P>
<P>
   This new model still looks like a Miata, but one that apparently
has been working out at the gym in its spare time. Its muscles are
bulging all over, giving it a more masculine appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The hood and fenders have bulges and curves the older model
didn't have, and the sides are more sculpted. Gone are the cute
hideaway headlights, replaced by oval lights on each side of a
larger grille.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive appearance is designed to bring more male buyers
into the Miata fold. The previous version, which debuted in 1989,
appealed more to women. The new model is less cute and more brute,
which apparently is what men want, Mazda research showed.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the new style is more an answer to the competition
from the equally muscular BMW Z3 than just an attempt to shift to
more male customers. The base Z3 costs just a few thousand dollars
more than a loaded Miata and has more snob appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But thank goodness Mazda didn't jack up the price of the Miata
after restyling it. It's still the only affordable roadster on the
market, with its base price of $19,770.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is slighty more powerful in the new model: 140
horsepower vs. last year's 132. That's due in part to a new
cylinder head for the 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. It has
larger, straighter intake and exhaust ports for improved air flow.
</P>
<P>
   The extra power really isn't all that noticeable, though. There
is adequate but not impressive acceleration, but power isn't what
the Miata is all about. It's a driver's car, not a racer's, and its
best attributes are its tight, nimble roadhandling and the freedom
that the occupants feel with the top lowered and their hair
whipping in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Miata takes curves like it was glued to them, thanks to the
four-wheel, double-wishbone independent suspension. The new
shorter-throw five-speed manual transmission adds fun to the
driving experience. And the Miata maintains its rear-wheel drive, a
necessity for a true roadster.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who just have to have an automatic, there is a
four-speed, electronically controlled gearbox available. But the
automatics are rare and hard to find because most people don't want
them. You'll appreciate the automatic the most if you have a long
daily commute in stop-and-go traffic. Except for that, the manual
is the best way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda has strengthened the Miata's body without adding weight,
giving the car a more solid feel on bumps and bounces. There's just
not as much give in the body as before.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Miata has dual front air bags, there is an
ignition-key-operated, cut-off switch for the passenger air bag on
the lower center of the dash. I found that convenient for taking my
6-month-old granddaughter for her first ride in a Miata. You risk
an infant's life if you put her on the front passenger side without
disabling the airbag _ even with a rear-facing safety seat.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few major convenience features that were lacking on
the predecessor. The rear window is glass (with a defroster built
in), and unlike the older model, the window doesn't have to be
unzipped to lower the manual top. Just flip the catches on top of
the windshield and push back with one hand, and the top goes down
easily. It's also easily raised with one hand even while sitting in
the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Trunk space has increased 44 percent to 5/1 cubic feet, finally
making it large enough to hold at least one set of golf clubs.
Forget big suitcases, though. There is a package shelf behind the
seats for extra stowage, however.
</P>
<P>
   Miatas are offered with five options packages, beginning with a
simple one that adds just speed-sensitive power steering and wheel
trim rings. Our test car came with the touring package ($1,100),
which included the power steering as well as power windows and
mirrors, 14-inch alloy wheels and a three-spoke leather-wrapped
steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The popular-equipment package adds all of the above as well as a
Torsen limited-slip differential (manual transmission only), cruise
control, power antenna, wide-range speakers, power door locks and a
special windbreaker behind the seats. The windblocker limits the
flow of air into the passenger compartment, allowing the car to be
driven comfortably with the top down in cooler weather.
</P>
<P>
   The most luxurious model has the leather package, which includes
most of the above as well as 15-inch alloy wheels, tan leather
seats and interior trim, a tan vinyl top and a great Bose
AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc audio system with dual 200-watt
amplifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Base models come with an in-dash AM/FM/compact-disc unit with
clock, cloth sport bucket seats, remote fuel and trunk releases,
dual body color mirrors, styled steel wheels, rack-and-pinion
steering, four-wheel power disc brakes and a center console with
lockable storage compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Air-conditioning is a $900 option that was included on our test
car. The only other extra was carpeted floor mats ($80). Total
sticker was $22,300, including $450 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Other available options include a removable hard top and a
cassette player. Antilock brakes are optional, but they are
available only with the manual transmission, popular equipment
package and Bose audio system.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 25 miles per gallon in the city and
29 on the highway, which is pretty frugal for such a fun little
car. The tank holds 12.7 gallons of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   A Cadillac roadster? General Motors plans to roll out a two-seat
Cadillac roadster built on a modified Corvette chassis and carrying
the Northstar V-8 engine, the trade weekly Automotive News reported
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said the vehicle could debut at this summer's Paris
Auto Show, but might not be ready until the North American
International Auto Show in Detroit in January.
</P>
<P>
   It would share a chassis with the fifth-generation Corvette, but
would have a different body and drivetrain. The Caddy, which would
be the GM division's first two-seater since the Italian-designed
Allante was discontinued in 1993, would be 11 inches shorter than
the 'Vette, but with a five-inch-longer wheelbase, the magazine
said.
</P>
<P>
   NEW GRAND CHEROKEE: Chrysler Corp. says it will unveil its new
Jeep Grand Cherokee on Wednesday (June 16) at Detroit's Cobo Hall,
the site of the North American International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
   Some of you might remember that Cobo Hall is where the original
Grand Cherokee made its debut by dramatically ramming through a
plate glass window.
</P>
<P>
   Photos of the Grand Cherokee, meanwhile, have been posted on the
Internet for several weeks now, much to Chrysler's chagrin.

WHILE THE ARTS RISE, CRITICS WANE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These should be the best of times for critics. The arts in
America are exploding, culture has been democratized and just about
anything can be called ``art.''
</P>
<P>
   Who else but the professional critic has the expertise and the
perspicacity to go through it all, to determine what is art and
what is a masquerade, and to explain why?
</P>
<P>
   Yet in today's highly commercialized society, where distinctions
between high culture and low have become blurred, celebrities often
hold as much sway as critics, at least in determining popular
success.
</P>
<P>
   Book publishers crave a push from Oprah Winfrey or Don Imus,
while Broadway turns to Rosie O'Donnell, an unabashedly uncritical
booster, to give a show a lift. The fact that Andrew Lloyd Webber
collects Victorian art helped revive interest in artists like
Edward Burne-Jones (who now has an exhibition at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art). And Hollywood, with help from eager television
producers, editors of glossy magazines and reviewers happy to
provide gushing ad blurbs, can now generate a flood of glowing
publicity that often drowns out serious critiques.
</P>
<P>
   Put that all together with the proliferation of cable television
channels, talk shows, Internet sites and magazines that dote on
celebrities, and it is no wonder part of the critic's role has been
usurped.
</P>
<P>
   But does the rise of the celebrity taste maker, who functions
more as booster than as judge, mean the decline of the serious
critic? And if critics are less read and less heeded in the
commercial arena and perhaps even among the cultural elite, who or
what is to blame?
</P>
<P>
   These questions are starting to cause considerable debate among
critics who publish in academic journals and those who write for
newspapers and magazines. The answers so far focus not only on
society's commercialism, but also on importance of young audiences
that disdain authority figures and on the critics themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Much academic criticism, of course, has long been written off as
impenetrable and irrelevant. But now a small but growing cadre
worries that critics who write for wider audiences are losing
influence, too, leaving the mass market in charge of defining what
is good and what is bad art.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some artists and critics argue, no one wields a
singular influence like Clement Greenberg, for example, who
championed Abstract Expressionists like Jackson Pollack; or Brooks
Atkinson, who raised awareness of serious American dramatists like
Eugene O'Neill, or Pauline Kael, who made the reputations of
directors like Martin Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of critics think they have power, and it's news to them
that people aren't listening to them,'' said Maurice Berger, who
recently edited ``The Crisis of Criticism'' (The New Press, 1998).
Berger, a senior fellow at the Vera List Center for Art and
Politics at the New School, hopes the collection of articles by
writers like Joyce Carol Oates, Bell Hooks and Wayne Koestenbaum, a
professor at the City University of New York, will set off alarms
in the critical world.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dickstein, the director of the Center for the Humanities
at the City University of New York and the author of ``Double
Agent: The Critic and Society'' (Oxford University Press, 1992),
about literary criticism, would agree with that hope. Although he
does not believe that there is a crisis, he said that criticism is
even more consequential now than in the past precisely because
culture and commerce are so intertwined, particularly in areas like
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest of the people who are doing the marketing is in
producing products that are floating on a sea of hype,'' he said.
``Only when you read a serious review do you see the issues
underneath. Criticism plays a very important role in keeping people
honest. Otherwise things will be hyped out of sight and reduced to
the lowest common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Criticism is especially helpful with avant-garde art or when
the arts are changing,'' he added. ``There are things that don't
make sense to people without reviews.'' Turning to history, he
cites George Balanchine, whose choreography made shapes in space,
like an abstract painting, instead of telling a story: ``Critics
helped expose the public to the subtle things he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he sees no need for hand-wringing, Dickstein did say that
critics have lost some power to influence public taste, as did
Michael G. Kammen, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who wrote
``The Lively Arts: Gilbert Seldes and the Transformation of
Cultural Criticism in the United States'' (Oxford University Press,
1996), among other books. ``There has been,'' he said, ``a steady
diminution over the last 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The slide stems, in part, from demographics and the youth
culture. Joe Roth, who as the chairman of Walt Disney Studios
decides what movies get made and orchestrates the high-octane
campaigns to sell them, has noted a difference among generations.
Younger audiences, who go to movies more frequently than their
elders, prefer to make up their own minds based on a film's buzz,
not reviews.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several critics cite the money-driven market economy, which
defines a high-quality movie as one that does well at the box
office not one that offers a powerful script or fine acting, as the
source of critical malaise. From Nielsen ratings to best-seller
lists, a market gauge exists for virtually every arts field.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics think part of the problem is self-inflicted. ``The
Crisis of Criticism,'' for example, was at least partly inspired by
an internecine incident: Arlene Croce, the dance critic, wrote a
piece for The New Yorker in December 1995 explaining that she
declined to see and review a performance by the black, gay,
HIV-positive choreographer Bill T. Jones because it included video
and audio tapes of people terminally ill with cancer and AIDS.
``Victim art,'' she called it, a prime example how culture had been
politicized beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The article met with swift reaction, pro and con, not only from
readers but also from Ms. Oates, who defended the Jones work and
argued that Ms. Croce's article was ``a landmark admission of the
bankruptcy of the old critical vocabulary, confronted with ever-new
and evolving forms of art.''
</P>
<P>
   In no time, Berger was recruiting critics to criticize criticism
of literature, dance, art, film, music, even fashion. ``It's like a
bunch of doctors saying that the medical system isn't working very
well,'' he said. ``It's still important even though it's something
that patients have known all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Koestenbaum, author of ``Jackie Under My Skin: Interpreting an
Icon'' and writer of the libretto for the opera ``Jackie O,'' sees
a problem with the woeful amount of space available for book
criticism and wants critics to use what is available more
advisedly. He proposes a radical plan to remedy the ``waste of
space'' given over to ``a reviewer's display of spleen,'' adding
``as if there were not hundreds of shipwrecked books that never
receive adequate attention.'' He writes: ``I suggest that the
exercise of sanctioned aggression known as book reviewing be
retired and replaced by passionate acts of advocacy. Writing a
review takes enormous work. I cannot imagine summoning the energy
if I didn't feel that I needed to save a book from certain death,
to wedge it into a crowded marketplace, to support a kind of
writing that I esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   (He did not address the question of who would print only
positive reviews.)
</P>
<P>
   Alan Wolfe, a sociology professor at Boston University, is also
troubled by book critics, but for a different reason. Writing
recently in The Chronicle of Higher Education, he took on both
academic and popular writers for using reviews to discuss a
writer's motive to advance their own political and ideological
views. ``The actual book _ its craft, its cogency, its energy, its
shortcomings _ gets lost,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Sarah Rothenberg, a musician with Da Camera in
Houston, and Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, fault critics for such sins as
using alienating jargon, speaking mainly to one another instead of
addressing the concerns of readers, automatically bowing before
politically charged and multicultural works for fear of giving
offense, and simply, lazily asserting their views, without
displaying any reasoning. ``There's a certain mentality among
critics, that if I say it's good, it's good, and I don't have to
say why,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be, Kammen suggested, that critics have lost power
with the public partly because there are now so many of them. ``As
recently as 20 or 25 years ago, there were not as many critics,''
he said. ``Now The New York Times reviews pop culture that it would
not have 20 years ago, and there's an incredible number of popular
culture magazines that have critics. You see six or more reviews of
something, and you feel you're drowning in different perspectives.
That's different from when Clement Greenberg could make or break
not only an artist but a whole movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kammen adds that this trend toward the democratization of
criticism is not necessarily bad because the big critic can have
too much power. ``When Clement Greenberg didn't like something, he
absolutely scorned it and it ceased to be an option: Even museums
didn't buy what he didn't like,'' he said. ``He became a tyrant of
taste, not an arbiter of taste.''
</P>
<P>
   David Ross, who just became the director of the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art after a seven-year tenure as director of the
heavily criticized Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan,
argues that the arts profit most from a combination of popular and
critical response.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he often tries to ignore critics. ``People vote with
their feet,'' Ross said. ``And when attendance is up and membership
is up, you know you're doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical dialogue is very important,'' he added. ``But
it's important for critics to not just say, `This is what I like.'
We want their opinion, but we want them to educate, to inspire
people to go out and look at something. The `thumbs up, thumbs
down' kind of criticism inspires apathy and cynicism. It's a
misunderstanding of the critic's responsibility, which is to say,
`Go out and see this, and then let's talk.'''

   Record warmth will occur in the Southeast Saturday, as the
mercury could surpass 100 degrees east of the Appalachians. Across
Florida, it will not be quite as hot, as clouds and isolated
thundershowers develop, while brush fires produce smoky conditions
in the north. Meanwhile, a few thunderstorms will blossom from the
Deep South to the lower Mississippi valley as a disturbance lifts
the sultry air mass.
</P>
<P>
   Strong to severe thunderstorms with hail and high winds will
erupt from near the western Ohio valley to the upper Middle West.
The greatest risk for tornado-producing thunderstorms will near the
western Great Lakes, where the combination of a surge of dry air
near 10,000 feet and jet stream disturbance ignites a volatile
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, searing heat will engulf much of the southwestern
Plains and western Texas as blazing sunshine and hot winds from the
southwest prevail. In contrast, moist winds from the north will
sponsor another cool, showery day in parts of the northern Rockies.
The West Coast will be mostly tranquil.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WETTEST MONTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although less than two-thirds of the month has passed, June has
become the wettest summer month on record in Salt Lake City. A
unseasonable midweek tempest that dropped up to two feet of snow in
the Wasatch mountains east of the city caused over 1.5 inches of
rain in the city. The rain brought the monthly total to 3.71 inches
eclipsing the rain record for any summer month which was set in
August 1968. Excessive summer rain is very uncommon in Salt Lake
City. The surrounding mountains act as an effective barrier to
moist air masses. Average rainfall in each month from June to
September is less than an inch.  &QL;

CHEVRON'S BAY-AREA PLANT CITED AS MAJOR POLLUTER IN EPA LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Chevron's Richmond refinery tops the nation's
list of polluters with more than 944 million pounds of toxic waste
produced in 1996, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's latest Toxic Release Inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, the only California manufacturing plant to make the Top
50 national list released Thursday, has manufactured gasoline, oil
and other products on the San Francisco Bay since the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time that Chevron sat down with community members
and talked about source reduction,'' said Karen Susag, community
organizer at Communities for a Better Environment, an environmental
group.
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond refinery's environmental manager, Marty Gilles,
said she believed the waste production figure was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only amount that is emitted to the environment is roughly
1.5 million pounds,'' Gilles said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA ranks the refinery fifth highest in California for its
chemical releases of about 1 million pounds to the air and 500,000
pounds to the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 943 million pounds are treated on site in ponds where
microorganisms digest and degrade the chemicals, Gilles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that's a good thing,'' Gilles said, ``that we have a
waste system that does that removal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susag isn't impressed, saying that Chevron should be obeying
the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to reduce waste at the source, which does not
mean producing 944 million pounds,'' Susag said. ``Producing that
amount of waste is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilles said Chevron is planning to significantly reduce the
pollutant methanol by adding scrubbers to its
hydrogen-manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986
created the Toxic Release Inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that manufacture or process 25,000 pounds a year of
one of 650 toxic chemicals must report the production, discharge to
air, water, land or groundwater or offsite transfer to the EPA.
Companies that handle or store 10,000 pounds a year also have to
report.
</P>
<P>
   California ranked 18th in the nation for industrial releases of
toxic chemicals in 1996. Nearly 1,400 facilities reported a total
of 50 million pounds of releases, the majority to the air.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Richmond refinery on the California Top 10 of
waste producers are Mobil Corp. in Torrance, Exxon Co. USA in
Benicia and Shell Oil Co. in Martinez.

 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the Fifth Avenue offices of Earl G. Graves Ltd.,
employees step with almost military precision. Secretaries in crisp
yellow suits make sure appointments are kept to the minute, while a
receptionist announces visitors within seconds of their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hunter-green office of the man whose name is on the
door, however, the atmosphere is considerably homier, almost a
suburban den: Children's crayon notes and athletic awards cover the
walls. This is fitting, since Earl Graves, the multimillionaire
publisher of Black Enterprise Magazine and the chief executive of
the United States' largest minority-controlled Pepsi-Cola
franchise, is in business with all three of his adult sons.
</P>
<P>
   Seated across from a picture of his two elder sons, Earl Jr. and
John, facing off in a Yale-Brown basketball game, Graves swept his
arm to take in the photograph as well as the opulent surroundings
and said, ``Someday, this will all be theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   In this classically sentimental expression of family succession
_ the punch line of so many New Yorker cartoons _ Graves spoke
earnestly for millions of fathers who, in every age, have groomed
sons to follow in their footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   A bulwark of American life since the days of small farms hacked
from the wilderness, the tradition of sons succeeding fathers in
the work place may be less routine now, in an era of working women,
large public corporations and economic prosperity that gives
offspring the freedom to strike out alone.
</P>
<P>
   But father-to-son succession is alive and well in a surprising
number of big New York enterprises, in fields as diverse as real
estate, public relations and sports ownership. The mogul-owners who
run them are often at the core of the city's power structure. After
completing the task of all good fathers _ hectoring sons to finish
homework, mow the lawn and respect Mom _ they have taken on the
added job of shaping ambitious, field-hardened minimoguls.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their sons, in their 20s, 30s and early 40s, are being
groomed as the next generation of New York's power elite. They
schmooze one another both inside and outside office hours, forming
alliances that mirror those that their fathers enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see so many of my friends' sons now friends with
my own sons,'' said Howard J. Rubenstein, the public relations
czar, who is a power broker in political and business circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``SOBs'' is how his son Steven Rubenstein, 28, characterizes the
18-member breakfast club he started with Jeff Wilpon, 36, a son of
Fred Wilpon, an owner of the New York Mets baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   That's Sons of Bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Guests at the breakfast meetings have included Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all friends,'' Jeff Wilpon said of his fellow baby
moguls around town, who include William Rudin, 43, a member of a
prominent real-estate family, and Jonathan Tisch, 44, an owner of
the Regency Hotel and a son of Robert Tisch of Loews Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do business,'' Wilpon said. ``We socialize. I help them.
They help me. It all runs together.''
</P>
<P>
   Father's Day is a reminder that a major attraction of fathers'
and sons' working together is that it provides an opportunity to
maintain intimate ties into the adult years of the younger
generation _ rare in a highly mobile society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have a son with you,'' said Fred Wilpon, whose
midtown office is on the same floor as Jeff's. ``It continues the
dialogue for the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are eager and ambitious daughters being
groomed by fathers to take over businesses (and daughters and sons
being groomed by mothers), but even in this modern world, the old,
traditional way is still the path most commonly followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is surprising, but in 1998 the most predictable and most
common person to take over the helm of a family business is the
oldest son,'' said John Davis, a senior lecturer at the Harvard
Business School and an author of ``Generation to Generation''
(Harvard University Press, 1997), a study of family succession.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pride and satisfaction of grooming a son, and of
being groomed by a father, are abundant, there are also manifest
perils, according to Davis and other family business experts (not
to say psychotherapists).
</P>
<P>
   Fathers, Davis has written, often complain that sons are in too
big a hurry to take over, or that sons too readily risk the company
that was built from scratch by years of toil. For their part, sons
say that fathers use business situations to instruct how to live
one's life, making sons feel as if they are still little boys.

<P>
   Here are portraits of four New York families in the process of
handing major businesses from fathers to sons:
</P>
<P>
   The Wilpons
</P>
<P>
   A Son in a Hurry to Run the Mets
</P>
<P>
   From the time he was 10, Jeff Wilpon has been eager _ maybe too
eager _ to follow his father. At that age he carried a homemade
business card identifying himself as director of construction. His
father, Fred Wilpon, was an owner of Sterling Equities, a
real-estate conglomerate he founded with his brother-in-law Saul
Katz.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, when Jeff was a high school senior in Roslyn, his
father and uncle bought the Mets. Jeff was so gung-ho to join the
front office that he gave up every boy's dream _ a potential career
as a professional athlete. He had been drafted by the Montreal
Expos out of college and believes he could have started at catcher
in the major leagues, he said, but he quit after one
spring-training session to join the family business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I wanted to do what my dad did,'' he said,
sitting, like his father, with legs crossed in Fred Wilpon's office
in Sterling Plaza, on Fifth Avenue. From time to time, his father
glanced dotingly at him.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Lear, a former chief executive of F&AMP;M Schaefer who is
now executive in residence at the Columbia Business School, said
that when being the owner's son is the main qualification for the
top job of a big company, a business can find itself on shaky
footing. Many young men being groomed to take over by fathers would
not make it as chief executives in publicly owned companies, where
family ties are irrelevant. ``They're not tough enough,'' Lear
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of this, Fred Wilpon insisted that before his son join
the family company, he should work for another builder, starting at
the bottom, sweeping floors on job sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to wear boots and be in the field,'' said Fred
Wilpon, adding that he sought to toughen his son by having him work
for bosses who would not show favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Jeff joined Sterling Equities, he rose to his
present position as chief officer of development and construction,
overseeing planning for the new stadium that the Mets want built.
</P>
<P>
   In Jeff's office there is a picture of his 2-year-old son in a
Mets hat. Does Jeff expect his toddler to be the third generation
to join the company?
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rubensteins
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Sons From Competing
</P>
<P>
   Howard J. Rubenstein used to throw the daily newspapers onto the
kitchen table and have his two sons, Richard and Steven, read the
articles and recite the answers to the classic journalism
questions: who, what, when, where, why and how.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein's own father was a reporter for The New York Herald
Tribune, who took him as a boy to fires and murder scenes. In turn,
he said, ``I wanted to teach my boys what I did.'' So he took them
on the rounds of his trade as a publicity agent _ to hundreds of
parties, dinners and political fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein started both his sons in the mail room of the
160-employee family company, which represents clients like the
duchess of York and George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   After getting advice from other fathers with more than one child
in a family business, he assigned them to separate divisions to
keep the peace. ``They are very different people, and I didn't want
them competing with each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard has a flair for entertainment,'' he added. ``Steven is
more civic-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Richard, 32, heads two spinoff companies, one with
entertainment and small-business clients, the other representing
publicly owned companies. Steven, 28, represents real-estate
companies and political causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted each one of them to have their own areas of
responsibility,'' their father said. ``In the beginning, when they
came in, they did not report to me. They were trained by other
people. It gave them a far greater sense of independence and a way
to prove their own merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm their father. It's different if they came in reporting to
me. Each one was helped by senior people.''
</P>
<P>
   When the day comes for Howard Rubenstein to step aside, the
biggest question might be which son will inherit his palatial
30th-floor office on Avenue of the Americas at 55th Street, which
overlooks Central Park and New Jersey and whose windowsills are
lined with 100-odd hard hats from the buildings of real-estate and
construction clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be divided in half,'' Rubenstein said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get out the tape measure,'' Richard said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Graveses
</P>
<P>
   Sons as Polished as Their Dads
</P>
<P>
   Earl Graves maintains that the family that skis together stays
together. Not to mention the family that spends summer vacations
together and sends its shoes out to be shined together.
</P>
<P>
   Graves, his wife, his three sons, their wives and their children
all take family ski trips to Vermont and Colorado, and they spend
summer vacations at two facing houses in Sag Harbor, Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Every Tuesday, the father and sons take their shoes to the
office to be sent out for shining. ``You must be presentable _ you
must look good,'' Graves instructs his sons, who all favor, as he
does, power business suits with suspenders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the appearance of having raised a matched set, Graves
said he never forced his sons to follow in his footsteps; instead,
as they grew up in Scarsdale, he tried to make the business world
alluring by inviting corporate titans like Sanford Weill of
Travelers Group to the family dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   Another paterfamilias who believed his sons should not taste
success too easily, Graves refused to give them cars at college. He
would lend them a vehicle, but if their grades fell, he would take
it back. He also had his sons cut grass and work in the company
mail room during school vacations. Some summers, Michael, the
youngest, drove a Pepsi truck. Today, at 31, he runs the family
soft-drink distributorship, Pepsi-Cola of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   John, 35, a lawyer, is general counsel to the family business.
Earl Jr., 36, who is known as Butch, is president of Black
Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   When they all first worked together, it wasn't always smooth.
``Butch and Johnny, I would say, were very vocal in their
disagreements,'' the senior Graves said. Former Ivy League
basketball rivals, they would sometimes take disputes into the
hallways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would bring them into my office,'' Graves said, ``and say:
`This is not a basketball court. We are executives. We must act
like owners of the company.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Sterns
</P>
<P>
   A Daughter Wants a Shot, Too
</P>
<P>
   In the family of Leonard Stern, one gets the impression, there
is very little sentimentality about father-son matters. His sons,
Emanuel, 35, and Edward, 33, call him Leonard, not Dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't think they could make it, I would pull them out,''
said the senior Stern, chairman of Hartz Mountain Industries, the
pet-food conglomerate that also owns more than 175 buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not, it would destroy their lives,'' he said. ``The peer
group for owners' children is very tough. You really have to prove
yourself. I've seen too many kids whose grandparents started a
company with ruined lives.''
</P>
<P>
   His children, who also include a daughter, Andrea, grew up
knowing that the opportunity to join the business was always there,
although they pursued highly individual paths at first. Emanuel
helped open homeless shelters in the Bronx. Edward worked as a
reporter for Spy magazine. Andrea was a photographer.
</P>
<P>
   At a certain point, Leonard Stern recalled in his Manhattan
office, which is furnished like a Park Avenue living room, he told
the children: ``The business is here if you want it. If not, I'm
selling it off.'' He has a crisp manner and eyes that could pierce
a statue. About the same time he divorced his children's mother and
married Allison Stern, a former model, and the two became regulars
in Manhattan's society circles. ``It was my time to play,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   How soon after that did his children join the company?
</P>
<P>
   ``Instantly,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   He did not start his offspring at the bottom. ``This mail-room
business is really a farce,'' he said. ``Creating an artificial
sweatshop when your father is the chairman is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it came to grooming them to inherit power, he was
careful to give limited responsibilities at first, so that failure
would not mean disaster. Emanuel began in retail real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only 3 percent of the company, so if I messed up, it
wouldn't have hit too hard financially,'' Emanuel said. ``Leonard
is not stupid.'' Today Emanuel runs much of Hartz Mountain's real
estate, including the SoHo Grand Hotel and buildings in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   His brother graduated from Spy to the pet-food division of the
company, which he now runs, overseeing 2,400 employees.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Andrea founded The Long Island Village Voice, an
offshoot of The Village Voice in New York, which the family owns.
She has a staff of 23.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Leonard Stern would seem to favor his sons as
business heirs over his daughter, who is, at 31, the youngest.
</P>
<P>
   That would be typical of most men at the top of family empires,
who groom sons to take over, whereas daughters are often given a
lavish wedding, a nice trust fund and a job that may be glamorous,
but not too important, for as long as they like. Raising a family,
it is understood, is their first priority.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Stern denied that he had favored his sons over his
daughter in the grooming department, but he noted that Andrea, who
married last year, is struggling with the issue of whether to drop
out and begin a family. She agreed that this was so.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's her lifestyle problem to sort out,'' Leonard Stern
said. ``I'm not favoring one over the other, but if my sons wanted
to stay home with kids, they just wouldn't be president of the
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Lear, the Columbia executive in residence, said that very few
women with families make it to the top of big private companies.
``They are competing with men who are putting in 18 hours a day
seven days a week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Andrea currently has far fewer responsibilities than
her brothers, she said she has just as much desire to make it to
the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't count me out yet,'' she said. ``I'm just as driven and
ambitious as my brothers are. My time clock is just different.
We'll just see who takes over someday.''

 By PETER LIPPMAN  
 FROM: The Progressive  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In March, I became a prisoner in Kosovo, along with a group of
activists from Peaceworkers, a California-based organization that
monitors human-rights abuses and promotes nonviolent conflict
resolution.
 &HT;    I arrived in Kosovo as part of the Peaceworkers' delegation, at
the invitation of the Independent Student Union there.
 &HT;    We witnessed the brutality of the Serbian government in this
Albanian-populated province. And we noted the remarkable efforts of
Kosovo's Albanian citizenry to stave off disaster by engaging in
creative nonviolence.
 &HT;    In Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, we met the people who are
holding together the infrastructure of Albanian society _
professors, doctors, journalists and human-rights workers.
 &HT;    The dean of philology at Pristina's underground university told
us how, in 1991, the Belgrade regime had imposed an exclusively
Serbian-language curriculum. When the Albanian professors refused
to teach the curriculum, they were fired. The same thing happened
in the high schools. Teachers and professors soon set up a parallel
educational system in private rooms, basements and storefronts.
 &HT;    We visited an English class in an unheated, empty store. The
students sat on makeshift wooden benches, wearing their coats, hats
and gloves. The young teacher shivered as she gave a lesson in
prefixes: neo-liberalism, neo-colonialism, pan-Hellenic,
pan-Balkan.
 &HT;    All of the college-educated people we spoke with said they were
convinced that their conflict with the Serbian regime must be
resolved peacefully. One of our young translators was the most
eloquent. Asked how she felt about the Kosovo Liberation Army, she
responded, ``Did anyone ever win a war? You can take territory, but
everyone still loses.''
 &HT;    At the same time, many people are at the end of their patience.
A journalist said to me, ``Each night I go to bed knowing that the
police can break into my apartment and do whatever they want to my
family. This is psychological terrorism. Every parent is a
potential fighter.'' One student in the English class told us, ``If
the police hurt my father or my brother, I will have to fight.''
 &HT;    At the student union office, I looked at pictures of the victims
from Drenica, the region west of Pristina where Serbian police and
paramilitary units surrounded more than a dozen villages in late
February and massacred at least 90 people. I saw photos of the
bodies of old people, men, women and children. Many had been shot
at close range. Half of one woman's face was gone.
 &HT;    Later I watched the Serbian TV coverage. Only the male victims,
all of whom were termed ``terrorists,'' showed up on television.
 &HT;    We met a former Serbian politician who was forced out of his job
after he spoke against the regime when it took away Kosovo's
autonomy. We asked what would happen to him if he protested now
against massacres of Albanian civilians. ``Probably the same thing
that happened to the people in Drenica,'' he said.
 &HT;    Another Serb we met, a shopkeeper, said he had friends and
customers among the Albanians. He came close to tears when he
talked about the Albanian woman who used to take care of his
children. He told us he wished the Albanians would receive their
independence so that things could calm down.
 &HT;    But his mood changed when we brought up the recent massacre. ``I
knew some of those policemen who got killed,'' he said. ``In
America, what do you do with your terrorist problem? You hunt them
down and shoot them, right? I am just waiting to leave here.''
 &HT;    The Serb shopkeeper blamed the Kosovo Liberation Army for the
troubles in the region. But he also expressed hateful views of the
Albanian people generally.
 &HT;    ``The Albanians just think about sex and guns,'' he said. ``If
they have two wives and we have one, they can have 10 or 15
children, and we usually just have two. And they always make sure
to have lots of guns. The Albanians I know here in town are mostly
normal. But not those in the villages. Did you see the pictures of
the people who were killed? They looked like monkeys.''
 &HT;    At noon on Friday, March 13, my colleagues and I walked up a
muddy hill in Pristina to observe a protest. Demonstrators chose
the hillside location, among other reasons, because of its
inaccessibility except by foot. No cars could make a sudden attack.
The demonstration started earlier than announced, so the police
wouldn't have time to block it.
 &HT;    About 50,000 people stood among the houses on the edge of a
sloped field. They sang freedom songs, waved Albanian and American
flags, carried signs saying, ``Serbian Terror out of Kosovo'',
``NATO: S.O.S.'' and ``Drenica, We're with You''. Protesters made
speeches, and then the demonstration broke up. The crowd marched
down Qafa Street, renamed Yugoslav National Army Street by the
Serbian government.
 &HT;    We went to visit the Mother Teresa clinic, located in a small
house in the poor part of Pristina. It is the only free women's
clinic in Kosovo, staffed by doctors and nurses who donate their
time. One doctor told us about her surreal firing from the state
hospital in 1990 by a policeman wearing a doctor's white coat,
holding a gun in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other.
 &HT;    She also said another doctor was fired while operating on a
patient. When he insisted on finishing the operation, he was
handcuffed to a radiator and beaten. On days when traffic is not
disrupted by police actions, an average of 15 children are born in
the clinic. Because of space limitations, mothers who have just
given birth have only two hours to rest before they are sent home.
Women are often doubled up, two to a bed.
 &HT;    The day we visited was a slow one, because of the
demonstrations. There were only three newborns, tightly wrapped and
placed together in a bed with bottles of warm water between them.
Most women are giving birth at home now, the doctors said, and
there is anecdotal evidence of a big jump in infant mortality.
 &HT;    On Sunday, four days after we arrived, we watched more
demonstrations. One was scheduled to coincide with Catholic Mass.
There were no signs this time, just pictures of Mother Teresa.
Demonstrators also carried candles in honor of the dead at Drenica.
About 100,000 people walked around the town quietly. Seven young
men at the front of the line wore T-shirts that spelled
D-R-E-N-I-C-A.
 &HT;    Near the center of town the march stopped. An old man stepped
out and motioned everyone to be quiet. The silence of those
thousands of people was overwhelming. The man lit all the candles
of those in front of the line, and then walked away, lighting a
cigarette.
 &HT;    The next day, 20,000 women tried to march to Drenica with bread
in their hands. The police turned them back. Human-rights groups
and aid organizations were also prevented from reaching Drenica,
where terrified villagers hiding in the woods were reportedly
starving. The head of the International Red Cross in Pristina gave
up on relief efforts and left town after receiving death threats.
 &HT;    On Thurs., March 19, the students called another brief
demonstration. This time everyone was to bring keys and rattle
them, to symbolize unlocking the prison of military repression, a
tactic protesters used in Chile and Czechoslovakia. A half-dozen
policemen blocked the protest at a main intersection. Pistols,
grenades, and knives hung from their belts. The marchers all sat
down. Snipers stood on the rooftops. Two armored vehicles raced to
the scene, and 10 helmeted policemen got out. They filed around to
stand behind the seated protesters.
 &HT;    But what were they going to do to thousands of people who were
sitting down, with dozens of international journalists watching?
Nothing happened. The demonstrators rattled their keys and blew
their whistles. For half an hour unarmed men, women and children,
sitting on the pavement, prevailed over the police.
 &HT;    On the same day, a large Serbian demonstration took place. Word
spread that many busloads of people were brought into Pristina from
Belgrade, Nis and Kragujevac. We watched as a crowd of people
walked by carrying signs: ``Kosovo is the Heart of Serbia'';
``We'll Give our Head, But Not Serbia!'' _ and a swastika with the
words ``America'' and ``Germany'' over it.
 &HT;    Some Serbian marchers caught sight of my colleagues and me
standing near some journalists who were wearing plaid shirts and
carrying cameras. The marchers started yelling, ``Profiteers! Go
home.'' People sang the old song, ``Who's lying? Who says Serbia is
small?'' As we left, an old woman followed us, yelling, ``You
should be killed!''
 &HT;    I heard a piano when I arrived at my host's house to rest. The
14-year-old music student who lives there was practicing. I went in
to listen while he played Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, all three
movements, without sheet music. I was impressed, and asked him how
long he had been working on it.
 &HT;    He told me, ``Since the beginning of the year, only I haven't
had much time.''
 &HT;    Then he played Mozart's March Alla Turca, which sounded easy
after the Beethoven piece.
 &HT;    Our visit ended abruptly when my group was arrested, tried by a
``judge'' (more properly a magistrate) and sentenced to 10 days in
jail, all in the space of a few hours. I was apprehended a day
before my colleagues when I reached a checkpoint while trying to
leave Kosovo by bus for Sarajevo.
 &HT;    The police, not liking the fact that I had no evidence to show I
had registered my presence in Kosovo with the police, removed me
from the bus. They held me at the Mitrovica police station for
several hours, talking to me sometimes politely, and other times
rudely. Eventually they decided to send me back to Pristina. Two
armed policemen drove me back in an unmarked car.
 &HT;    During the entire detention and arrest incident, I was more
inconvenienced than scared because I believed I would soon be fined
and allowed to go on my way. When one of my guards conjectured that
I would be sentenced to 10 days in jail and then deported, I
thought he was trying to intimidate me. But I soon learned that he
was right.
 &HT;    And as my mother warned me before I went to Kosovo, ``In a war
situation, there's no one you can complain to.''
 &HT;    On entering the jail, I was not physically mistreated, just
yelled at for a long time by the guards. Some of them seemed to be
enjoying their opportunity to yell at an American. They asked me if
I wanted a haircut. I said no. Then they shaved my head and took me
to a cell.
 &HT;    I spent the night in the cell with seven Albanian men, ages 16
to 40. They had been arrested the same day as I was. It was clear
that the police had already been hard at work on a couple of them.
I shook hands with everyone except the two whose hands were too
swollen from pounding by nightclubs.
 &HT;    Two men adopted me, talked to me in a whisper, and told me how
to act in order to survive. I asked if we could speak openly. One
said, ``You can, but we can't.''
 &HT;    The police entered the room every half hour that night. Each
time, we had to jump up and form a line with our hands behind our
backs. One big guard was particularly mean. He asked the
16-year-old boy standing next to me a question. The boy answered in
Albanian.
 &HT;    The man slapped him on one cheek and told him to speak Serbian.
The poor kid didn't know much Serbian.
 &HT;    The guard slapped him hard on the other cheek. His hand whizzed
by my face. He asked the boy, ``Were you in the demonstration?''
The boy answered, ``Yes.'' Slap. The guard left, satisfied for the
time being.
 &HT;    I was arrested on a Friday, and the rest of my colleagues came
in on Saturday. Diplomatic pressure on the Serbian government
ensued. U.S. diplomats all the way up to Madeleine Albright were
making a clamor to high Serbian officials.
 &HT;    On Monday, we were suddenly taken out of the jail and driven to
the Serbian border with Macedonia. The Serbian government had made
a mistake in detaining us. The arrest gave us a special opportunity
to publicize our findings. After we were released, we held press
conferences in Skopje, Macedonia, and in Washington, D.C.
 &HT;    We were relieved to be out of jail, but sorry to be forbidden to
reenter the country for three years. The privileged Americans are
free, but for the Albanians, life goes on.
 &HT;    Albanians in Kosovo are close enough to Bosnia to know that no
amount of human suffering will necessarily force Western
policymakers to act. But every day I spent there, I heard the same
things: ``What is America going to do? NATO needs to wake up and
help us.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, as the West cranks out ``strongly worded
statements,'' the atrocities continue. Serbian soldiers keep
pouring into Kosovo. They are setting up more checkpoints, and
violent attacks on Albanian peasants are not restricted to the
Drenica area, but are taking place all over the province. By now,
there are well over 40,000 refugees. Some even showed up in
Sarajevo.
 &HT;    As long as the conflict does not spill over the borders, sending
thousands more refugees into NATO countries, the West seems content
to keep its distance. But there will be more Drenicas. Madeleine
Albright's declaration that ``we will not rule out force'' and
pontification about an arms embargo on Yugoslavia are pathetic
gestures. It is getting very late for the Albanians.

 By PETER LIPPMAN  
 FROM: The Progressive  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In March, I became a prisoner in Kosovo, along with a group of
activists from Peaceworkers, a California-based organization that
monitors human-rights abuses and promotes nonviolent conflict
resolution.
 &HT;    I arrived in Kosovo as part of the Peaceworkers' delegation, at
the invitation of the Independent Student Union there.
 &HT;    We witnessed the brutality of the Serbian government in this
Albanian-populated province. And we noted the remarkable efforts of
Kosovo's Albanian citizenry to stave off disaster by engaging in
creative nonviolence.
 &HT;    In Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, we met the people who are
holding together the infrastructure of Albanian society _
professors, doctors, journalists and human-rights workers.
 &HT;    The dean of philology at Pristina's underground university told
us how, in 1991, the Belgrade regime had imposed an exclusively
Serbian-language curriculum. When the Albanian professors refused
to teach the curriculum, they were fired. The same thing happened
in the high schools. Teachers and professors soon set up a parallel
educational system in private rooms, basements and storefronts.
 &HT;    We visited an English class in an unheated, empty store. The
students sat on makeshift wooden benches, wearing their coats, hats
and gloves. The young teacher shivered as she gave a lesson in
prefixes: neo-liberalism, neo-colonialism, pan-Hellenic,
pan-Balkan.
 &HT;    All of the college-educated people we spoke with said they were
convinced that their conflict with the Serbian regime must be
resolved peacefully. One of our young translators was the most
eloquent. Asked how she felt about the Kosovo Liberation Army, she
responded, ``Did anyone ever win a war? You can take territory, but
everyone still loses.''
 &HT;    At the same time, many people are at the end of their patience.
A journalist said to me, ``Each night I go to bed knowing that the
police can break into my apartment and do whatever they want to my
family. This is psychological terrorism. Every parent is a
potential fighter.'' One student in the English class told us, ``If
the police hurt my father or my brother, I will have to fight.''
 &HT;    At the student union office, I looked at pictures of the victims
from Drenica, the region west of Pristina where Serbian police and
paramilitary units surrounded more than a dozen villages in late
February and massacred at least 90 people. I saw photos of the
bodies of old people, men, women and children. Many had been shot
at close range. Half of one woman's face was gone.
 &HT;    Later I watched the Serbian TV coverage. Only the male victims,
all of whom were termed ``terrorists,'' showed up on television.
 &HT;    We met a former Serbian politician who was forced out of his job
after he spoke against the regime when it took away Kosovo's
autonomy. We asked what would happen to him if he protested now
against massacres of Albanian civilians. ``Probably the same thing
that happened to the people in Drenica,'' he said.
 &HT;    Another Serb we met, a shopkeeper, said he had friends and
customers among the Albanians. He came close to tears when he
talked about the Albanian woman who used to take care of his
children. He told us he wished the Albanians would receive their
independence so that things could calm down.
 &HT;    But his mood changed when we brought up the recent massacre. ``I
knew some of those policemen who got killed,'' he said. ``In
America, what do you do with your terrorist problem? You hunt them
down and shoot them, right? I am just waiting to leave here.''
 &HT;    The Serb shopkeeper blamed the Kosovo Liberation Army for the
troubles in the region. But he also expressed hateful views of the
Albanian people generally.
 &HT;    ``The Albanians just think about sex and guns,'' he said. ``If
they have two wives and we have one, they can have 10 or 15
children, and we usually just have two. And they always make sure
to have lots of guns. The Albanians I know here in town are mostly
normal. But not those in the villages. Did you see the pictures of
the people who were killed? They looked like monkeys.''
 &HT;    At noon on Friday, March 13, my colleagues and I walked up a

the hillside location, among other reasons, because of its

flags, carried signs saying, ``Serbian Terror out of Kosovo'',
``NATO: S.O.S.'' and ``Drenica, We're with You''. Protesters made
speeches, and then the demonstration broke up. The crowd marched
down Qafa Street, renamed Yugoslav National Army Street by the
Serbian government.
 &HT;    We went to visit the Mother Teresa clinic, located in a small
house in the poor part of Pristina. It is the only free women's

   The New York Times asked Melissa Fay Greene, Stanley Crouch and
Elmore Leonard to rate the computer-generated book recommendations
offered by Amazon.com's Bookmatcher. The authors took the
Bookmatcher quiz. which first asked how frequently they read
different literary genres, like popular fiction, classics, romance
and science fiction. Then they were asked to rate 20 different
books, from ``Bad!'' to ``Loved It!'' ``Don't Know'' and ``Not for
Me'' were also possible answers.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were asked to rate more John Grisham than
Shakespeare, all three authors found Jane Austen and
``Underworld,'' by Don DeLillo on the lists. Ms. Greene punched in
the answers herself, while Crouch and Leonard answered the
questions over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   MELISSA FAY GREENE, author of ``The Temple Bombing'' and
``Praying for Sheetrock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Answering the questions is tricky. When asked, ``How do you
rate Macbeth?'' is it really possible to respond, `Don't know,' or,
worse, `Not for me'? Of course you say, `loved it!' even if you're
not in the mood to read it again in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several times, I felt I was on the verge of being tricked by
my computer interlocutor; the novels ``Don Quixote,'' ``Ulysses''
and ``Les Miserables'' were proposed to me in quick succession. `Ah
ha!' I thought. `The software is trying to get me to say I love
really, really long books.'' Just to cramp its style, I replied
that I ``loved'' one of those and ``liked'' two. A better question
from the software might have been, `Have you ever honestly finished
any of the following books?'
</P>
<P>
   ``My recommendations: ``Underworld,'' by Don DeLillo (a terrific
recommendation _ even though it was probably triggered by my `long'
book responses; I'm reading the book right now and loving it);
`Northanger Abbey,' by Jane Austen (read it years ago, can't
remember if I `loved' it or only `liked' it); `The Reivers,' by
William Faulkner (ditto), `The Best of Roald Dahl,' by Roald Dahl
(where on earth did that recommendation come from?) and `Like Water
for Chocolate,' by Laura Esquivel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction: overall, I'm flattered (which is truly the point
of these absurd exercises, a slightly upscale version of teen-age
magazine surveys like, `Which boyfriend type is truly for you?'). I
find that the recommendations generated by Amazon.com in response
to purchases I've made on line are more accurate than these
generated by questionnaire responses, however. And I have to ask:
Where's nonfiction? Where's poetry? For those are the two genres I
read more often than fiction. I bet there are plenty of titles in
those genres to which I could truly respond, `loved it!'''
</P>
<P>
   STANLEY CROUCH, author ``Always in Pursuit,'' cultural critic
and columnist for The (New York) Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the seven recommendations, three were books by Jane
Austien: ``The Jane Austen Collection: Emma, Mansfield Park,
Northanger Abbey,'' ``The Oxford Illustrated Jane Austen:
Northanger Abbey and Persuasion'' and ``Pride and Prejudice.''
Crouch is a fan of Austen and thought that was a good choice. As
for the other selections, ``A Shround for a Nightingale,'' by P.D.
James, ``Underworld,'' by Don Don DeLillo, ``Longing,'' by Maria
Espinosa and ``Finding Moon,'' by Tony Hillerman came up. Crouch
said he owned ``Underworld'' though hadn't yet read it and heard
that Ms. James was talented, but had not heard of the other two
authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they understand my taste. You see, the problem
is that the range of things that you may like or may not like is
much wider. Even though I said I loved a book like `The Great
Gatsby' or `Animal Farm,' the fact that to them, that added up to a
whole heap of Jane Austen suggests to me that there is some
fundamental flaw in the way they do what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have writers like our poet laureate Robert Pinsky, who did
this astounding translation of the `Inferno.' If they can't figure
out how to get someone like Pinsky or a guy like Derek Walcott, or
Philip Roth __ he's written so many exceptional works _ there's
something wrong. So I find this fundamentally worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   ELMORE LEONARD, author, whose latest novel, ``Be Cool,'' will be
published early next year by Delacorte Press.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, who said he frequently reads popular fiction and rarely
reads classics, found ``The Jane Austen Collection'' included in
his list along with ``The Sufferings of Young Werther'' and
``Elective Affinities,'' by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He was
pleased to see ``Underworld,'' saying that he already has it
``ready to read.'' He also thought Robertson Davies' ``Rebel
Angels'' was a good choice. As for the other selections, ``Mutant
Message Down Under,'' by Marlo Morgan, and ``Where Echoes Live''
and ``A Wild and Lonely Place,'' by Marcia Muller, ``I've never
heard of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said he didn't read fiction while he was writing, so he
had been saving ``Underworld,'' along with ``Cloudsplitter,'' by
Russell Banks and ``Cities of the Plain,'' by Cormac McCarthy to
read since he just finished his book. He would read nonfiction, but
the system doesn't recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand the way computers think at all. I pick
books mostly from reviews or if I recognize the author, of course.
That was the reason I immediately chose `Underworld.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't have a feeling for computers to begin with. They
certainly don't have much popular fiction to recommend for me.
They've got all that Clancy and Grisham. I'd choose word of mouth
any time.''

 &HT;    Dunlap's behavior at June 9 meeting encouraged firing
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Al Dunlap's job wasn't on the line when
Sunbeam Corp's. board of directors gathered in New York early last
week. Rather, the seven directors, including Dunlap, met June 9 to
discuss how to answer a national magazine's allegations against the
company.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunlap's behavior at the meeting set in motion a series of
events that led to his firing just four days later.
</P>
<P>
   As the discussion unwound, Dunlap, Sunbeam's chairman and chief
executive until last Saturday, complained that he had been slighted
by the company's largest stockholder. He offered repeatedly to
resign, according to two directors who were at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That caused us to wonder about what was happening within the
company,'' said Director Howard Kristol, a lawyer who hosted the
June 9 board meeting at his office. Sunbeam's five other directors,
including Dunlap, didn't return calls or couldn't be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Kristol described Dunlap's offer to quit as ``out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, coupled with indications that Sunbeam's
second-quarter earnings would fall short of Dunlap's prediction,
spurred Sunbeam's five outside directors _ those who don't work for
the company _ to spend much of last week scrutinizing the Delray
Beach-based company's operations. Directors _ including Dunlap
appointee Kristol _ talked to employees and examined Dunlap's sales
and earnings forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found was very disquieting,'' Kristol said.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry raised so much doubt that the board sacked Dunlap on
Saturday and, as part of the early Monday announcement of his
departure, said Sunbeam would fail to meet his numbers for the
second quarter and all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam's new CEO, Jerry Levin, has made no financial
projections for the appliance maker, whose stock has fallen 75
percent from its 12-month high in early March.
</P>
<P>
   The stock (NYSE: SOC) closed Thursday at $13.06, down 38 cents _
and nearing the $12.25 a share it was selling for when Dunlap, the
self-proclaimed turnaround artist extraordinaire, was hired in July
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The first board meeting last week, on June 9, was called to
discuss how the company should respond to a report in the June 8
issue of Barron's financial weekly that said Sunbeam's 1997
earnings were largely manufactured with accounting tricks, a charge
directors deny.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the seven directors attended the meeting in person, with
the seventh, William Rutter of First Union National Bank of
Florida, listening in by phone. Also there were Sunbeam's chief
legal officer, David Fannin; a representative of Sunbeam's outside
auditor, Arthur Andersen; another Sunbeam executive; and an outside
lawyer for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The board decided to prepare a private rebuttal to the Barron's
article, then assess what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Following that discussion, everyone left except the directors,
including Dunlap and Chief Financial Officer Russell Kersh.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Dunlap said he and Kersh, his sidekick in the
restructuring of several companies, were prepared to take severance
packages if the board did not support them, Kristol said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll settle up now,'' Dunlap said.
</P>
<P>
   He felt he had been slighted by Michael Price, whose Franklin
Mutual Series Fund Inc. is Sunbeam's largest shareholder, Kristol
said.
</P>
<P>
   Price, who was instrumental in Dunlap's hiring, had been quoted
in the June 8 issue of Fortune magazine as saying, ``We're not
going to sit around and let Al wreck the company. We're paying a
lot of attention.'' The thrust of the article was that Sunbeam was
looking to replace Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   In response to that article, Price, whose fund owns 17 percent
of Sunbeam, had issued a statement saying his views were
``mischaracterized'' and he was ``completely supportive'' of
Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   At the board meeting, Peter Langerman, who represents Price on
the Sunbeam board, assured Dunlap that he had the full support of
Price and the board, Kristol said.
</P>
<P>
   After Dunlap and Kersh left, and Rutter was no longer on the
phone line, the four remaining directors stayed around ``for
hours'' discussing what had happened, Kristol said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kristol and Langerman, Directors Faith Whittlesey
and Charles Elson, a professor at the Stetson University law school
in St. Petersburgcq, participated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us independently, though we didn't say so at
the meeting, were dismayed by Mr. Dunlap's repeated offer to leave
the company with a suitable severance arrangement,'' Kristol said.
``No one at the meeting had suggested that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly raised some questions about the forecast and Mr.
Dunlap's commitment to realize the plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The four directors exchanged home phone numbers and agreed to
get more information on the company's financial condition, with
Langerman taking the lead, Kristol said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, it became clear that even Dunlap's most
recent earnings forecasts of 5 to 10 cents a share for the second
quarter and $1 for the year _ down from his earlier predictions _
were unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap made those projections at a May 11 meeting with analysts
in New York, where he presented his plan for Sunbeam to absorb
three companies _ outdoor equipment maker Coleman Co., smoke alarm
maker First Alert and Mr. Coffee maker Signature Brands USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reached the conclusion that we no longer had confidence in
Dunlap's ability to deliver in accordance with that plan,'' Kristol
said.
</P>
<P>
   The board called another meeting for last Saturday in New York,
asking Dunlap and Kersh to be available by phone. During the brief
conference call, Elson made the motion to fire Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good friend of mine, and it was a very difficult
decision,'' said Elson, a shareholders' advocate whom Dunlap
appointed to the board in September 1996. ``But you have to
separate your personal relationships from your role as a
director.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said the board does not intend to voluntarily negotiate
a severance package for Dunlap. The matter has been referred to the
company's lawyers, who may contend that Dunlap effectively resigned
when he offered to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The board fired Kersh, Dunlap's top lieutenant, on Tuesday.
Christopher Sues, a New York lawyer representing the two, did not
return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the board met with representatives of MacAndrews &AMP;
Forbes Holdings, the corporate arm of financier Ronald Perelman.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman, a part-time resident of Palm Beach, became Sunbeam's
second largest shareholder _ with 13 percent _ when he sold his
Coleman stake to the company in March.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's meeting, the board tapped Levin to replace Dunlap as
CEO. Levin has turned around several of Perelman's companies,
including Coleman and Revlon Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Langerman, Price's representative, is serving as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   While Perelman's man is now in the driver's seat at Sunbeam,
Kristol said the billionaire investor _ who will name two directors
to Sunbeam's board _ wasn't behind Dunlap's firing.
</P>
<P>
   Said Elson: ``We acted proactively by putting the company and
our shareholders first.''

NIGERIA'S VICTORY IS A RECORD FOR ITS YUGOSLAV COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Before these World Cup finals began, Bora Milutinovic
was very close to losing his job for the second time in a year.
Friday, the cosmopolitan Yugoslav became the first man to lead four
different teams into the World Cup's second round.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, Milutinovic's latest and potentially greatest project,
clinched its spot Friday with a 1-0 victory over Bulgaria that was
nowhere near as conservative as its scoreline. Several hours later,
after the other group D match between Spain and Paraguay had ended
in a scoreless draw, Nigeria also clinched first place in a group
that was widely considered the most daunting in this event.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who like the spectacular, we make it spectacular,''
Milutinovic said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerians had every intention of being more spectacular than
in their thrill-a-minute 3-2 victory over Spain in their first
match. Daniel Amokachi, the striker who missed that match because
he was still recovering from a knee injury, predicted four goals
against Bulgaria. Nigeria would have to settle for just one, but it
was a thing of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   It came in the 26th minute after Nigerian playmaker Jay-Jay
Okocha took control of the ball outside the Bulgarian penalty box.
After losing one defender, he passed the ball deftly in the
direction of Amokachi who, with a cocksure thrust of his right leg,
flicked it toward the goal where longtime rival Victor Ikpeba was
waiting. Ikpeba accelerated past Trifon Ivanov and knocked the ball
underneath the armpit of Bulgarian goalkeeper Zdravko Zdravkov.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, that sequence sounds logical, almost clinical, but
what a blow- by-blow description cannot convey is the startling
speed with which the Nigerian stars went about their business.
After the ball had rolled into the net, Ikpeba and Amokachi were
locked in an embrace, their differences in the past overwhelmed by
their delight in the present.
</P>
<P>
   Both 25 and both the sons of Nigerian army officers, their
talent was spotted very early and, like most of their teammates in
this World Cup, both moved to Europe as teenagers to polish their
skills. But while Ikpeba experienced considerable success on the
club level, the more precocious and powerful Amokachi continually
blocked Ikpeba's way onto the national team. Friday, they started
together for only the fourth time in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   With the red-headed Okocha at the controls, Nigeria pushed
forward from the beginning, just as they had four years earlier
when they beat the Bulgarians, 3- 0, in their opening match in the
1994 World Cup finals. That victory hinted at a continental shift
in power, but it would be the Bulgarians who would end up in the
semifinals in the United States and the Nigerians who would end up
losing in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulgarians only made it to the United States because of what
happened in Paris in November 1993, when Emil Kostadinov scored a
last-minute goal to eliminate France from contention. Kostadinov
was back at the Parc des Princes on Friday, along with Hristo
Stoitchkov and five other members of that team, but the stadium and
the French fans exacted a measure of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever one of the key Bulgarians touched the ball in the early
going, he was jeered by the crowd, and despite their considerable
guile and gift for counterattack, they could not find a way to put
the ball past Nigeria's shaky goalkeeper Peter Rufai.
</P>
<P>
   They came agonizingly close but neither Krassimir Balakov in the
41st minute, Stoitchkov in the 65th nor Kostadinov in the 86th
could convert. When Kostadinov's shot glanced off the crossbar, he
screamed in frustration. The Bulgarians had dominated the second
half on the sort of muggy afternoon that one would think would
favor the Africans, but they would get nothing for their efforts,
although they still have a chance to reach the second round if they
defeat Spain on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's final first-round match against Paraguay will be
nothing more than a second-round warmup for Milutinovic and his
players: a remarkable turn of events for a team in great disarray
before this event began. After losing 3-0 to Yugoslavia and 5-1 to
the Netherlands in friendly matches, Nigerian authorities were
seriously considering firing coach Bora Milutinovic and replacing
him with Jo Bonfrere, the Dutchman who coached Nigeria to the
Olympic gold medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But after the sudden death of Nigerian President Sani Abacha,
Milutinovic was given a reprieve, and after Nigeria rallied twice
to defeat Spain, he was given another one. ``If we would have lost
that game, I would have been fired,'' Milutinovic said this week.
</P>
<P>
   His previous second-round appearances were with Mexico in 1986,
Costa Rica in 1990 and the United States in 1994, but he has never
had this sort of talent at his disposal. He only got the
opportunity to coach Nigeria after Mexico fired him late last year.
``I hope this game gives Mexico some inspiration,'' Milutinovic
said sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   It will certainly give Africa some inspiration. After Cameroon
reached the quarterfinals in 1990 behind the thirty-something
heroics of Roger Milla, this could be the year of Amokachi, Ikpeba
and Okocha.

`CNN NEWSSTAND': MOSTLY MORE OF THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``CNN Newsstand,'' the new prime-time cable series, opened on a
controversial note last week with allegations that the United
States used nerve gas against American defectors during the Vietnam
War. The network's chief military analyst, retired Maj. Gen. Perry
Smith, resigned in protest (``sleazy journalism'' he called it) but
the report prompted Defense Secretary William Cohen to order a
fresh inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN Newsstand'' is the overall title for three hourlong weekly
collaborations between the cable network and magazines in the
Time-Warner empire. On Sundays, Time magazine, which carried the
nerve-gas charges, is the partner from print; on Wednesdays, it's
Fortune magazine and the beat is business; on Thursdays, it's
Entertainment Weekly, and the beat is show business.
</P>
<P>
   Time-Warner executives hope that this pooling of resources will
lift CNN's ratings in slow periods when wars or the deaths of
celebrities are not available. At least, it is hoped, the new
entries will give CNN a leg up in the increasingly crowded
news-magazine field. Whether you call it synergy or merger muscle,
the new series is the best the company has come up with to hold
onto some of the many viewers who flip channels after catching
``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the new business and entertainment programs _ plainly
inspired by the popularity of other such shows _ are efficiently
produced, with a mildly irreverent attitude toward the
personalities they perforce celebrate, they do not promise to be
the engines of success the network seeks. On first viewing, it is
hard to see what they offer that is not already either in abundant
supply elsewhere or not particularly worth supplying.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of the content seemed to be determinedly
inconsequential. Among the stories played up on the first business
hour was one about a man who predicts success from the shape of
your eyebrows and nostrils; a profile of a hot-shot computer maker,
and a peek inside corporate jets. The first show-business hour
delivered a report on how public-relations geniuses maneuver to
redeem clients' soiled reputations; the tough life of actresses
over 40, and an interview with Sean Lennon, son of John. All were
mildly diverting but not likely to revolutionize viewing habits.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's hope for making a mark among news fans resides in the
Sunday night program. With two of the network's best-known
personalities _ Bernard Shaw and Jeff Greenfield _ as anchors, it
aspires to more weight and import than its companion entries.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the main story about nerve gas, the premiere carried
a segment on teen-age sex, a news magazine perennial. Particular
attention for some reason was devoted to a Mormon community. There
was nothing especially wrong with the report unless you were hoping
for something surprising.
</P>
<P>
   More provocative was a short final feature called ``The Looking
Glass,'' under the auspices of Greenfield, who has been occupying a
prominent place as a commentator since moving to CNN some months
ago. In this appearance, he chided his audience for hypocrisy for
telling poll takers that they are sick of scandal and violence even
as they tune into Jerry Springer and anything about the president's
sex life instead of brooding over the tribulations of the Asian
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield is a leading proponent of one television school of
how to treat Clintoniana. While others (see ``Hardball'' on CNBC)
keep booking assertive loudmouths to rattle their cages, the
Greenfield school takes an introspective, above-the-commotion
attitude. He draws rueful attention to being in a line of work that
requires wheel-spinning, day after day, about who did or is doing
what to whom in the latest celebrity melodrama, be it about O.J.
Simpson, Diana, Princess of Wales, or Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   His good judgment or taste, as he would be quick to grant, can
have no effect at all on coverage of such tempting tales, certainly
not by his current employer. Yet there is something touching about
the abashed concession by one of television's news stars that his
tribe finds itself consigned to a journalistic netherworld, like
tenors fated to sing ``Pagliacci'' on tour forever and ever.
</P>
<P>
   The second edition of ``Newsstand: CNN and Time'' on Sunday led
off with a report on the propensity of some NBA athletes,
millionaires all, for fathering illegitimate children and then
failing to support them either financially or emotionally. From
another report, we learned that the new drug of choice among
youngsters is methamphetamine, street name ``crank,'' which can
produce symptoms of paranoia. And there was a brief epilogue of
conflicting testimony on the nerve-gas story. With its combination
of proven ingredients (money, sex, children, drugs) and its
hard-edge &UR;  &LR; reporting and soft-focus production, the program made a
professional, if not spectacularly fresh, package.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Asian economy went unmentioned, a few minutes was
given to the opinion, delivered by Walter Isaacson, managing editor
of Time, that the recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan were
unsettling. His contribution seemed like an inexpensive gesture on
behalf of Greenfield's campaign to acknowledge the existence of
significant stories that are not natural news magazine audience
grabbers.
</P>
<P>
   In the same spirit, Shaw promised that ``CNN Newsstand'' would
devote less time than the competition to the Clinton-Starr-Lewinsky
operetta, a pledge that did not apply to his network. The next day
and night found CNN on the case as usual; among the journalists
assembled by ``Larry King Live,'' that major merchandiser of
celebrity chat, was CNN's senior analyst, Jeff Greenfield.

 &HT;    DESPITE NEW RULES, POULTRY PROCESSORS MAY CONTINUE TO SALVAGE
EXCREMENT-TAINTED CHICKEN
 &HT;    By ELLIOT JASPIN and MIKE WARD
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite new rules that are supposed to reduce fecal
contamination in food, the Agriculture Department continues to
allow poultry processors to salvage chicken tainted with excrement
and sell it to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The department's Food Safety and Inspection Service once
required poultry known to be contaminated with bacteria-laden feces
to be trimmed away and discarded. Current procedures allow
processors to rinse it in chlorinated water or cook it without even
washing it first.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say these measures prevent contaminated food from
reaching America's dinner tables.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates say Agriculture Department food safety
rules are so ineffective that most raw chicken at a supermarket has
evidence of fecal contamination. They point to a recent Consumer
Reports study that found bacteria linked to feces on 71 percent of
the raw chicken purchased in stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department's own studies show an even worse
situation. In a 1994 study, government scientists discovered 88
percent of the chicken carcasses they tested from major poultry
producers had been contaminated with bacteria found in excrement.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, which are found
in fecal contamination, are estimated by government scientists to
sicken over 4 million people each year and cause over 3,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, says Jack Leighty, a retired high-ranking
Agriculture Department scientist, is that using chlorinated water
to disinfect chicken is ``essentially worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics also dispute government and industry claims that
cooking fecally-contaminated chicken will render it safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooked filth is not the definition of wholesome,'' argues
Felicia Nestor, a food safety expert at the Government
Accountability Project, a consumer group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the Agriculture Department stopped keeping track
of how much salvaged chicken is sold to consumers. But Jacque (CQ)
Knight, a department spokeswoman, estimated the total last year
alone may have been 800 million pounds _ approximately two percent
of all chicken processed in the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fecal contamination in a poultry processing plant typically
occurs when a machine that scoops internal organs out of chicken
carcasses unintentionally punctures the digestive tract, releasing
feces onto the carcass.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department requirement that poultry producers
either throw away chicken with visible fecal contamination or trim
away the fouled area, was discarded following a 1977 study that
concluded that washing carcasses was as effective as trimming them.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Tucker Foremen, who as assistant secretary for Food and
Consumer Services at the time approved allowing chicken to be
washed and put back into production, now says the decision was a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad decision,'' Foreman said in an interview. ``The
study was questionable. Nobody has defended it to this day.'' She
said she also regrets the decision because the earlier policy of
forcing companies to throw away contaminated carcasses was ``a
penalty that made the plants take greater care.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Agriculture Department began phasing in a
new inspection system called HACCP, an acronym for Hazard Analysis
and Critical Control Points. In the first phase, 312 of the largest
meat and poultry plants were required to operate under HACCP rules.
</P>
<P>
   The new inspection program turns over many of the traditional
inspection functions of government to private industry while at the
same time requiring companies to use various scientific measures to
quickly locate and correct production problems.
</P>
<P>
   But government records show the new inspection system has done
little to change the practice of salvaging contaminated chicken.
Agriculture Department documents obtained by Cox Newspapers detail
how between January and March of this year Arkansas-based Tyson
Foods, the nation's largest poultry producer, used salvage
procedures on approximately 29 tons of chicken from two of its
plants. Both plants are subject to the new HACCP rules.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the chicken came from a Tyson plant in Waldron, Ark.
that had the worst inspection record of any plant in the United
States during 1996, the most recent year for which government
records are available.
</P>
<P>
   During that year, federal inspectors cited the plant for 1,753
critical violations. A critical violation is one which federal
inspectors believe is certain to result in adulterated or
mislabeled food reaching the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 14, the plant was temporarily closed for the first time
in its history by the federal government. At the time it was
closed, federal officials said there were numerous sanitary
violations, including fecal contamination, at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   What the Agriculture Department did not disclose at the time it
announced the closure was that it allowed the company to salvage
chicken that had been in the plant production line when it was
forced to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   A government form that tracks product moved between plants shows
that on Jan. 16 a truckload of chicken from the plant was sent to
another Tyson Plant in Berryville, Ark., which prepares various
cooked chicken products. The form bears a notation that chicken on
the truck was ``to be cooked only'' because of sanitary violations.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials in Washington said department
inspectors never directly inspected the chicken when it arrived at
Berryville because both the Waldron plant and the Berryville
facility were operating under the new HACCP regulations. Instead,
the inspections were done by plant employees.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bill Smith, the Assistant Deputy Administrator for
District Inspections and Operations at the Agriculture Department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), said federal inspectors
approved how Tyson handled the chicken. And while they filed no
written reports, Smith said he was sure there was no problem.
</P>
<P>
   While Smith initially said there was a ``100 percent
inspection'' of all suspect chickens, he later said Tyson inspected
a random sample of chickens that arrived in Berryville from the
Waldron plant. The random sample meant there was a 95 percent
chance there was no visible fecal matter on the product, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, who monitored the process, said the
company then cooked the chicken at 160 degrees. Agriculture
Department regulations treat cooking as a ``kill step,'' which will
destroy any harmful bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what happened to the cooked chicken after it
left the Berryville facility.
</P>
<P>
   While the Berryville plant processes chicken sold at fast-food
restaurants, Tyson officials declined to say where the chicken was
sold, saying such information was proprietary.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Nestor said it surprised her that the government allowed
any chicken to be used from a plant that had to be shut down for
sanitary violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are producing products in a process that is out of
control enough that they are going to shut a plant down,'' Nestor
said, ``what confidence can you have in the products that were
produced in that plant?''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government allowed the Waldron plant to re-open a
few days later after the company said it had made various reforms.
But Tyson Foods, whose motto is ``Feeding you like family,'' was in
trouble again in April. Agriculture Department officials closed the
plant for several days, saying management ``does not have the
ability...to prevent contamination or adulteration of product at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   While cooking was used to make the poultry from the Waldron
plant safe to eat, Tyson used a chlorinated rinse at its plant in
Clarksville, Ark., when it found fecal contamination there on March
13, a practice allowed under HACCP.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Agriculture Department and Tyson officials insisted in
interviews that all the chicken at the plant was closely checked
and found to be wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find fecal material, it is removed. Let me be very clear
about that,'' said Bill Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Just as adamant was Archibald Schaffer III, a vice president of
Tyson Foods, who said ``None of the product in question was found
to be contaminated with fecal material, and we trust that your
reporting will not say or imply that it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer currently is under federal indictment for allegedly
giving gifts to former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy and then
lying about it. Last year, Tyson Foods pleaded guilty to giving
Espy $12,000 in favors.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Smith-DeWaal, director of food safety at the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, cautioned that removing any visible
signs of fecal contamination is not the only concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washing if off will remove visible signs of fecal
contamination, but it may not remove the bacteria,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bacteria may be on the carcasses even if there (aren't)
visible signs of contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   To kill that bacteria, poultry processors rinse chicken with
chlorinated water at a government-recommended level of 20 parts per
million (ppm).
</P>
<P>
   Although the government describes chlorinated water as ``an
anti-microbial agent,'' Jack Leighty, who held several high ranking
positions in FSIS, including chief of the laboratory branch, says
that using chlorinated water to decontaminate chickens is
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   He cited one study done in 1984 that found concentrations of 200
ppm _ ten times the mandated level _ had no impact on fecal
bacteria. If poultry processors used chlorine concentrations above
200 ppm, Leighty said, the chicken would be unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Emswiler-Rose, one of the authors of the study that
Leighty cited, said the concentrations of chlorine in the lab were
much higher than they would have to be in a commercial application
because of the nature of her experiment.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said she never did another study to determine what
would constitute effective chlorine levels in a poultry processing
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ken Petersen, a veterinary medical officer at the
Agriculture Department, cited two studies that he said showed the
effectiveness of chlorinated water.
</P>
<P>
   However, one study he showed reporters actually used tap water.
It was, coincidentally, the same study used by Foreman in 1977 when
she decided to allow salvaging chicken. It was also the study
Foreman later said was based on questionable science and which she
said is considered unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   The second study offered by Petersen showed that the incidence
of bacteria on chickens with visible contamination was
approximately the same after being sprayed with a chlorine rinse as
on birds that were not contaminated. However, the study did not
measure the bacteria levels on birds that had been contaminated but
not sprayed.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Petersen contended the study showed the
effectiveness of using chlorinated water.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Yankees-Braves: Godzilla, without the happy ending.
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're allergic to overkill, it's time to take cover with the
wife and kids. The schedule shows Yankees-Braves. Twice. We're
talking about a two-game series in New York next week (week of June
22 - 28) followed by another in Atlanta, and we're talking about
all of those words and videos involving an interleague matchup that
isn't happening in October.
</P>
<P>
   This ugly outbreak of Yankees-Braves games is among the worst
things that could happen to those among us who wish for hype not to
conquer reality when it comes to interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, many lost their minds around Chicago when
the White Sox and Cubs played before stuffed houses at Wrigley
Field. The same hysteria occurred in Boston's Fenway Park, where
the Mets visited the Red Sox for the first time since the 1986
World Series. And the Indians' trip to Cincinnati produced the
biggest home crowds for the Reds during a three-game series since
about the time the Ohio River was invented.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, for each of these interleague series featuring the
Cubs and the White Sox, there are several others featuring the
Brewers and the Royals. As for the latter, the masses definitely
are not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the baseball owners just don't understand that the, ahem,
success of interleague play is simply a mirage. In fact, the worst
thing that could happen here is for the players to agree this
summer to allow the owners to turn this two-year experiment into a
permanent monster.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what monsters do? They destroy. Approving
interleague play for the ages would be baseball's version of
constructing its own Godzilla _ you know, without the happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Interleague play is a gimmick, and like all gimmicks, it worked
in the beginning. Last year, for instance, attendance rose 38
percent during that first round of interleague games. And what the
owners like to mention is that the first round this season also
showed a dandy increase. Oh, but this is what they don't tell you:
America is starting to say, ``Been there, done that,'' for anything
shy of Yankees-Braves, and after next week, America will say the
same even for a matchup such as that.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the sliding numbers. After this year's first round
of interleague games, the increase in attendance was 12 percent
less than the increase after last year's first round. Not only
that, you'll see even more of a dropoff in that percentage of
increase after Part II of this year's interleague play next week.
But it won't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Since interleague play hasn't fully run its course, the owners
will look only at its short-term success and ask the players to
feed this monster that will bring long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   There is the All-Star Game, for instance. And don't forget about
the World Series. Once, they featured the only meetings between the
American and National leagues during a season. No more. And here's
the point: Even before interleague play, television ratings were
dwindling for both.
</P>
<P>
   So what would a permanent dose of interleague play do? It would
create this scary movie called, ``Baseball's Godzilla swallows
what's left of the All-Star Game and the World Series _ and thus
the game itself.''

 &HT;    New GW coach Penders says he'll get support he didn't at Texas
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Among the virtues Tom Penders extolled about his new
job at George Washington University is the support of his athletic
director, something Penders said he believed was lacking last
season in his final year as men's basketball coach at the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Penders, the winningest men's coach in UT history who resigned
under pressure this spring, was introduced in Washington, D.C. as
coach of the Colonials of the Atlantic-10 Conference. He replaces
Mike Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   Penders, 53, is a childhood friend of George Washington Athletic
Director Jack Kvancz.
</P>
<P>
   While never mentioning UT Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds by
name, Penders indicated he felt he lost Dodds' support this year.
He referred specifically to the fact that Dodds waited several days
to tell Penders about a meeting four players had at Dodds' home the
day after the season ended to express concerns about the direction
of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This past year I just felt quite simply that my athletic
director was undermining me,'' Penders said. ``... I just felt it
was clear to me that I could not work for my athletic director.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working with an athletic director (Kvancz) that I totally
trust. I've lost a lot of weight this year ... and I feel like I
lost another 50 pounds when I took the steel plate out of my back
when I left Texas,'' added Penders, making a knife-in-the-back
reference. ``I don't have to worry about that here. I have people
that are going to work with me to bring GW the very, very best.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodds declined to respond to Penders' remarks, saying, ``We
appreciate the good things he did for the university, and we wish
him well in his new challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Penders resigned April 2 with four years left on a contract that
had an annual base salary of $550,000. Penders received a payment
of $643,000 when he left UT.
</P>
<P>
   Penders accepted a multiyear deal with the Colonials. His base
pay is expected to range between $450,000 and $500,000, plus
incentives. After leaving UT, Penders signed with Host
Communications to do broadcasting work, but said he had a clause
allowing him to pursue other coaching jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a coach who wants to coach,'' he said. ``This is what I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Penders said he had one assistant on his Texas staff ``I would
love to bring with me,'' but declined to name him. His top
assistant, Eddie Oran, accepted reponsibility for faxing the
academic progress report of freshman guard Luke Axtell to KVET-AM
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Penders stressed that his problems at Texas were solely with
Dodds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the University of Texas. I have many friends from the
chancellor on down to people on the board of regents, but it was
time to part ways,'' he said. ``The saddest part is I left great
players like Kris Clack and Chico Vazquez behind, who I love
dearly. They're my seniors, my captains. But you cannot succeed
without the support of your athletic director.''
</P>
<P>
   UT President Larry Faulkner wished the best for Penders, who in
10 seasons with the Longhorns had a 208-110 record with eight trips
to the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tom Penders had a long run as a successful coach at
the University of Texas, and I think we still have very positive
feelings about the contributions he made to our program,'' Faulkner
said. ``I wish him well in the future, however he decides to try
and develop that future.''

Thescelasaurus dinosaur for transport to Montana State University's

training program. Launched in 1992 under the leadership of
then-Senate Armed Forces Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., it was

their hands without a Soviet threat to confront. Since then, the
U.S. armed forces have been downsized dramatically and stretched
thin as they have been dispatched to trouble spots around the
globe. But the civil-military programs have continued, despite
questions about how carefully they have been monitored. (Malone,

   CONGRESS-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ In a significant test of
strength, the coalition supporting bipartisan legislation to
overhaul the campaign finance law won a series of House votes on
Friday and drew an unexpectedly large number of Republicans to its
side. On one key test, 65 Republicans voted to preserve the
legislation sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and
Martin Meehan, D-Mass. The bill is one of a dozen proposals up for
consideration in a free-for-all over the campaign finance laws. By

   MIAMI-CORRUPT (Miami) _ Bribery. Kickbacks. Voter fraud.
Cover-up. Even as law enforcement officials promise more arrests,
the city of Miami is now engulfed in a series of high-profile

corruption it is now often mentioned in the same breath as New York
during the so-called city scandals and Chicago during the heyday of
the Democratic machine. By Mireya Navarro.

   PRESBY-GUNS (Undated) Striking an unusally personal note in the
national debate on gun control, the top policy-making body of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has passed a resolution calling on the
denomination's 2.6 million members to ``work toward removing
handguns and assault weapons'' from their homes and communities.
Presbyterian officials and other church leaders said the assembly's
resolution takes a new tack in asking directly for individual
action by church members, rather than seeking governmental
legislation. By Gustav Niebuhr.

   COLOMBIA-COCA-HERBICIDE (Bogota, Colombia) _ The Colombian

manufacturer against its use in Colombia. By Diana Jean Schemo.

   SPOCK-VEGETARIAN (Undated) _ The late Dr. Benjamin Spock,
arguably the most influential pediatrician of all time, has left
children and their parents with a surprising and rather demanding
legacy: advice that they stick to a vegetarian diet devoid of all
dairy products after the age of two. In the seventh edition of his
world-famous book, ``Baby and Child Care,'' issued last month by
Pocket Books just weeks after his death at age 94, he recommends an
approach to childhood nutrition that many experts, including his
co-author, Dr. Steven J. Parker, consider too extreme and likely to
result in nutritional deficiencies. By Jane Brody.

HIGH COURT EXPECTED TO DECIDE SEX HARASSMENT CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 21)   (For use by the New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beginning Monday, the Supreme Court is expected to
decide, in little more than a week, cases involving sexual
harassment on the job, attorney-client privilege after the client
dies, the president's line-item veto and the treatment of HIV
patients.
</P>
<P>
   By its tentatively scheduled June 29 adjournment, the court will
have produced 90 formal opinions, the highest number since it
disposed of 107 cases in its 1992-1993 term. It decided 80 cases
last year and 75 the year before. It now has 14 cases left to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   Already this term, it ruled unanimously that Title VII of the
1964 Civil Rights Act forbids men to harass other men as well as
women. By a 6-3 vote, it said the Constitution does not compel
publicly-owned TV stations to open political debates to all
candidates on the ballot, and in a 5-4 decision it said credit
unions should not have been allowed to enroll as members workers in
jobs or firms outside those that the credit unions were originally
set up to serve.
</P>
<P>
   In the pending sexual harassment cases, the justices are
considering whether employers should be held financially
responsible for a supervisor's sexual misconduct when the victim
complained to another supervisor and whether a school district is
liable for a teacher's harassment of a student.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the question is whether a company is
responsible if one of its supervisors harassed a woman and
threatened to make her job difficult unless she succumbed to his
advances but never carried out the threat. She alleged that even
though she received a promotion, she felt compelled to resign
because of a hostile work environment.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decisions in the cases could have a tremendous
impact on workplaces around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases should lay the groundwork for when employers must
pay for the actions of their employees, and that could be felt in
every office,'' says Joan Williams, a constitutional law professor
at American University here who specializes in women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   Several women's groups have filed briefs arguing that holding
employers financially responsible for their workers' behavior would
help deter abuse on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If employers know that they'll have to pay when someone is
harassed, you can bet they'll do a better job at making sure their
employees know that it's wrong and will not be tolerated,'' says
Kim Gandy, executive vice president of the National Organization
for Women.
</P>
<P>
   But many employers have contended that they cannot constantly
police the workplace for sexual abuse, and they worry that they
will be punished for actions that are beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could open businesses up to a huge wave of sexual
harassment lawsuits,'' says Stephen Bokat, senior vice president
and general counsel of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Employers
shouldn't be held liable unless they knew or should have known that
there was a problem,'' Bokat adds.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether a lawyer can be forced to disclose
confidences of a client after the client dies arises from
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's probe of President and Mrs.
Clinton. Starr wants the confidential notes of a conversation that
the late deputy White House counsel, Vincent Foster Jr., had with
his lawyer, James Hamilton, nine days before Foster committed
suicide in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the conversation, Foster was embroiled in a
controversy surrounding the May 1993 firing of seven employees at
the White House travel office. Starr says the notes could be
important to his investigation into allegations that White House
aides or Hillary Rodham Clinton lied about the her role in the
firings.
</P>
<P>
   The line item veto case involves the constitutionality of the
1996 law in which Congress voluntarily surrendered to the president
the authority to shape spending and tax legislation, permitting him
to cancel individual items within five days of signing a bill into
law.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by
six members of Congress, but it dismissed their suit, saying they
had not suffered any actual injury because of the veto, which at
that point Clinton had not exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the president has canceled 82 items in 11 laws. One
was a Medicaid tax benefit to New York City. The city, which claims
it was injured by the veto, is challenging the law.
</P>
<P>
   In the HIV case, the justices will rule on whether the 1990
Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination
against disabled people in employment, housing, and public
accommodations and services, applies to a person who has the human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, but who has not
developed any of the AIDS symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Abbott of Bangor, Maine, sued a dentist who refused to
treat her in his office after she informed him that she had HIV. He
offered to treat her at a hospital, but she claimed that would have
unfairly forced her to pay an extra $150.
</P>
<P>
   The court also will rule on whether the government, in
considering applications for financial grants by artists, has the
authority to judge whether their work meets certain standards of
decency.
</P>
<P>
   The case was brought by Karen Finley of New York City and three
other performance artists whose request for grants from the
National Endowment for the Arts was denied in 1990. Then-NEA
Chairman John Frohmeyer rejected the artists' bids because he said
their works didn't reflect the ``general standards of decency''
clause written into the law by Congress earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the decency clause shortly after a public
outrage erupted over the discovery that government money had funded
such art exhibits as Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs of
homosexual acts.

CONGRESSMAN EXPRESSES CONCERN ABOUT MARINE HANDLING OF BORDER
SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of a House immigration panel said Friday
he was dissatisfied with a Marine Corps investigation that cleared
an anti-drug patrol in the shooting death of a young man along the
Rio Grande last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee
on immigration, said the report that found no criminal wrongdoing
by the four-man Marine patrol raised questions about training and
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the year-long Marine Corps investigation were made
public after the Navy released documents on the shooting to Smith,
whose subcommittee is investigating the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, R-Texas, said the Marine investigation ``just makes me
want to ask more questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Esequiel Hernandez Jr., 18, was herding is family's goats near
the Rio Grande in the Big Bend region of Texas when he was shot to
death on May 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal grand juries returned no indictments against
Cpl. Clemente Banuelos, who said he shot Hernandez after the young
Texan fired two rounds at the Marines. There were three other
Marines in Banuelos' patrol.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department investigation into the shooting also found
no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the soldiers, who were part
of the Joint Task Force 6 surveillance unit providing
anti-narcotics smuggling information to federal law enforcement
agencies. They were operating under the civilian authority of the
U.S. Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never know what was in Esequiel Hernandez's mind,''
said Capt. Craig Quigley, a spokesman for Navy Secretary John
Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that young Marine clearly thought the lives of his
teammates were in danger, and he acted accordingly,'' Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps' admission that support for border missions was
at times less than acceptable has attracted Smith's attention, and
he wants to know the chain of events that led to the order to fire
on the young goat herder.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Marine Corps statement about the investigation,
``Officers in the chain of command who had direct responsibility
for supervision and support have been officially counseled in
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides are examining 20 boxes of documents received
from the Marines Corps, which is part of the Navy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is calling for a full public accounting of the shooting
death. Because of the amount of information being examined, he
said, a hearing, if one is warranted, would not likely occur until
after Congress' August recess.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Weinacht, a lawyer representing the Hernandez family, could
not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Marine Corps investigation, the four-member
patrol was watching activity along the Rio Grande near Redford,
Texas, at dusk when they spotted Hernandez carrying a rifle. Marine
investigators said Hernandez fired two shots at the patrol, ``then
moved in a manner adjacent to the Marines, which caused the team to
believe he was trying to outflank them.''
</P>
<P>
   The patrol then ``moved for 20 minutes in a manner to ensure
visual contact while awaiting the arrival of the Border Patrol, and
in order to maintain their self-defensive posture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marines determined the patrol acted within the scope of its
duties and complied with the ``rules of engagement, which include
the inherent right of self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis,'' Marine investigators said, the patrol
``believed their lives were threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acting in self-defense, they used the basic tactical training
skills they learned at the School of Infantry and in subsequent
unit training,'' it concluded.

COLOMBIA TO TEST HERBICIDE AGAINST COCA CROPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Bowing to demands from Washington, the
Colombian government has agreed to test a granular herbicide to
kill coca crops, despite public warnings from the chemical's
American manufacturer against its use in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the herbicide, tebuthiuron, is used mostly
to control weeds on railroad beds and under high-voltage lines far
away from food crops and people.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency requires a warning label on
the chemical that says it could contaminate ground water, a side
effect Colombian environmental officials fear could prevent
peasants from growing food where coca once grew.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have decided to concentrate more heavily on
treating illegal drug crops with chemicals, particularly in parts
of southern Colombia under the control of leftist guerrillas. Those
guerrillas have fired on aircraft attempting to spray herbicides on
coca crops. But tebuthiuron can be dropped instead of sprayed,
making the task easier under such conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in fumigation comes at the expense of other
measures to control drug smuggling, a recent U.S. government
investigation concluded.
</P>
<P>
   American and Colombian police officials say that a granular
herbicide will be more effective in the battle to control drugs.
For four years, they have used a liquid toxin, glifosate, that has
destroyed only 30 percent of the plants sprayed. Despite the
effort, the amount of coca in Colombia has yet to decline, because
eradication has prompted farmers to move and plant coca elsewhere.
Last year, Colombia became the world's leading coca grower.
</P>
<P>
   American and Colombian authorities also contend that tebuthiuron
offers greater protection from gunfire for pilots, who must now fly
low to fumigate in the early morning hours, when winds are calm and
temperatures are lower. Tebuthiuron pellets can be dropped from
higher altitudes in virtually any weather, making pilots less
vulnerable to gunfire, police officials here said. Washington has
lobbied Andean governments to accept tebuthiuron for more than a
decade, even though the chemical's manufacturer, Dow AgroSciences,
a subsidiary of Dow Chemical Co., strongly opposes its use in
Colombia. ``Tebuthiuron is not labeled for use on any crops in
Colombia, and it is our desire that the product not be used for
coca eradication as well,'' the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Tebuthiuron granules, sold commercially as Spike 20P, should be
used ``carefully and in controlled situations,'' Dow cautioned,
because ``it can be very risky in situations where terrain has
slopes, rainfall is significant, desirable plants are nearby and
application is made under less than ideal circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning is a rough description of conditions in Colombia's
coca growing regions. Dow, which faced years of lawsuits and public
protest over the use of its Agent Orange defoliant during the
Vietnam war, said that if approached, it would refuse to sell
tebuthiuron for use in Colombia. However, American officials note
Dow's patent on the chemical has expired, allowing others to make
it legally.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in Colombia, including Eduardo Verano, the nation's
environmental minister, say the health effects of tebuthiuron on
farming areas are unknown, and its use will only increase
deforestation by pushing coca growers deeper into forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reconsider the benefits of the chemical war,'' said
Verano. ``The more you fumigate, the more the farmers plant. If you
fumigate one hectare, they'll grow coca on two more. How else do
you explain the figures?''
</P>
<P>
   American officials, backed by Colombian police, maintain the
benefits outweigh the environmental risks. The liquid herbicide
used now, at a cost of millions of dollars to the United States,
has mostly been washed away in the heavy rainfall of the Amazon,
said Luiz Eduardo Parra, environmental auditor of Colombia's
anti-narcotics squad.
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador to Colombia, Curtis Kamman, said, ``For
a net environmental positive effect, getting rid of coca is the
best course for Colombia.'' Research in Hawaii, Panama and Peru by
the U.S. Agriculture Department concluded that tebuthiuron would
persist in Colombian soil for less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Where once the United States concentrated on arresting drug
barons, smashing their organizations and seizing their wealth, the
new strategy involves greater fumigation and the interception of
boats that may be carrying drugs or chemicals needed to make
cocaine from the coca.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the State Department's acting assistant secretary of
state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, Rand
Beers, outlined a plan to increase fumigation in the southern
provinces of Caqueta and Putumayo, and asked Congress to pump $21
million more into the $30 million counter-narcotics budget for
Colombia this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said that drug traffickers made a strategic decision to grow
coca in Southern Colombia because of American success in blocking
Peruvian drug planes that fly raw paste to Colombia where it it is
made into cocaine. The United States must seize the opportunity to
prevent Colombian-grown coca from taking its place, he told
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. intelligence analysts say these statements exaggerate
the victory at intercepting drug planes, and that coca base is
still reaching Colombia from Bolivia and Peru. According to U.S.
government figures, 78 percent of the cocaine leaving Colombia is
made from coca grown elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, in a February 1998 report,
concluded that a dramatic increase in coca fumigation and drug
interception in Colombia was ill-planned, and shortchanged other
anti-narcotics programs.
</P>
<P>
   While coca fumigation of rebel-held areas is a subject of heated
debate here, one point is not in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy draws the Colombian military into the war on
drugs in an unprecedented way, while sharpening American attention
on the main concern of the Colombian military: its longstanding war
with leftist rebels, particularly the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, Latin America's oldest and strongest insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The growing strength of the FARC rebels, who advocate
nationalization of Colombia's oil and other natural resources, has
become a serious concern in Washington.

</P>
<P>
   Colombian officials say a turning point in their estimation of
the rebels' strength occurred two years ago, when coca farmers in
Southern Colombia battled security forces over government efforts
to ration cement and gasoline which are used to make coca paste.
The demonstrations were taken as a barometer of the growers'
potential support for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FARC is their party, their benefactor,'' said one American
intelligence analyst. ``The kind of thing you want to do is go
after the rebels' base of support.''
</P>
<P>
   But Col. Leonardo Gallego, counter-narcotics chief of the
Colombian National Police, denied that increased fumigation was
part of any plan to strike at the guerrillas. The ``primary
objective'' was destroying coca and recovering the environment
destroyed through coca farming, he said. ``Whatever other goals are
achieved through these operations is completely secondary, and
would be solely the result of any ties between guerrillas and
growers,'' said Gallego.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo Garcia, nom de guerre of a member of the FARC's
international commission, vowed that intensive eradication in the
group's strongholds would lead to open warfare. U.S. intelligence
analysts estimate the FARC collects upwards of $100 million a year
in commissions from the drug business, but Garcia contended that
the rebels supported the growers out of political necessity alone.
He acknowledged that the guerrillas collect commissions from the
drug trade but said they also do so from other sectors of the
economy, including banana and coffee growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campesino has the right to defend himself and to defend
the only thing he has to survive on _ his plot of land,'' Garcia
said. ``People themselves go in search of weapons. So what can we
do? We're going to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Parra, of the Colombian police, argues that the damage that
occurs when peasants clear rain forest and mountain areas to grow
coca and opium poppies far outweigh whatever harm tebuthiuron may
represent.
</P>
<P>
   But Verano, the environmental minister, argues that the solution
may be worse than the problem, and suggests the U.S. government
should control the export of excessive amounts of chemicals like
ether, acetone, cement and gasoline. It takes some 155,000 tons of
these materials to process coca in Colombia, less than 6 percent of
which were seized by Colombian police last year, Verano said.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ In one of the worst attacks on Hindu
civilians in nine years of war in Kashmir, 25 men taking part in
wedding parties were killed on Friday by gunmen armed with
automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials in Kashmir said the killings, attributed to
Pakistan-backed Muslim insurgent groups, occurred as members of two
wedding parties drank tea at a village stall while waiting for a
bus to take them home after the weddings. The officials said five
gunmen arrived in a stolen jeep, took cash and jewelry from the
wedding guests at gunpoint, then separated the men and opened fire.
The two bridegrooms were among those killed.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, in a remote rural area in the southern part of
Kashmir, marked the third time in six months that large groups of
Hindu civilians have been singled out for slaying by gunmen who
have been identified by Indian officials as Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on members of the Hindu minority in the territory have a
deep political resonance for India, which has been in dispute with
Pakistan over Kashmir ever since Pakistan was carved out of India
as a haven for Muslims in the partition of 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In January, 23 Hindu civilians were gunned down in a village
north of Srinagar, the state's summer capital. The slayings
occurred in a part of the Kashmir Valley that was home to more than
100,000 Hindus before the insurgency, many of whom fled at an early
stage of the conflict to Hindu majority areas around Jammu, in the
southern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Then in April, 29 Hindu villagers, including 13 women and
children, were killed in a remote mountain district in the Udhampur
district, between Srinagar and Jammu.
</P>
<P>
   That massacre caused a wave of outrage across India that was
compounded by the accounts given by survivors, who said the killers
struck after the villagers refused demands from the gunmen that
they become Muslims and prove their conversion by eating beef. This
is forbidden among Hindus, who regard cows as sacred. The survivors
said that the killers forced other villagers to watch as they
singled out their victims, killing many of them by cutting their
throats.
</P>
<P>
   Since it began in 1989, the Kashmir insurgency has taken at
least 20,000 lives _ India's official estimate _ and perhaps as
many as 50,000 _ the figure given by Muslim guerrilla groups. At
least half the casualties have been civilians, and many of them
have been killed in what international human rights groups have
described as a pattern of abuses by Indian security forces and
Muslim insurgents. In scores of cases chronicled by the rights
groups, the two sides have made civilians their targets.
</P>
<P>
   But the massacres of Hindus in recent months have raised
especially strong feelings elsewhere in India, especially in the
period since March, when a new government took power in New Delhi
that is headed by the Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu nationalist
group that has traditionally followed a hard-line policy on
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   After the April killings, top officials of the new government
vowed to step up the war against the insurgents, and warned of
possible retaliation against Pakistan, which India has accused of
training, arming and financing the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings were stepped up after India's underground nuclear
tests last month, raising fears that India might pursue insurgents
into the part of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan, risking a wider
war between the two nations. When Pakistan detonated its own
nuclear tests two weeks after India's, the United States and other
countries expressed alarm at the heightened tensions and urged both
countries to open immediate discussions on Kashmir settlement.
</P>
<P>
   India's home minister, L.K. Advani, who recently assumed overall
control of Indian policy in the state, described the killing of the
wedding guests on Friday as ``a clear attempt at ethnic cleansing''
and said responsibility for the attack, and the other massacres of
Hindus, rested with Pakistan. Advani ordered additional Indian
troops moved into the area of the attack, in the Doda district of
southern Kashmir, and said the assailants would be hunted down.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee issued his own condemnation,
saying India would exact the ``sternest'' punishment on the
insurgents, whom he described as ``enemies of peace.'' Vajpayee,
widely viewed as a moderate among the Hindu nationalists who
dominate in the government, has repeatedly appealed to Pakistan in
recent weeks for talks on nuclear and other issues. But he has
refused Pakistan's demand for foreign mediation in the Kashmir
dispute, saying the issue must be settled directly by India and
Pakistan.

in their coverage. That's in sharp contrast to Friday's
announcement by Oakland-based Kaiser Permanente Group that it will
not pay for the pill. Kaiser, the nation's largest HMO, said that
at $10 a dose Viagra is just too expensive. By Ben Sullivan. (Will

LOW AUTO INVENTORIES MAY WEAKEN SEASONAL SALES DISCOUNTS

   DETROIT _ The best time to buy a new car is August or September,
right? Perhaps not this year: The end-of-the-model-year clearance
may have already begun.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers usually offer their best deals in late summer and early
fall, as dealers try to clear their lots and showrooms to make room
for the next year's models. This year, however, supplies are
already low, thanks to a hearty economy, near-record vehicle sales,
generous sales incentives and a spreading auto worker strike
against General Motors Corp. With fewer cars to sell, manufacturers
are likely to cut back on their inducements to buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The axiom that the best deals of the year are in the third
quarter, at the end of the model year, could take a hiatus this
year,'' George Pipas, a Ford Motor Co. spokesman, said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. vehicle sales reached 1.5 million cars and trucks in May,
making it the strongest month since September 1986. The seasonally
adjusted annual selling rate reached 16.3 million, the best level
since October 1987, and the trend appears to be continuing this
month.
</P>
<P>
   James Holden, Chrysler Corp.'s executive vice president for
sales and marketing, said Chrysler's sales have been strong this
month. In May, Chrysler sold 250,000 cars and trucks, a one-month
record.
</P>
<P>
   The strong car and truck sales are set against the backdrop of a
robust economy, and low interest rates have brought a wave of
mortgage refinancings, putting more money in Americans' pockets.
But vehicle manufacturers have also offered sweeteners, spending as
much as $1,700 a vehicle on sales incentives like cash rebates,
low-interest loans and discount coupons in May and June, up from
about $1,100 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In April, after GM's share of the U.S. vehicle market fell below
30 percent, the company sent previous customers certificates of
$500 to $1,000 to use toward the purchase of 50 models, above and
beyond other incentives. Ford and Chrysler matched GM's program
with their own loyalty incentives and agreed to accept GM's
certificates. GM has declined to take coupons from Ford and
Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   The loyalty programs expire July 2 and are unlikely to be
continued in their current form. ``My guess is they will expire and
be replaced with something else that is not quite as expensive for
the automakers,'' said David Healy, the auto analyst for Burnham
Securities in New York. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The industry is now closely watching strike developments at GM,
the largest automaker. Since workers at two Michigan parts
factories walked out two weeks ago, 19 of GM's 29 North American
assembly plants have shut down, idling 80,000 workers. Analysts say
that if the strike is not settled soon it is likely to last into
mid-July, when a two-week plant shutdown was previously scheduled.
The strike, along with healthy spring sales, have caused supplies
of GM's cars and trucks, especially the most popular models, to
dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Inventories are particularly low of two all-new compact cars,
the Pontiac Grand Am/Oldsmobile Alero, that were just introduced;
of the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon sport utilities, and of the
Chevrolet Malibu sedan. If the strike continues, it could interfere
with production of GM's most important models: all-new, full-size
Chevrolet and GMC pickups that replace the company's highly
profitable, best-selling vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the strike lasts, the more dealers will find
themselves short of popular models,'' Healy said. ``GM will have
nothing to sell, so it won't need incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that incentives will disappear. The intense
competition of 1998 may well intensify in the 1999 model year,
which begins in October. ``I don't think the long-term landscape
has changed that much, but the short-term landscape may well
change,'' Pipas said.
</P>
<P>
   As Holden put it: ``Consumer incentives will continue, but the
war is over.''

COMMUNITY LEADERS ANNOUNCE AGREEMENT WITH DILLARD'S INC. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A group of community leaders on Thursday
announced an agreement with Dillard's Inc. that included an apology
from the retailer for any past mistakes in dealing with minorities
and measures to correct any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dillard's is to be applauded for their movement,'' Kansas City
Mayor Emanuel Cleaver said. ``I'm pleased to say that.'' Cleaver
appointed the committee in December after a black shopper won a
million-dollar award because of her treatment at a Dillard's in
Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement completes seven months of often-tough
negotiations. Dillard's, which has eight stores in the Kansas City
area and Topeka, said it was pleased the talks with the Community
Redress Committee were successfully concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are firm and sincere in our belief that the progress we
have made by working together thus far is only an indication of the
progress which can still be made when persons of good will and open
mind meet to resolve conflict and misunderstanding,'' the retailer
said in a three-page letter to Cleaver that outlined the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement included the formation of a committee of community
representatives and Dillard's executives who will meet frequently
to chart the retailer's progress and suggest any improvements.
</P>
<P>
   One paragraph of the letter appeared to particularly gratify
committee members, who gathered Thursday afternoon at Metropolitan
Missionary Baptist Church to announce the agreement. That paragraph
was about racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dillard's agrees with you that the issue of race is a serious
problem in our society and that no element of society is immune
from this problem,'' the letter stated. ``There is absolutely no
place for discrimination anywhere. Where we have erred and made
mistakes in the past we sincerely apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Michael Zedek, a committee member, said this language was
one of the breakthroughs that made the agreement possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should not be minimized,'' Zedek said. ``We are pleased
to see this context and that they see themselves as part of this
context.''
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions of the agreement:
</P>
<P>
   Dillard's will post notices at its stores giving the phone
number of the store manager to register any complaints about
customer service and a pledge to respond to the complaint. The
notice will also contain the telephone number of Paul Schroeder,
Dillard's vice president and general counsel, whom the customer can
call if still unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Dillard's reaffirms its commitment to being an equal opportunity
employer, including maintaining a way to address complaints about
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Dillard's will develop a program to train its security and sales
personnel about how minority shoppers might feel when they visit
retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Dillard's will seriously consider philanthropic support of
organizations that support diversity and racial understanding in
the community.
</P>
<P>
   Dillard's will try to increase the number of its minority
vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The Community Redress Committee, composed of area clergy and
community and civic leaders, was formed specifically to address
concerns about the treatment of minorities at Dillard's stores in
the Kansas City area. But the Dillard's letter said it expects
provisions such as the effort to increase minority vendors to be
carried out nationally. The retailer has 272 stores.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was formed after Paula Hampton of Overland Park
was awarded $1.1 million in a lawsuit against Dillard's. Dillard's
asked the federal judge who presided over the trial to reduce the
award or set aside the verdict. That motion is pending.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that Hampton was denied a free gift at Dillard's
Oak Park Mall store because she is black. Hampton and a niece had
been detained at the store when a security guard suspected the
niece of shoplifting. No evidence of theft was found.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members said they were often frustrated in the talks
with Dillard's but credited the sincerity of Schroeder with keeping
the negotiations going.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Wallace Hartsfield said there was still work to be done
in carrying out the agreement's provisions. But in remarks
addressed to Cleaver at the news conference, he noted the
committee's accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached a preliminary agreement with Dillard's that
meets the challenge set by you,'' Hartsfield said.

     MANY LOW-SKILL WORKERS WON'T FIND JOBS, STUDY
SAYS
 &HT;     Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories. &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Urban employers are not creating enough jobs for
workers with low skills, the Clinton administration reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, the number of welfare recipients seeking jobs in 74
metropolitan counties will exceed the available low-skill jobs by
about 350,000, according to a U.S. Conference of Mayors survey.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was included in a ``State of the Cities'' report
compiled by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) and released at a Mayors Conference meeting in Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Atlanta, one of the nation's hottest economies, the
survey projected that 19,200 current welfare recipients would be
seeking work over the next five years, but only 7,160 low-skill
jobs would be available. That means 2.7 people would compete for
each low-skill job, a category that includes machine operators,
unskilled laborers, and jobs in the food and service industries.
</P>
<P>
   As federal welfare reform efforts try to move all able-bodied
recipients into the workplace, ``the challenge is for the nation to
produce jobs on the scale needed to accommodate all of the
households making the transition,'' said J. Thomas Cochran,
executive director of the Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the HUD report, the national economy has produced
more than 16 million new jobs in the past five years, with
unemployment at a 28-year low. But the report found that cities are
still suffering from concentrations of poverty, shrinking
populations and inadequate housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about something insurmountable,'' William
Apgar, a senior HUD official, said in a conference call with
reporters on Friday. ``These problems are well within our reach.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat this problem, the administration wants Congress to
expand or create a number of programs in fiscal 1999, which starts
Oct. 1, including a new $400 million fund to create and retain an
estimated 280,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's ``urban agenda is helping cities continue to
recover from years of decline and making them better places to live
and work,'' HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. ``This
is a midterm report card with an A grade for cities, but there is
still work to be done.''

FAMILY'S HISTORY IS A PART OF A FAMOUS MUSICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BRIAN McTAVISH  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There's a bright golden haze on the memory.
</P>
<P>
   It surfaces each time 86-year-old Howard McNeill recalls Lynn
Riggs, the second cousin who was ``more intellectual'' than anyone
else he knew in their native Oklahoma. For one thing, he wrote a
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Green Grow the Lilacs'' it was called. First produced in 1931
by the Theatre Guild, it included characters based on McNeill's
grandmother, mother and aunt. It ran for 64 performances in New
York and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The play, a turn-of-the-century love story of a cowboy and a
farm girl set against the rivalry between ranchers and farmers,
effectively launched Riggs' successful writing career. He became an
active member of cafe society on both coasts, kept a home in trendy
Santa Fe, hobnobbed with Hollywood stars like Bette Davis and Joan
Crawford and still found time to write more than 30 plays
influenced by his humble beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   But Riggs' theatrical legacy, as well as McNeill's personal
recollection of him, may have ended there if not for the keen
interest of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. In 1943 the
legendary Broadway team embraced the romantic plot and earthy
characters of ``Green Grow the Lilacs.'' The result was their
now-classic musical ``Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers and Hammerstein's first and most famous collaboration
set new ground rules for American musicals with its innovative use
of singing and dancing designed not only to viscerally entertain
audiences but also to advance story and characterization.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the timeless artistic triumph of ``Oklahoma!'' is less
interesting to McNeill than the musical's unique role in keeping
his family history alive. Now a medical supplies consultant who
lives in Chanute, Kan., McNeill, like Riggs, was reared in
Claremore, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma!'' which became a movie in 1955 _ the year after
Riggs' death at age 54 _ continues to have more than 600 licensed
productions a year in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're proud, just like you would be if your dad was president
of the United States or something,'' McNeill said of Riggs' impact
on him and his remaining Oklahoma relatives. ``You just have a real
kindred, glowing feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The glow increases exponentially when considering that the three
main female roles transplanted from ``Green Grow the Lilacs'' to
``Oklahoma!'' were inspired by family members who influenced Riggs'
and McNeill's young lives long before the stage versions became
part of theater history.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs and McNeill were born more than 10 years apart. But when
their mothers died, they were raised at different times by Riggs'
aunt and McNeill's grandmother, Mary Thompson. It was Thompson's
strong-willed yet loving personality that imbued the Aunt Eller
character in ``Oklahoma!'' That's her churning butter as ``Oh, What
a Beautiful Mornin' '' opens the musical.
</P>
<P>
   Other kin who achieved ``Oklahoma!'' immortality include
McNeill's mother, Laura Thompson, who became Laurie, the fetching
female lead in ``Oklahoma.'' McNeill's aunt (and Riggs' sister)
Willie Thompson, became the musical's man-crazy Ado Annie, who
sings ``I Cain't Say No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty authentic,'' McNeill said the other day.
``Willie had been married three or four times. She'd get rid of one
guy and look at another one. My grandmother raised her two
daughters, to tell you the truth. She was working in Kansas City.
She was a hasher, a waitress _ we used to call them hashers. She
was a good-looking gal, and guys were all the time trying to make
her. She was all the time looking for a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ``Oklahoma!'' characters culled from the lives of real
Oklahomans included Laurie's handsome cowboy beau Curly, inspired
by a hired hand who used to work for Riggs' Aunt Mary. McNeill
vividly remembers seeing _ if not really knowing for social reasons
_ the creep who became Curly's archenemy Jud in ``Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   ``His name was Jeeter Davis, and I remember him just like it was
yesterday,'' McNeill said. ``He was a farmhand, but one of these
guys that would get drunk on Saturday and thought he was a whiz
with the women and ... he was just a dirty old boy. He'd come to
town and sit there. Back then a lot of people would come to town on
Saturday in wagons. And old Jeeter, why, he'd get on his wagon and
strum his guitar and sing and make oodle eyes at the girls. The
character in the play, he was that type of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeill doesn't often share these stories with people. He
considers it boasting, the kind of carrying-on that led to one of
his most embarrassing moments. It happened when he was stationed in
Covington, Ky., during World War II, and the national tour of
``Oklahoma!'' visited nearby Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old me, I was bragging to some other GIs about how one of my
relatives wrote the original play,'' McNeill said. ``And I said,
`Well, I'll just take some of you guys with me. We'll go down and
see it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So we go down to this theater, and I told the gal I wanted to
get some tickets. She said, `You can't get any tickets. They're all
sold out.' And these guys are starting to rawhide me. So I said,
`Now, lady, just a minute. You mean, I can't get any tickets?' She
said, `You can't get any.' I said, `Let me use your telephone.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I go in the booth and I called up Lynn _ I had his phone
number in New York. I said, `This is Howard. I'm down here in
Cincinnati, and I want to go see your play, and I've got four guys
with me.' I said, `Here, you tell this girl to sell us some
tickets.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `Howard, I don't have anything to do with that
ticket-selling or anything else. I already sold my rights to the
play.' I'll tell you, when I walked out of that booth, I felt
pretty low with those guys going, `Yeah? Yeah?' But then they did
finally kind of believe me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something comes up about the family,'' McNeill said,
``I don't go around talking about it anymore _ unless maybe I've
had a highball or something.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeill's daughter, Melinda McNeill, who works at Hallmark Cards
in Kansas City, is more open to broaching the subject with people
because ``Oklahoma!'' is her way of proudly connecting to a past
that she can only imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it to a guy in the line at Best Buy,'' she said. ``He
was buying the musical on CD. I just thought, `I've got to say
something to him. I've just got to. He'll never see me again. He
doesn't know me. He'll never know me. He may think I'm a bit insane
...'
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `Thanks for buying that CD. That means a lot to
me.' He said, `Really?' And I said, `Well, that musical was
inspired by my family.' I enjoyed saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her father plan to enjoy one of next week's performances
of ``Oklahoma!'' at Starlight. Her brother, who lives in St. Louis,
also was planning to catch a performance of the touring show there
this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Melinda McNeill says she will be the only one among her
immediate family _ her mother died several years ago _ who will ask
theater officials about going backstage to meet the actors playing
her relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly her father acts as if he won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you going to say hello to?'' he asked her during a
recent get-together in Kansas City. ``What are you going back there
for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To feel the love,'' she replied with a silly smile, although
she really wasn't kidding. ``I love hearing people who've been in
the musical. I have a lot of people who played my
great-grandmother, grandmother and great-aunt _ 650 times a year
this thing is performed. That means a lot to me. It's a warm
feeling.''

COMMENTARY: THE FIRE NEXT TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Yorkers can't stop howling about Rudolph Giuliani's proposed
$15 million bulletproof bunker, but let's give the mayor a break.
Perhaps he is afraid of Pat Robertson, who this month warned that
terrorist bombs, earthquakes, tornadoes and ``possibly a meteor''
could strike Orlando, Fla., in biblical vengeance for ``Gay Days''
at Disney World. There are more gay people in New York than in
Orlando, and Giuliani has recently endorsed domestic-partnership
rights for them. Who knows what havoc Reverend Pat might cook up in
response? In 1985, when he prayed on TV for Hurricane Gloria to
spare his headquarters in Virginia Beach, Va., the storm diverted
to New York's Fire Island, where, as writer Christopher Buckley
astutely noted, it wiped out Calvin Klein's summer house instead.
</P>
<P>
   It's as easy to laugh at Robertson's lunacies as it is at
Giuliani's, but the men differ in one unfunny respect: Robertson's
ugly views about gay people, as sinners deserving of treatment or
punishment, are triumphing over Giuliani's benign ones within the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-May there has been an ever bolder escalation of
gay-baiting by GOP politicians. Congressmen publicly endorsed a
Family Research Council luncheon in Washington honoring Reggie
White, the Green Bay Packers star who decries homosexuality; Sen.
James Inhofe of Oklahoma likened philanthropist James Hormel, a gay
nominee to be ambassador to Luxembourg, to David Duke; and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott took to TV this week to brand gay people
as sinners comparable to thieves. He was seconded by his House
counterpart, Dick Armey, the man who once called Barney Frank
``Barney Fag.''
</P>
<P>
   Where is this drumbeat leading? Washington cynicism dismisses
such incidents as typical election-year red meat tossed by a party
to its base _ in this case religious conservatives. But this is the
kind of pandering that can incite hate crimes as well as votes _ as
witness the warning signs in Texas just last week.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the state Republican Convention in Fort Worth.
The Texas GOP had refused to let the gay Log Cabin Republicans have
an information booth in the hall _ despite the fact that more than
50 openly gay Log Cabin members had actually been elected as
delegates and alternates to the convention itself. The party's
spokesman justified the booth ban by likening Log Cabin to the Ku
Klux Klan and child molesters. Log Cabin organized a small,
peaceful civil rights rally nearby in protest _ which in turn
attracted Bible-waving counterdemonstrators bearing such signs as
``There's no such thing as a Christian fag.''
</P>
<P>
   One gay Texan Republican at the rally, sufficiently shaken up
that he asked not to be named, described it as ``a 1961 Mississippi
situation'' with ``shouting and screaming'' bigots raging out of
control; a video taken by a Dallas gay church, the Cathedral of
Hope, confirms his view.
</P>
<P>
   Much to his credit, Texas Gov. George W. Bush implored
Republicans to stop their ``name-calling'' well before the rally.
But national GOP potentates not only fail to repudiate homophobia
but contribute to the name-calling and, taking a cue from Pat
Robertson and Gary Bauer, hide piously behind the Bible as they do
so. Any elected leader who implicitly fuels the fears that feed
bigotry _ or who remains silent while others do so _ is not serving
God but only his own selfish, short-term political interests.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Bible could also be used as a rationale to bring
back slavery and the subjugation of women. In the Jim Crow South,
it was even used to rationalize lynching, as historian Leon Litwack
documents in his new book, ``Trouble in Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The national head of the Log Cabin Republicans, Richard Tafel,
also knows Scripture; he's an American Baptist minister. At the
Fort Worth rally, he preached to the crowd that ``we are all God's
children, worthy of his love.'' But his voice could hardly be heard
over the protesters, one of whom brazenly boasted on camera
afterward, ``I didn't get me enough gay-bashing of queers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have to have someone hurt and beat up and dragged from
a truck to stop this?'' asked the gay Texas Republican who was
terrified by what he experienced outside his own party's convention
last Saturday. Someone should ask Lott, who went on TV just two
days later to further fan the flames.

     MANY LOW-SKILL WORKERS WON'T FIND JOBS, STUDY
SAYS
 &HT;     Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories. &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Urban employers are not creating enough jobs for
workers with low skills, the Clinton administration reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, the number of welfare recipients seeking jobs in 74
metropolitan counties will exceed the available low-skill jobs by
about 350,000, according to a U.S. Conference of Mayors survey.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was included in a ``State of the Cities'' report
compiled by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) and released at a Mayors Conference meeting in Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Atlanta, one of the nation's hottest economies, the
survey projected that 19,200 current welfare recipients would be
seeking work over the next five years, but only 7,160 low-skill
jobs would be available. That means 2.7 people would compete for
each low-skill job, a category that includes machine operators,
unskilled laborers, and jobs in the food and service industries.
</P>
<P>
   As federal welfare reform efforts try to move all able-bodied
recipients into the workplace, ``the challenge is for the nation to
produce jobs on the scale needed to accommodate all of the
households making the transition,'' said J. Thomas Cochran,
executive director of the Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the HUD report, the national economy has produced
more than 16 million new jobs in the past five years, with
unemployment at a 28-year low. But the report found that cities are
still suffering from concentrations of poverty, shrinking
populations and inadequate housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about something insurmountable,'' William
Apgar, a senior HUD official, said in a conference call with
reporters on Friday. ``These problems are well within our reach.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat this problem, the administration wants Congress to
expand or create a number of programs in fiscal 1999, which starts
Oct. 1, including a new $400 million fund to create and retain an
estimated 280,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's ``urban agenda is helping cities continue to
recover from years of decline and making them better places to live
and work,'' HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. ``This
is a midterm report card with an A grade for cities, but there is
still work to be done.''

JAZZ EVENTS AIM TO PUT KANSAS CITY BACK ON THE MAP 
</HEADLINE>

 CALVIN WILSON  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The festivals
</P>
<P>
   - The Kansas City International Jazz Festival is June 26 and 27
at Crown Center. Performers include Take 6, Dee Dee Bridgewater,
Joe Lovano, Pete Fountain, Brad Mehldau, the Brian Blade Fellowship
and the Andrienne Wilson Quartet. For information, call
1-888-337-8111.
</P>
<P>
   - The Kansas City Blues &AMP; Jazz Festival is July 17-19 in Penn
Valley Park. Performers include the Pat Metheny Group, David
Sanborn, Kevin Mahogany, John Scofield, Benny Waters, Charlie
Hunter &AMP; Pound for Pound and Claude ``Fiddler'' Williams. For
information, call (800) 530-5266.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that Kansas City is a jazz town, a swinging town,
a place where the music reaches down to the bottom of your soul and
dares you not to dance.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the myths surrounding the city's musical heritage or
its actual exalted place in jazz history (as reflected in the
national attention focused on the new Jazz Museum), Kansas City has
lagged behind three other famous jazz meccas _ Chicago, New Orleans
and New York _ in international reputation and tourism. Fans of
Charlie Parker and Count Basie aren't necessarily inclined to visit
their old stomping grounds.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be about to change. Because this summer Kansas City
can claim two of the more ambitious jazz festivals in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is new. The Kansas City International Jazz Festival,
Friday and Saturday, is in its third year; the Kansas City Blues &AMP;
Jazz Festival, July 17-19, is in its eighth. Between the two of
them, they'll be presenting some of the biggest and most-respected
names in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The pop-inflected atmospherics of Pat Metheny and the
blues-soaked fusion of David Sanborn await Blues &AMP; Jazz
festivalgoers next month. The lineup also will include Kansas City
singer Kevin Mahogany, who has made waves from coast to coast, and
guitarist John Scofield; both of them combine artistry with
accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   Fans at next weekend's International Jazz Festival may be swayed
by the straight-ahead vocalizing of Dee Dee Bridgewater or the
close-to-the-bone bop of sax man Joe Lovano. Also on the schedule
are pianist Brad Mehldau and drummer Brian Blade, two of the
most-talked-about young performers in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The imaginative programming bodes well for both events, said
Frank Malfitano, founder and executive producer of the 17-year-old
Syracuse (N.Y.) Jazz Fest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both outstanding festivals,'' he said. ``Both have
great lineups, a programming stamp and an identity. But they're
trying to accomplish some very different things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues &AMP; Jazz festival, Malfitano said, ``obviously has more
crossover potential and the potential to draw larger audiences in
and become more of an economic development tool for tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, the International Jazz Festival
``has some of the brightest, up-and-coming names in jazz. I think
that's a unique festival in its own right, very well thought-out,
and shows great promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only this summer will they offer more than most jazz fans
could wish for, but the festivals also reflect a commitment to
present a global jazz perspective while emphasizing Kansas City's
role in that continuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that Kansas City jazz is something that
is, not something that was,'' said John Jessup, an organizer of the
Kansas City International Jazz Festival.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the event, which added a second day last year and
drew about 6,000 people, has made several changes that organizers
hope will raise its profile:
</P>
<P>
   - Held in September in previous years, the event is now closer
to the beginning of the festival season, when more acts are
available and attendance is likely to be higher.
</P>
<P>
   - Ticket prices, formerly as high as $50, have been lowered to
$10 in advance, $12 at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   - The International Jazz festival now makes its home at Crown
Center, instead of the larger (and harder to fill) Starlight
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still fighting for recognition on the street,'' said
organizer Steve Irwin. ``But even though there weren't a lot of
people at the first festival, and even last year we were
disappointed, we got so much good feedback from the people who were
there that we were encouraged. It was perceived as a quality
event.''
</P>
<P>
   With its emphasis on traditional jazz values, the Kansas City
International Jazz Festival provides an intriguing counterpoint to
the more populist Blues &AMP; Jazz event.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Boehr, the International's executive director, said its
mission is to present straight-ahead jazz with a few detours into
more cutting-edge territory. But that territory must lie within the
acoustic jazz tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want acid-jazz or fusion,'' Boehr said.
``That's just not what we've chosen to do. There's nothing wrong
with doing it. We're just trying to go in a different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in the valley
</P>
<P>
   The Blues &AMP; Jazz festival, meanwhile, has long been recognized
as a major Kansas City summer event. A principal goal now is to
heighten its national profile, said Greg Patterson, who has been
executive director of the Blues &AMP; Jazz Festival since January.
</P>
<P>
   The festival aspires to grow, Patterson said, to ``a nationally
recognized level much similar to the Chicago Blues Festival, the
New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.''
</P>
<P>
   And the way to get there, he added, is to do all the things the
festival has been doing right _ only even better.
</P>
<P>
   As in past years, the event in Penn Valley Park, which attracts
about 100,000 people over a typical weekend, will feature musicians
from across the jazz as well as the blues spectrums.
</P>
<P>
   But this year festival organizers did three things that have
significantly improved the all-around quality of the lineup:
</P>
<P>
   - They created a talent committee to get the job done, including
some members of the festival's board. In the past that task was
handled more informally and with less board involvement.
</P>
<P>
   - They aggressively solicited suggestions from area jazz and
blues fans and from disc jockeys about which performers to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   - And they went after those performers sooner than in past
years, increasing the festival's chances to land choice acts before
they could be booked elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the changes are intended to preserve the festival's
mass appeal while enhancing its musical integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to have the bigger names,'' Patterson said, ``but
also a consistency in bringing back the real strong roots names _
the names that people recognize as being the start, the actual
heritage of the music itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Among this year's performers, nonagenarian violinist Claude
``Fiddler'' Williams and saxophonist Benny Waters would qualify as
just such legendary jazz figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're people who can actually tell the story the way the
story needs to be told, and make it interesting enough to where
your 15-year-olds, your 19-year-olds, your 25-year-olds, are going
to come and take a listen and learn something _ as opposed to just
attending another concert.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues &AMP; Jazz Festival is becoming more expansive in its
musical views. Over the years the festival's audience has become
more jazz-savvy, said Rich Carr, a member of the festival's board
and its former president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're much more up on what's going on,'' Carr said.
``Before, I think, it was just something to do on a Saturday or
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's a much different crowd: Much more knowledgeable about
the music, much more opinionated on what they want to hear and
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Local heroes
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City jazz musicians, long known for their ability to tell
musical stories, will be well-represented at both festivals. No
doubt some of the people out to hear Sanborn or Lovano will also
sample homegrown sounds on the festival grounds.
</P>
<P>
   And in a city where the jazz focus has sometimes been on the
past to the exclusion of the present, that can only be a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a time to start counting our jazz blessings,''
said trumpeter Mike Metheny, whose quintet will open for his
brother's Pat Metheny Group at the Blues &AMP; Jazz festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two festivals, in addition to the other things that are
going on here this summer, can't help but increase the prestige of
Kansas City as a jazz town,'' Metheny said. ``And both of them
feature outstanding local talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Alaadeen, a saxophonist whose Group 21 makes its local
festival debut at the International Jazz event, said he was
``honored to have the opportunity to let Kansas City hear us in a
first-class venue.''
</P>
<P>
   So far as the festival's John Jessup is concerned, that's only
as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best jazz music is played by people who get paid to play
it,'' he said. ``And we want to be among those who are paying jazz
musicians what they deserve, to play great music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the quality of the music and the commercial prospects
for the festivals go hand-in-hand. And considering the current
line-ups, the future looks more than promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you can really teach people about this music and bring
them to this music,'' Malfitano said, ``you've got to get them. So
it's really important to have those artists who instantly and
automatically reach people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've got them there, the rest is easy.''

`LILLIAN': FINDING POETRY IN THE BANAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The title character in ``Lillian'' fits no one's
ideas of a woman of mystery. Her English accent is unmistakably
middle-class; her gestures are small and rather prim; her lips are
often pursed into the expression of someone savoring the vestiges
of that morning's mouthwash.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no air of concealment in the way she talks
about her life. And though you don't know what she's wearing, you
can be sure it's not a Garbo-style cloche and sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as drawn by the British performance artist David Cale,
Lillian is a luminous embodiment of the ineffable in life, a
reminder that even the most mundane existence is shaped by currents
beyond comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   She likes the fact, she says cozily, that there is so much
inside her that she herself doesn't understand. The idea of
psychoanalysis absolutely appalls her. And though she has worked in
a bookstore and surrounds herself with books at home, she never
reads them. She prefers what they represent closed.
</P>
<P>
   Cale, who first came to attention for his dreamlike monologues
about sexuality and who has recently appeared as an actor in the
New York productions of ``Curtains'' and ``Present Laughter,''
emerges here as a potent foe of those who would break personality
down into quantifiable elements and influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lillian,'' his one-person show at the New Theater Wing of
Playwrights Horizons, is a wondering and accepting look at the
clear, intricate patterns that develop over time from the ordinary
muddle of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   The evening may skirt the sticky edges of New Age mysticism and
the sentimentality of late-blooming-romance novels. But as directed
with gentle precision by Joe Mantello, ``Lillian'' is mostly an
immensely appealing work that finds an ordering poetry in the
seemingly banal.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cale's performance and his words give off a quality of
being rooted in common soil, like the chrysanthemums Lillian so
loves. The lyricism of the piece is less a matter of individual
phrases and images, which are often deliberately pedestrian, than
the ways in which they accumulate and echo.
</P>
<P>
   Cale, a lanky, long-faced man with Clark Gable ears, doesn't
look at all feminine, and there has been no attempt to use costumes
or makeup to make him more so. First seen onstage as a silhouette,
he wears simple men's street clothes that make no particular
impression.
</P>
<P>
   It's the smile with which he greets the audience that you first
notice: polite, welcoming and just slightly strained, it's the
smile of a hostess who is a tad nervous about receiving her guests,
but also amused by her own nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   That quality of benign detachment permeates the first-person
story that Cale proceeds to tell. It begins with Lillian recalling
the day when, as a married woman in her mid-30s, she went to bed
with Jimmy, then a store clerk and 15 years her junior. The sex is
described in terms both graphic and genteel, adjectives that apply
to Lillian's voice in general, and is given equal weight with
recollections of the pet lizards Jimmy keeps in aquariums.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter, though it will change Lillian's life in ways she
can't begin to anticipate, is not the stuff of fireworks. She finds
it not unlike a visit to the dentist and admits that her husband,
Keith, is a better lover, along the lines of ``a really good waiter
in a pretty good restaurant.'' And her attitude is more maternal
than erotic as she describes a postcoital bath in which Jimmy draws
animals on her shoulders in soap and asks her to guess what they
are.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of patterns felt but not seen recurs in ``Lillian,''
which spans close to a decade. So do images that crack open doors
onto breathtakingly unknown territory: a small ant-shaped tattoo on
a man's ankle; a strip of photo-booth pictures that give
illuminating form to previously unidentified feelings; a feral
white dog running among a field of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cale nor his alter ego pushes the significance of these
images, but they never trivialize them either. Lillian watches her
own life with admiring curiosity, as if contemplating the slow
emergence of a photo negative into focused detail.
</P>
<P>
   Cale matches the lapidary nature of his narrative with clean,
understated gestures _ encircling a wrist with a hand, smoothing
out the folds of a shirt sleeve _ that somehow come to paint a
complete physical portrait. Robert Brill's set and Beverly Emmons'
color-drenched lighting give off the same effect of pregnant
simplicity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are moments when Lillian directly brings to mind the
life-affirming, middle-aged heroines of Willy Russell's comedies,
``Shirley Valentine'' and ``Educating Rita,'' with a soupcon of the
eccentric monologists of Alan Bennett's ``Talking Heads.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is less adorably plucky (thank heavens) than Russell's
characters and far less tart and forlorn than Bennett's. Actually,
if she ever went against personal policy to crack a book, she might
find she has more in common with James Joyce's Molly Bloom, a woman
who instinctively says ``yes'' to life again and again without
considering reasons or consequences.

NOVELTY CONTACT LENS DESIGNS NOW AVAILABLE 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ That wild-eyed look
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the from one company, Wesley Jessen:
</P>
<P>
   - Hypnotica _ Black with white spiral.
</P>
<P>
   - White Out _ Pure white.
</P>
<P>
   - Wild Fire _ Red with yellow star burst.
</P>
<P>
   - Pool Shark _ Black, with an eightball in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   - Zoomin _ A flower.
</P>
<P>
   - Starry Eyed _ A star with a crescent moon.
</P>
<P>
   You're on your lunch break, about to pay the cashier at a
fast-food restaurant. You glance up and suddenly notice _ gasp! _
his eyes are hypnotic whirlpools of black-and-white swirls.
</P>
<P>
   A scene from a new horror movie? Hardly. It's the latest in
contact-lens fashion. And it's hit Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lenses open a whole new avenue for people to express
themselves,'' said Darin Nitschke, a Bonner Springs optometrist who
said he has sold a few pairs so far. ``These allow people to make
any statement they'd like.''
</P>
<P>
   The novelty lenses are available from several companies. One,
Wesley Jessen, based in Des Plaines, Ill., supplies more than 40
Kansas City area optometrists with six designs, everything from an
eightball to a crescent moon (see accompanying box).
</P>
<P>
   Remember when rocker Michael Jackson had cat's eyes in his
``Thriller'' video or Tom Cruise glared through eerie bloodstained
eyes in the movie ``Interview With the Vampire''? Both achieved the
effect with novelty contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The lenses are most popular among young men ages 16 to 24, said
Janet Day, senior franchise manager for Wesley Jessen.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Warburton, 18, and his sister, Tiffany, 17, of Bonner
Springs, were eager to try on the lenses after hearing about them
from friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would probably wear them to work or to a club,'' Travis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Travis works at an alternative clothing store, where he thought
the contacts would draw attention and increase his sales.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is as impressed. ``It's not my cup of tea, but it's
fun for the kids,'' said Phyllis Browning, Nitschke's receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   Jessen introduced the novelty contact lenses about five months
ago. The styles are offered in conventional, soft contacts only.
</P>
<P>
   The eye-catching lenses cost about $140 a pair. That's more than
contacts that change eye color (about $110) as well as normal
lenses (about $90), according to Nitschke. Most patients also must
buy a normal pair of lenses if they don't plan on wearing the
novelty lenses every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't wear them every day,'' Nitschke said.
</P>
<P>
   The lenses also are offered in nonprescription for those with
20-20 vision.
</P>
<P>
   Although the wearer ideally should be able to tell no difference
from a normal lens, Travis and Tiffany complained that some of the
styles altered their vision slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a black ring around everything,'' Travis said as he
gazed through the Hypnotica spiral-design lenses. ``It's like
tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the lens is covered in design; a 5-millimeter circle is
left clear over the pupil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average pupil is 3 millimeters,'' Day said. ``Some people
with larger than average pupils might get a halo effect. Then it's
just a matter of getting used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Slonim, spokesman for the American Academy of
Ophthalmology, said that a novelty-lens wearer might experience
minimal visual problems, including reduced peripheral vision or a
slight glare while driving at night.
</P>
<P>
   And some doctors are concerned that teen-agers might be sharing
the contact lenses. ``It is possible to transmit conjunctivitis,
corneal ulcers and a number of diseases from one person to another
if they are shared,'' said Ronald Cedrone, chairman of the American
Optometric Association's contact-lens section.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes consumers don't forget that the contacts are a
medical device. ``I think the fitting process may be trivialized so
that the `wild eyes' might be looked at as a consumer product,'' he
said. ``Even if there is no prescription, it is still a
prescriptive device,'' according to the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   As always, this trend is taking off most strongly in Los Angeles
and New York, but Kansas City is in the top 20 percent of sales in
the country, said Brad Macleod, product manager at Wesley Jessen.
</P>
<P>
   So you may just spy a red-and-yellow-eyed boy or a starry-eyed
girl on your next lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's nice about the novelty lenses is that it's
crazy and it's fun and it's trendy, but when the kids go home they
can take these off,'' Day said. ``It's a temporary, fun thing; it's
not like a tattoo.''

SPRINT PCS TO SPEND $700 MILLION TO EXPAND ITS WIRELESS PHONE
NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star

<P>
   WESTWOOD, Kan. _ Within a couple of years, skiers at Vail,
Breckenridge and other areas of Colorado should be able to call
home without leaving the slopes. Gamblers in Las Vegas and Atlantic
City, N.J., should be able to call without leaving the slots.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS said Thursday it had signed a contract to spend an
additional $700 million to expand its wireless phone network. Among
new areas where wireless service will be added are Vail and
Colorado Springs in Colorado, Las Vegas and Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS, the wireless unit of Westwood-based Sprint Corp.,
now provides phone service in 156 U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to aggressively build and expand the network on a
massive scale,'' said Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive officer of
Sprint PCS.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with other construction projects already under way and
contracts with smaller companies to provide wireless service under
the Sprint name, ``the promise of a seamless, nationwide PCS
network under one brand is now reality,'' Sukawaty said.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal announced Thursday, Sprint PCS will spend $700
million with Lucent Technologies Inc. to supply equipment for the
expansion. As part of a three-year deal, Lucent will supply
hardware, software and consulting services to Sprint PCS.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Paglusch, vice president of technical services and network
operations for Sprint PCS, said the agreement would add service in
new areas and improve existing service.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we said from day one was that not only are we going to
come in and build out the network, we're going to continue to
expand the footprint, keep up with capacity as it increases and add
sites to provide better service,'' Paglusch said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., already had a $1.8 billion
contract with Sprint PCS to help build initial phases of the
wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS, which expects to have more than 8,000 employees by
the end of the year, currently has more than 1.2 million customers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest Lucent contract, the company has agreed to spend
about $4.5 billion to build the infrastructure for the network.

HYPOCRITICAL TOBACCO BILL DESERVED TO BE STAMPED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The Senate's scuttling of its tobacco bill offers
hopeful evidence that representative democracy is still a
functional concept.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was a hypocrisy paraded across the political stage as a
means to protect youthful Americans from the ravages of smoking. In
reality, it was a government-sanctioned attempt to raise taxes and
loot a legal business enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Its most significant results would have been a huge tax increase
for Americans least able to afford it and a substantial expansion
of government power.
</P>
<P>
   Based on experience, there is no reason to believe it would have
reduced tobacco consumption by youngsters. There is reason,
however, to believe it would have led to the growth of a cigarette
black market and more unwarranted federal intrusion into private
life.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the much ballyhooed initiative may have been becoming
irrelevant to most average Americans. A recent poll showed drugs,
gang activity, alcohol abuse, reckless driving and sexual
misconduct well ahead of teen tobacco use as major concerns of
Americans. Nearly 40 percent of the respondents said drug abuse was
their main concern, while only 2 percent listed teen tobacco
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kluger, author of ``Ashes to Ashes,'' a history of
America's battle over smoking, questions claims about the
legislation's ability to curb youth smoking. He recently called the
focus on children ``great politics'' but said it was ``nonsense in
terms of anything you can put numbers next to.''
</P>
<P>
   From another perspective, said economist Stephen J. Entin,
executive director of the Institute for Research on the Economics
of Taxation, ``there is no economic justification for the (proposed
tax increase). Some people simply like to smoke. Policy-makers
should accept that and mind their own business.''
</P>
<P>
   Why aren't they minding their own business when it comes to
smoking? In a word, money. This is why the Senate tied itself in
knots trying to pass a bill that would have robbed smokers and
tobacco companies of hundreds of billions of dollars. It was about
money for Uncle Sam and the congressional incumbents whose war
chests would have been fattened by contributions from the bill's
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri was a
steadfast opponent of the effort and thus distinguished himself for
refusing to embrace the hypocrisy. In this regard, Ashcroft's
instincts proved sound. It's probably no coincidence that the
legislation died shortly after the Senate couldn't summon the
courage to cap legal fees generated by tobacco litigation. After
this happened, the political upside of the proposal was diminished
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress and the media were seriously interested in
discouraging teen smoking rather than engineering a huge bonanza
for undeserving special interests, they should take a closer look
at a House bill pushed by Rep. Sanford Bishop, a Georgia Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's to-the-point proposal is notable for its focus on teen
smoking rather than enhancing revenue and government power. His
bill would require tobacco retailers to get licenses that would be
revocable for selling tobacco to minors; would fine and possibly
revoke the driving licenses of minors caught buying and using
tobacco; and would restrict cigarette vending machines to areas
banning minors, such as bars.
</P>
<P>
   It's an approach that deserves a serious look from anyone really
worried about teen tobacco use.

JAPAN DENIES REPORT OF MERGING MAJOR BANKS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As a high-level U.S. delegation pressed Japanese leaders
Friday to strengthen the economy and tackle bad loan problems, news
reports surfaced that the government might rescue two major banks
by merging them.
</P>
<P>
   A report by Kyodo News Service, citing unidentified government
officials, said that authorities were considering a merger of the
Long-Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank, two of the nation's
largest _ and weakest _ financial institutions. The Tokyo Stock
Exchange suspended trading in shares of the banks as it tried to
confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Both banks denied the reports by late Friday afternoon and the
government said it would refrain from supporting feeble banks.
</P>
<P>
   The government ``intends to let bad banks collapse, and it does
not have any intention of bailing them out,'' said Kanezo Muraoka,
the government's chief Cabinet secretary, as quoted by Kyodo News.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings Friday with Lawrence Summers, the U.S. deputy
Treasury secretary, Japanese leaders stressed Japan's efforts to
clear away the bad debt and invigorate the economy, while Summers
called on Japan to continue fiscal stimulus, including tax cuts.
Koichi Kato, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party,
told Summers that the Liberal Democrats would decide before
elections in July on whether to create a new ``bridge bank'' that
would help absorb the business of failed institutions. Such a bank
would be a major step toward solving the bad debt problem, Kyodo
News quoted Kato as saying.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the financial markets seemed to welcome the reports
of a possible merger between Long-Term Credit and Nippon Credit as
a sign that mergers may be in the works to accelerate the disposal
of bad loans and nudge along greater consolidation in the banking
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been worried for the last few weeks that
Long-Term Credit could be facing difficulty in paying some routine
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday morning, the stock price of Long-Term Credit fell
to an all-time low, plunging to 95 yen, down 31 yen from Thursday's
close. After the reports, the stock bounced back to 120 yen before
trading was suspended. Shares of Nippon Credit rose 10 yen to 135
yen.
</P>
<P>
   The share prices of both banks have taken a beating over the
last couple of weeks, and investors have not forgotten the
financial turmoil last November, when four financial institutions
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of a potential merger between Long-Term Credit and
Nippon Credit have been circulating in the market over the last
couple of weeks. Long-Term Credit seems not to have been as active
a borrower as it usually is in the money market, according to a
banker at a large Japanese bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not participating in the market,'' said the banker,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But we cannot say why.''
Long-Term Credit said through a spokesman that the bank's
day-to-day money operations had been normal.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Credit is also under scrutiny amid its efforts to
restructure 200 billion yen worth of debt. More than a year ago,
the government rescued the bank with an injection of new capital
and issuance of new debt.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, leaders in Japan's governing Liberal
Democratic Party have mentioned the possibility that another large
bank could fail. A week ago, Taku Yamasaki, the party's top
policy-maker, tried to assure the markets that there would not be a
failure any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's banks are burdened by more than $600 billion in bad
debts, and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has said that cleaning
them up is a top government priority.

WAIT BEFORE STAINING CEDAR SHINGLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 21 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I plan to put a semitransparent stain on white cedar shingles
being installed on my house walls. Is that acceptable, or must I
wait a while before staining? The shingles in the bundle seem quite
dry.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SIEGMAN, Princeton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The shingles on the outside of the bundle are indeed dry, but
inside they are wet; they are so tightly bound that water cannot
evaporate. Most white cedar shingles are sold green; that is,
uncured, full of water. Therefore, you should wait six months for
them to cure in service before staining. They will shrink when they
cure, so there will be gaps between the shingles, but it cannot be
helped. Well, yes, it can be helped; buy cured (dry) white cedar
shingles. But they cost nearly twice as much as standard white
cedar shingles.
</P>
<P>
   You could also unbundle the shingles and lay them out to dry
before putting them up. They may curl a little when they dry out
this way, but in most cases these curls will straighten out when
the shingles are nailed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I get a smoke odor out of an upholstered sofa?
</P>
<P>
   JUDITH MAYER, Halifax, mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Dampen the upholstery with a wet sponge, then sprinkle a
whole bunch of baking soda on the damp surface. Leave it for an
hour, then sweep up and throw away. You can use instead carpet
freshener, which is perfumed baking soda. You could mound up salt
over the damp surface, let dry, and throw away.
</P>
<P>
   The reason you wet or dampen the upholstery: Baking soda will
not absorb dry materials very well, but will do a good job of
pulling dampness out, thereby pulling the smoke odor out, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My kitchen linoleum is 25 to 30 years old and is in good
shape, except that a small section is missing, about half an inch,
near a metal edging. What can I fill that section with?
</P>
<P>
   VERA GROPPER, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you have a spare piece of the linoleum (actually it is
sheet vinyl), you can cut a piece to fit and glue it in with an
adhesive caulk. If the linoleum normally goes under a flange on the
metal, make sure the patch piece does, too. If it doesn't, and just
butts up against the edging, make sure it is well glued down
because that's probably where the break occurred when someone
tripped on the uneven surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   If the metal edging is in a doorway, you may not even have to
put in the patch if you cover the opening and the edging with an
oak threshold.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In last Sunday's column, the handyman had a great answer, but
alas, there was no question. So today we are listing the question
and repeating the answer, in full.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some of my brick foundation is painted, the paint is peeling
and some of the bricks are sort of sloughing off, but only an
eighth of an inch or so. How can I stop that, and stop the paint
from peeling? In other areas, both brick and concrete, the paint is
fine.
</P>
<P>
   A CALLER
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your best bet is to get rid of the paint by wirebrushing and
letting the remainder wear off. It wll take time. The sloughing off
of the brick is called spalling, and is caused by moisture trapped
behind the paint and in small spaces in the brick, where it
freezes, pushing the face of the brick right off.
</P>
<P>
   You're lucky that the paint on other bricks and concrete is
good; it might be a cement-base paint that penetrates concrete,
fills pores and makes the material water resistant.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run, avoid painting concrete and bricks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I installed a wood stove last fall. The chimney man said he
would paint the chimney with two coats of a sealer called Chimney
Saver that is 100 percent breathable, to keep the chimney from
leaking, at a cost of $225. The man told me that the sealer, being
breathable, will not trap moisture in the brick. Is all this worth
it?
</P>
<P>
   BERT BOUCHARD, Danvers, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the chimney is not leaking, there is no need for the
sealer. If rainwater is entering at the top of the chimney and is
dripping on the stovepipe, sealing will not work; you need a
chimney cap. The sealer helps only if the water is making its way
through the brick; that can cause all sorts of mysterious leaks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I took up a rug from my flagstone indoor entry, the area
had faded quite a bit, so now I have two-toned flagstones. How can
I even out the color?
</P>
<P>
   SHEILA MURPHY, Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think it is so much fading as it is clean; the
flagstone stayed cleaner under the rug. If you keep the rug off,
the color will even out eventually. To hasten the evening out, wash
the whole floor with an extra strength solution of Spic and Span
and water, let this solution sit on the stone for two to five
minutes, then scrub and rinse.
</P>

PRESBYTERIANS ASK MEMBERS TO REMOVE HANDGUNS FROM HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Kan., Ohio, Va., Calif.)   (mk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a strong statement about personal responsibility and guns,
the top policy-making body of the Presbyterian Church (USA) has
passed a resolution calling on the denomination's 2.6 million
members to move toward removing handguns and assault weapons from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, passed by a 4-1 margin at the church's annual
General Assembly late Thursday afternoon, follows on a three-decade
stream of declarations by several major Protestant, Roman Catholic
and Jewish organizations favoring restrictions on handguns and
assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Presbyterian officials and other church leaders said the
assembly's resolution takes a different tack in asking for
individual action by church members, rather than seeking a purely
legislative remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, which comes after a recent series of schoolyard
shootings around the country, says the General Assembly should
``call upon all Presbyterians to intentionally work toward removing
handguns and assault weapons from our homes and communities,''
adding that church members should ``develop community strategies
and create sanctuaries of safety for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Its new ground is in speaking directly to Presbyterians to do
something,'' said the Rev. Kathy Lancaster, a Presbyterian official
who specializes in criminal justice issues for the church.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National
Council of Churches, said, ``It's taking this very serious issue
and bringing it home, and saying church people have guns in their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that some of the boys accused in the recent shootings had
been involved in local churches, Campbell said, ``Maybe we're not
doing all we could as church people to teach people a lifestyle of
living nonviolently.''
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterians' resolution is strictly advisory, rather than
binding. But it nonetheless sparked about 40 minutes of debate in
the General Assembly, an annual eight-day gathering that is winding
down at the Charlotte, N.C., Convention Center. The vote in favor
was 393 commissioners, as Presbyterian delegates are called, to
120.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment that would have modified the resolution's language
by removing the reference to handguns was defeated by 361-144. Bill
Ward, a commissioner from Wichita, Kan., who spoke in favor of that
amendment, said in an interview afterwards that ``our church is
treading on something that's legal and trying to say to all of us
who use shooting as a sport'' that that sport was wrong. The
resolution does not mention rifles, shotguns or hunting. In 1990,
the assembly adopted a resolution calling for handgun control but
said the statement was not intended to ``disparage the legitimate
ownership and use of firearms'' for hunting, collecting and
recreational sports. Others at the assembly who opposed the
amendment described it as a ``feel-good'' measure that would have
little practical effect.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harley, an attorney from Springfield, Ohio, said, ``If
you look into history, you'll see the first thing totalitarian
dictatorships have done is disarm its citizenry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ann Holt, a retired teacher from Raleigh, N.C, who voted for
it, said it was ``the church's responsibility to make a response''
to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner who made the motion proposing the resolution
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for her response to the resolution, Tanya Metaksa, chief
lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, said that organization
was sorry that the Presbyterian assembly ``would suggest to their
parishioners that self-defense is no longer an option.'' She said
that 2.5 million times a year, a firearm is used for self-defense,
``and 95 percent of those times, no shot is ever fired, but
people's lives are saved.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think they never heard the whole story,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although critics have accused the church's leadership of being
liberal-leaning, Presbyterians are an ideologically diverse group
who lately waged a fierce internal fight over whether to allow
ordination of homosexuals as ministers, elders and deacons. In
1997, the church amended its constitution to bar such ordinations
by declaring that those who are ordained must be either monogamous
within marriage or celibate as unmarried people. An attempt to
soften the amendment's language failed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is, we're a slice of middle America,'' said the Rev.
Douglas Oldenburg, a seminary president elected last Saturday as
the denomination's moderator, one of its top officials. ``I have no
idea what percentage of us have handguns _ probably more than I'd
wish.''
</P>
<P>
   The church has long been among those religious organizations in
favor of restricting access to handguns and, most recently, assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these declarations date to 1968, the year in which the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert Kennedy were
assassinated. But some were issued in 1975, the year of
assassination attempts against President Ford. Others have come
more recently, after the rise in urban violence and drug abuse in
the late 1980s.

for example, released a statement in 1975 calling for ``effective
and courageous action to control handguns, leading to their
eventual elimination from our society.'' The bishops as a body
reaffirmed that statement in 1992 in a pastoral message on
substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, which
represents about 800 Reform synagogues, called for eliminating the
manufacture, sale and possession of handguns, except for use by
police, the military and licensed gun clubs. In 1995, the United
Church of Christ's General Synod asked for legislation requiring
safety devices on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the United Methodist Church, building on earlier
statements, recommended that the denomination's churches be
designated as ``no gun zones,'' where all firearms were prohibited.
The 1990 Presbyterian statement, which focused on handguns and
assault weapons, criticized the entertainment industry for the
``glorification of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Friday, Presbyterians at the assembly expressed
differing opinions about the resolution. The Rev. Thomas Nance Jr.,
a Richmond, Va., minister who described himself as being ``on the
right-wing of things,'' said he voted for the resolution. ``There's
just too much violence and we have to do some things to ensure the
safety of people in this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Arlynn Barner, a Los Angeles real estate salesman who voted
against the resolution, said, ``I would feel uncomfortable without
a handgun in my home for protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Oldenburg, the moderator, said he voted for it. ``Will it make a
difference? Who knows?'' he said. ``Now it's up to individual
Presbyterian families to follow the counsel, the advice, of this
assembly or not.''

OZZIE AND HARRIET: THE ADVENTURES OF AMERICA`S FAVORITE FAMILY

<P>
   It's instructive comparing two upcoming, and generally engaging,
A&AMP;E biographies _ one devoted to Ozzie and Harriet Nelson and their
television family, the other to comic innovator Ernie Kovacs. The
documentaries are airing as part the cable channel's weeklong
Biography series dedicated to the 1950s. The first revisits the
mother and father of all family shows, Ozzie and Harriet Nelson,
and their real children David and Ricky, who also played their
children on radio, then more famously still on television. The
other Biography is devoted to the wacky Ernie Kovacs, whose
inspirational comedy depended as much on his appreciation of TV
technology as on his ageless lunacy. (``Ozzie and Harriet: The
Adventures of America's Favorite Family'' runs Sunday from 8-10
p.m., ``Ernie Kovacs: Please Stand By,'' on Tuesday from 8-9 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   As naturally as we think of Kovacs as an innovator, we associate
the nuclear Nelsons with whitebread family values that have come,
correctly or not, to epitomize '50s conformity and stasis.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing these two documentaries, however, reveals a striking
irony. And I'm not referring to the troubles afflicting the
off-screen Nelsons that contrasted darkly with their wholesome TV
image. The most public of their difficulties involved Rick after
the family show shrewdly helped his chart-topping pop-singing
career. Drugs and family chaos took their toll long before his 1985
death in a plane crash devastated the extended and genuinely
close-knit Nelson clan.
</P>
<P>
   All of this and more is well represented, and treated
unsensationally, in the two-hour program. But there's nothing
really surprising about the family's hardships. They were, the
documentary points out, an enterprising and highly ambitious
show-business family subject to enormous pressure and stress.
</P>
<P>
   On screen, Ozzie was a fuzzy patriarch with an unidentifiable
job and a silly fetish for Tutti-Fruity ice cream. But this
easygoing, slightly daffy image was a radical disconnect from his
real-life drive and even unconventionality. Ozzie especially, but
Harriet, too, were scarcely the middle-class models they portrayed
in 435 episodes of their popular ABC show. Both came from itinerant
show business families and, while not bohemian, their adult lives
on the road, on bandstands, and in theaters had little in common
with their suburban screen stereotypes. Harriet Hilliard Nelson,
born Peggy Louise Snyder, went from vaudeville to fronting Ozzie's
successful big band as a slinky crooner _ and, according to the
documentary, was the first ``girl singer'' hired by an established
big band.
</P>
<P>
   The program reveals in colorfully sympathetic detail who the
off-screen the Nelsons really were, and for this effort alone, and
its emphasis on their show-biz savvy, it's worth watching. But it
misses an extraordinary opportunity, I think, to explore more
thoroughly the abyss between the hard-driving show-business Nelsons
and the soft fantasy family they projected on TV. The documentary
does show how as he aged, Rick Nelson was painfully imprisoned by
his popular teen image, but it doesn't begin to explain adequately
how the comforting, conformist TV family _ which bred others like
``The Donna Reed Show'' and ``Father Knows Best'' _ evolved and how
it so shrewdly served advertisers and the appetites of '50s
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame the producers of this otherwise solid film didn't
include some probing cultural commentators in their list of
generally friendly if often fascinatating interviewees consisting
mostly of family members and former show staff. And while the
documentary reveals the off-screen Ozzie Nelson as a fiercely
independent business man protective of his creative properties, it
seems timid in assessing the impact of his domineering impact on
the family.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we're left the wiser: It required entrepreneurial if not
artistic daring and true grit to create and sustain ``Ozzie and
Harriet's'' marathon TV run from 1952 to 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacs, on the other hand, was a truly creative noncomformist
who made a lasting impact on the medium. ``The Late Show With David
Letterman'' and ``Saturday Night Live,'' for only two examples,
wouldn't exist in their current form without the experimental, and
often extemporaneous, on-air hijinks pioneered by the New
Jersey-born entertainer. The biographical details in ``Please Stand
By'' hang together meaningfully. The many agonizing struggles of
Kovacs _ with tuberculosis, with the ex-wife who kidnapped their
two daughters from him, with typically craven network executives _
testify to the force of his irrepressible inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   But the most memorable and pleasure-giving aspects of the
hour-long film are the clips of his zany, ebullient work, from such
shows as ``Ernie in Kovacsland'' (1951) and ``The Ernie Kovacs
Show'' (1953). He possessed a Woody Allen-ish sense of the absurd,
but above all valued surreal visual humor that cleverly exploited
the new electronic medium he so obviously loved. Because they are
really inseparable from the camera tricks and other technological
effects they depend on, Kovacs's most inventive and exhilarating
gags are quite indescribable. But, then, some of them are in
``Please Stand By,'' over 40 years old but remarkably standing the
test of time.

SPLIT WEAKENS CHALLENGE TO HOFFA TEAMSTER CANDIDACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bid by union reformers to win the Teamsters presidential
election has stalled because of an internal split over a candidate
to challenge James P. Hoffa for the 1.4 million-member union's top
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, son of labor leader James R. Hoffa, is expected to garner
a significant number of votes this summer because of his father's
legacy, but union reformers had hoped to launch a viable campaign
against the 57-year-old Detroit lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   However, hopes for a consensus started to unravel when George
Cashman, president of Local 25 in Charlestown, Mass., and two other
international vice presidents from the eastern region declined to
back reform candidate Thomas Leedham of Oregon. The decision could
catapult Hoffa into the union presidency. In all, 475,000 members
are in the eastern region.
</P>
<P>
   Leedham was endorsed by Teamsters for a Democratic Union, the
union's 10,000-member reform group, after top candidate Ken Hall
dropped out of the race because of a health issue. Hall, who led
the Teamsters to victory during last year's strike against United
Parcel Service of America, had enjoyed widespread support.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few weeks, divisions within the union, as well
as some defections to the Hoffa camp, have focused attention on the
group's ongoing struggle to unify its ranks since the
disqualification of Teamsters president Ron Carey. In November,
Carey was barred from a federally ordered rerun election because of
a campaign finance scandal involving the illegal use of union
funds. He later took a leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, some local union leaders in the south and west have
switched allegiances from Carey to Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   This week, nomination papers were mailed to delegates of the
Teamsters convention. The delegates must choose candidates to run
for general president and general secretary-treasurer, as well as
for at-large and regional positions.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman, who once considered entering the race himself, said he
and two others in the eastern region had backed Hall, but balked at
the notion that they should rally around a replacement simply
because he has received an endorsement from reformers.
</P>
<P>
   A labor source said some eastern leaders consider Leedham
arrogant and feel he is too much of a reformer to seek out their
views. The eastern leaders have been characterized by union
observers as moderates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now 1.4 million members in the Teamsters union, but
for one group to say they will pick a candidate that everyone
should surround, well, it just isn't possible,'' Cashman said this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Leedham, meanwhile, has said the most important factor in the
election should be the issues, not the personalities of the people
running. An international vice president, he is in charge of the
warehouse division, which represents 400,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unity among officials does not necessarily mean the membership
is supportive,'' said Sandy Pope, an aide to Leedham. &UR;  &LR; ``That's why
we will be taking our campaign directly to the members.''
</P>
<P>
   But the split appears to be widening. In Philadelphia, for
example, John Morris, one of four eastern international vice
presidents, is backing a slate headed by John Metz, director of the
Teamsters' public employee's trade division. Metz is based in St.
Louis. ``We think we have a good viable slate and we think it's
going to win,'' Jim Smith, an aide to Morris, said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, meanwhile, Carroll Haynes, president of Local 237,
this week announced his support of Hoffa in a mail ballot election
slated for August. Haynes had backed Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for healing, and time to come together to protect
and ensure the survival or our great union,'' said Haynes. ``We
need to put aside our differences so we can go about the business
of protecting members' rights and benefits in the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hoffa Now!, Hoffa's election offices in Washington, D.C.,
campaign manager Thomas Pazzi said he was confident Hoffa will win.
``Part of the problem Leedham and Metz will have is name
recognition,'' Pazzi said in a telephone interview. ``Who knows who
they are?''

100 BEST FILMS? ARE THEY SURE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Atrick trivia question for film fans: What is
the last line of ``The Maltese Falcon''? No, it's not a
Shakespearean line about the stuff of dreams from Humphrey Bogart
as Sam Spade.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Bond, as Detective Sergeant Tom Polhaus, stares at the
black bird and says ``Huh?'' _ which expresses the view of many
movie buffs miffed at the stiffing of their favorites among the 100
best American movies cataloged by the American Film Institute.
</P>
<P>
   A gruff, dimwitted stalwart of director John Ford's troupe, Bond
played cops and cowboys, appearing in seven of the 100, more than
anyone else (one more than the talented Robert Duvall), thus
proving that randomness and quirkiness infest such a list.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40,000 feature films were winnowed to 400. The final
criteria included ``critical recognition,'' ``major awards,''
``popularity over time,'' ``historical significance,'' and
``cultural impact.'' The Film Institute, celebrating its 30th
anniversary, has, under the leadership of Jean Picker Firstenberg,
preserved the art and the fun of the movies. Now, a little
marketing coup will sell 100-best videos and maybe even revive
wide-screen showings of the winners.
</P>
<P>
   I confess to having seen all 100, many more than once, when I
could have been working on a suntan. Moreover, if all but five of
them were on a nearby big screen, I'd ignore ``Godzilla,'' buy a
ticket, and order extra cholesterol on the popcorn. Choice is what
the list is about _ that, along with myth and memory and arguments,
which have begun grandly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calcified critical orthodoxy,'' writes Mick LaSalle of the San
Francisco Chronicle, and the headline is even better: ``Top 100
films: a roundup of usual suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who chose this list of the top 100?'' asks Bob Thomas of the
Associated Press, who knows Hollywood as well as anyone.
``Apparently it was done by 1,500 film people, critics, and
moviegoers. The only voters identified were President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore. Whoever the voters were, they seem
deficient in film history.'' Thomas decries the presence of only
four silent movies and suggests that whim and whimsy treat the last
two decades better the 1930s or 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The omissions on the AFI list, and they are numerous, are,
frankly, a scandal,'' writes KennethTuran in the Los Angeles Times.
A roster without directors like Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges,
he says, ``is like making a list of 100 best American novels and
forgetting about Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald.''
</P>
<P>
   Words count as well as pictures, as a CBS spe
</P>
<P>
   cial reminded viewers _ Colin Clive and `It's alive!''
</P>
<P>
   in ``Frankenstein''; Marlon Brando, who ``coulda been a
contendah,'' in ``On the Waterfront''; E.T., who wants to ``phone
home.'' This idiosyncratic lineup may prompt some moviegoers to
emulate Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle: ``You talkin' to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Turan protests the absence of ``Buster Keaton, easily the equal
of Charlie Chaplin,'' represented by three films. The Marx Brothers
have only one, ``Duck Soup,'' which Bob Thomas correctly says is a
lesser film than ``A Night at the Opera.'' W.C. Fields once called
Chaplin ``a goddamned ballet dancer,'' perhaps realizing that
critics would fail to recognize that his ``My Little Chickadee'' is
funnier than ``The Gold Rush'' and that ``The Bank Dick'' is better
than ``City Lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields is mysteriously MIA on the 100, but he's in good company.
Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Bing Crosby, and Bob Hope, are all six
places behind Ward Bond and one behind Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times,
published ``The Great Films,'' his choice of the 50 best films,
only 14 of which survive AFI scrutiny 30 years later later. No
Harold Lloyds need apply, and Nanook me no Norths. ``Naturally, my
choices are arbitrary,'' Crowther wrote. Maybe that's the meaning
of this ``Rosebud'' list.

 &HT;    
 &HT;      WHILE SPECTER RECOUPS, LLOYD GOES FOR DOLLARS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 19 -- As Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., has been
recuperating from heart surgery and pneumonia the past three weeks,
Democrat Bill Lloyd has trying to kick-start the fundraising drive
of his campaign to unseat the veteran Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Specter on the sidelines, Lloyd continues to fall
further behind in the money game, according to both campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going slow,'' said Peter Wiley, spokesman for Rep. Lloyd,
D-Somerset. ``Nobody at this point is willing to come across with a
lot of money for Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd won the Democratic nomination last month largely on the
basis of his endorsement from the state Democratic party. He ran no
television ads, and had raised only $17,600 as of the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign was always designed around the concept of
winning the nomination based on the Democratic machine -- or what's
left of it -- and then hitting the fundraising trail.
</P>
<P>
   One month after that primary victory, Lloyd has raised just
$60,000, Wiley said. In the first week of July, Lloyd said he plans
to hold a fundraiser in Somerset County to rally support in his
home base, which he hopes will pay some of the campaign bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting at ground zero,'' Lloyd said. ``There's no
question he's going to have a lot more money.''
</P>
<P>
   While filing forms are not due until the end of this month,
Specter is expected to have at least $5 million in cash. Through
March, he had raised that much and had $3.6 million remaining in
his account.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his absence could at least give Lloyd the chance to make
more appearances and get his message out while Specter recovers.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, 68, went into Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia
May 30 complaining of chest pains. A day later he underwent a
double bypass surgery, and within a week he was suffering from
aspiration pneumonia. He left the hospital June 15, and will return
to work ``as soon as his doctors give him the go ahead,'' said
Specter spokesman John Ullyot.
</P>
<P>
   That go-ahead won't come until at least June 30, and possibly
not until mid-July, Ullyot said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be six weeks off the job -- and off the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd is careful to say that he will not make Specter's health
and age an issue in the campaign, but that it could become one.
``That's really a question the public has to decide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the voters) make it an issue, it'll be an issue,'' Wiley
added.
</P>
<P>
   One issue Specter has missed out on was last week's Senate
debate on the $516 billion tobacco bill, which won 57-42 but failed
to get the 60 votes needed to kill off a filibuster. President
Clinton claimed there were two more Democratic votes he could have
secured, meaning Specter's vote may have been decisive.
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't saying how he would have voted because most of the
debate and amendments to the bill occurred while he was in the
hospital. ``In its final form, it was far different from the
original bill,'' Ullyot said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd, however, endorsed the bill as a ``good opportunity to get
a pool of funds to address public health problems.'' It would
increase cigarette taxes by $1.10 a pack while settling all states'
lawsuits against tobacco firms. But conservatives criticized the
bill as a ``money grab'' for Democrats to fund White House
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd sees reducing smoking as part of his broader message of
making health care affordable; if smoking can be reduced, lung
cancer will decline, reducing health costs across the board.
</P>
<P>
   But getting that message out will be hard to without a major
increase in campaign funds. The goal is to have raised between $1.5
million and $2 million by November: about $15,000 a day from now
until election day.
</P>
<P>
   Even while he's been sick, Specter's campaign has held
fundraisers, including a June 8 event in Philadelphia while Specter
was in the hospital. It was attended by 12 U.S. Senators, including
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and other GOP leaders, according
to Kent Gates, Specter's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   That one night almost certainly raised more than the $60,000
that the Lloyd campaign has raised since entering the race earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd said he can't figure out why Specter is still raising so
much money. ``My guess is that his polls are telling him what my
instincts are telling me: that this race is far from over,'' he
said.

BULLS LEARNED TO PLAY WITH HEART AGAINST DETROIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was after midnight, and the Los Angeles Lakers' team bus sat
idling on the second floor of Boston Garden, waiting for
stragglers, before it could head down the ramp to Logan Airport for
the long flight home. About an hour before, the Celtics had beaten
the Lakers, 111-102, in the steamy Garden to become the 1984 NBA
champions.
</P>
<P>
   On his way out of the building, Red Auerbach walked past the bus
with a couple of friends when a voice shouted his name. Auerbach
turned. Pat Riley, then the young coach of the Lakers, was stepping
down from the bus and walking across the floor, his right hand
extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' said Riley. ``You guys deserved to win. You
are just tougher than us. We're not tough enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach, against his nature, was almost demure. ``It could have
been different if you had (Bob) McAdoo,'' said the Celtics
president. ``He could have made a difference in such a close
game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Riley would have none of it. ``No,'' he said. ``He wouldn't
have made the difference. We're just not as tough as your club.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the Celtics and Lakers met again in the NBA
Finals. The Celtics embarrassed Los Angeles in the Garden in the
opener, 148-114. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was particularly pathetic. The
media jumped on the theme that Jabbar was done, that the Lakers
simply could not beat Boston. Never had. Never would.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, the Celtics led early in the first period.
Larry Bird was coming down the right wing for a fairly open
15-footer when Abdul-Jabbar challenged the shot and leveled Bird. I
mean leveled him. Bird went skidding on the seat of his pants past
the Celtics bench and out of bounds. It was a very loud, hard foul.
No one on the Celtics reacted. Abdul-Jabbar was not challenged. The
Lakers found some muscle. They beat the Celtics that night and kept
on going to win the series in six games, taking the clincher in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Riley would call that episode, and that series, the
most important in Laker history. It was when they discovered it
took more than great players to win it all. It also took heart.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls learned this lesson from Detroit. For years,
before Michael became Michael, Jordan and his teammates couldn't
get past Detroit. The Pistons were bullies and the Bulls wouldn't
muscle up to them in the playoffs. Detroit won back-to-back titles
in 1989 and '90 with grab-and-maul basketball. ``Detroit changed
the rules of the game,'' says our basketball guru, Bob Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Bulls found some heart and have been beating up the
NBA ever since. They can now clutch and grab with the best of them
and proved it once again this year by mauling Utah every time the
game was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   There is no greater player in any sport than Michael Jordan, but
at the same time, there is no player ever who bent the rules more
and was allowed to do so. He is a master when it comes to working
the officials. He is on them constantly, telling them how to call
the game. He never gets a technical. And he always gets an
audience. In the end, he gets his way.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh game of the Indiana series this year was a great
showcase of his clout with the officials. With the Bulls in danger
of being eliminated by the Pacers, Jordan simply took the ball at
the end of the game, and because he wasn't shooting well, he drove
into the pile and jumped into the nearest opposing Pacer he could
find. The result: two foul shots for Jordan and a bailout for
Chicago. But give Jordan credit for doing what has to be done to
win. This is all part of toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the glorious summer of 1967, when a young Red Sox team
was on the way to restoring the love of baseball in New England,
there was a turning point early that season in Yankee Stadium. Jim
Lonborg was pitching in a night game against Thad Tillotson, a
journeyman righthander for the Bronx Bombers, who were three years
past their heyday but still a bit arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   Lonborg, who would lead the American League in hitting batters
that year, had drilled Tillotson when he was at the plate.
Tillotson didn't like it and was yapping at Lonborg when he went to
first base. First baseman George Scott didn't like what Tillotson
had to say, and in seconds, the two teams went at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The night before, Joe Foy hit a grand slam for us,'' recalls
Lonborg. ``Then in the first inning of that game, Joe hit a
three-run homer. The next time up, Tillotson missed him twice and
then hit him in the head with the third pitch. He came up the next
time and I simply had to drill him. There was no thinking about it.
If you want to compete, you must let everyone know that you are
going to set a certain attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox kicked the Yankees' butts in the fight, and more than
anything else early that season, that incident pulled a group of
young players together as a formidable team that would go on to win
the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, at the same place, the reverse happened. The
Sox, fresh from winning the 1975 pennant and going to the seventh
game of the World Series before losing to Cincinnati, went into
Yankee Stadium early in the season. Bill Lee was pitching for
Boston. There was a play at the plate, and Carlton Fisk got into it
with the sliding Yankee runner. In the ensuing melee, third baseman
Graig Nettles sucker-punched Lee, and moments later, center fielder
Mickey Rivers cheap-shotted Lee, who suffered a separated shoulder
and was out of action for weeks. None of Lee's teammates answered
for him. They stood around like a bunch of wimps and let it happen.
From then on, the Yankees of that era had the Sox' number and beat
them in the big games, including the 1978 AL East playoff in which
Bucky Dent hit his infamous homer.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1979, the Bruins were in the semifinals of the
Stanley Cup playoffs against the Montreal Canadiens. The first game
was at the Forum, and when Montreal had the game in hand late in
the third period, Canadiens coach Scotty Bowman inserted their goon
of the year, Gilles Lupien, into the lineup. Lupien and defenseman
Butch Bouchard triggered a brawl and mopped up on a bunch of
smaller Bruins on the ice at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the Bruins were due to practice right after the
Canadiens on the Forum ice. The Bruins' colorful coach, Don Cherry,
got to the rink while Montreal was still working out and sent one
of the trainers into the Boston dressing room to fetch tough guys
Stan Jonathan and John Wensink. Cherry had not dressed Wensink for
the first game and was upest that he hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotty,'' Cherry bellowed across the ice, bringing the
Canadiens' practice to a halt. ``You got us last night. I was
stupid not to dress this guy'' _ he pointed to Wensink _ ``but
he'll play every game the rest of the way and we're going to be
looking for those two guys.'' Cherry pointed to Lupien and
Bouchard.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens won Game 2, but when the series returned to
Boston, Cherry set Jonathan and Wensink loose in the third game,
and they pummeled Lupien and Bouchard into submission. It was the
critical point in the series. The Bruins had to put up, and they
did. The Bruins were back in the series and should have won. They
had the seventh and deciding game apparently in hand in Montreal
when the game officials came to the rescue, calling two phantom
penalties in the final 10 minutes to help the Canadiens get two
power-play goals. Then came the notorious too-many-men-on-the-ice
call vs. Boston in the closing minutes, setting up Montreal's tying
goal and forcing overtime, in which the Canadiens scored. They went
on to win another Cup.
</P>
<P>
   When discussing dynasties, even though the Canadiens were great,
never put them up with the Celtics, Yankees, or even the
present-day Bulls. Montreal controlled the NHL. It was not only the
site of league headquarters, but all the referees were Canadian.
And when Montreal was in trouble, the officials came to the rescue.
That was a given.
</P>
<P>
   This Bulls team is terrific but not an all-timer. The Celtics,
Lakers, and 76ers of the Wilt Chamberlain era were much better at
center and deeper on the bench.

GM CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR STRIKE RESOLUTION
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ The chairman of the General Motors Corp. called
Friday for a speedy resolution of the two-week strike that has shut
down virtually all of the carmaker's North American assembly plants
and idled nearly 100,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to reaching a settlement as quickly as
possible,'' John F. Smith, GM's chairman and chief executive, said
here during commencement ceremonies at Kettering University, the
former General Motors Institute. The school is the alma mater of
one-fourth of GM's 72 corporate officers. ``Right now, nothing is
more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's comments came as President Clinton also urged GM and the
United Auto Workers to work out their differences. But while these
high-level calls for labor peace were being made, another 5,000 GM
workers were sent home, this time from the Lordstown, Ohio, car
plant and the company also closed a plant in Silao, Mexico, which
had 2,455 workers. That brings to 23 the number of GM assembly
factories shut since the strikes began on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the company has laid off 105,500 workers, not
including the 9,200 walking the picket line outside two parts
factories here. Only seven GM factories remain open, mainly
nonessential small-car assembly plants, which make cars that are
significantly less profitable for GM than its trucks and and sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the automaker was under pressure to become a more
efficient global player. ``We must have an agreement that allows us
to meet the demands of this changing marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's layoffs heightened concern among industry analysts and
observers that GM and the United Auto Workers will not be able to
broker a settlement and restart production before the automaker's
annual two-week summer shutdown, which is to begin June 29. Also,
the UAW's top strategists, and even some Flint union leaders, are
in Las Vegas for a convention that began on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they came to a resolution over the weekend,'' said
Mike Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting in Farmington
Hills, Mich., ``it would take three to five days to vote on it,
ratify it and refill the pipeline of parts. GM isn't going to bring
people back for one or two days then send them home for a
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   A GM spokesman said, however, that given a quick settlement, the
company could cancel its vacation and restart production, at least
at the Flint factories.
</P>
<P>
   No matter when a resolution is achieved, some analysts say it
will be difficult for GM to recoup lost production capacity, which
Robinet calculated at 114,000 cars and trucks as of Friday. Wall
Street analysts estimate that the strike is costing GM $60 million
a day.

LESS SCORING, NO STARS PLAGUE WORLD CUP, NHL TV RATINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, hockey and soccer don't seem to have much in
common, one game being played on ice, the other on turf. When it
comes to TV, though, the two sports share a problem _ attracting
viewer interest.
</P>
<P>
   Each has a devoted live following; NHL arenas in North America
and soccer stadiums around the globe are packed for big games. But,
as the NHL playoffs on Fox and ESPN proved again and as the initial
games of World Cup coverage showed, neither sport has been able to
attract much more than a hard-core following in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey ratings stunk all season, and the Stanley Cup playoffs
didn't help matters.
</P>
<P>
   As for the first TV appearance by the American squad in this
year's World Cup soccer tournament, it didn't measure up to the
ratings for Team USA's matches in the 1994 World Cup and couldn't
even outpoint the soap it pre-empted, ``General Hospital''.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe tomorrow's Team USA match against Iran will provide a
ratings windfall, if only for jingoistic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe the NHL will surge in popularity next season.
</P>
<P>
   But don't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions of why hockey fails to attract a wider TV audience
usually focus on these issues: The puck's too small to follow, the
sport's not indigenous to enough of the American population and
there aren't any individual stars to lure viewers.
</P>
<P>
   All real problems.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer has a whole other set of woes in this country, the main
one being that most of us don't care about the game past the youth
level.
</P>
<P>
   Both sports, however, die on TV for other reasons, problems that
aren't easily fixed by technology or rule changes.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey and soccer are generally low-scoring games played on
large surfaces by hard-to-identify players. And both sports have an
ebb-and-flow rhythm fully appreciated only by true students of the
games.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is more exciting than a legitimate scoring chance in
hockey or in soccer, whether a goal results or not. But the casual
fan is not likely to stay tuned waiting for those occasional
moments to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   That each game is spread out over a large area, which TV can't
readily capture in a single shot, makes it all the harder to follow
the action and to see the offensive and defensive strategies that
lead to those scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   More popular TV sports like football and basketball don't have
such problems. Football resets the action after every play,
allowing for slow-motion replays and analysis. Basketball is played
in a more confined space, and key plays usually amount to
one-on-one confrontations that are both intimate and easy to
televise.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons Game 7 of this year's NBA Finals drew a
22.3 TV rating while the U.S.-vs.-Germany soccer match pulled only
a 4.4 Monday, and Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals rated just a
3.3.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, for one.
</P>
<P>
   There are some possible solutions, too. The NHL, for instance,
is trying to promote increased scoring by reigning in
obstructionist defensive schemes, and TV has offered innovations
like the glowing puck.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest roadblocks to attracting a larger TV audience for
either hockey or soccer may be endemic to the games themselves,
however, and no amount of technology or effort by the networks or
leagues may be able to overcome that. &QL; 
BAD MAGIC &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Terry Bradshaw was sacked as host of his own TV show
earlier this year, you'd think the Ex-Jock Society would've sent
out a memo urging all would-be Lettermans to stick to sports.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they did, and poor Earvin Johnson didn't get his.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain ``The Magic Hour'', a waste of 60 minutes of
air time if ever there was one.
</P>
<P>
   Magic, by all accounts, is one nice guy. He's lauded for
launching business ventures in America's inner cities and for
preaching safe sex to all. He's also been a great champion and has
a smile with more juice than a nuke plant.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a pretty flimsy reason to give him an hourlong TV
show every night. It's embarrassing to watch Johnson fumble about
on stage, lacking the wit and timing of a professional comedian or
the sophistication and backgrounding of a good interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   One or the other, or both, are essential to successfully be host
of a late night talk show.
</P>
<P>
   In one program last week, viewers got to see Magic share a camel
ride with percussionist bandleader Sheila E. and a stroke session
with the Chicago Bulls' Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Harper stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's something that never would have happened on the
court.

SLAYER: THE RHYTHM AND RHYME OF VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's hard not to resort to metaphor in describing a
Slayer concert, because what you're confronted with is both
kinetically massive and uniform, blank, detailless.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the band recorded ``Reign in Blood,'' an album that's
still the primary sacrament of death-metal; the short, powerful
record mixed the rhythms of hardcore punk with a single-minded
focus on ritual violence.
</P>
<P>
   As a lot of defunct death-metal bands have since found out,
carnage and devilry are a tricky songwriting trope: Unless you make
a living as a torturer, you can only imagine it in so many ways
before you get tangled up in cliches and the clunky Victorianisms
that go so well with decadent themes.
</P>
<P>
   But metal, for some reason, continues to need words, and where
they were prolific in the '80s, now the band's songwriters squeeze
out a batch of malevolent scenarios every three years or so.
``Imagine humanity's decline,'' sings Tom Araya in one of the
band's songs on its new album, ``Diabolus in Musica'' (Columbia ).
``Step inside my stain of mind/infesting superiority/infectious
immorality, oh yea.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the metaphors begin, oh yea: Watching Slayer's show at
Irving Plaza on Wednesday night was no more or less interesting
than watching an enormous furnace for 90 minutes. It was also like
being crushed by an archetype.
</P>
<P>
   Slayer constructed the language of death-metal, and in concert
they set about deploying it purely, with as little variation as
possible. This enforces the in-crowd aspect of the music. If you
have to ask at this point, you'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   The drummer Paul Bostaph began the show with a few triplet
rhythms that gave way to single slablike beats, spaced apart; it
was a teasing ritual. Then the speed-metal of ``Hell Awaits''
began. Typically, the songs flickered between thrashing two-beat
rhythms and a starchily funky four, with a flowing, histrionic
high-note guitar solo nailed somewhere in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Slayer's pleasures are purely physical; some of the show's best
moments were the pockets of winded silence after the band had ended
a 400 beats-per-minute song and before the fans could physically
raise a cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 11 songs on ``Diabolus in Musica,'' a few of which
were played at the show, are in the same gray key, a detuned E
minor. Other major metal bands _ Pantera, Metallica, Megadeth _ at
this point, more than a decade into their careers, are hot-colored
and diverse by comparison. In a career-retrospective show like the
one at Irving Plaza, you can feel it's all one barreling song.
</P>
<P>
   Slayer's impact is bigger than even a large club like Irving
Plaza ought to withstand; the band's massive sound-board, to the
rear of the room, displaced about 100 people. But previous shows at
larger halls have proved that Slayer fans and furniture of any kind
_ even chairs bolted to the floor _ do not mix.
</P>
<P>
   At Irving Plaza, a whole new crop of young fans filled the
floor, becoming an eruption of arms, legs and hair. They knew the
coordinates, yelling every refrain; for ``Angel of Death,'' the
final song, the air in front of the stage rained with stage-divers.

AMATEUR ROCKET SET FOR SPACE LAUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an unlikely combination: A helium balloon carrying aloft a
10-foot-tall rocket, built entirely by amateur space enthusiasts
and fueled by asphalt and laughing gas.
</P>
<P>
   But if all goes as planned, the balloon will rise from a
NASA-supplied barge in the Gulf of Mexico Saturday morning and,
after reaching an altitude of about 20 miles, will fire the rocket
out into space _ and into the history books.
</P>
<P>
   If it works, it will be the first rocket built by amateurs ever
to reach space _ defined by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration as an altitude of 50 nautical miles, or 57.5 statute
miles. It will also be the first trip into space by a rocket of its
type _ a ``hybrid rocket'' using a solid fuel (ordinary asphalt)
and a liquid oxidizer (nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, stored under
pressure in liquid form).
</P>
<P>
   The novel balloon-launch method has been tried once before by
the group, the Huntsville Alabama L5 Society (HAL5), a chapter of
the National Space Society, which promotes the exploration and
eventual human colonization of space. That earlier launch, on May
11, 1997, was not tracked accurately enough to determine its
highest altitude, but is believed to have reached about 30 miles _
well short of today's goal of reaching the fringes of space. Still,
it qualified as the world's first balloon launch of a hybrid
rocket.
</P>
<P>
   If the weather doesn't cooperate for the launch, the group plans
to try again Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Launching a rocket from a balloon _ the combination is called a
``rockoon'' _ is not just a stunt. The group hopes it could pave
the way for practical, low-cost rockets that could be used to carry
experiments briefly into space, for a few minutes at a time, to
conduct experiments for students and scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ``rockoon'' concept was pioneered back in the 1950s
by space scientist James Van Allen, discoverer of the Earth's
radiation belt. He used several such rockets to conduct some of the
nation's earliest scientific experiments in space.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of the method is that the balloon can carry the
rocket above 99 percent of the atmosphere, reducing greatly the
amount of atmospheric drag it has to punch through. Thus, even a
relatively small rocket can reach heights many times greater than
it could if launched from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   As for the unusual fuel combination, it is a new version of a
kind of ``hybrid'' technology that was tried unsuccessfully a few
years ago by a private venture called American Rocket Co. The idea
is to combine the simplicity of a solid-fuel rocket _ similar to
the space shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters, which require no
complicated fuel pumps and nozzles _ with the greater safety of a
liquid-fueled rocket, which cannot be accidentally set off by a
stray spark as solid-fueled rockets can.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual design of the home-built rocket is a product of the
inventiveness and enthusiasm of its builders, a band of inveterate
tinkerers dedicated to a vision of humanity's future in space. Tim
Pickens, a member of the group who is in charge of the rocket
system, wrote after last year's launch that ``I love a
challenge.... I can't go to the hardware store or even to the
grocery store with my wife without trying to transform something on
the shelf into usable rocket hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA, which is interested in pursuing low-cost alternatives for
scientific research flights that are typically carried by
multimillion-dollar sounding rockets, is helping out by providing
some money and equipment, including the barge that will be used as
a launch platform in the Gulf 60 miles out from New Orleans, and
helium for the 120-foot-high balloon.
</P>
<P>
   But the rocket itself, the balloon that will carry it, and its
camera and radio equipment _ which, the group hopes, will transmit
live pictures of the launch, both from the balloon and from the
rocket itself _ were all built entirely by members of the amateur
group. They call the project HALO, for High-Altitude Lift-Off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our hope that Project HALO will demonstrate that extreme
altitudes are reachable by amateurs,'' wrote project manager
Gregory Allison. ``We hope to help lay the groundwork of
organization, technology, and imagination that will make cheap
access to space a reality for all.''

HORSE WHISPERER LISTENS EVEN BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPSFIELD, Mass. _ For many of his 63 years, people have said no
to horseman &UR;  &LR; Monty Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   When Roberts as a young adult suggested to his horse-trainer
father &UR;  &LR; a less aggressive means of training horses _ a technique
based on cooperation and understanding rather than submission and
fear _ his father said no.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When Roberts suggested to novelist Nicholas Evans, who had
pumped him for information as he wrote ``The Horse Whisperer,''
that he alter the ending of his book _ a romantic novel that
incorporates some of Roberts's training methods _ the writer said
no.
</P>
<P>
   When Robert Redford's production company wanted Roberts's
endorsement for the film version of ``The Horse Whisperer,''
Roberts said he'd consent only if they made the ending more in
keeping with his nonviolent methods. Redford said no.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts's own book, ``The Man Who Listens to Horses,'' is a
runaway bestseller with 2 million copies sold in 14 languages. And
it hasn't come out in paperback yet. The BBC shot a documentary
called ``Monty Roberts'' that was a major ratings hit on PBS and
has just come out on video.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Roberts who's been saying no.
</P>
<P>
   No to his father's method of hog-tying horses. No to Evans. No
to Redford. No to people who won't listen, and yes to the horses
who will.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Roberts, who lives in Northern California,
demonstrated his ``join-up'' techniques of establishing a bond with
the horse before sold-out audiences over two nights at the
Topsfield Fairgrounds. He takes a horse who has never been ridden
and, within 30 minutes, the animal is cantering around a round
enclosure with a rider on his back as if he's been doing it all his
life. The process of nonverbal communication _ a method that
Roberts equates with deaf people using sign language _ involves an
elaborate series of gestures that Roberts explains as he
demonstrates.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie, a 3-year-old gelding from Balsom Farm in Falmouth,
Maine, was brought into the ring. While he's a bit reluctant at
first, Roberts allows the horse to run in circles, explaining that
the horse is a flight animal and its first instinct is to flee.
Slowly, Roberts allows the horse to come to him. It's a magical
dance between equal partners that ends with Lonnie accepting a
saddle, bridle, and rider for the first time, without violence or
stress.
</P>
<P>
   After the demonstration, Lonnie's owner, Laurel McCormick, led
the horse back to a stall in an adjoining barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' she said. ``It's wonderful. I can't
believe it. But it happened. He's a miracle worker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse wants to please,'' said Roberts, a man who is as
gentle and soft-spoken with humans as he is with horses. He exudes
an inner confidence and an almost messianic zeal about his approach
to horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave a talk recently at Belmont Park advocating whipless
racing. There's no reason for the violence. Horses love to run.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  As a youngster, Roberts grew up around horses on his father's
farm in Salinas, Calif. He started riding at 2 and, between the
ages of 4 and 6, won several championships. In 1955, at age 20,
Roberts was hired by Warner Bros. as a production adviser who
handled all the animals involved in the Elia Kazan movie of John
Steinbeck's novel, ``East of Eden.'' In fact, when star James Dean
was killed in the auto crash on May 5, 1955, he was on his way to
visit his new friend, Monty Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Roberts was beginning to see parallels between
his father's treatment of him and the horses. He had been a quiet,
withdrawn child, and his father physically abused him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought it was a way to solve problems,'' said Roberts of
his father, Marvin Roberts. ``It wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts rebelled against his father's admonition, ``You hurt
them first or they'll hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   While his father continued to fight Roberts and his methods,
Roberts was branching out. Working as a horse trainer, adviser,
educator, and author, he started to develop his pacifist,
non-restraining techniques by observing horses' behavior. How do
they interact in herds? How do they react to stress? Roberts slowly
began to apply what we now call behavioral psychology to the
animals.
</P>
<P>
   After several decades, during which Roberts was roundly
ridiculed by a significant majority of the horse world, he began to
gain a few converts.
</P>
<P>
   But his big break didn't come until 1988, when Queen Elizabeth
II, an avid horsewoman and racehorse owner, invited him to Windsor
Castle after she read about Roberts's techniques in The Blood
Horse, a horse-racing magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her Majesty was wonderful,'' said Roberts. ``The English were
much more accepting of my methods, and I worked on many of the
queen's horses. After that, it got a little bit easier to get
people to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   And, while Roberts acknowledges that the bestselling book and
movie of ``The Horse Whisperer'' have helped promote his tour, he's
a fan of neither.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ending of the book and the movie of `The Horse Whisperer'
involves the depiction of a horse that must be restrained and
physically controlled to make it do a human's bidding,'' he said,
between shows. ``It's the opposite of everything I talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, while visiting at Rockingham Park in Salem,
N.H., Roberts met with horse trainer Carlos R. Figueroa and his
staff along with a group of patients from Tewksbury Hospital; some
of them are involved in a rehabilitation program where horses are
used to build patients' self-confidence. Roberts spoke with the
patients, some of whom suffer from severe spinal and head injury
problems.
</P>
<P>
   As Figueroa brought Irish President, a gentle gray horse, from
his stall to a space outside for the patients to see and touch,
Roberts carried on a soft conversation with a patient away from the
group at large.
</P>
<P>
   But he did more than speak. He did what he does best _ he didn't
whisper, he listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it's all about,'' he said, as the young girl's
eyes lit up. ``There's no reason for violence. No reason at all.''

THE BEAR TRAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 21 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether last week's surprise intervention in the currency
markets works or not to prevent the Asian crisis from becoming a
global nightmare, you've got to admire the Clinton administration's
verve &UR;  &LR; in trying.
</P>
<P>
   Never in its nearly six years has the administration more
sharply wielded the enormous power of the government to affect
events _ nor has the meager power of the press to deflect their
onrush been more conspicuously displayed.
</P>
<P>
   While the chattering classes went on about the self-deflating
exhibitionism of Monica Lewinsky and Kenneth Starr in ``Vanity
Fair'' and ``Brill's Content,'' the Treasury Department contrived
one last powerful attempt to persuade the Japanese to act to
reignite their economy. Moreover, while independent counsel Starr
vainly fulminated against his critics (having abandoned momentarily
at least his attempts to build bridges to sympathetic reporters),
Treasury officials put on a textbook display of good press
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, shortly after currency markets participants
discovered that the US government was buying yen in sufficient
volume to guarantee a short-term rise in its value, Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin confirmed that the Japanese and American
governments were seeking to stem the currency's fall. Clinton
himself talked to reporters briefly in the Rose Garden as the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York shocked currency traders by buying
$2 billion worth of yen with dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's ploy was a classic ``bear trap,'' a maneuver designed to
squeeze short-sellers, traders who had made large bets that the
value of the yen would continue to fall. The treasury secretary had
been a legendary currency trader himself while cochairman of
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., the big Wall Street firm.
</P>
<P>
   He set the trap the week before by feigning elaborate unconcern
_ then sprung it after a series of top secret negotiations Tuesday
night with his counterparts in Tokyo that were designed to
galvanize the Japanese to act. Fortunes were lost by traders who
had shorted the yen. Well-informed stories on the campaign
blossomed overnight in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The
Wall Street Journal, and The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   The joint US-Japanese action came as China appeared to totter on
the brink of pursuing a policy of competitive devaluation of its
currency, the yuan _ a move that, while aimed at self-preservation,
could tumble the world economy into a disastrous recession at the
worst possible time.
</P>
<P>
   China's currency (and that of Hong Kong) is tied to the US
dollar by its central bank's policies. Thus Chinese export prices
have been soaring relative to its Asian neighbors, especially the
Indonesians and South Koreans. Export sales are falling; job growth
has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   The official Chinese position has been that a devaluation would
serve no useful purpose; so weak is the Asian market that lower
prices would benefit Chinese firms little if at all, while
increasing levels of indebtedness throughout Asia and sending
tremors through markets as far away as Russia and the Middle East.
Privately, the Chinese with increasing urgency have been pleading
with the United States and Japan to act together to halt the fall
of the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the past 15 years, governments of the industrial
nations have acted in concert to impose a particular order on the
vast flows of funds that are the world currency markets, always
with the understanding that free-spending treasuries could have
only temporary effects if underlying policies were not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Three times they were successful: in 1985, when the Plaza Accord
sought to stem the rise of the dollar against the yen that had been
precipitated by America's bourgeoning federal budget deficit; in
1988, when the Louvre Accord brought an end to the yen's
appreciation; and in 1995, when the Clinton administration
intervened to boost the falling dollar. Never, however, has quite
so much depended on the outcome of their acts.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem for Japan is much like the one that threatened
the United States during the late 1980s and early 1990s in the
savings and loan crisis _ a binge of ill-judged lending stimulated
by easy money and lax supervision _ only three times larger in an
economy only half as big.
</P>
<P>
   Mustering the political will to write off bank loans as
unrecoverable and to close companies as a result is no easier for
the Japanese than it was for the Americans. So far, the government
has refused to abandon its ``convoy system,'' whereby strong
companies act to keep week companies afloat.
</P>
<P>
   It took the United States 10 years to decisively narrow its
budget deficit. The period of Japan's embarrassment is going on
only seven years. There is a significant difference, however: The
American economy continued to grow robustly, serving as an engine
of sorts for the world economy, while the Japanese economy has
stagnated to the deteriment of its trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   After springing his trap on Wednesday, Rubin dispatched an
urgent mission led by Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
and New York Federal Reserve Bank chief William McDonough to press
the Japanese for further financial reforms. Top treasury and bank
aides from the other leading industrial nations _ the Group of
Seven _ were scheduled to join them on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There is no particular reason to expect the intervention to work
_ except that the damage to the world economy will be so enormous
if it fails.

NIGERIA VICTORIOUS OVER BULGARIA, 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Nigeria's Super Eagles represent the hopes of millions
of West Africans. And after a 1-0 victory over Bulgaria Friday,
combined with the failures of the other African teams in the World
Cup finals, their constituency is about to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria became the first African team to qualify for the second
round of this tournament as African player of the year Victor
Ikpeba concluded a lightning series of passes in the 26th minute.
The Nigerians then protected the advantage _ barely, though _ as
Emil Kostadinov cracked a close-in shot off the bar with five
minutes remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bora Milutinovic defied convention by adding three
attackers as substitutes rather than drawing Nigeria into a
defensive shell _ a strategy that proved unsuccessful when the
Eagles were eliminated by Italy at Foxboro Stadium during the '94
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best defense is to attack,'' Milutinovic said. ``Not just
for Nigeria, but for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic's philosophy was the opposite when he coached the
US, but ``the best defense is a good offense'' reflects the
character of this Nigeria team _ confidence bordering on arrogance,
plus creative, uninhibited offensive instincts. When Nigeria won
the 1996 Olympic tournament, it rallied from a two-goal deficit to
eliminate Brazil and twice came from behind to defeat Argentina in
the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigeria is a place where everyone thinks we have the materials
and if we don't win, it is not the players' fault but the fault of
the coach,'' said midfielder Finidi, who dropped his last name to
emulate the Brazilian tradition. ``I can't say how we will do in
the next round, but we are looking forward to it. Every player's
dream is to win the World Cup, but that is not an easy thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Cameroon, Morocco, South Africa, and Tunisia are winless,
the Nigerians could be the only team from the continent to advance.
This mixture of spectacular failure and success mirrors the
potential and the tragedy of a continent considered to be a
sleeping giant.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria has about 100 million citizens, representing one-fifth
of the population of the continent. The country has great natural
resources, especially in oil, and a capable, diverse populace. But
through corruption, mismanagement, and the failure to expand its
economy, Nigeria has dropped from having one of the world's highest
gross domestic products in the 1970s and '80s to being rated among
the 20 poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the decline in prestige of their country, the Super
Eagles have attained their greatest successes recently. In 1994,
they won the African Nations Cup and came within an 89th-minute
Roberto Baggio goal of qualifying for the World Cup quarterfinals.
In '96, they won the Olympic title.
</P>
<P>
   They are on the verge of validating what some have expected for
many years.
</P>
<P>
   When African teams were allowed into the World Cup finals in the
1970s, they were dismissed as disorganized and inexperienced at
best. Sir Stanley Rous, then president of the Federation
Internationale de Football Association, encountered almost
universal skepticism when he predicted that the Africans would win
the World Cup before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Africans lacked the resources to succeed as the colonial era
ended. There was a lack of professionalism since few played in
European leagues. The best African players, such as Eusebio and
Mario Coluna of Mozambique and Portugal, represented colonial
powers in international competitions. Africans had to contend with
misconceptions and stereotypes, and _ most crucially _ only one
team from the continent was allowed into the World Cup finals.
Sub-Saharan nations advanced to the finals only once before the
1980s, and Zaire was humiliated during the 1974 tournament in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian Joao Havelange deposed Rous for the FIFA presidency in
1974 by promising the Africans an increased role in the world game.
Havelange was a Machiavellian ruler but also a visionary who
overruled the preponderance of doubters in awarding the '94 World
Cup to the United States. Havelange, whose term as president ends
July 12, made certain Africa was supplied with resources, mostly
training for coaches and referees; the passion and talent already
existed in potential players.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Algeria upset Germany, 2-1, and Cameroon was eliminated
after the first round despite going undefeated. The Cameroonians,
who have qualified for four of the last five finals, shocked
Argentina in the opening match of 1990 but failed to win at USA '94
and so far at France '98.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria has taken up where Cameroon left off. Yet, like the
other African teams which have had success in the World Cup,
Nigeria is relying on a foreign coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in ourselves and we believe in our coach,'' said
Austin Okocha, who along with Daniel Amokachi set up the goal
against Bulgaria. ``We employed him because we know he has gone far
in the World Cup before. The first time you meet him, you know he
is a good person, someone you can talk to, even about your personal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more maturity than in 1994. We are different people
with a different mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria tried one native coach since Dutchman Clemence Westerhof
departed in 1994 but won the Olympics with Dutchman Jo Bonfrere,
qualified for the World Cup under Frenchman Phillipe Troussier,
then threatened to fire Milutinovic if he lost to Spain in the
World Cup opener. But the Super Eagles _ they were merely
``Eagles'' before winning the Olympic title _ rallied for a 3-2
victory over Spain on Sunday Oliseh's dramatic late volley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so much talent, that is our problem,'' Milutinovic
said. ``They didn't always work so much, but now they understand
they have to work hard.''

SUPERBIKE TOUR LEADER DUHAMEL FRACTURES ARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Honda rider Miguel Duhamel arrived at New
Hamsphire International Speedway as the new leader of the American
Motorcycle Association Pro Series Superbike Tour point standings.
But Duhamel's ride at the top came to an abrupt halt when the
31-year-old native of LaSalle, Quebec, departed NHIS in an
ambulance, his left femur and his hopes for a championship
shattered.
</P>
<P>
   Duhamel suffered a season-ending double compound fracture 7 1/2
minutes into Friday's qualifying session for the 75th Loudon
Classic. He went into Turn 1 at 76 miles per hour, skidded past the
entrance in slippery track conditions, and slammed into the wall.
According to a witness, Duhamel locked up his brakes, went straight
for the wall, and slammed into it. He wound up getting pinched
between his bike and the wall and popped up in the air before
landing on the asphalt face-first.
</P>
<P>
   Duhamel, who won four consecutive Superbike events to surge to a
7-point lead over Kawasaki rider Doug Chandler (236-229), was
evaluated at the track's hospital and transported to Concord
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awake and he's talking,'' said Gary Mathers, manager of
motorcycle sports for American Honda. ``And he's disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathers said Duhamel was expected to be out for five to seven
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he knew what might have caused the accident, Mathers
said, ``Yeah, I think it was rain. I think you can't turn left in
the pouring rain. It just started to rain and they were in the
qualifying session. Of course, they all wanted to get the fast lap
in case they don't get to qualify again (in Saturday's final
Superbike session).
</P>
<P>
   ``What we always tell the riders is that they're the first ones
to know when they get rain on their goggles,'' Mathers added. ``We
always tell them if it rains to come in. But riders are riders.''
</P>
<P>
   Duhamel had posted the second-fastest lap of the one-hour
qualifying session with a tour of 1 minute 14.482 seconds, .10
seconds off the pace set by Suzuki rider Mathew Mladin (1:14.472).
At the time of Duhamel's accident, a cloudburst erupted over the
south end of the track near the first turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably thought he could do just one more fast lap,''
Mathers said. ``Apparently, it was only raining hard down in that
corner there. It moved in from that corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other riders sustained serious injuries. Superbike rider
Thomas Wilson of Oregon, Ohio, suffered fractures to both legs and
his pelvis region when he crashed his Harley-Davidson in Turn 1
during Fridaythe morning practice session. Wilson was taken to
Concord Hospital and transferred to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical
Center in Lebanon for further treatment of his pelvic injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Metzger of Newington, Conn., crashed exiting Turn 12 and
sustained a possible head injury while practicing on his Suzuki. He
was also transported to Concord Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Miguel crashed at Daytona (and finished 58th), it just
about took us clear out of the championship,'' Mathers said.
``After Daytona, our second race, we had a meeting and said, `Look,
it's mathematically possible to get back into it.' We did our part
when Miguel won four races. Coming into this race was the first
time we were back in the points. So we came all the way back from
nothing to get back into the hunt, but now we're out of it again.''

MANY EXPERTS QUESTION SPOCK'S DIET FOR CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The late Dr. Benjamin Spock, arguably the most influential
pediatrician of all time, has left children and their parents with
a surprising and rather demanding legacy: advice that they stick to
a vegetarian diet devoid of all dairy products after the age of 2.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh edition of his world-famous book, ``Baby and
Child Care,'' issued last month by Pocket Books just weeks after
his death at age 94, he recommends an approach to childhood
nutrition that many experts, including his co-author, Dr. Steven
Parker, consider too extreme and likely to result in nutritional
deficiencies unless it is very carefully planned and executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that there are harmful effects of a meaty diet,''
the new book tells parents. ``Children can get plenty of protein
and iron from vegetables, beans and other plant foods that avoid
the fat and cholesterol that are in animal products.'' As for dairy
foods, Spock says, ``I no longer recommend dairy products after the
age of 2 years. Other calcium sources offer many advantages that
dairy products do not have.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the influence of the book, pediatricians and nutritionists
have reacted with concern to Spock's new recommendations to raise
children on an all-plant or vegan diet. Throughout its 52-year
history, ``Baby and Child'' Care has been the second-best selling
book next to the Bible. Overall, parents continue to rely heavily
on Spock as an authoritative guide to raising children.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, pediatrician specializing in child
behavior at Boston City Hospital and a long-time admirer and friend
of Spock, called his new dietary recommendations ``absolutely
insane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with them at all,'' he said. ``A vegetarian diet
doesn't make any sense. Meat is an excellent source of the iron and
protein children need, and to take milk away from children _ I
think that's really dangerous. Milk is needed for calcium and
vitamin D.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts expressed concern about the ability of small children to
consume calories and fat to sustain normal growth on an all-plant
diet, as well as the diet's adequacy in supplying recommended
amounts of such essential nutrients as calcium, riboflavin, vitamin
D, iron and zinc and possibly even protein. They also said that
having to follow a vegetarian diet free of dairy products could
place undue social pressures on children, few of whom like to be
different from their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising children on an all-plant diet can be done, but it
would be like climbing Mount Everest,'' said Dr. Michael Georgiess,
professor of pediatrics and child development at the University of
Minnesota in Minneapolis. ``It would take an incredible amount of
planning and balancing of nutrients.'' Georgiess, who wrote the
chapter on vegetarian diets in the American Academy of Pediatrics
nutrition handbook, said that a strictly vegetarian diet ``involves
very significant risks. It would probably provide only about 60
percent of a small child's calorie needs and maybe the same
proportion of protein and would require supplementation with
vitamin D, calcium, iron and zinc.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc Jacobson, a specialist in adolescent medicine at
Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said, ``If a
strict vegetarian diet is part of someone's long-term culture, the
kids grow fine, though not as big. But for those who became vegans
recently, I can't say it's dangerous but there are risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the first edition of his landmark book in 1946,
Spock always included meat and milk products as part of a child's
recommended diet. Spock's revisions of what had been his most
recent nutritional advice _ to include small amounts of lean animal
foods in children's diets _ stemmed from a switch he himself made
to an all-plant diet in 1991, following a series of illnesses that
left him weak and unable to walk unaided. His wife, Mary Morgan,
said his health rebounded after he made the dietary change. He lost
50 pounds, regained his ability to walk and became healthier
overall and more energetic, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enabled him to revise his book before he died, which was
his most important goal,'' Ms. Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians for Responsible
Medicine, a Washington-based organization that advocates strict
vegetarian diets for everyone, said he had drafted the section on
nutrition in the new edition of Spock's book, but that Spock had
edited it to give it ``his personal touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morgan said, ``Ben had a hand in every part of the book''
and that he was ``very committed'' to the diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not difficult at all to get complete nutrition on a
vegan diet if it is supplemented with Vitamin D and B-12,'' Barnard
said in an interview. He said diet-related problems like obesity
and atherosclerosis begin in childhood and added, ``today's kids
are in worse health than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parker, the book's co-author and an expert in behavioral
pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, objected to the stringency of
the dietary advice and suggested that parents at least be offered
two alternatives. However, Spock rejected this idea, stating in a
letter to Parker that he wanted his book to be ``in the forefront''
of the growing awareness of the link between animal foods and
disease.

<P>
   Female empowerment isn't exactly new to Disney, given ``Beauty
and the Beast,'' ``The Little Mermaid,'' ``Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs,'' and a few other titles. But ``Mulan,'' Disney's new
animation about a young woman in old China who disguises herself as
a man to take her ailing father's place as a soldier and saves the
country, moves the theme and the Disney formula a big step forward.
After a few recent sub-par efforts, ``Mulan'' bracingly and
captivatingly reinvigorates the Disney animation line. Sporting the
look and feel of an instant classic, it's the studio's strongest,
freshest entry since ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   With Chinese art influencing the look of ``Mulan,'' it's not
only stylistically innovative, but the first full-length feature
out of Disney's Orlando facility. Given the chance to show what it
could do, the Orlando team vaults past its more established Burbank
colleagues to emerge as Disney's new animation pace-setters.
Luckily, the project kicked around long enough to have been rescued
from its original incarnation as a short, titled _ with consummate
political incorrectness and insensitivity _ ``China Doll.'' Far
from being a cute mannequin looking for the right prince, however,
``Mulan'' is Disney's most vital and complex animated heroine ever.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the very end does the possibility of love enter the
picture. Mulan, to whom the maidenly arts do not come naturally
anyway, has too much work to do. The antithesis of passivity, she's
tough, smart, opinionated, driven by honor and duty. Fearing her
father won't survive another army hitch, she chops off her hair,
dons his armor, and rides off to defend her country against the
fearsome chieftain of the Huns, Shan-Yu, who, as voiced by Mel
Ferrer, sounds as looming as he looks. Although she's accompanied
by the usual Disney comic sidekick, a shrimpy ancestral dragon who
looks like the perpetually disheveled cat from the old comic strip,
Bloom County, she never sits back waiting for supernatural
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   She's tough, passionate and smart _ a fact brought home in the
film's climax, when she outsmarts Shan-Yu and the Huns on a snowy
battlefield, even though they vastly outnumber the gallant little
Chinese army. Just as ``The Lion King'' suggested a familiarity
with ``Triumph of the Will'' and a few other film classics, this
one reinvents Eisenstein's famous battle on the ice from
``Alexander Nevsky'' (Kurosawa reinvented it, too, in ``Ran''). The
computer-generated parts of the scene never advertise themselves or
get in the way of the grandest, most sweeping tableaux since ``Lion
King.'' There's a lot more sophistication in ``Mulan'' than is
immediately apparent, including an air of cool independence.
</P>
<P>
   The artists also skillfully integrate the conventions of Chinese
art _ from the misty landscapes to Mulan's stylized horse _ into
the story, which, by the way, has the boldness to make the leading
male role, the brave but untried captain Shang, clearly subordinate
to Mulan. She even looks less like a young woman than any previous
Disney heroine. The scenes of her toughening herself up during
basic training could have come right out of ``G.I. Jane.'' She wins
over a rough trio of fellow recruits, who naturally become her best
buddies. Even at the end, when she's unmasked as a girl, and finds
herself in trouble from which only the emperor can extract her, she
compels the respect she earned from everybody, including Shang,
whose life she saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' is a warrior all the way. Her zestfulness and
innovation incline you to overlook, or at least minimize, Disney's
clinging to formula in the framework surrounding her, by which I
include the music, which sounds machine-made, as almost all the
music in Disney animations does. It's wallpaper for the ears, but
does no serious harm to Ming-Na Wan's voicing (and Lea Salonga's
singing) of Mulan, B.D. Wong's (sung by Donny Osmond) physically
brave but emotionally timid Shang, Murphy's scene-stealing dragon
named Mushu, and the others, ranging from Harvey Fierstein's army
buddy to Pat Morita's emperor. (Anticipating ethnic sensitivities,
Disney has prominently, and with a prudent eye to political
correctness, cast Asian actors in the speaking and singing roles;
Mulan's untraditional expression of indiviaulity and emotion will
strike a repsonsive chord among emerging Asian women of today.)
</P>
<P>
   Some Hollywood observers predict ``Mulan'' will face an uphill
battle because it's different. In my view, this is its strength.
``Mulan'' is not even that different, but it's different enough,
even though it has been calculated to present audiences with enough
reassuringly familiar Disney animation trademarks to hedge its
bets. Hollywood studio execs usually assume people want the same
old thing until they're surprised by how people react to newness
and departure from familiarity. ``The Truman Show'' is proving
that. ``Mulan'' will continue to prove it. Although it's Chinese
culture Disneyfied, it pulls far enough away from the Disney
formula to make you wish it had shown more of Mulan's independence
and moved even farther. ``Mulan'' is a winner.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Parker said Spock felt his vegetarian diet ``improved his
quality of life and given him a new lease on life his last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed you should try to inculcate a taste for plant
foods early on and not acquire a taste for saturated fats, salt,
etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said a vegetarian diet ``can be healthy for kids,'' if
parents make sure they obtain all the nutrients they need, but that
he did not believe people had to be vegetarian as children to adopt
the diet as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said in an interview, ``I think the book is a terrific
book. There was no other area in which we had a disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   The book does makes some concessions to parents who do not go
the full vegetarian route. ``If you are including meats, poultry or
fish in your regular family routine, let me encourage you to
explore vegetarian meals and to serve as many meat-less meals as
possible,'' Spock advises parents.
</P>
<P>
   But the book says placing children on an all-plant diet will
their risk of developing such health problems as heart disease,
obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and certain diet-related
cancers later in life. Several studies have shown that, in general,
vegetarians are leaner and at lower risk of such diseases. As for
dairy products, Spock wrote that some children are allergic to
cow's milk and others have trouble digesting it. He also noted that
milk protein may trigger insulin-dependent diabetes in susceptible
children.
</P>
<P>
   However, several experts questioned the need to be so extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be sticking to dietary changes that have
demonstrable health benefits, like those outlined in the food
pyramid _ that's where the evidence is right now,'' said Dr.
Johanna Dwyer, nutrition expert at Tufts-New England Medical Center
in Boston who has studied the effects of vegetarian diets on growth
and development. The food pyramid, a dietary guide developed by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, emphasizes grain-based foods,
fruits and vegetables but also includes meats, poultry, fish and
dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer said it would be possible to provide growing children with
adequate nutrition by following Spock's recommendations, but added,
``most people would need a lot of help to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nutrition experts strongly disagreed with Spock's advice to
avoid dairy foods. The book states that ``most green leafy
vegetables and beans have a form of calcium that is absorbed as
well as or even a bit better than that in milk.'' But the experts
noted that calcium-rich vegetables contain substances like
oxalates, phytates and other fibers that interfere with calcium
absorption in the gut. (Spock also suggested calcium-fortified soy
milk and orange juice as sources of this mineral that is critical
to the proper development of bones.)
</P>
<P>
   As for diabetes, Dr. Susan S. Baker, a pediatric
gastroenterologist at the Medical University of South Carolina and
chairperson of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on
Nutrition, said the committee had examined the evidence for milk as
a factor in the disease and had found ``no real cause-and-effect
relationship between them'' that would justify eliminating dairy
products from children's diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is a compelling reason to avoid dairy products,
they should not be deleted from a child's diet,'' Baker said. ``It
would be very difficult for a child to get adequate calcium from
vegetables in the quantities needed to support optimal bone growth.
Milk is the most concentrated source of bioavailable calcium.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazelton said the advice was ``neither parent-friendly nor
child-friendly.'' He pointed out that ``although vegetarian
families, if they are very careful and conscientious, can eat a
balanced diet, most children in their second and third year are in
such rebellion about food, it's hard to get them to eat any
vegetables. This recommendation puts pressure on parents who in
turn will put pressure on their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Older children, too, would face added pressure, he and others
said, when forced to eat differently from their friends in social
situations. Susan Adams, a registered dietitian and nutrition
educator at the University of Washington in Seattle who has written
pamphlets with vegetarian meal plans, said, ``By restricting
children's diets so much, they can't interact normally in social
situations with other children. What's a birthday party without ice
cream? Having to be treated separately is hard on kids.''
</P>
<P>
   It can also be hard on parents, who might have to spend more
time preparing meals, including box lunches for their school-age
children. Ms. Adams said, ``Rice and pasta can be quick to fix, but
cooking beans and other vegetarian foods takes time. It's not the
way most people live today. Parents shouldn't be made to feel
guilty or that they are putting their children at risk
nutritionally because they make other choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Bonci, a dietitian in private practice in Pittsburgh,
said that parents who decide to raise their children on a
plant-based diet must make vegetarianism a family affair. Ms.
Bonci, who is herself a plant-only vegetarian, has two sons, ages 9
and 14, who are also vegetarians but who consume some dairy
products and eggs. She said, ``Children are so influenced by what
their parents are and are not eating, they will balk if their
parents don't eat what they do.''

LYRES: STILL `ON FYRE' AFTER 22 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Conolly, singer-organist of the Lyres, works in used record
stores by day and proudly plies the trade of garage rock by night.
Here's what he says about his chosen field of music: ``Garage rock
goes up and down (in popularity), but the people are always the
same: At the lower spectrum of the food chain of rock 'n' roll.
We're at the bottom, essentially, where there's a lot more
infighting and backbiting.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet ...
</P>
<P>
   When the Boston-based Lyres are on _ Conolly playing his Vox
Continental one-handed, shaking a tambourine with the other, and
scream-singing, with his three mates pumping away _ life does not
get much better. At least in that moment. The sentiments in the
songs are pretty simple _ ``I wanna help you Ann!,'' ``Don't give
it up now!,'' ``Trying just to please you!'' _ but the music is
swirling, the power and passion undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really very good with lyrics and stuff,'' Conolly
says, ``so I try to make up for it with rhythms.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lyres have been with us, off and on, for 22 years. They were
formed out of the ashes of the band DMZ, which had a brief unhappy
life on Sire in the 1970s. Signed to Rick Harte's Ace of Hearts
label, the Lyres hit a peak in the mid-1980s _ there was a
four-year period Conolly says when the band was his only means of
support _ and disintegrated in 1988. Conolly split Boston for what
he believed to be the garage-rock mecca of San Diego, and formed a
Lyres with a different lineup. The band lasted a few months and
made no records. ``It was a cultural wasteland out there,'' says
Conolly, ``all yard sales and flea markets. I went because I
thought if I pulled the plug I could reinvent myself out there.''
In 1990, Conolly returned to Boston and the Lyres were reborn
again.
</P>
<P>
   A number of players have passed through the portals, but Conolly
is proud to state the current version is the longest-lasting to
date, more than four years. It includes cofounders, drummer Paul
Murphy and bassist Rick Coraccio, and guitarist Steve Aquino. Why
so many lineup changes?
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Jeff Conolly is cantankerous, volatile, and hard
to work with,''' says Conolly, and indeed people have said those
words. ``I've always had to take the rap, but it's garage rock
itself that's the fall guy. There's no money in garage rock, no
garage rock band ever has ever lasted more than a few years.''
Intact, at least. The Fleshtones and ? and Mysterians play on, and
the Lyres joined both bands for a glorious night of rocking a few
months back at the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The Lyres are celebrating a remastered four-CD re-release of the
discs ``Lyres,'' ``Lyres Lyres,'' ``On Fyre,'' and ``A Promise Is a
Promise'' on Matador. ``I'm a little bit proud of myself,'' Conolly
admits. ``It was a six-year project and was very slow going, but we
got to Matador right when we were ready for them to take care of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Conolly says the remastering process was done at Sterling
studios in New York by the same people involved with the Jimi
Hendrix and Led Zeppelin remasters. He calls the sound ``10 times
hotter'' than the original Lyres albums, adding, ``It's not phony,
no remixing or any of that junk.''
</P>
<P>
   If you only want to buy one, Conolly says, ``the smart money is
on `On Fyre.' That's what the project began with and the one I
cared about most.'' Agreed. The Lyres do beautiful justice to two
Kinks songs, ``Tired of Waiting'' and ``Love Me Till the Sun
Shines,'' and it features their best work including, ``She Pays the
Rent,'' ``Help You Ann,'' and ``Don't Give It Up Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Conolly, nicknamed Monoman for his love of monoaural sound, has
come to terms with his status in the pop world. ``We used to be
successful in the '80s because back then WBCN would play our
records,'' he says, ``which they don't do anymore. ... I'm starting
to become more content with my lot in the whole scheme of things.
I'm not as frustrated as I used to be. I'm not as upset. I don't
get messed up, either. I don't really need that right now. The
music does it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lyres go into the studio Sunday to work on a new song, ``(We
Ain't Got) Nothing Apart,'' and Conolly promises, ``I'm gonna have
a full-length record out, and a good one, before the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the garage rock genre _ experiencing a mini-rebirth at
present _ Conolly says, ``it keeps getting reinvented. There's a
continued interest in it, because over time, people realize the
stupider you get in rock _ well, it's a natural thing, to be stupid
and dumb. The more scholarly you get, the shorter the lifespan. It
will always be there, but it's always taken for granted, too. Once
in a while, you feel like giving up, but there's something that
makes you wanna keep doing it. It gets me out of the house.''

LOWE GEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nick Lowe was once called ``the Jesus of cool'' by an English
rock magazine. He promptly selected that over-the-top praise as the
tongue-in-cheek title of his solo debut album. (In America, it was
changed to ``Pure Pop for Now People.'')
</P>
<P>
   If, Lowe is asked, 20 years ago he was the Jesus of Cool, what
might he be now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I feel, ummm, I suppose I feel a bit of a grand old man
of Rockdom,'' says the long-graying 49-year-old Lowe. Indeed, he is
profiled in, of all places, the July Esquire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at it a long time,'' says Lowe, ``but I don't feel
very retro. I think I'm starting to get the hang of it. I think
when you're just doing what you did when you were a kid _ well,
it's so unseemly when you see the old geezers doing that. It just
looks awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer-bassist Lowe was one of the bright stars of
late-'70s-early '80s British new wave, as an artist and a producer,
the latter most notably for Elvis Costello. He was hardly a rookie,
having served nobly in the pub-rock group Brinsley Schwartz. He
cofounded Stiff Records, the label that helped give new wave its
early irreverence.
</P>
<P>
   His own pop gems included ``I Love My Label,'' ``(I Love the
Sound of) Breaking Glass,'' ``Heart of the City,'' ``So It Goes,''
``Marie Provost,'' ``Cruel to be Kind,'' ``(What's So Funny 'Bout)
Peace, Love and Understanding.'' He was Paul McCartney with a nod
and a wink. Melody: cheerful. Lyric: semisubversive.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, who recently released the CD ``Dig My Mood,'' is very much
an artist who's turned a corner, made a transition. To be truthful,
Lowe's been in turnaround mode for some years, ever since leaving
Rockpile, the band he formed with pal Dave Edmunds, in the
mid-'80s. ``The Impossible Bird'' made it clear in 1995, and ``Dig
My Mood'' takes Lowe's remaking a step farther. Where ``The
Impossible Bird'' seemed to rock gently, ``Dig My Mood'' barely
rocks, but draws you in for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Even if wit and irony, once primary tools of his trade, are on
holiday. Even if Lowe is not shouting his head off _ he's
caressing, massaging the lyrics. Even if there's no big walloping
backbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sort of done enough of that,'' Lowe explains prior to a
US tour. ``I can't imagine where I'd ever do that again. ... Europe
seems to be perceiving what I do now more favorably, but I've
noticed over here there's been a number of people who are genuinely
kind of aggrieved _ `Where's the rock?' _ and I don't like to see
people disappointed at my shows. But if they are, they're happy to
drop by the wayside and find someone else for them to relive their
youth through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dig My Mood'' is an often somber, melancholic, bittersweet
effort. There's plenty of nuance and atmosphere. There's a country
tinge. It's got the intimate feel of a rainy, late night session.
It features Lowe singing, ``The friends I've had are so-called
now/They slipped away somehow,'' and commiserating about being
``lost in lonesome reverie,'' about feeling ``so tired,'' in need
of a holiday. It's not the blues, but feels like the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Has Nick Lowe become a sad sack?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all. ``I certainly don't try and put my diary to music,''
says Lowe. ``It is not an autobiographical thing. That is of no
interest to me. I like pop which is `made up,' but having said
that, I love singing and writing songs that have got some bottom _
I don't mean bass, I mean substance, and in order to do that you've
got to know what it feels like to be blue. If you are blue, you
can't write any songs let alone go into the recording studio and do
them. But you've got to get in a sort of mood. My stick is that I
think depression is an illness, but being blue is a rite of
passage, and it's, in some way, kind of a glorious feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe notes that although he plays a chunk of the new CD in
concert, he dips into his catalog for songs that still make sense.
``Marie Provost'' doesn't make the cut _ ``a gruesome story with a
cheerful melody, it was fun but I can't put that across anymore,
it's too arch.'' ``Cruel to Be Kind'' makes it _ ``my bonafide Top
20 hit!, a very slight thing, but it turns people on.'' He still
knows the bride and the old hippie in him is still asking what's
funny 'bout peace, love, and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Lowe doesn't earn the bulk of his living from record
sales or concert tickets, but from other people covering his songs.
Huey Lewis and the News made Lowe a pile of money when they did ``I
Knew the Bride,'' and Curtis Stigers made Lowe a cool million when
his rendition of ``(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and
Understanding'' graced the mega-platinum soundtrack to ``The
Bodyguard.''
</P>
<P>
   Stigers, Lowe says, has a lifetime offer of four-star restaurant
dining whenever he comes to London and visits. ``Mind you,'' Lowe
cautions, the money ``is all gone, as I plowed it back into the
family firm. It enabled me to do `The Impossible Bird' and gave me
a degree of comfort. I could pay my guys (band) right. I bought a
couple of shirts, took a couple of people out to dinner, and that
has taken care of it. Everything's back to normal now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe the songwriter describes himself as a canny fisherman,
dangling his hook-packed songs off a line. ``A passing artist tends
to be swimming past,'' says Lowe, ``and they might hear my song and
go `That's a good song, I could do it better than that guy.' Then,
the rod bends, the line goes taut, and you're reeling 'em in, and
you've got a cover and that's really how I earn my living.''

 B-52s AND PRETENDERS: DIFFERENT STYLES, BUT BOTH IN TOP FORM  
 (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their 1980s heyday the B-52s and the Pretenders were both
considered new- wave rock, which shows how vague a category can be.
</P>
<P>
   The two bands, which began a summer tour together Thursday night
at the PNCBank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., shared an era but not
a sensibility. The B-52s turned a few campy jokes into a
fountainhead of giddy, joyful party songs; the Pretenders chronicle
Chrissie Hynde's shifting attitudes, from tough-talking rocker to
affectionate wife and mother.
</P>
<P>
   In Holmdel, both bands were in top form. The B-52s socked out
their garage-rock grooves as Fred Schneider, Kate Pierson and Cindy
Wilson performed every conceivable synchronized arm and wrist
maneuver except the macarena.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Hynde _ leading a band that includes drummer Martin
Chambers, the only other surviving member of the original
Pretenders _ brought out all of the swagger and underlying
tenderness in her songs. The tour comes to Radio City Music Hall in
New York City on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   Both bands wrote decidedly unconventional tunes when they
started. The combination of Schneider's nasal talk-singing and the
untutored, fervent belting of Ms. Pierson and Ms. Wilson is
downright peculiar, though satisfying. And through ignorance or
willfulness, their songs use melodies that stop and start and jump
around; ``Mesopotamia'' piles up short, asymmetrical motifs like
pick-up sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie Hynde's early songs for the Pretenders are dialogues
between her rhythm guitar and voice, with vocal lines tucked
between the chords; later, her voice seized the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   When the B-52s got together in the late 1970s, they resurrected
outre pop artifacts, like the twang of a surf guitar and the hoot
of cheap keyboards; their lyrics were about 1950s-style leisure,
complete with patio parties, and about the future as learned from
space-age cartoons. Lately, bands from the Beastie Boys to the
Propellerheads have rediscovered lounge music and half-forgotten
dance grooves, making the B-52s prescient.
</P>
<P>
   On stage, the B-52s romped through their catalog. With a
miniature disco ball hanging from Schneider's microphone, guitarist
Keith Strickland wearing a cowboy hat, Ms. Wilson in a green
feather boa and Ms. Pierson in a sequined dress that made her look
like a Las Vegas Valkyrie, the band still has an eye for retro
frivolity. Amid songs about a dog dyed green, alien abductions,
strobe lights and the ``Love Shack,''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider delivered the least necessary introduction of all
time: ``This is a dance tune,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hynde, who taught a generation of rock women some ways to be
feisty, simply played a supercharged set. With a voice that shifted
from offhanded sultriness to a thoughtful vibrato, and a band that
adds a little rockabilly twang to the old Pretenders sound, she
moved from elegies to defiance to guarded love songs to vows of
loyalty. A new song, a ballad in Spanish, ponders sadness and hope.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hynde wrested back ``My City Was Gone'' from Rush Limbaugh's
radio show, which used its opening riff, by rearranging the song
without the riff. And in ``Brass in Pocket,'' she enlisted women
from the audience to sing what she had helped teach them: ``I'm
special.''

     REPORT CITES LOW-SKILL `JOB GAP' IN AUSTIN
 &HT;     Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;     By SAMAR ABULHASSAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Austin's employers are not creating enough jobs for
workers with low skills, according to a national report released
Friday, but local officials said they had high hopes of overcoming
the job gap.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12,180 low-skill jobs will become available by 2003 for the
14,229 current welfare recipients expected to enter the local job
market, according to a ``State of the Cities'' report issued by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at a U.S.
Conference of Mayors meeting in Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes data from a Conference of Mayors survey
predicting that in 74 metropolitan counties, the number of welfare
recipients seeking jobs by 2003 would exceed the available
low-skill jobs by about 350,000. Low-skill jobs include machine
operators, unskilled laborers and those in the food and service
industry, which often require little or no high school education.
</P>
<P>
   As federal welfare reform efforts try to move all able-bodied
recipients into the workplace, ``the challenge is for the nation to
produce jobs on the scale needed to accommodate all of the
households making the transition,'' said J. Thomas Cochran,
executive director of the Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   But Austin officials say that their city's projected job deficit
_ which projects 1.2 people vying for each low-paying job _ is
relatively small compared to other cities' and is easily
surmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that we have a tight low-skill market,''
said Mayor Kirk Watson. ``But as that period of time goes by, if
we're providing jobs, training and work force skills, those numbers
could change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a real opportunity by being in a situation where you
have as low as a deficit as this one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin currently has several efforts in place to ease the
transition from public assistance to self-sufficiency, including
the Welfare to Work Coalition, a four-month-old program attempting
to ``bring all the stakeholders together,'' including social
service agencies, to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Butler, executive director of the Community Action Network,
which directs the coalition, said, ``the most critical issue is to
get a real understanding of what makes up the population we're
dealing with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The major factors in moving people off public assistance, Butler
said, is providing job training services, child care and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how do we tie it all together and provide
support services to allow them to move out of self-sufficiency?''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Travis County, there were 3,346 adults on Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families as of this month, or 8,397 people
when children are included, Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the HUD report, the national economy has produced
more than 16 million new jobs in the past five years, with
unemployment at a 28-year low. But the report found that cities are
still suffering from concentrations of poverty, shrinking
populations and inadequate housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about something insurmountable,'' William
Apgar, a senior HUD official, said in a conference call with
reporters on Friday. ``These problems are well within our reach.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat this problem, the administration wants Congress to
expand or create a number of programs in fiscal 1999, which starts
Oct. 1, including a new $400 million fund to create and retain an
estimated 280,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's ``urban agenda is helping cities continue to
recover from years of decline and making them better places to live
and work,'' HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. ``This
is a midterm report card with an A grade for cities, but there is
still work to be done.''

RICCI'S WICKED WAYS MAKE `OPPOSITE' ATTRACTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE OPPOSITE OF SEX 
Directed and written by: Don Roos 
Starring: Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan, Lisa Kudrow, Lyle
Lovett, Johnny Galecki, Ivan Sergei, William Scott Lee 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rated: R (strong language and sex-related dialogue and sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Opposite of Sex'' reminds us that a little family
dysfunction goes a long way. There's more dysfunction than the film
can frankly sustain. Still, even though it capsizes, it sports a
tangy performance from Christina Ricci as a would-be sex bomb
armoring herself from her own youth and inexperience with an
icepick tongue. Flawed though the film may be, it's an impressive
move by Ricci beyond juvenile roles into acerbic teen assignments,
keeping the promise of her precocious malcontent in ``The Ice
Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his inventiveness flags, writer-director Don Roos, in
his debut film, certainly keeps Ricci's Dedee supplied with
scorchers that begin flying from her mouth before she's even left
home in Louisiana and keep going in voice-overs when she's not in
scenes. After verbally skewering her mother and a teen lover of the
moment, she complicates the life of her gay half brother, Bill, who
until her arrival had been leading a stable existence as an English
teacher in a small Indiana town, in, you might say, ``In &AMP; Out''
territory.
</P>
<P>
   As Bill, Martin Donovan does a lot to make passivity droll. Lisa
Kudrow's Lucia, the virginal sister of Bill's dead lover, makes her
maladroit ways seem simultaneously funny and sad. Their patience is
soon enough put to the test by Dedee, who loses little time
seducing Bill's hunky new lover, Ivan Sergei's Matt. Getting
pregnant, she takes off with him and a chunk of Bill's money.
Before it's over, Bill must chase them down to Arizona, then clear
himself of a false accusation of seducing the jilted lover of the
guy who now has jilted Bill.
</P>
<P>
   There's compassion at the core of ``The Opposite of Sex,'' and a
rueful understanding of the permutations and combinations of
loneliness-driven relationships and the ways people stay lonely by
defending themselves too well. But the dysfunctional canterings
soon seem to be unfolding by rote, especially given Roos's
inability to make the actors do little beyond zombie-ing through
them in the apparent hope that their affectlessness will pass for
cool. There are glints of originality in ``The Opposite of Sex,'' a
talent for an arresting turn of phrase, and an impressive balance
between vulnerability and wildness in Ricci's Dedee. But the film
can't avoid seeming to take place in a vacuum long before it's
over.

X-FILES: THE TRUTH IS STILL OUT THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE X-FILES: FIGHT THE FUTURE 
Directed by: Rob Bowman 
Screenplay by: Chris Carter 
Starring: David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Martin Landau, William
B. Davis, Armin Mueller-Stahl, John Neville 
Running time: 121 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (some violence, a dash of adult language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In transporting ``The X-Files'' from small screen to big, Chris
Carter, the television series' creator, presented himself with a
rather daunting challenge: how to make a film satisfying to both
newcomers and the program's rabid devotees.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, the popular Fox series has been a frustratingly
slow but deliciously seductive tease, revealing bits and pieces of
an expansive government conspiracy involving extraterrestrial life.
At the heart of it are FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David
Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the two-person team
investigating the so-called X-Files within which may lie the fate
of humankind. All this has spawned thousands of Websites and
newsgroups and created one of the great water cooler shows of all
time. Hence, ``X-Files'' philes will enter their local cineplex
looking to be rewarded with deserved answers to lots of questions.
</P>
<P>
   But what about all those people who've never watched the series,
and wouldn't know the Cigarette-Smoking Man from the Marlboro Man?
If the movie were too inside baseball, many moviegoers would be
left dazed and confused, if they bother to go at all. Not exactly
what Carter wanted for his $65 million movie.
</P>
<P>
   So, it speaks volumes about the talents of Carter, as well as
the work of Duchovny and Anderson, that he almost pulls this movie
off. That's almost. ``The X-Files'' is an intense, entertaining
movie, more likely to appease nonfans more than those who schedule
their lives the show's broadcast each week. Which isn't to say
Carter and director Rob Bowman, who has helmed more than two dozen
of the show's episodes, don't give aficionados a few answers to
long-pondered questions. They just don't offer enough.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the truth; the tease is out there.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins with a flashback, and what a flashback _ all
the way back to 35,000 B.C., with two fur-clad cavemen making their
way across the snowy tundra. Within a cave, they they encounter
what fans will immediately recognize as the nefarious black oil
(later revealed as something far, far nastier). Fast forwards to
the present day, where that once snowbound site now a dust-choked
North Texas field. Once a group of boys out for a day of adventure
stumble into the same oil-oozing cave, the conspiracy is up and out
of the blocks.
</P>
<P>
   When the show ended its fifth season last month, the X-Files had
been torched. Mulder and Scully have been reassigned to an
anti-terrorist unit, and wouldn't you know it, they're looking for
a possible bomb in a government building in Texas. The bomb
explodes, takes out an FBI bomb expert, and leaves a bite in the
edifice which looks eerily like the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City after Timothy McVeigh paid his deadly
visit in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, it's not a coincidence, and it's quite
unsettling. Nothing from the fevered mind of Carter is ever a
coincidence. One of the program's staples is seasoning its shows
with just enough history and reality _ say, the public's continuing
disbelief concerning the official report on the assassination of
John F. Kennedy, or the Buffalo Bills' inability to win the Super
Bowl _ to make viewers wonder about their own government officials,
and all the deep, dark secrets they may be keeping from us.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder is approached by Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil (Martin Landau), a
gynecologist so stoked by his own alien conspiracy theories, even
Mulder finds him paranoid. But he eventually convinces Mulder that
the bombing was part of an elaborate cover-up designed conceal
something hidden within the building.
</P>
<P>
   Suspected government coverups are to ``The X-Files'' what
state-of-the-art sports cars are to James Bond. Each has to be more
elaborate and lethally loaded than the one before. This one is a
beaut, which racks up frequent flyer miles from Texas to Washington
D.C. to London to Antartica.
</P>
<P>
   And here's where the film gets a little slippery. The first half
of the film, for the most part, is what fans have been waiting for.
But since Carter can't reveal his entire hand _ novices won't get
it, and he still has at least two more TV seasons to fill _ the
second half pretty much becomes standard action fare, albeit one
which isn't afraid to have a brain and snappy dialogue. There are
chases, explosions, and plug-ugly, bloodthirsty creatures, but real
fans may feel disappointed that wherever the truth is, it isn't
necessarily in this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some characters prominent in the television show are all
but relegated to wallpaper such as Mitch Pileggi, who plays
Assistant FBI Director Walter Skinner, Mulder and Scully's
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Duchovny and Anderson are just as electric and
entertaining to watch in the theater as on TV. With the whip-smart
banter of Tracy and Hepurn, the relationship between Mulder and
Scully has always been one of the program's hallmarks. Even if the
actors aren't that fond of each other in real life, there is an
undeniable chemistry between the two, and Carter has wicked fun
with the sexual tension within their platonic, but charged
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   William B. Davis as Cigarette-Smoking Man is also there,
scheming and doing his part for the tobacco states, but his
resonance is lessened. Thinking about those mainstream audiences,
Carter likely had no choice. Making a far greater impact is John
Neville as Well-Manicured Man, who has some surprises under his
perfectly-tailored sleeve. With his haunted eyes and serial
killer-grin, Landau brings such a tangible paranoia to Krutzweil,
it's a wonder he hasn't been on the TV show before.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ``The X-Files'' is far more enjoyable than most of
the nonsense taking up screen space this summer. But the quality of
the TV show has raised expectations impossibly high for this film.
At its best, the program is a wonderful, at times brilliant
60-minute film every week. Virtually, the same can be said of this
two-hour ``X-Files'' movie.

POPE IN AUSTRIA, WHERE CHURCH IS BESET BY DIVISION AND APATHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALZBURG, Austria _ Pope John Paul II arrived in Austria on
Friday on a mission to grapple with two of the most troubling
problems of his pontificate in the Western world _ bitter divisions
inside church ranks, and the alienation and indifference of the
prosperous society around it.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than in the United States and Western Europe, the
Roman Catholic Church in Austria is in crisis, as many people
abandon it and reformers challenge its leadership on such
contentious issues as celibacy, women's ordination, and the role of
the laity.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues were compounded by a recent sex scandal that forced
the resignation of the archbishop of Vienna, the leader of the
church in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In a homily in a Salzburg cathedral, the pope urged, ``Don't
leave the church!'' He warned that many Europeans are more
attracted to ``the feast of well-being and consumerism'' than the
feast of the Eucharist.
</P>
<P>
   And while lauding the efforts of lay believers, he also reminded
his Austrian audience that the church expects its followers to
respect the rules. ``In the flock of the Good Pastor, the equality
of dignity does not mean equality of office and activity,'' John
Paul said in German, reading from a text. ``The particular duties
of priests cannot be simply passed to the laity.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the pope's third trip to Austria, and in the 10 years
since his last visit, the world and the Catholic church has changed
dramatically. Then, the church was one of the driving forces behind
the burgeoning revolt against communism in Eastern Europe. Now that
battle is over, and other more internal conflicts dominate the
Catholic agenda. Some 77 percent of Austrians are Catholic, but a
recent poll indicated that less than 20 percent attend church
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The ideological rift within the Austrian church, moreover, was
deepened by a scandal that bred rebellion and mass defections.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, a conservative who was appointed by
Pope John Paul II in 1986, was forced to resign in 1995 amid
allegations that he molested seminarians 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh charges of sexual abuse surfaced in January. When a
leading conservative bishop dismissed the priest who made them
public, it intensified the rift.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to smooth the path for the pope's visit, Groer's
replacement, Cardinal Cristoph Shonborn, took the extraordinary
step last April of declaring that the charges were true and
apologizing publicly for his predecessor's actions. The church then
let it be known that the disgraced cardinal would be sent to a
monastery outside Austria for the duration of the pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Before the pope's mass, Shonborn told reporters that the crisis
in the Austrian church was real, but could be overcome. ``We need
to regain mutual trust, and the only way is through discussion and
dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old cardinal is conservative in doctrinal matters,
but diplomatic and open in manner, and is often described as
``papabile,'' someone who could someday be elected pope. But the
impasse within his church is unlikely to be quickly resolved even
by a papal visit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last November, the bishop of Innsbruck, Reinhold Stecher, sent a
letter to the Vatican criticizing its unyielding position on such
issues as celibacy for priests and lay workers delivering mass.
``Rome has lost the image of mercy and assumed the image of harsh
authority,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the cathedral and outside on the square, followers
greeted the pope with cheers, applause and emotional tears. But on
the same square, many young people expressed the alienation that
brought the 78-year-old pope back to Austria for a third pastoral
visit, which ends Sunday, when he leaves Vienna for Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the church were more open to young people, I would be more
interested, said Anne Pichler, 21, a psychology student in Salzburg
who walked past the cathedral square with a friend, and declined to
linger for a glimpse of the pope. ``The pope is the head of the
church but he is an old man and I can't identify with him.''

RANDY TRAVIS: NO LONGER `ALONE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Singer Randy Travis isn't joking when he says, ``Any
entertainment business is a strange business.'' That surely
describes today's country music, where flavor-of-the-month
newcomers are often given preferential treatment over artists of
his stature. By that, we mean artists who have been around long
enough to realize that Merle Haggard, Tammy Wynette, and George
Jones mean more to the music's legacy than the dime-a-dozen,
faux-cowboy hat acts romping through Nashville's MTV-style videos.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk one up for the good guys, however, because Travis is
getting a second commercial life.
</P>
<P>
   After selling 20 million records, scoring 15 Top10 hits, and
launching the New Traditionalist movement with its return to
fiddles and steel guitars, Travis fell into a mid-'90s limbo that
is finally lifting. He recently notched a No.1 hit, ``Out of My
Bones,'' followed by a new single, ``The Hole,'' which is racing up
the charts with its apt verse about digging oneself out of a hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all about that,'' says Travis. ``It does seem like
radio has welcomed me back,'' Travis says during a break from this
week's Fan Fair in Nashville. ``I hadn't recorded in over a year.
And you're not sure if radio is going to play you or not. Sometimes
they forget you and want nothing else to do with you. But that
hasn't been the case.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been the case because the stubborn Travis, now 39,
wouldn't let it be. As the son of a North Carolina construction
worker, he knows about toughing it out. After releasing 12 albums
with Warner Bros., he made a career-saving move to DreamWorks, the
well-endowed label owned by entertainment moguls Steven Spielberg,
David Geffen, and Jeffrey Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Travis's engaging new album, ``You and You Alone'' thus became
the first on the new DreamWorks Records Nashville label.
</P>
<P>
   ``DreamWorks has been behind me 110 percent,'' says Travis, who
had feuded with the CEO of Warner Bros. and the head of its country
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   He feels doubly vindicated with the success of the singles
because he says Warners made some wrong decisions when promoting
singles, but that DreamWorks has given him more leeway and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought one of my strong points was choosing good
material,'' says Travis. ``And I think we're proving that can still
be the case. The fact that I signed with DreamWorks and the first
single went to No.1 proves that I am not wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis, known as a song interpreter rather than a writer, also
did his part by knuckling down and choosing some terrific songs for
the new disc. They range from the Western swing of ``Stranger in
the Mirror'' to the country-rock of ``I'm Still Here, You're Still
Gone'' (with the Grammy-winning Alison Krauss singing backup), to
the mature title track (with Vince Gill and Melba Montgomery on
backup) and the thoughtful ``Spirit of a Boy, Wisdom of a Man,''
about teenage pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look and look and look to find good songs,'' says
Travis. ``We went through over 1,000 songs. There were four of us
looking for five months to find songs. They're harder to find,
simply because there are so many artists looking. And regardless of
how good a writer is, if he writes 20 songs, there might only be
one in there worth recording. And I would say that's true of most
writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis was no stranger to hits in the '80s and early '90s _ such
radio classics as ``On the Other Hand,'' ``Forever and Ever,
Amen,'' and ``Look Heart, No Hands.'' But that was before country
became diluted by so many here-today, gone-tomorrow acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very strong opinions about what's happening in country
music,'' says Travis. ``I think (the labels) oversign acts, and
when that happens, you have more records than radio can possibly
play. And often you don't find out who is recording a certain song.
They may become hits, but you don't know who does them.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis still loves country legends like Haggard and Jones
(``he's still one of the best singers in any genre''), but as for
new male acts, he likes Trace Adkins, Darryl Singletary, and Tim
McGraw. As for females, he loves Patty Loveless, Faith Hill, and
Trisha Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   He also has some strong feelings about all the ``crossover''
attempts of country acts to capture pop listeners. ``We've drifted
too far to the pop format,'' he says. ``Variety is great, but this
is country music, after all. We should stick closer to the roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis's down-home voice is not only easily recognizable, but
so, these days, is his well-chiseled face, since he has a dual
career as a movie star. He has 25 film and TV credits to his
resume, including films such as ``The Rainmaker,'' ``Maverick,''
and this spring's ``Black Dog,'' his first starring vehicle, in
which he shared the limelight with Patrick Swayze. ``I played a bit
of a redneck in it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is ``The White River Kid'' with Ellen Barkin and Antonio
Banderas. ``I play a sheriff who's kind of nuts,'' Travis says with
a laugh. ``I guess you'd call it a dark comedy. My character is way
out there. He's running for election and if he sees his opponent's
picture on a telephone pole, he shoots at it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Travis says he didn't join DreamWorks _ despite the
presence of Spielberg _ in order to further his movie career. ``We
wanted to keep that separate,'' he says of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's just glad to be touring again. He's glad to be
coming back to New England, where previously he has played the
Worcester Centrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I've been up in that part of the country, the
audience has responded wonderfully,'' Travis says. ``I couldn't ask
for a better response.''

FUND WATCH: WHERE YOU CAN TURN IF THE BOTTOM DROPS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 21)  
 (bl)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUIZ: If the Dow Jones industrial average drops 1,500 points,
American workers invested in defined contribution plans will:
</P>
<P>
   (a) panic
</P>
<P>
   (b) ignore the selloff
</P>
<P>
   (c) receive calm and measured advice from their 401(k) plan
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   If you're counting on (c), think again.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by William M. Mercer Inc., a human
resources consulting firm, more than half the 209 employers
surveyed _ 52 percent _ have no plans to communicate with their
employees in the event of a major market selloff. Nor have they
looked into whether their plan vendor is prepared, willing or able
to provide the employees with information or service in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The great majority of the remaining 48 percent have only
informal plans to communicate with their employees or simply expect
their plan vendor to handle the job for them, according to the
survey. (There was no word as to whether such vendors would,
indeed, provide such hand-holding.)
</P>
<P>
   Only a piddling 3 percent of the employers surveyed had formal
plans in place to counsel their employees in a major stock market
downdraft. Such a plan might include making sure that managers and
supervisors are prepared to counsel employees against making
drastic moves.
</P>
<P>
   The long-running bull market has, of course, rewarded Americans
who invest regularly in their company's 401(k) retirement plans.
But a market downturn could obliterate employees' confidence _ and
leave companies scrambling to deal with the employees' problems.
Employees typically have at least two-thirds of their 401(k)'s
invested in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been through a really large or extended correction
during the 10 years in which 401(k) plans have become so popular,''
said Brian Ternoey, a principal with Mercer. ``How companies help
employees through a downturn will affect their attitude toward
investing for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund companies learned their lesson the hard way in 1987,
when frantic investors couldn't get through to telephone
representatives to sell their shares. Fund companies have since
geared up for similar disasters, and in fact weathered the 1990
downturn very easily.
</P>
<P>
   Companies, for their part, overwhelmingly believe that the
vendors who run their 401(k)'s will be able to handle a selloff.
Among other things, the survey found that the companies believe
vendors will communicate with their employees and manage to handle
phone calls and high trading volume. But Ternoey said the staff at
401(k) vendors has not necessarily received training to help
investors handle a market crash.
</P>
<P>
   How companies deal with the issue of employee hand-holding may
well have an impact on their own stock. Of the respondents, 32
percent said they included company stock as an investment option
within their 401(k)'s. Of those, 22 percent said that more than 50
percent of the plan's assets was invested in company stock.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's Analyst Fund
</P>
<P>
   Putnam Investments introduced a new fund to the public that
tests the stock-picking prowess of its well-respected research
department without the help of a dedicated, professional manager.
The lead manager of the fund, Putnam Research, is Thomas Bogan,
Putnam's associate director of global equity research. He heads a
team of 43 analysts that picks 70 to 90 mostly midsize-to-large
U.S. companies for the fund's portfolio. The analysts use a blend
of value and growth investing styles and closely hew to the sector
weightings of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has been open without a load to Putnam employees and
trustees living in Massachusetts since October 1995. Since
inception, the fund has returned an annual average of 32.8 percent
through March 31, 1998, Putnam said.
</P>
<P>
   For the public, the fund, which holds $14.6 million in assets,
levies a maximum initial sales charge of 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's new fund arrives as a couple of other analyst-based
offerings have been started. Massachusetts Financial Services,
which began the analyst-only MFS Research fund in 1991, opened an
international version of that fund in January to outside investors,
after running it with seed money for one year. The State Street
Research Galileo fund, another analyst-run offering, was also
opened this year.
</P>
<P>
   Third Avenue Value Shut
</P>
<P>
   Value manager Martin Whitman will close his flagship fund, Third
Avenue Value, to new investors effective July 15. Whitman's chief
concern is the fund's huge cash position, which accounts for about
30 percent of the fund's $1.82 billion in assets, a company
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Whitman announced plans to open a real estate
value fund this fall; it will invest in real estate and related
companies. Whitman and a real estate analyst at his firm will be
co-managers.
</P>
<P>
   It's an asset class with which Whitman has some familiarity.
About 15 percent of Third Avenue Value's assets is invested in real
estate, as is 25 percent of the Third Avenue Small-Cap Value fund.

FOR ALLMANS, ALL ROADS LEAD TO BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Allman Brothers Band is the quintessential Southern rock
act, yet it has enjoyed a longstanding love affair with New
England. The group is playing three area dates this summer _ up
from two last year _ and all are at the 19,900-capacity Great Woods
Center for the Performing Arts &UR;  &LR; in Mansfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start the tour in Boston, end it in Boston, and also start
the second leg of the tour in Boston,'' Allmans drummer Butch
Trucks said of the additional July 31 and Sept. 19 shows. ``The
demand seems to be there. I don't know if it's a tribute to Boston
that we're playing all these shows, but we sure do appreciate it.
If every city treated us as well, we'd make a good living.''
</P>
<P>
   That last remark is an attempt at humor, because the Allmans, as
most anyone knows, have made a tremendous living in recent years.
Not only have they been playing well, but their fan base has
increased because of the number of Deadheads who have come aboard
since Jerry Garcia died.
</P>
<P>
   The Allmans had a few moments of tension last year while
integrating new members Oteil Burbridge (bass) and Jack Pearson
(guitar). But Trucks said the tension is now gone. ``We're starting
to lock in with Oteil and Jack. We're doing a lot of jamming and
are taking more chances. Everyone has just gotten used to each
other. The more you do that, the deeper the musical conversation.
We're able to get out on the edge a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Allmans also are getting looser about their song lists. Last
year, they alternated two separate shows. This year, they've raised
that to three different set lists, but they're changing those
around as well. They're also digging out some songs, such as
``Don't Keep Me Wondering,'' ``Nobody Knows,'' ``High Falls,'' and
``Ain't Wastin' Time No More.''
</P>
<P>
   The Allmans are so confident that they're only doing one
rehearsal before tonight's show. Trucks feels they will still be in
a groove based on the 15 nights they did at New York's Beacon
Theatre in March. ``Those Beacon shows were so much fun,'' he said.
``And at times, we played as well as we've ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   The band members also have kept up their chops through side
projects this year. Gregg Allman made a solo album and toured
behind it. And Trucks and Burbridge were part of Frogwings, a
jazz-rock act that likewise toured. (Look for a record from them
next year on Trucks's label, Flying Frog Records.)
</P>
<P>
   But for the last 2 1/2 months, the Allmans have been off the
road. ``We're ready to go to work again,'' said Trucks. ``And we're
looking forward to Boston again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Allmans also have a new album, ``Mycology, an Anthology''
(mycology is the study of mushrooms) on Sony's 550 label. It
contains tracks from their last five discs on Epic Records, as well
as an acoustic ``Midnight River'' and some live material from the
Atlanta Pop Festival in 1970.

   A bewitching Sinead: Sinead O'Connor was stiff and somewhat
out-of-sync during her show with the Chieftains at Harborlights in
Boston Wednesday, but she was infinitely better when she swung over
to sing later that night at McGann's Pub near North Station at 1
a.m. She joined the Donal Lunny Band (from Dublin) and flashed more
smiles in her short set than she did in her entire show at
Harborlights. She might not like to hear this, but she also seemed
more comfortable with Lunny's Band than with her own. At the
jampacked McGann's, which was experiencing its greatest moment
since opening a few years ago, O'Connor even climaxed with ``Danny
Boy,'' investing it with such dignity that you could have heard a
pin drop in the room. And she humorously introduced it by saying,
``This is going to be very sad, so shut up!'' She also did one of
her own songs (``I Stretched Across Your Grave'') and added a
transporting version of ``Dawning of the Day.'' It was a charming
set, backed by the sure hand of guitarist Lunny (known for his
association with Planxty and Moving Hearts) and an all-star cast
that featured fiddler Molly Casey and squeezebox virtuoso Sharon
Shannon.

   Renaming Great Woods?: Promoter Don Law confirmed this week that
discussions have been held to rename Great Woods with a corporate
imprint. One of the possibilities is Fleet Bank (yikes, Fleet
Woods?), but Law said that no deal has yet been done. And the talks
started taking place well before Law's Blackstone Entertainment
company was sold to SFX. ``The sale had nothing to do with it,'' he
said, rebutting a newspaper report last week that said it did.
</P>
<P>
   One direct result of the SFX purchase, however, is to soon
implement SFX's push for a second stage for all Great Woods
concerts, not just for the major touring festivals. The second
stage would feature local bands. The reasons? ``To expose new
talent, to get people out of the parking lots, and obviously to get
people to use the venue earlier,'' said Law.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 216.
WASHINGTON, June 19 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments this week.
A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the
member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not
vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: TOBACCO
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Wednesday to kill the tobacco settlement bill
proposed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. The bill sought to cut
teenage smoking by giving the government authority to regulate
nicotine as a drug and by increasing the federal tax on tobacco by
$1.10 per pack of cigarettes, which would have raised more than
$500 billion. Although the procedural vote was 57 to 42 in favor of
bringing the bill to a vote, under Senate rules, 60 votes were
needed. Supporters said that opponents overloaded the bill with
extra programs to make it unpalatable. Opponents said that the bill
created too many new programs, unfairly focused a tax on low-income
Americans and included no limits on the liability of tobacco
comanies. A ``yes'' vote favored bringing the measure to a vote,
and a ``no'' vote effectively killed the bill.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: TAXES
</P>
<P>
   The House voted Wednesday, 219-209, to overhaul the current tax
code by December 31, 2002. Supporters said the tax code needs to be
reformed because it is too complicated for the average American to
understand. Opponents said it would be risky to overhaul the tax
code without putting an alternative code in place. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   The House approved Thursday, 225-197, a tax cut to offset
elementary and secondary education expenses, including for private
and religious school tuition. The bill would allow parents to save
as much as $2,000 a year for school expenses for each child without
paying taxes on the interest. Supporters said public schools are
failing America's children, and parents should have the opportunity
to try alternatives. Opponents said the bill would only help
wealthy families who already send their children to private
schools. A ``yes'' vote favors the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: CHINA
</P>
<P>
   The House voted Thursday, 409-10, to set up a special
nine-member committee to assess whether U.S. national security was
undermined by the President when he allowed the Chinese government
to launch U.S. satellites on Chinese rockets. Supporters said
allegations in the national media that the President's decision had
undermined U.S. national security were credible and deserved to be
investigated. Opponents of the measure made no statements on the
House floor statements. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

ONLY GLOBAL POLICY CHANGE WILL END ILLEGAL DRUG RAMPAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 21 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We believe the global war on drugs is now causing more harm
than drug abuse itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Under that banner headline in a double-truck ad of the June 8
New York Times, an astounding array of prominent and accomplished
world citizens appealed to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan for a
major shift in drug-fighting worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Fully one-twelfth of all international trade involves traffic in
illegal narcotics, it is claimed. And while no one can be sure of
the scope of the drug economy, the number could be right on the
button. And it is also inescapable that governments worldwide
routinely fail to contain the worsening social deterioration that
accelerates despite ever-harsher methods.
</P>
<P>
   The criminalization of drug use imprisons many hundreds of
thousands, perhaps millions of sniffers, snorters, swallowers,
injectors. As an inevitable byproduct of the
into-your-bloodstream-with-a-rush economy, the drug trade also
corrupts law enforcement, governments, and the judiciary.
Meanwhile, drug suppliers grow fabulously wealthy, and insulate
their criminal conspiracies from punishment. The United Nations
estimates that more than $1 billion a day goes for illegal drugs
worldwide, and the $400 billion-per-year estimate seems low to
some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day politicians endorse harsher new drug war
strategies,'' said the letter, coordinated by the Lindesmith Center
of New York. But those who call for alternatives to the current
consensus of failed policies ``are accused of `surrendering,''' and
the wasteful spending on searches and suppression increases as drug
use spreads.
</P>
<P>
   The signers of this public petition include some impressive
achievers: Walter Cronkite is nobody's fool. There are ``formers''
such as ex-senators Claiborne Pell and Alan Cranston,
ex-presidential adviser Lloyd Cutler. ex-US Surgeon General
Joycelyn Elders, and ex-Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach.
</P>
<P>
   There are influential big-city mayors such as Willie Brown of
San Francisco and Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore and San Jose's Susan
Hammer. There are prominent professors from across the continent,
an array of academics such as Harvey Cox, Cornel West, Andrew Weil,
Herbert Gans, James Vorenberg, Mathew Meselson, and Stephen Jay
Gould.
</P>
<P>
   There are some big-time Georges, such as philanthropist George
Soros and former US Secretary of State George Shultz, and big-time
preachers such as the Revs. Leon Sullivan, Floyd Flake, and Calvin
Butts 3d.
</P>
<P>
   There's Lani Guinier and Lester Grinspoon, the American Civil
Liberties Union's Ira Glasser and the venerable and very
conservative economist Milton Friedman, cheek-by-jowl alongside
various CEOs and federal judges (Denver's John Kane, New York's
Robert Sweet and John Curtin,), and Irish cops such as Patrick
Murphy, once police commissioner of New York, and Joseph McNamara,
once top cop in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   These serious and accomplished individuals have dared put their
names on a petition for which, if they were running for office in
the vast majority of US jurisdictions, they'd be pilloried. Because
in the current political climate of mindless mimicry of the failed
policy of interdiction, of search-and-destroy, of
lock-up-the-little-guy-while-the-kingpins-live-high-on-the-hog, it
can be hazardous to a politician's health to point out how badly
the drug war is lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all deeply concerned,'' says the letter, ``about the
threat drugs pose to our children, our fellow citizens and our
societies.'' And the signers from other countries are more
impressive in their scope than the US signatories.
</P>
<P>
   People who ran the governments of the Netherlands, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Nicaragua, writers such as Germany's Gunter Grass and
Ivan Illich, Italy's Nobelist Dario Fo, Canada's Jane Jacobs, put
their names to the petition.
</P>
<P>
   There's a plethora of Nobel laureates, top cops from Jamaica and
Scotland Yard, the lord mayor of Melbourne, the former UN chief,
Peru's Javier Perez de Cuellar, parliamentarians and professors
galore, from New Zealand to the Arctic Circle, and some civil
rights campaigners who made the long march in other causes, such as
South Africa's Helen Suzman, who knew what it was like to take up a
crusade before it was safe or popular with the powers that be.
</P>
<P>
   The criminals coining wealth on the backs of drug users get away
with more than murder. The letter points out the obvious: They
``corrupted governments at all levels, eroded internal security,
stimulated violence, and distorted both economic markets and moral
values.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's an additional point: ``These are the consequences
not of drug use per se, but of decades of failed and futile drug
war policies. In many parts of the world, drug war politics impede
public health efforts to stem the spread of AIDS, hepatitis and
other infectious diseases. Human rights are violated, environmental
assaults perpetrated and prisons inundated with hundreds of
thousands of drug law violators.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter does not point out that in the United States, there
are 1.6 million Americans behind bars, many of them for
drug-and-alcohol related crimes. ``Scarce resources better expended
on health, education and economic development are squandered on
ever-more-expensive interdiction efforts. Realistic proposals to
reduce drug-related crime, disease and death are abandoned in favor
of rhetorical proposals to create drug-free societies.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the crusher, endorsed by all these accomplished and
intelligent individuals from across the planet: ``Persisting in our
current policies will only result in more drug abuse, more
empowerment of drug markets and criminals, and more disease and
suffering. Too often, those who call for open debate, rigorous
analysis of current policies, and serious consideration of
alternatives are accused of `surrendering.' But the true surrender
is when fear and inertia combine to shut off debate, suppress
critical analysis, and dismiss all alternatives to current
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, most of the official titles born by the distinguished
signatories are prefaced by the bland ``former.'' Many of them
could not have voiced such sentiments while they held power,
because of the pressure of public opinion, which militates against
experimentation, innovation and change. Can you imagine how swiftly
CBS would have dumped Uncle Walter if the beloved anchorman had
opened a broadcast with these views?
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the world's top bureaucrat, is just a mail drop for
this cause. The effective decriminalization of illegal drugs would
take much of the corrupt money out of the system, and rationalize
the treatment of the addicted, who are among the most forlorn of
humans. Real improvement requires real, and risky, change. Most
American politicians cannot summon the intestinal fortitude to do
anything but mouth meaningless platitudes about ``cracking down''
on what is at bottom a chemical dependency masquerading as a
weakness in human nature. The smugglers, the middlemen, the mules,
the vein-poppers, the snorters, the needle-sharers will always stay
one step ahead of the law. We even have out-of-control drug
problems in some of our major prisons. If you cannot interdict
narcotics in a maximum security federal prison, what chance have
you on the streets of America? The war is lost. Demand creates
supply. So the demand must be channeled, treated, controlled; it
cannot be simply eradicated by fiat.
</P>
<P>
   Until we make this momentous shift in global public policy,
society will continue to rot from the pernicious, ineradicable
spread of illegal drugs.

 By JOHN P. LOPEZ  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
BORDEAUX, France _ Mexico might not have the best soccer team at
this 1998 World Cup. Then again, who knows, considering how well
the Mexicans played in their Cup opener last week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We were like killers for a while in the second half,'' said
Mexico forward Luis Hernandez, who scored a pair of goals in the
3-1 victory over South Korea. ``It was like old times. How far that
one game will take us, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? But one thing is certain: The fans of the famed
tri-color have proved to be among the most loyal and conspicuous in
France over the past two weeks, their unconditional love for the
Mexican team making for one of the warmer stories of the Cup thus
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is like that,'' Mexican forward Luis Garcia said. ``You
win, and you have a great party. You lose it's time to cry. We're
tired of seeing our people crying. They like to party. We're here
to play, and they're here to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   For the victory over South Korea in Lyon, an estimated 25,000
Mexican fans squeezed their way into 35,000-seat Stade Gerland,
ready to begin the celebration and put away horrible memories of a
team that looked disorganized even days before the start of the
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Three Mexico goals in the second half set off the party.
Afterward, Lyon's streets were flooded with jubilant but peaceful
Mexican revelers celebrating the return of the stylish, high-level
game Mexico had been accustomed to seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we did in that game was not think about the World
Cup, or playing in a different country, or anything but playing
Mexican soccer,'' defender Dauilio Davino said. ``We stopped
worrying about anything but playing like we do at home. It was a
lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the night, even the normally conservative waiters
at Lyon's upscale restaurants were bedecked in sombreros and
serapes, yelling for ``El Tri'' and singing the unofficial Mexican
soccer anthem, Cielito Lindo, which has been reverberating off
walls in Paris, Lyon and now here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful little sky,'' the title translates. ``Sing, don't
cry,'' is part of the lyric.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's fans have had much to sing about in recent days after
the amazing transformation of this team, from tentative to
aggressive, from seemingly lost to focused.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Mexican faithful have descended on Bordeaux for today's
second round-robin game against Belgium, a strong team that many
experts placed ahead of the Mexicans as favorites to advance out of
Group E with the favored Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican fans are filling train stations and city buses. They are
partying at nearby beaches, plazas, vineyards and chateaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans have more faith in us than before because we won a
game and played well,'' Mexico coach Manuel Lapuente said. ``It
makes us feel good that the fans believe in us again. We believe in
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer number of Mexican fans who have made the long trip to
France is staggering, considering the cost, time commitment and
long hours spent looking for costly tickets. Some World Cup
organizers estimate that better than 40,000 Mexican fans are here,
the majority of whom seemed to be wandering through the Bordeaux
city center Friday, wearing the green Azteca shirts, tooting horns,
cheering wildly and singing Cielito Lindo.
</P>
<P>
   Sing, don't cry.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Mexico's improvement here has been attributed not just
to Lapuente's relaxing of what had been a defense-oriented style
implemented by former coach Bora Milutinovic. Players such as
Hernandez, Garcia and Alberto Garcia-Aspe also seem to have become
more daring with their attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've changed a lot; everybody's changed,'' Garcia said. ``A
week ago, no one gave us a chance, and I'm not sure we were
confident ourselves. But now we're expected to go on, and we expect
to go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of that is because of the confidence we have in how we
play. It also has to do with the fan support. If you're a good
team, you know that it's time to show up at the World Cup. Two
months ago, we left our homes, our families, with the idea of
winning the World Cup. That's why we're here. We will do what it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will have an army of fans behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeaux city officials even announced Friday that an extra
outdoor viewing area with a large-screen television will be erected
for Mexican fans who can't get tickets for today's game.
</P>
<P>
   Lapuente began his daily news conference Friday by saying, ``I
have no more tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bus drivers are wearing small Mexican flags on their lapels.
</P>
<P>
   Even the weatherman seems to have jumped on the bandwagon. After
more than a week of cool, damp weather in France, Friday was hot
and humid, with temperatures in the low 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if the weather is like this, it will be an
advantage for us,'' Lapuente said. ``It's been more than a month
since we've been here, but yes, it will be an advantage. This is
Mexican weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Cielito Lindo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the motivation, the talent and the support,''
Hernandez said. ``We are going to win.''

LIBERIAN FATHER GETS GIFT: MISSING SON 
</HEADLINE>

 By GLORIA NEGRI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Molley Jones got a Father's Day gift by airmail
special delivery Friday _ a shy boy, small for his age, with
soulful eyes, dressed in a beige African dashiki.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the son the 39-year-old Jones thought forever
lost to him in Liberia's civil war was back in his arms for good.
</P>
<P>
   Brown eyes shining, a big smile on his face, Boimah Jones, 12 in
July, jumped into his father's arms as soon as he exited the United
Airlines gate at Logan International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The moment seemed to erase the trauma Boimah suffered after
seeing five people die on the crowded, leaky boat that, in 1996,
took him and other Liberian refugees away from their wartorn
country to a refugee camp in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Boimah spent a year in the camp before he went back to Liberia
to more civil strife and an uncertain future. Only his father's
unwavering determination to overcome bureaucratic red tape and the
help of the American Red Cross of Massachusetts Bay were able
finally to bring him here.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Red Cross is cool,'' Boimah said on the tarmac as he
hugged Regina Szwadzka, coordinator here of the Red Cross's
international services program.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Deyton, executive director of the chapter, put a white
Boston baseball cap on Boimah. His father dressed him in a Boston
T-shirt that went to his knees as the happy family stepped into a
silver limousine loaned for the occasion by businessman Russell
Robbat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``They deserve a little first-class treatment,'' said Robbat,
who also paid Boimah's $1,300 airfare from Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; On hand to greet Boimah were his stepmother, Sara Jones, his
half sister, Massah Jones, 16, who emigrated from Liberia last
year, Red Cross officials, and Robbat.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had last seen his son in the Liberian capital of Monrovia
in 1996 during a lull in the fighting. He had begun planning to
bring him here, along with his two daughters, after the war broke
out in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Jones said, ``for seven years I lost complete contact
with my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Boimah's mother, Emor, as well as the mother of Jones's two
daughters, remain in Liberia. Boimah's mother has been too
devastated by the war to care for him, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones came to the Boston area from Liberia in 1986, got a
student visa ``so I could help my family back home,'' and graduated
from Lesley College with a degree in community development. Then he
earned a certificate in business software systems. Now he has two
jobs, with IDX Systems Corp. in Boston, and as a hotel concierge.
</P>
<P>
   Jones recalled that as he listened to reports of civil unrest in
Liberia, one question haunted him: ``Where is my son?''
</P>
<P>
   Boimah was only 5 months old when Jones left Liberia in 1986 and
3 years old when the war broke out. The next time Jones saw him,
during a visit to Liberia, he was 10.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Jones returned to his residence in suburban Malden,
Boimah fled Liberia. To escape the shooting, disease, and hunger
that killed thousands each day, Boimah, his aunt, and others
crowded on a leaky boat, Jones said. Several countries turned the
boat away, but Ghana accepted the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Jones recalled that two weeks after the refugees arrived in
Ghana, he heard from his sister that she and Boimah were in the
camp. He immediately called the American Red Cross in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross said it would send Boimah his father's handwritten
message that he was looking for him, as required under the Red
Cross family reunification program. But with so much fighting in
the region, it took two months for the message to get through.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, meanwhile, took to the Internet, sent e-mail messages,
and spent hundreds of dollars on telephone calls to embassies and
agencies, trying to get permission to bring his son to Malden.
</P>
<P>
   His American wife, Sara, filed official papers for Boimah's
immigration, as she had to bring Jones's two daughters, Tina, 18,
and Massah, to the United States. But Boimah's immigration was
denied.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle, Jones said, was that he had to prove Boimah was
really his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Boimah got back to Liberia from the camp, I contacted the
American Embassy there for his visa,'' Jones said. ``It was refused
because they did not believe he was my son. I got my mother in
Liberia to identify him. But all failed. I was told both Boimah and
I had to have our blood tested. I had Boimah send a sample of his
blood here. Then, I sent both samples to a lab in Maryland. When
the test came up positive, I got his visa.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Boimah has a much happier future. This weekend he will
luxuriate in his father's embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A boy should be in school,'' his father said, ``not in a
refugee camp.''

   CONGRESS-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ In a significant test of
strength, the coalition supporting bipartisan legislation to
overhaul the campaign finance law won a series of House votes on
Friday and drew an unexpectedly large number of Republicans to its
side. On one key test, 65 Republicans voted to preserve the
legislation sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and
Martin Meehan, D-Mass. The bill is one of a dozen proposals up for
consideration in a free-for-all over the campaign finance laws. By
Alison Mitchell.

MEDICARE GUIDE TOO CONFUSING FOR MASS CONSUMPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Fla., Ohio, Ore., Wash.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

   WASHINGTON _ In an abrupt change of plans, Clinton
administration officials said Friday that they would restrict the
initial distribution of a new consumer guide on the Medicare
program because they feared that millions of elderly people would
be utterly confused by its description of new health insurance
options.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials had said as recently as June 4 that they
intended to mail the new Medicare handbooks to all 38 million
beneficiaries this fall, even though focus groups and surveys
indicated that much of the complex information would be
incomprehensible to readers.
</P>
<P>
   Now Michael Hash, deputy administrator of the Federal Health
Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, says the agency
plans to send the handbooks to just 5.5 million beneficiaries in
five states this year. Other officials identified the states as
Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's desirable to have more testing and evaluation of the
handbook before we mail it to all 38 million beneficiaries,'' Hash
said.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the government and by the American Association of
Retired Persons suggest that many elderly people do not have the
slightest idea of the differences between a health maintenance
organization and the original fee-for-service Medicare program.
Without such information, they cannot intelligently assess the new
options.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress from both parties had criticized the latest
version of the Medicare handbook, saying it would prompt a flood of
questions from confused constituents just before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the new options last year to give Medicare
beneficiaries a wider range of choices. The options include medical
savings accounts and various forms of managed care like those
available to workers in private industry. Republicans, in
particular, argued that private health plans and insurance
companies should be allowed to compete for the business of elderly
people, most of whom now get coverage through a highly regulated
government program created 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The government will operate a toll-free telephone number to
answer questions about the new insurance options. The phone service
will begin in October in the five states receiving handbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficiaries in other states will receive a brief newsletter
this fall to alert them to the coming changes in Medicare. They
will not receive the full handbook until next year, when they gain
access to the toll-free telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Although the handbooks will initially be distributed in just
five states, private health plans can sign contracts with the
government and can enroll Medicare beneficiaries in other states.
So elderly people will probably receive promotional material from
health care organizations touting their own plans, and that may
leave beneficiaries as confused as the government handbooks would
have.
</P>
<P>
   The handbooks will contain detailed information comparing the
prices and benefits of private health plans offered to older
Americans in different parts of the country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Special
Committee on Aging, said he was surprised by the administration's
``sudden change of plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the handbook, Grassley said, ``Medicare beneficiaries
have little or no access to objective information about their
health plan choices, rights and responsibilities.'' He said that
elderly people should not have to rely on ``glossy sales
brochures'' as their only source of information about the new
program known as Medicare+Choice.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats welcomed the decision. ``It will bring a bit
of sanity to what's going to be a tumultuous happening among senior
citizens,'' said Rep. Pete Stark of California, the ranking
Democrat on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.
</P>
<P>
   Stark said the experience of the first five states ``will
probably reveal all kinds of unanticipated problems, which can be
corrected before we send Medicare manuals to the rest of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials said that Donna Shalala, the secretary of
Health and Human Services, showed keen interest in their plans
after a report in The New York Times earlier this month suggested
that beneficiaries would be confused by the latest draft of the
1999 handbook.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Boeder, a spokeswoman for the secretary, said that
Shalala and Medicare officials decided this week that they needed
to ``pilot-test the handbook in five states so it can be improved''
before it goes to the other 32.5 million beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secretary sees this as a tremendously important job,'' Ms.
Boeder said. ``She believes that we need to do it right, by testing
the handbook and the telephone hotline so we can learn from senior
citizens and improve our methods of communicating with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Shalala, Grassley said: ``When the
Medicare+Choice program is implemented later this year, it will
inevitably compound existing confusion and raise the level of
anxiety and concern among millions of beneficiaries. It was my hope
that a comprehensive handbook, one important part of a
comprehensive education strategy, could help make the transition
smoother for beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress appropriated $95 million to pay for the education of
beneficiaries in the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Hash told Congress last month that $35 million of that amount
would be used to design, print and mail the Medicare handbooks. He
said the handbook would be sent to beneficiaries this fall so it
could be used in the ``open enrollment period'' in November of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said he wanted to know how the money would be used now
that the Clinton administration had delayed distribution of the
handbooks in most states.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has asked Congress for $150 million to
continue educating Medicare beneficiaries next year. A recent
survey for the American Association of Retired Persons found that
31 percent of beneficiaries ``knew almost nothing about HMOs.''

EUROPEAN OFFICIALS MOVE TO APPROVE WORLDCOM-MCI DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ After more than a month of negotiations,
European antitrust regulators Friday tentatively approved Worldcom
Inc.'s $37 billion takeover of MCI Communications Corp. after the
two companies agreed to concessions in the sale of MCI's Internet
holdings, industry executives involved in the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Though a few details still need to be clarified, the executives
said, Friday's agreement removes the biggest remaining uncertainty
about the ability of the two telecommunication companies to
complete their deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, MCI will sell its main Internet businesses
and will promise not to actively recruit its old corporate
customers. Under an agreement announced last month, MCI agreed to
sell its wholesale Internet business to the British telephone
company Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC, for $625 million. But that deal would
have allowed Worldcom to pursue that business again after the sale
_ a provision that brought protests from Worldcom's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   While the European agreement will prevent that, WorldCom will be
allowed to retain its crown jewel, Uunet, the world's largest
operator of the Internet's high-speed main artery known as the
backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom's shares closed Friday at $47.0625, up $1.3125. MCI's
shares rose $1.8125, to close as $56.50.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, neither Worldcom executives nor European Commission
officials would comment on the plans Friday. But privately,
officials on both sides confirmed that they had reached a working
agreement and would try to resolve a few remaining issues within
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department is examining the same issues as
European regulators, and is not expected to make its decisions for
several weeks. But Worldcom executives consider the European
objections to be their most serious problem. And the Federal
Communications Commission has allowed European regulators to take
the lead in determining how much of the combined company's Internet
backbone will have to be sold off before the deal can be given
approval.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A merger between MCI and Worldcom, which are now the second- and
fourth-largest long-distance telephone companies in the United
States, would create an entity with about $70 billion in sales and
a sprawling array of businesses in voice and data communications.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest part of that empire is in traditional long-distance
telephone service, but both companies provide high-speed data
communications, and Internet services are one of the
fastest-growing areas in both Europe and the United States. What is
more, the industry is quickly digitizing voice calls and moving
them to the Internet and other data lines as a cost-saving measure.
</P>
<P>
   Though MCI and Worldcom are both U.S. companies, European
regulators assert their right to review any merger in which the
companies have significant sales in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Karel van Miert, the European Commission's powerful competition
minister, objected several months ago that the combined companies
would have too much power in the area of Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   MCI agreed last month to sell Cable &AMP; Wireless its backbone
business, which serves local companies that provide Internet access
to businesses and individuals. But Van Miert pressed for more
divestiture, and MCI offered this week to sell off its retail
businesses that provide direct Internet access to corporate and
individual customers.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that MCI would have to sell more of its
Internet assets to satisfy European regulators, Cable &AMP; Wireless
sued MCI on June 10, demanding that it be given the right of first
refusal on any additional Internet assets MCI decided to unload. A
court rejected that claim last week.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission must reach a final decision on the
merger by July 15, though officials want to deal with it at their
meeting July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Van Miert met Friday in Brussels with what is known as the
merger task-force, which consists of competition regulators from
each country in the European Union. That group must recommend
either approving or rejecting a proposed merger, relying largely on
the work done by Van Miert's Competition Ministry in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Though the arguments over the Worldcom deal have been rather
arcane, the stakes are significant because of both the size of the
deal and its timing.
</P>
<P>
   The huge merger is part of a much broader race for position
between the world's giant telecommunications carriers, most of
which have formed global alliances. It also comes as the European
Union is forcing its own state-controlled telephone monopolies to
accept competition. That process began in earnest last January,
when most European countries simultaneously dropped rules that
prohibit competition in ordinary local and long-distance telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Though MCI has relatively little business within Europe,
Worldcom is an aggressive competitor here in several lucrative but
little-noticed niches of the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Through MFS Communications, which it acquired nearly two years
ago, Worldcom owns high-speed fiber optic networks in seven major
European cities, including London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and
Brussels. These networks serve big corporate customers, including
banks and financial institutions, and Worldcom is linking the local
fiber optic networks into a pan-European network that should be
completed next year.
</P>
<P>
   Through Uunet Technologies, Worldcom has become one of Europe's
biggest providers of Internet access services. In the last two
years, Uunet has bought up commercial Internet access companies in
Germany, Britain, France, Holland and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the United States, where Worldcom has traditionally
been known as a cut-rate provider of long-distance service for
residential customers, the company's European focus has been much
more on big corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Now that European governments have lifted most of the
restrictions on competing with established telephone companies,
Worldcom executives are trying to broaden out and serve small and
medium-sized businesses.

WASHINGTON, June 19 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments this week.
A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the
member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not
vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: TOBACCO
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Wednesday to kill the tobacco settlement bill
proposed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. The bill sought to cut
teenage smoking by giving the government authority to regulate
nicotine as a drug and by increasing the federal tax on tobacco by
$1.10 per pack of cigarettes, which would have raised more than
$500 billion. Although the procedural vote was 57 to 42 in favor of
bringing the bill to a vote, under Senate rules, 60 votes were
needed. Supporters said that opponents overloaded the bill with
extra programs to make it unpalatable. Opponents said that the bill
created too many new programs, unfairly focused a tax on low-income
Americans and included no limits on the liability of tobacco
comanies. A ``yes'' vote favored bringing the measure to a vote,
and a ``no'' vote effectively killed the bill.

</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: TAXES
</P>
<P>
   The House voted Wednesday, 219-209, to overhaul the current tax
code by December 31, 2002. Supporters said the tax code needs to be
reformed because it is too complicated for the average American to
understand. Opponents said it would be risky to overhaul the tax
code without putting an alternative code in place. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   The House approved Thursday, 225-197, a tax cut to offset
elementary and secondary education expenses, including for private
and religious school tuition. The bill would allow parents to save
as much as $2,000 a year for school expenses for each child without
paying taxes on the interest. Supporters said public schools are
failing America's children, and parents should have the opportunity
to try alternatives. Opponents said the bill would only help
wealthy families who already send their children to private
schools. A ``yes'' vote favors the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: CHINA
</P>
<P>
   The House voted Thursday, 409-10, to set up a special
nine-member committee to assess whether U.S. national security was
undermined by the President when he allowed the Chinese government
to launch U.S. satellites on Chinese rockets. Supporters said
allegations in the national media that the President's decision had
undermined U.S. national security were credible and deserved to be
investigated. Opponents of the measure made no statements on the
House floor statements. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

HOUSE MAJORITY, INCLUDING 65 REPUBLICANS, BACK CAMPAIGN FINANCE
REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A majority of the House, including 65 Republicans,
voted on Friday to protect a bipartisan campaign finance bill from
the first Republican leadership effort to water it down by
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of 254-155 put Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and
Martin T. Meehan, D-Mass., over only the first of many hurdles they
will have to cross as they try to prevail in a free-for-all debate
on campaign finance that is expected to last until August.
</P>
<P>
   It indicated that a larger than expected number of Republicans
are likely to break with Speaker Newt Gingrich and ultimately vote
for their bill to overhaul the law governing campaign contributions
and help shepherd it to passage.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan measure _ and a companion bill in the Senate _
have been fiercely opposed by top Republicans, who see it as an
effort to cut into their party's traditional fund-raising
advantage. It would effectively ban the large unregulated
contributions to political parties that were at the heart of the
1996 campaign finance abuses and also curb independent advertising
by interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Gingrich went to great parliamentary lengths
to prevent the bill's ever coming up for a House vote. But his
tactic backfired and led to an incipient Republican revolt. He
headed it off by promising a full and fair debate on the campaign
finance law.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has become such a full debate that a dozen campaign
finance proposals and 258 amendments have been authorized for
consideration throughout the summer, a procedure virtually unheard
of in the usually tightly controlled House. Democrats have charged
that this is a ruse to subject the Shays-Meehan bill to ``death by
amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Shays and Meehan managed to defeat the first
amendment, which Shays characterized as ``an attempt to gut the
bill.'' They also passed an amendment designed to bring them more
support.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling vote came on an amendment offered by Rep. Bill
Thomas, R-Calif., the chairman of the Committee on House Oversight,
which has jurisdiction over campaign finance legislation. His
amendment said that if any element of the Shays-Meehan bill was
held unconstitutional, the entire bill would be void. That would be
a departure from the usual practice in Congress, in which bills
state that the nullification of one provision does not effect the
rest of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas argued that past court rulings on the subject of campaign
finance had left in place a flawed system that Congress had never
intended to devise. With many lawmakers believing that part of the
Shays-Meehan bill will not meet constitutional scrutiny, he said,
``I think the far-better choice is to say if a piece falls, it all
falls.''
</P>
<P>
   But his proposal was handily defeated 254-155, with 65
Republicans voting against the California Republican and only 6
Democrats supporting him. If that kind of vote total continues to
hold, it shows that there will be more than a majority of the House
voting for the bipartisan campaign finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Shays said he cannot predict whether all 65 Republicans would
stay with him. Some are also supporting a separate bipartisan
campaign finance measure drafted by House freshmen, but were
willing to cooperate to make sure both proposals get a clear shot
at a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be able to declare any victory,'' Shays said.
``There's no victory, but there's been some strong votes showing
that campaign reform has legs in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said several weeks of House proceedings had persuaded him
that his coalition can prevail. ``The general feeling is we've got
the votes,'' he said. ``It's just a matter of surviving the
procedural land mines.'' He said he hoped that over time opponents
would recognize the strength behind overhaul and stop the blizzard
of amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The House also voted 325-78 on Friday to attach to the
Shays-Meehan bill a proposal to create an independent commission to
study other changes in the finance law. Shays and Meehan had agreed
to the amendment as a way of drawing support away from a rival
campaign finance proposal that would have created an independent
commission to study changes in the campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the procedure created for the campaign finance debate,
whichever proposal gets the most votes above a majority becomes the
one then considered by the House for final passage.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition supporting the ban on soft-money had come to fear
that Republicans might throw their majority behind the commission
bill to trump Shays-Meehan. So they said they would add a
commission to their own legislation to study further changes in
law.
</P>
<P>
   The free-standing proposal for a commission went down to defeat,
201-156, on Wednesday night, with 68 lawmakers voting ``present''
even though they favored the idea.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The votes on Friday came after a long Thursday night of debate
that continued on Friday morning and saw some pointed exchanges on
the state of modern politics. At one point, lawmakers squabbled
over the question of just how much money is too much money in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., insisted ``the average person in western
Wisconsin believes that under the current finance system, even
though it is legal for a wealthy individual or group to contribute
a million dollars to either political party, that is too much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, scoffed and said that in the
last campaign the spending on House races amounted to $218 million.
``That breaks down to about $3.80 per voter who voted in the
election,'' he said. ``That is less money than we spent on bubble
gum in this country.''

ENOUGH HOTEL ROOMS AVAILABLE FOR DEMOCRATS, BOSTON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three days before an inspection of the city as a
possible host for the National Democratic Convention, city
officials announced that one of the obstacles to hosting the
extravaganza has been solved.
</P>
<P>
   Where once the city was thought to lack the necessary hotel
space, officials now say they have ``found'' the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, intent on bringing more than $100 million in
spending to the city, scrutinized the hotel space surrounding
downtown Boston and came up with additional rooms in inns that had
previously been overlooked _ closing the biggest hole in Boston's
bid for the convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   City officials Friday said they can offer 21,000 hotel rooms,
3,410 more than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   The windfall of hotels, which were missed by the Greater Boston
Convention and Visitors Bureau because they are not bureau members,
comes as the city prepares for Monday's arrival of about 50 ranking
Democrats scouting Boston as a possible convention site, said
Howard Leibowitz, director of intergovernmental relations.
</P>
<P>
   In the home stretch to land what would be a tremendous prize _
Chicago derived $130 million in direct spending from the last
Democratic convention _ the Menino administration is scrambling to
spruce up the city and prepare a three-day tour for the party's
site selectors.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members will be inundated with classic Boston experiences
from an exclusive shopping spree at Filene's to a Pier Four
clambake, a night at Fenway Park, and lunch at Old City Hall with
Sen. Edward Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The glitz and the grit of the visit are designed to quell three
concerns that the Democrats might have about Boston hosting the
convention: Hotels, transportation, and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino had been leaning on executive housing in
area universities to make up for a paucity of downtown sleeping
quarters. But the mayor asserted that the fresh supply of rooms,
found by the Massachusetts Lodging Association means, ``Hotel rooms
are a non-issue.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials had hawked their accommodations as being located
within a 30-minute ride from the Fleet Center, but blocks of rooms
in Plymouth and Sturbridge ``strained that definition,'' Leibowitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   On other counts, the DNC panelists will have to squint and use
their imagination about where the Big Dig and other construction
projects will be in August 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, they'll have to just imagine the Fleet Center
without cranes and backhoes surrounding it, ignore the hard hat
site near the airport and picture a finished 800-room Hilton
instead. And the Big Dig? Imagine if the work was all underground.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they see in two years will be much better,'' said Menino,
who will lead a 6 a.m. walk through the South End next Tuesday.
``They have to imagine that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of the visiting Democrats will be briefed by Central
Artery officials on what state the Big Dig will be in during the
convention, complete with maps and other visual aids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who spends a day and a half in Boston will see that
traffic moves, businesses are open; Boston is thriving,'' said
Andrew Paven, spokesman for the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the summer of 2000, you'll see far fewer construction
barricades on the surface streets and there'll be a lot more
activity underground where you can't see it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Democrats will hear that traffic in August is
17 percent lighter, due to vacations and the absence of college
students, than the June traffic they will see next week.
</P>
<P>
   As the Democrats pass the demolition site of the Boston Garden
and work being done on a bridge over the Charles and North Station
changes, they will hear that the convention ironically will come at
a great time.
</P>
<P>
   By August 2000, there will be a large clear space around the
Fleet Center that will be suitable for the semi-trailers of
television production crews, said Kelley Quinn, a key architect of
the city's convention bid. It ``will be a great time to be at the
FleetCenter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other computer models will depict how the FleetCenter would
accommodate journalists in the underground parking garage, said
Quinn. The garage is already air-conditioned and could easily be
outfitted with telecommunications equipment, she said, adding that
the FleetCenter also offers movable luxury boxes and a TV
production crew that has been hired to do major shows and
tournaments in other venues.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that matters if Democratic higher-ups decide they
would rather have the convention in a region that is less reliable
for party support or if Vice President Al Gore does not want to
come to the home state of putative primary opponent Senator John
Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Leibowitz downplayed the significance of Boston being ruled out
as Kerry's home turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are over-estimating that part of the political
equation,'' said Leibowitz. ``In recent years, the nominee of the
party is chosen well before the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Boston, nestled in a Democratic home court with
relatively low electoral vote totals, recommends itself to the
Democrat's politically is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choosing the site,'' said Leibowitz, ``goes back to what is
the best backdrop for the nominee.''

   LONE PINE, Calif. _ The stone sentry posts stand empty and
silent now at Manzanar, their graceful pagoda shapes a haunting
reminder in the desolate high desert here on the eastern slope of
the Sierra Nevada. In World War II, this lonely stretch of scrub
off Highway 395 was the largest outpost between Los Angeles and
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   It had a Bank of America branch and a hospital of 250 beds, plus
an orphanage, a hog farm and chicken ranch. It had a Boy Scout
troop, baseball teams, a 9-hole golf course with oiled-sand greens
and a swing band called the Jive Bombers, who played all the
wartime hits, even Cole Porter's jaunty cowboy ballad, ``Don't
Fence Me In.''
</P>
<P>
   But Manzanar was no ordinary town. Behind its armed guards and
barbed wire fences, in tar paper barracks that baked in the summer
heat and shook in the winter winds, it housed 10,000
Japanese-Americans, most of them U.S. citizens, who were brought
here from their homes and businesses along the West Coast against
their will in the mass hysteria that followed Pearl Harbor. In all,
10 ``relocation centers'' held about 120,000 internees imprisoned
between 1942 and 1945 as a result of the infamous Executive Order
9066.
</P>

   Now, after years of halting steps, the National Park Service is
just beginning to develop the abandoned remains of Manzanar as a
National Historic Site, to tell the story of all the camps to new
generations. Congress conferred the designation in 1992 after a
long campaign by survivors, but provided no initial appropriation
to run the park. Last year, the Park Service finally got title to
813 acres in a land swap with the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power, which had owned the parcel for decades. This summer, the
staff of one full-time superintendent is about to double with the
addition of a ranger from nearby Death Valley National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, this is going to be a grabber,'' said Ross R. Hopkins, the
park superintendent, his voice alive with enthusiasm for a master
plan that calls for reconstructing parts of the camp's grounds and
buildings, adding a shuttle bus with interpretative tours and
putting up weatherproof metal signs scattered around the ruins and
restoring the camp's one surviving building, the auditorium, as a
visitor's center and museum. It is a big change from the last four
years, when Hopkins, 61, has been what he wryly calls ``sole owner
and operator'' of the site.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for what Hopkins diplomatically calls the
``lack of leadership'' that has delayed development of Manzanar,
chief among them the Park Service's recent years of budget-cutting
in which ``we're competing with Yellowstone and Yosemite and other
heavily used parks with tremendous environmental problems,''
Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with no formal program, park officials here estimate that
Manzanar, about 212 miles north of Los Angeles on the road between
Death Valley and Yosemite National Park, already draws 18,000 to
25,000 visitors a year. They drive around its rutted roads, dotted
with the ghostly remnants of rock gardens and ornamental ponds
built by the internees. Virtually all the barracks were torn down
at the end of the war, and their lumber was sold to returning
veterans at discount prices to build homes.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the only organized tours are conducted by Richard
Stewart, a 54-year-old elementary school art teacher in nearby
Bishop, who will begin on Saturday his second summer of twice-daily
walking tours of an hour and 45 minutes. His tours are financed
with a $3,500 grant from the Eastern California Museum in
Independence, five miles up the road from the camp site and now
home to a heartbreaking collection of artifacts from Manzanar _
carved wooden pins, mess kits, a fragment of barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said that if the Park Service tells this story right,
we'll have everybody mad at us,'' said Hopkins, who keeps an
unlisted home phone number because of harassment from some local
residents who oppose developing the park and have threatened to
burn down the auditorium, which was preserved in the first place
only because it served as a garage for the Inyo County Department
of Public Works.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objection is it's not being recognized truthfully,'' said
W.W. Hastings, 73, a retired banker and World War II Marine veteran
in nearby Bishop who has conducted a letter-writing campaign in the
local newspaper objecting to the Park Service's plans. ``The
Japanese were free to come and go. All it was was an assembly
center,'' he said. ``They were escorted there not to keep them
under control but just to protect them. It did have a loose
barbed-wire fence, but I saw them sneaking out all the time to go
fishing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those kinds of comments, according to Sue Kunitomi Embrey, help
explain why even now, many elderly survivors are deeply ashamed and
reluctant to talk about their camp experiences, and why it has
taken so long to get the park up and running.
</P>
<P>
   ``They focus on, `Oh, it was a not a concentration camp,''' said
Ms. Embrey, a 75-year-old retired teacher in Los Angeles who was 18
when she was taken to Manzanar with her family and now heads the
Manzanar Committee, the survivor group that pressed for creation of
the park. ``They don't focus on how it could have happened in a
democracy. I think it's very important that Americans remember what
happened. Everyone talks about the Holocaust Museum in Washington
being so popular, but that happened across the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who has heard the firsthand stories of dozens of
survivors who come to Manzanar on pilgrimages, says the most
painful irony of the camp remains the apple-pie Americanism of the
very people who were interned as threats to America. When some
internees threatened to tear down the camp's American flag in
protest over their treatment, the camp Boy Scout troop got wind of
the plan and formed a protective cordon around the flagpole,
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Stewart leads visitors around the groves of trees and
the remnants of gardens, his eyes are eagle-sharp. Not long ago, in
the ruins of the garden of Block 6, he saw a slender green shoot of
bamboo sprung to life again from the hard, rocky soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be more than 50 years old,'' he said in quiet
wonder. ``They say it grows in 20 year cycles, so it's coming up
again, just in time.''

JURY RULES FOR DEFENSE IN FEUD BETWEEN RICH BROTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ One of the longest and nastiest family disputes
ended Friday, sort of, as a working-class jury blocked efforts by
William Koch, one of the nation's richest men, to get $2 billion
from two of his brothers who he said cheated in a business deal
more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 weeks of testimony and two days of deliberations, a
six-man, six-woman U.S. court jury said that Koch, who led the
legal charge on behalf of another brother and a group of relatives,
was owed nothing by his brothers Charles and David Koch, who almost
entirely own Koch Industries, a $35 billion oil conglomerate in
Wichita, Kan., that is the nation's second-largest private company
after Cargill Inc.
</P>
<P>
   No important legal issues were at stake. But the enormous sums
in dispute and the brother-to-brother hatreds that emerged made it
a soap opera of avarice and malice that far outdistanced other
celebrated courtroom brawls over rich people's money.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the Koch (pronounced ``coke'') family is worth
around $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, William Koch said he would appeal, and he
continued to attack his brothers: ``These guys are crooks. In my
opinion, this is the 10th round of a 15-round championship fight.''
Koch also criticized Judge Sam Crow of U.S. District Court as a
``hometown judge'' who ``cut us way back'' in his rulings from the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said it was premature to speculate on the basis of an
appeal or how long the legal process would drag on. ``I'm sure they
could find some errors to appeal,'' said Robert Howard, an attorney
for Koch Industries. ``I am confident the verdict will be upheld on
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb Heckler, a law professor at the University of Kansas, said
of the verdict: ``This may be an example of the pig rule in law. If
you overreach egregiously, cosmic justice will have its way with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle stemmed from a 1983 settlement between William
and the two brothers his group sued. That settlement gave William;
another brother, Frederick, and a number of Koch cousins $1.1
billion in return for their 5.5 million shares in Koch Industries,
which has larger revenues than such corporations as Microsoft, Walt
Disney or Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   William contended that the group was shortchanged in that 1983
deal and has been pressing the case through 25 federal and state
courts. He was seeking $339 million more for the group's holdings
in 1983 dollars. Court documents he filed estimate that interest
would bring this to more than $2 billion today.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the verdict, the jury did find that Koch Industries
made ``misrepresentations and omissions'' in 1983 about the output
of an oil refinery, but concluded that these lapses were not
significant. The jury rejected William's allegations that Koch
Industries' accounting practices were misleading in financial
documents used in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury did find that they lied,'' said William Koch, 57, an
oil businessman himself who is best known for spending $70 million
to win the America's Cup yacht race. ``To us, that's a significant
finding.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Charles Koch, 62, chief executive of Koch
Industries, who was not present for the verdict, said: ``We are
glad that this long saga is behind us. This issue has been painful
for the entire Koch Industries family. For more than 13 years, we
have been forced to allocate substantial financial and legal
resources to defend our company.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The trial provided a two-month legal spectacle in which the
courtroom here was filled with squadrons of lawyers, more than 800
exhibits, 10,000 pages of documents and overhead projectors, flip
charts and television monitors. Local Topeka attorneys estimate
William's legal costs at around $200,000 a week or around $5,000 an
hour. By contrast, the jurors who decided against him were paid $50
a day.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the lawsuit gave jurors a window on a rich,
dysfunctional family mixed with tales of boardroom backstabbing.
The 1983 buyout at the center of the litigation came two years
after William led a boardroom coup and tried to oust Charles as
chief executive. At that time, William and the other minority
shareholders complained that Charles had poured too much money back
into the company and did not give enough to shareholders, who were
receiving $20 million to $30 million a year in dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Painful family secrets were laid bare in testimony: A Christmas
dinner where William reduced his mother to tears; Christmas gifts
sent by William to Charles' children, returned unopened; a tearful
David breaking down on the witness stand over his failed
relationship with William, his twin.
</P>
<P>
   Today, William and Frederick, 64, are not on speaking terms with
Charles and David. Even in the court, they passed within feet of
each other, not talking. Charles lives in Wichita and heads the
company founded by their father, the late Fred Koch. David is a
Koch executive, living in New York and best known for buying
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' Fifth Avenue apartment. William lives
in Palm Beach, Fla., and Cape Cod, Mass., while Frederick, a
reclusive man who loves to restore castles, owns homes in London,
Monaco, Austria and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The wealth of the family made all four unsympathetic figures to
the jury, who, unlike the expensively dressed lawyers, came to
court in casual clothes, the men tieless.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the wealth did was eliminate sympathy for one side or
another,'' said Stanton Uffman, a farmer and truck driver who was
the jury foreman. ``A great percentage of this case was really a
family issue. We felt the deal was a fair price, but we wanted to
say also that neither side was blameless.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Smelser, a juror employed by Hallmark Cards, added:
``Their wealth had nothing to do with it. But it was personal.''

SCHOOL VOUCHER EXPANSION STIRS MILWAUKEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ It's unusually noisy in this otherwise orderly city
on the shores of Lake Michigan, and not just because 50,000 bikers
vroomed in last weekend for the 95th anniversary of
Harley-Davidson, or because the oompah bands are practicing polkas
for this weekend's wildly popular Polish Fest.
</P>
<P>
   The real commotion is over last week's Wisconsin Supreme Court
ruling _ the first of its kind in the nation _ that will allow
low-income children in Milwaukee to attend religious schools with
public money. The city's seven-year-old Parental Choice program
will be expanded, making as many as 15,000 students eligible for
taxpayer-funded tuition this fall at some 80 parochial as well as
31 non-sectarian private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The civil-liberties leaders are in full throat, charging the
court with punching a hole in the constitutional wall that
separates church and state. The local NAACP and teachers' union
decry the decision as dooming the already troubled public schools,
while Republican officials and conservative activists declare
victory and praise private-school vouchers as a free-market cure
for what ails American education.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the loud, political rhetoric, however, there is a more
muted, but no less important, debate going on in and around the
city's religious community. It's about balancing churches'
obligations to serve needy families against the risks of a
state-run voucher program that could change the mission and
character of Milwaukee's parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling for choice may look like a free windfall, an
exciting adventure, or a positive opportunity, but if I were
running a Catholic or a Lutheran school today, I'd be very
cautious,'' said Angeline Cepelka, an associate professor of
education at Marquette University here. ``There is always a price
when you get involved with the state, but the sticker isn't on top
of this package.''
</P>
<P>
   The price may be unknown, but the landscape isn't altogether
uncharted for nonpublic schools. Under Milwaukee's pioneering
voucher program, 23 private schools that enrolled 1,500 low-income
children last year received almost $7 million from the state with
virtually no strings attached and none of the rules and regulations
imposed on public schools. So far, Wisconsin officials have pledged
to keep it that way for religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   The infusion of funds _ as much as $4,000 per ``choice'' student
_ is alluring to parochial schools. Many have seen enrollments and
tuition decline sharply as descendants of the immigrant Poles,
Irish, Italians, and Germans who built the sturdy, steepled
Catholic and Lutheran churches and schools in Milwaukee moved to
newer homes in safer suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The city, once sustained by a booming brewing industry, is now a
somewhat depressed and highly segregated place: North Milwaukee is
predominantly black, the south side is Hispanic, and the eastern
edge on Lake Michigan is white.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been struggling to serve our neighborhoods as parishes
have closed, merged, and restructured,'' said Jerry Topczewski,
spokesman for Milwaukee's Roman Catholic archdiocese. ``We expect
our enrollments to increase with school choice, and that is a
positive impact.''
</P>
<P>
   But questions abound. The telephone hasn't stopped ringing in
Brad Adams's office in the Wisconsin Department of Public
Instruction since the state Supreme Court ruling June 10. Parents
are desperate to know if they qualify for the school-choice program
and where they can place their children. Private schools, which up
to now have not been accredited by the state or required to hire
licensed teachers, want the ground rules before they sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, an education consultant, predicts taxpayers won't
tolerate this ``tremendous lack of oversight'' for long, not when
they are paying a $70 million annual bill for 15,000 of Milwaukee's
104,000 students to attend private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not today, but maybe five years from today, religious schools
may be very sorry they got into this,'' Adams said. ``The state
will demand accountability, and the result will be two public
school systems.''
</P>
<P>
   For parochial schools, there is also accountability to a higher
authority. Some school administrators say they will challenge a
state law that allows voucher students, at a parent's request, to
be excused from religious activities. Otherwise, administrators say
they can't participate in a program that would restrict religious
instruction and thwart their mission.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Schmeling, schools administrator for the Wisconsin
Evangelical Lutheran Synod, said theology is so incorporated in the
educational program _ for example, science is based on creationism,
and history evolves through God's hands _ that Lutheran schools
could not in good faith become ``choice'' schools if the state
opt-out law stands.
</P>
<P>
   Schmeling said the Lutheran schools he oversees also would
``have a real problem'' with a state policy that protects students
from discrimination based on sexual orientation. ``We believe
homosexuality is a sin, and that is what we would counsel a
child,'' Schmeling said. ``It would be a lie for us to sign off on
this to become a choice school.''
</P>
<P>
   A memo circulated by the Wisconsin Catholic Conference after the
state Supreme Court ruling says the religion opt-out provision
theoretically ``could create a challenge to Catholic identity.''
But John Huebscher, the conference's executive director, said urban
Catholic schools already are so multicultural that accepting more
non-Catholics via vouchers ``is something we will be able to live
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some fear parochial schools will be caught in uncomfortable
compromises over practices and curricula once they begin to depend
on state funds. Cepelka of Marquette University said Catholic
administrators might give up mandatory communion services that
would exclude non-Catholic children or go along with a ``tyrannical
state'' that prescribes sex education including abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``By virtue of vouchers, there may be entanglements that
directly or indirectly force parochial schools to minimize their
mission as institutions of strong and proclaimed values,'' Cepelka
said.
</P>
<P>
   That is the last thing Valerie Johnson wants. She has refused to
send her five children to Milwaukee's tough public schools,
scrimping and finding scholarships to keep them in parochial
schools, where she said not only academic achievement, but also
virtues like self-discipline, respect, love, and forgiveness are
stressed. A non-Catholic, Johnson is on the school board at the
Resurrection Catholic Academy in north Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I afraid of the religion they teach here? No _ that's why I
like it,'' said Johnson, who belongs to a dynamic group of black
women who launched the city's grass-roots school-choice movement
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In public schools you get busing, metal detectors, garbage in
the halls, and classes that are out of control,'' Johnson said.
``Here you get small classes, school uniforms, caring teachers, and
parents who are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   For all those reasons, and others _ including a dropout rate of
50 percent in Milwaukee's public high schools _ the number of
low-income parents expected to make the parochial-school choice
this fall will far exceed the number of spaces available. The
influx will test not only the attitudes of tuition-paying parents,
but also the commitment of private schools to randomly select its
student body.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rauh, director of the one-year-old Marva Collins
Preparatory School in north Milwaukee, said the biggest myth in the
school-choice debate is that private schools like his will ``skim''
the cream of the academic crop and cast off youngsters with the
severest disabilities and antisocial behavior to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the opposite. Kids who are doing well stay where
they're at. The children who are struggling are leaving the public
schools,'' Rauh said. He said his facility, which once housed St.
Anne's Catholic School, can handle children with learning
disabilities, but not serious physical handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks west, past the Love Child Liquor store and Flo's
Gospel Connection, principal Spencer Korte runs Hi-Mount Community
School, reputedly one of the best public elementary schools in
Milwaukee. Korte doesn't believe that private or parochial school
will accept troublesome students. But he dares them to try. Last
semester, he had to tackle and pin down a parent trying to beat up
a third grader.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, as a political reality or moral imperative, parochial
schools do select `choice' students at random, they will be
surprised at how challenging it is to work with the most badly
damaged families and children,'' Korte said. ``What may surprise
them more is how easy it is in those circumstances to lose your
identity and the identity of who you want to serve.''

LARGEST HMO WON'T PAY FOR VIAGRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest health maintenance
organization, said Friday it will not pay for Viagra, the
controversial new drug that treats male impotence.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is likely to influence how HMOs across the country
deal with the thorny issue of whether to provide coverge for
Viagra, a problem that some HMO executives are calling
``Viagravation.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts said Friday it will
pay for only four Viagra pills a month for each patient diagnosed
with impotence, down from 12.
</P>
<P>
   The decision follows a similar move last week by Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care, the largest health maintenance organization in New
England, to cut its coverage from eight pills a month to four.
Aetna U.S. Healthcare, one of the nation's largest HMOs, on Monday
told the New York state regulators that it will not cover Viagra,
at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is cost. At $7 to $10 a pill, Viagra is a potential
budget-buster that threatens to plunge health maintenance
organizations nationwide deep into the red.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance companies are trying to deal with that threat
by making a distinction between ``life-saving'' and
``life-enhancing'' drugs. In refusing to cover prescriptions for
Viagra, Aetna cited the ``primarily recreational/lifestyle use and
abuse of this drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Under this emerging standard, insurers are saying no to drugs
that may be medically useful but whose main benefit is to make
people's lives more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is not trivial, health experts say. As medical
miracles continue to roll out of medical laboratories and on to
pharmacy shelves, insurers are sure to adopt tougher standards for
determining whether new drugs are medically necessary. While
impotence is considered a disease, insurers nevertheless that in
many cases Viagra is being used by men to enhance their sex lives
and not to treat a medical problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a question of where you draw the line,'' said
Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the Americal Association of Health
Plans, an industry group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to make the distinction between something that was
cosmetic versus something that was medically necessary. Viagra is
new. Now there's a new distinction. Are patients using Viagra
because they have an underlying medical problem, or are they using
it for life enhancement?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Gerstein, medical director for Tufts Health Plan in
Waltham, Mass., said the same question also could be raised with
anti-depressants such as Prozac or Zoloft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it okay to use it for people with mild depression? Or for
someone who's feeling blue, or fatigued or unhappy?'' Gerstein
said. ``We're not dealing with absolutes. In every case, we're
making a value judgment on how much to spend for certain benefits.
We sit in judgment almost every week about how to distribute other
people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Blue Cross was deciding whether to cut back its
coverage for Viagra, officials at the health insurance said that
maintaining coverage at the 12-pill-a-month level would affect its
ability to pay for treatments of other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that this is a very expensive product, and we're
going to spend far more on Viagra than on childhood depression this
year,'' said Kathleen J. Goonan, medical director for Blue Cross.
She was unavailable for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser also cited cost as the main reason it had decided to end
coverage for Viagra. ``This has been a particularly difficult
decision for us,'' said Dr. Francis J. Crosson of Kaiser, which has
9.1 million members in 19 states. ``We could, of course, build the
cost of Viagra into everyone's premium, but is that the right thing
to do?''

fireplace of a room in Adams House several years ago; a
professional moving crew had to be called in to disassemble the
engine and move it out piece by piece.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there was a broken-down old-time Coke machine selling
bottles for 15 cents found in Claverly Hall. And a small cooler
filled with a orange juice and vodka along with a note: ``Dorm
Crew, don't screw around too much.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the things students forgot.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Neiman Marcus evening gown, its $800 price tag still
hanging from a sleeve; its owner claimed it within a week. Or the
wardrobe of men's suits, worth close to $2,000, left unclaimed for
over three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so much that there is an amazing amount of stuff,
but it is hard to believe that people could leave behind a printer,
a CD player,'' says Gingo, who has been working with Dorm Crew
since his freshman year. ``Students are in a rush, and so they
forget things. Some objects are so much a part of daily life they
become part of the furniture. And some students really don't care
that people have to clean up after them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students don't even care whether they recover their
valuables. They live across the country _ or the globe _ making it
prohibitively expensive to ship their larger belongings. Others are
too wealthy to care or too distracted during graduation to notice,
Gingo says.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wolfreys, supervisor of custodial services at Harvard,
says Dorm Crew distributes leftover items in different ways.
Cleaning supplies, which are considered hazardous chemicals, are
handed over to Harvard's waste disposal unit. Expensive items such
as printers and stereos are stored until they are claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Pens, staples, and office supplies are used in the Dorm Crew
office. One drawer alone has a dozen scissors. Books, sports
equipment, and other less valuable items are lotteried off to Dorm
Crew workers.
</P>
<P>
   In a program Wolfreys started last year, stackable crates, trash
cans, mirrors, bulletin boards and message boards are donated to
Habitat for Humanity, which resells them to students in the fall.
Last fall $1,400 was raised, and this year, Wolfreys says, there is
even more to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Other area universities are also involved in recycling student
trash for charitable causes. Boston College has a service project
called Clean Sweep, which recruits 40 alumni volunteers to collect
items students leave behind. This year alone, 17,000 items were
donated to local social service agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were given enough furniture and housing supplies to fully
furnish 25 apartments for battered women,'' says BC spokesman Mike
Seele.
</P>
<P>
   MIT runs a furniture exchange, selling furniture back to
students and donates proceeds into a scholarship fund. Three
hundred students from one dormitory collected 70 trash bags of
clothing which were donated to the Salvation Army and the Pine
Street Inn.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Boston University students have gone through dorms
collecting pennies to donate to local charities, says university
spokesman Joan Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard's Dorm Crew, whose job is to clean as much as to
pillage, emphasizes that their job is not just for amateur
archeologists. They find more junk than jewels. Like the hallway in
Mather Hall so filled with furniture that workers had to climb to
get around. Or the dorm room with 50 wads of gum glued to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Or the pair of handcuffs on a bedpost.
</P>
<P>
   Hazards Gingo, ``The owner must have lost the keys.''

1983 MOB SURVEILLANCE OF CRIME PROBER DETAILED AT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As the FBI and federal prosecutors prepared to indict
the hierachy of the local Mafia in 1983, the bureau relied on one
of its top informants, reputed gangster Stephen Flemmi, to alert
agents to fallout from the impending roundup of the mob's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi did just that, former FBI supervisor James A. Ring
testified Friday, even tipping the bureau to an ominous bit of
counter-intelligence: reputed mobsters Donato ``Danny'' Angiulo and
Ilario Zannino were keeping close tabs on the lead prosecutor in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were tracking Jerry O'Sullivan (the head of the organized
crime strike force) from the courthouse to North Station,'' Ring
testified. ``They knew his schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   But Flemmi knew what they were up to and told the FBI. ``Flemmi
was on top of the situation,'' said Ring, who headed the organized
crime squad in the Boston office of the FBI from 1983 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The tip is just the latest example of the kind of help that the
co-leader of the Irish mob gave the FBI during 30 years of sporadic
informing on his criminal rivals in the Italian Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Documents released during the first phase of hearings in January
show that Flemmi told the FBI that the local Mafia was ``seriously
considering'' murdering a district attorney and a judge in the
1960s. He was also credited with providing the FBI with information
on a Mafia plot to assassinate a US attorney in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But now, some 30 years later, attorneys for Flemmi and three of
his codefendants, including reputed New England Mafia boss Francis
P. ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme, are arguing that extortion and
racketeering charges brought against them should be dropped because
Flemmi infiltrated the Mafia and committed crimes with the
authorization of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   They are asking US District Judge Mark L. Wolf to dismiss the
landmark 1995 indictment that charges the leaders of the Irish and
Italian mobs with running the region's rackets in tandem for
decades. Wolf is also considering whether a series of wiretaps,
including the bugging of a Mafia induction ceremony in Medford in
1989, was legal.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination Friday by Assistant US Attorney James D.
Herbert, Ring denied that he or anyone in the FBI had ever given
Flemmi or his criminal partner and fellow informant James
``Whitey'' Bulger immunity from prosecution or authorization to
commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ring insisted that Bulger and Flemmi had been warned
that if they were commiting crimes ``you're on your own,'' though
there are no FBI documents to back up his claim that he met with
them at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a formal bureau procedure that allowed supervisors and
their superiors to authorize crimes, Ring said he did not agree
with the process. ``We should not be in the business of authorizing
criminal activity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During nearly three months of hearings, no FBI employee, past or
present, has said that Flemmi and Bulger were given permission to
commit crimes, though there has been abundant evidence that the FBI
was aware that they were involved in loansharking, gambling, and
extortion of drug dealers, and were suspects in several murders.
Neither was indicted, however, until January 1995, four years after
they were closed as FBI informants.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger fled before he was indicted _ tipped off, Flemmi claims,
by the FBI _ and remains a fugitive. Ring said he never tipped off
anyone to an upcoming indictment and knew of no one in the FBI who
had done so.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by Wolf, Ring said he was never told by FBI agent
John Connolly that Connolly had received phone calls from Angelo
``Sonny'' Mercurio while Mercurio was a fugitive. Mercurio was a
key informant, the person who told Ring exactly where and when the
Mafia induction would take place.
</P>
<P>
   Ring insisted that Mercurio had never told Connolly, his
handler, about the planned assassination of Salemme in June 1989,
even after Salemme's attorney, Anthony M. Cardinale, showed him a
report by Connolly 11 days before the botched hit in which Mercurio
told him that the Boston Mafia would ``like to clip Frankie
Salemme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk about killing in that particular
(report),'' said Ring. ``But it doesn't direct us to a particular
event.''

LEARNINGSMITH TO DOUBLE NUMBER OF STORES BY 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After struggling earlier in the decade, Learningsmith Inc. says
it will nearly double its number of educational toy-and-games
stores by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to rapidly expand,'' said Janet Emerson,
president and chief executive of the Bur-lington company.
</P>
<P>
   Paragon Capital, a Needham, Mass. lender that specializes in
helping retailers, said it will provide Learn-ingsmith with a $30
million ``emerging growth facility'' that will help Emerson add 60
new stores to a chain that today has 67.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Learningsmith had ``significant financial
problems,'' said Paragon president Andrew Moser, but since hiring
Emerson in 1995, Learningsmith has been on a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's made an incredible difference,'' Moser said Friday.
``She's adopted a new marketing and merchandising strategy that has
turned the company around.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately owned Leaningsmith does not disclose sales or
earnings. Founded in 1991 by local entrepreneur Marshall Smith,
Learningsmith thought it had a winning retail formula that could
quickly be expanded nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH, Boston's public television station, was an early investor
in the chain, which was once known as WGBH Learningsmith.
</P>
<P>
   But when early sales didn't meet expectations, expansion plans
were put on hold and new managers hired. By her count, Emerson is
the fourth person to hold the company's top job.
</P>
<P>
   Because toys make up a fraction of sales, Emerson takes issue
with descriptions of Learningsmith as an educational toy store.
</P>
<P>
   When he came up with the idea, Smith wanted to create something
unique, a store that sold educational books, puzzles, toys, games,
and videos to both children and adults. About a third of sales are
for products used by adults, Emerson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only one doll,'' she said. ``There is very little
overlap between what's in a Learningsmith and what's in a Toys
``R'' Us.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to become ``a learning store for all ages'' and ``a
general store for the curious mind,'' Learn-ingsmith needed much
trial and error to get its store format and merchandise mix where
it is today.
</P>
<P>
   Some early Learningsmiths too closely resembled a ``serious
bookstore,'' said Emerson, who added, ``When I came in, we said,
`Let's make the store fun again.' It had become too severe.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, the chain hit upon a prototype Emerson thinks
can provide the chain with a robust growth vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Using that model, a roughly 4,300-square-foot store is divided
into ``right-brain and left-brain sections.'' The right-brain
section includes scientific products and a software area called the
Information Highway. The left-brain section is devoted to crafts
and ``humanities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Given its eclectic merchandise, there are no direct rivals,
though several chains such as the Nature Co. look to nibble at
small pieces of Learningsmith's business, Emerson said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, many fun-and-games retailers are exploring
alternate sales channels, such as catalogs and the Internet, to
augment sometimes slumping store sales.
</P>
<P>
   Learningsmith isn't ready to dabble in e-commerce just yet.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to continue to focus on opening most stores in malls
that draw affluent, well-educated consumers and attempting to
provide them with an entertaining and informative shopping
experience that allows them to see and touch the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Said Emerson, Learningsmith seeks to offer ``a fun
environment,'' one with a lot of motion and color and lots of
computers and interactive exhibits.

U.S., IRANIAN PLAYERS KNOW IT'S MORE THAN A GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As much as the participants in the ``mother of all
soccer games'' would like to convince the world otherwise --- as
much as they would like to believe it is not true --- they
recognize that when the United States and Iran share the field
Sunday at the Stade Gerland in Lyon, it will be much more than just
a game.
</P>
<P>
   That's not what they say, of course. For the record, this is
``just an opportunity to get three points,'' ``another game'' or,
more pointedly, ``a game we have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, obviously, far more than that, but if the history that
divides the two nations makes this the most politically charged
clash that will take place in France this summer, those taking part
would rather not deal with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the political stuff and history between the two countries
really has nothing to do with us,'' declares U.S. defender Alexi
Lalas. ``If you really want to look at it that way, (then) look at
Germany. We've got a history with them, too, right? Or Yugoslavia.
They aren't wonderful. We could be pissed off at everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of the situation,'' says Steve Sampson, the
Americans' coach, ``we could care less about.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all rhetoric, although there's a scrap of truth to the
protestations. If Iran coach Jalel Talebi, as he asserts, is ``not
a politician (but) a sportsman,'' he --- and his American rivals
--- understands there is more at stake than a potential berth in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sunday's match is a sizable stride on the road to
normalization between the nations, a process set in motion when
reformist president Mohammad Khatami took power in Iran last
August. He softened his country's official anti-Western stance and
called for improved relations with the United States, the ``Great
Satan'' that had become enemy No. 1 in the wake of the Islamic
revolution of 1979.
</P>
<P>
   American officials followed suit this week. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Wednesday unveiled an offer to begin
repairing the relationship with Iran. ``The gap between us remains
wide,'' she said. But it is time to test the possibility for
bridging this gap.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the announcement could hardly have been by chance.
Iran, which is competing in the World Cup for the first time since
1978, sees the tournament as a passageway back into the world, and
players on both teams realize that their actions in Stade Gerland
will be rife with symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us understand the implications of this game,
and we're all excited about it,'' says U.S. forward Eric Wynalda.
``It's an opportunity for soccer to bring two nations together ---
that's the beauty of the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Says U.S. captain Thomas Dooley:``We are athletes and are
playing soccer against athletes. I look forward to meeting these
people. ... We have to live peacefully with these people --- we
live only one time, and if we can do something where the two
nations can come together peacefully, that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   The build-up to the match has been anything but peaceful.
Hardliners within Iran's government called for their players to be
barred from shaking hands with the Americans --- an instruction
Talebi, whose family has lived in the Bay Area since leaving Iran
in 1980, refused to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Monday night, a French television station aired the 1991
film ``Not Without My Daughter,'' starring Sally Field and based on
a true story of an American woman who accompanies her Iranian
husband to his homeland and discovers she can't leave. The Iranian
camp erupted in protest, calling the decision to screen the movie
an intentional ``insult'' that weakened team morale.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports, quickly denied, that the Iranian team might
withdraw from the World Cup in protest, but some saw the furor as
just plain silly. ``If they've been insulted by a movie that's
being shown, they've got bigger problems,'' Lalas said. ``It means
nothing to us --- it's their problem. It's just a movie, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, security around the U.S. camp has been tightened,
World Cup officials are bracing for a threatened disruption of the
game by Iranian exile groups, and FIFA even selected the game's
referee --- Urs Meier of Switzerland --- because his ``is the only
country that has excellent diplomatic relations with both
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone involved is approaching the match in a benign
fashion. Iranian star Khodadad Azizi calls the game ``the most
important of my life'' and admits he's looking for blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USA mistreated our country,'' he charges. ``In the
(1980-88) war, they supported our enemies Iraq. ... We will not
lose this game. Many families of martyrs are expecting us to win.
We will win for their sake.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Americans carry such hard feelings, but few of them
--- aside from the coaching staff, which is three-quarters
foreign-born --- remember much about the hostage crisis, in which
militants seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans
for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived it every night (on TV),'' Sampson says. ``I relate to
it more than the players. ... At some point, you have to put that
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Lalas, who was 9 at the time: ``I certainly was too young
to understand what was happening. It was just, `U.S.: Good. Iran:
Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Frankie Hejduk, who was 5, was asked about ``The
Great Satan.'' His reply: ``I don't really know what you're talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   His mind, during the crisis, was ``on recess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game, even those who see it as merely a game agree, is
part of a process meant to get past the troubles between the
nations the past 19 years. The Iranians plan ``something special''
for the Yanks before the game; they presented roses to Yugoslavia,
their first World Cup foe. Talebi says he has ``a surprise'' in
store for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides believe they will be building bridges, even if that
is secondary to gaining a needed victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports from the beginning is about getting people together,''
says Talebi. ``It's like those circles in the Olympics that link
together. It is, I believe, what we feel, and I hope it stays that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forward Ernie Stewart is looking forward to the tradition
jersey exchange at the end of the match. ``Before the game,'' he
says, ``we are going to shake hands, and at the end I would like to
trade jerseys with an Iranian player. That would be a symbol to
both nations of how things can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one wants to lose sight of what's truly important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't make (the outside issues) too big for us,''
Talebi pleaded with reporters earlier this week. ``This is a game.
A game.''

APOLLO MANAGEMENT TO BUY TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Xtra Corp., a Boston &UR;  &LR; company that leases transportation
equipment, Friday said it agreed to be acquired for $1.9 billion in
stock and debt by Interpool Inc. and financier Leon Black's Apollo
Management IV LP.
</P>
<P>
   The deal values Xtra at $65 a share, or $976 million, a premium
of 41 percent over its closing price Thursday of 41 1/16. The
transaction will be structured as a recapitalization of Xtra, and
the new company, Wheels MergerCo., will assume nearly $1 billion of
Xtra's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Xtra currently has about 900 employees, including 40 in
Massachusetts. Robert Blakely, vice president and controller, said
the company could not comment on whether those workers would remain
on the new firm's payroll or whether Wheels would stay in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Xtra stock soared on the news, closing at 61, up 14 15/16.
Interpool, a transportation leasing firm based in Princeton, N.J.,
gained 1 1/16 to 15 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Interpool will pump $73.1 million of equity into the new
company, giving it a 22.5 percent stake, while Apollo will invest
$219.4 million for a stake of 67.5 percent. The remaining 10
percent held by existing shareholders will likely trade on the open
market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale joins two of the top companies in the container-leasing
industry. About half of the world's 12 million shipping containers
are owned by leasing companies like Xtra and Interpool; shipping
companies own the rest, according to Burton M. Strauss, an analyst
with Dominick &AMP; Dominick Inc..
</P>
<P>
   Xtra's business includes marine and railroad containers, highway
trailers, and chassis for moving containers. Interpool also has a
significant chassis business, but is mainly involved with
international containers, said Thano Hasiotis, an analyst with
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   A strong US economy has driven up the demand for freight and
shipping containers. In Asia, where countries are trying to boost
exports to revive their flagging economies, a shortage of
containers is beginning to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said consolidation is critical for the industry's
smaller companies, particularly in the marine-container market, so
they can expand their capacity and boost efficiency. They said
Interpool was likely to eventually combine its operations with
Xtra's.
</P>
<P>
   Xtra's principal investors, namely Franklin Mutual Advisors and
Tiger Management LLC, were eager to sell the company, according to
Strauss. Xtra said investors holding 44 percent of the stock had
agreed to support the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo would not comment on additional details of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a franchise business with dominant market share
in the business they compete in,'' said Apollo partner Michael
Gross. ``It's been well run for a number of years with a strong
management team.''

'BYE, MOM; HELLO, HIGHER AIR TRAVEL COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 21)  
 (bl)  
 By NOELLE KNOX   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every summer, thousands of young children fly across the country
to visit grandparents or, for the growing number of divorced
families, to spend time with a parent. This season, however, if a
youngster is flying alone, it may cost more.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines doubled their
escort fees _ a charge on top of the air fare for unaccompanied
children of varying ages _ to $60 one way if the child has a
connecting flight. (The fee for children flying direct or nonstop
is still $30 one way.) If history is any guide, their competitors
will soon do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines say that higher fees are needed to cover the costs
of the service, but some parents are outraged. One mother in
Detroit, where Northwest has a hub, was so upset she wrote a letter
to Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., calling the fees ``anti-family
and anti-children.'' She also posted a copy of the letter on the
Internet news group alt.kids-talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid other airlines will feel compelled to hop on the
bandwagon to stay competitive on revenue,'' the parent wrote,
adding that if they do, ``it'll cost more for parents who live
apart from their kids to see their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase has made a stir on Capitol Hill, not just because
it affects children but because it is the latest in a string of
creeping fees. In the last year, carriers have bumped up charges
for everything from changing the dates for nonrefundable tickets to
picking up prepaid tickets at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Like banks and many other consumer service companies, the
airlines see fees as an important avenue for bolstering revenue.
With air-passenger traffic at record levels and ticket prices up an
average of 8 percent for leisure and 11 percent for business fares,
operating profits for the six largest airlines are expected to top
$7.5 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fees account for a small but growing percentage of that total.
Thomas Schreier, an analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston, said,
``They tend to be areas where it is fairly easy to increase
revenue, since they end up getting matched.''
</P>
<P>
   Many major carriers have raised the fees for customers who pay
for tickets in advance and pick them up at the airport. Many now
charge $75, up from $40 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers also pay more now to change itineraries on
nonrefundable tickets. In November, Continental Airlines and Delta
raised the fee for reissuing a ticket to $75 from $50. Competitors
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, the fee was $25. Today it's $75,'' groused Tom
Parsons, editor of Best Fares Online (www.bestfares.com). ``The
friendly skies are becoming very unfriendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is the rise in the child-escort fee that has finally
garnered some political notice. Thursday, in response to the
distressed parent, Abraham asked the Senate Commerce subcommittee
on aviation to ``investigate the issue of excessive airline fees on
minors traveling alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also getting attention in the House. The higher fee
``seems to be way out of line,'' said Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn.
``I don't think the workload is twice as difficult as it was; I
don't think the service is twice as valuable as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Oberstar, the ranking Democrat on the aviation subcommittee of
the House Transportation Committee, raised the issue at a hearing
on June 11 and said he would ask the Transportation Department for
a ``comprehensive review'' of the airlines' programs for
unaccompanied children.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of deregulation, however, government intervention is
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is effectively an agreement between the airline
and a parent. Children who fly solo are usually escorted to and
from the plane by a gate agent. The flight attendants look after
the children, often introducing them to the captain and giving them
airplane pins or other souvenirs. If a child must connect to
another flight, some airports have special waiting areas where he
can play until a member of the ground crew takes him to the next
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines do not offer the service for infants or toddlers,
and the age of eligibility varies with each carrier. For Alaska
Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Northwest, children must be at
least 5 years old to travel without a parent. For the other major
airlines, including Delta, the minimum age is 8. Some carriers,
including Southwest Airlines, do not offer escort services.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest expects its service to accommodate 150,000
unaccompanied children this year, a 36 percent increase over 1995.
Delta estimates that it will fly 10,000 solo youngsters this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summertime, we're dealing with situations where so many
children who are traveling back and forth to spend time with one
parent or another you can have as many as a dozen on the
airplane,'' said Patricia Friend, international president of the
Association of Flight Attendants union. ``The staffing does not
increase, and there is a limited amount of time we can spend with
the child; the best thing we can do is make sure they're OK at all
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Peach, a spokeswoman for Northwest, said the company
had to hire more people, build in a child-tracking system and
expand waiting areas in Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis to
accommodate the junior soloists. She estimated that the company had
spent $400,000 to upgrade the operations, which include
large-screen televisions, video games and art supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The company should be able to recoup its investment quickly.
While Northwest does not break out the number of children who make
connecting flights, the carrier could collect fees in excess of
$4.5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the child is just going from point A to point B, I don't
know what they're getting for it,'' said Ms. Friend, who has been a
flight attendant for 32 years. ``But if there is a connecting
flight, the airline is accepting responsibility for the well-being
of the child in transferring him or her.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most parents paid without complaint, said Leslie
Tillem, president of Eltee Travel in Manhattan. ``Anything to do
with children, people will pay.''

NIGERIA IS LATEST BORA TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It was vintage Bora.
</P>
<P>
   There he was, addressing a mob of media from within the bowels
of Parc des Princes speaking much but saying little, bouncing from
English to French to Spanish, confounding his translators all the
while a huge smile plastered across his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy,'' he repeated again and again, and with good
reason. Nigeria, the fourth team Bora Milutinovic has taken to the
World Cup, had just claimed its place in the second round with an
at-times impressive 1-0 victory over Bulgaria. The score was quite
deceptive, and while the Super Eagles had not soared as they can,
he knew they were celebrating in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, what change a couple weeks can bring. When Bora arrived in
France two weeks ago, his tenure with Africa's finest side appeared
nearing an end. A horrible run-up to the Cup with one-sided losses
to Yugoslavia, Swiss club Grasshoppers, and the Netherlands had
turned Nigeria from favorites to laughingstocks, and the Nigeria
Football Association had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Bonfrere, who guided the Eagles to Olympic gold in 1996,
checked into the team hotel, and the men who make such decisions
determined that Bora no longer was fit to be coach.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in Nigeria is so simple. Before Bora's ouster could be
finalized, approval was needed, from none other than Sani Abacha,
the nation's military ruler. Instead, news of a different sort
arrived: Abacha was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Bora,'' Milutinovic would say later. ``I am a lucky
man.''
</P>
<P>
   And Nigeria, while in deepest mourning over the loss of its
leader, can count itself fortunate that Bora is still around. He's
a master tactician, a ``miracle worker'' whose feats with lesser
squads --- among them the United States in the 1994 World Cup ---
finally earned him the chance to guide a team as talented as he is
brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost over as soon as it started.
</P>
<P>
   Those losses, and Nigeria's lackluster play in them, impressed
nobody, least of all the bureaucrats who run soccer in Africa's
largest nation. Abacha's death might have gained Bora some time,
but unless the Super Eagles pulled off a stunner in their Cup
opener, a week ago in Nantes, he was on his way out.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria 3, Spain 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Spain had beaten us,'' he said afterward, ``I'm sure I
would be at home with my family. That's life. ... Whatever happens,
I'm very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, and he's on top of the World Cup, champions of
the Group of Death with one match remaining, a second-round matchup
with Denmark or South Africa --- neither much of a threat ---
looming just ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite what it was in '94, he admits, even though he has
a team this time that could --- but won't --- win it all. The
Nigerians lack discipline, and their attack-at-all-costs mentality
does cost it at times, and it will once they come up against a
truly outstanding team, like Brazil in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Bora was happy just to get to the second round
with the Americans, who had no business getting there. That was a
labor of love, and this is a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``In U.S., the team was like my boys,'' he said Friday. ``Here
is different. I'm a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, there wasn't much pressure. He could lose and lose
and lose leading to the World Cup as long as his team didn't
embarrass itself when the games counted. This time was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friendly matches don't count,'' he said after the 5-1 loss to
the Dutch. ``The World Cup is all that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   His players, who acknowledge they have trouble getting motivated
for friendlies, agree. The only thing that matters is the World
Cup, and Bora --- again --- is proving his worth when it counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Friendly games) don't really matter that's not where the
action is,'' said forward Daniel Amokachi, echoing his coach. ``The
World Cup is the World Cup, and a friendly game is a friendly game.
Now we're doing the job, and everybody is happy. The government is
happy, the fans are happy, everybody is happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, Bora is happy, too.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONE PINE, Calif. _ The stone sentry posts stand empty and
silent now at Manzanar, their graceful pagoda shapes a haunting
reminder in the desolate high desert here on the eastern slope of
the Sierra Nevada. In World War II, this lonely stretch of scrub
off Highway 395 was the largest outpost between Los Angeles and
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   It had a Bank of America branch and a hospital of 250 beds, plus
an orphanage, a hog farm and chicken ranch. It had a Boy Scout
troop, baseball teams, a 9-hole golf course with oiled-sand greens
and a swing band called the Jive Bombers, who played all the
wartime hits, even Cole Porter's jaunty cowboy ballad, ``Don't
Fence Me In.''
</P>
<P>
   But Manzanar was no ordinary town. Behind its armed guards and
barbed wire fences, in tar paper barracks that baked in the summer
heat and shook in the winter winds, it housed 10,000
Japanese-Americans, most of them U.S. citizens, who were brought
here from their homes and businesses along the West Coast against
their will in the mass hysteria that followed Pearl Harbor. In all,
10 ``relocation centers'' held about 120,000 internees imprisoned
between 1942 and 1945 as a result of the infamous Executive Order
9066.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of halting steps, the National Park Service is
just beginning to develop the abandoned remains of Manzanar as a
National Historic Site, to tell the story of all the camps to new
generations. Congress conferred the designation in 1992 after a
long campaign by survivors, but provided no initial appropriation
to run the park. Last year, the Park Service finally got title to
813 acres in a land swap with the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power, which had owned the parcel for decades. This summer, the
staff of one full-time superintendent is about to double with the
addition of a ranger from nearby Death Valley National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, this is going to be a grabber,'' said Ross R. Hopkins, the
park superintendent, his voice alive with enthusiasm for a master
plan that calls for reconstructing parts of the camp's grounds and
buildings, adding a shuttle bus with interpretative tours and
putting up weatherproof metal signs scattered around the ruins and
restoring the camp's one surviving building, the auditorium, as a
visitor's center and museum. It is a big change from the last four
years, when Hopkins, 61, has been what he wryly calls ``sole owner
and operator'' of the site.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for what Hopkins diplomatically calls the
``lack of leadership'' that has delayed development of Manzanar,
chief among them the Park Service's recent years of budget-cutting
in which ``we're competing with Yellowstone and Yosemite and other
heavily used parks with tremendous environmental problems,''
Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with no formal program, park officials here estimate that
Manzanar, about 212 miles north of Los Angeles on the road between
Death Valley and Yosemite National Park, already draws 18,000 to
25,000 visitors a year. They drive around its rutted roads, dotted
with the ghostly remnants of rock gardens and ornamental ponds
built by the internees. Virtually all the barracks were torn down
at the end of the war, and their lumber was sold to returning
veterans at discount prices to build homes.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the only organized tours are conducted by Richard
Stewart, a 54-year-old elementary school art teacher in nearby
Bishop, who will begin on Saturday his second summer of twice-daily
walking tours of an hour and 45 minutes. His tours are financed
with a $3,500 grant from the Eastern California Museum in
Independence, five miles up the road from the camp site and now
home to a heartbreaking collection of artifacts from Manzanar _
carved wooden pins, mess kits, a fragment of barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said that if the Park Service tells this story right,
we'll have everybody mad at us,'' said Hopkins, who keeps an
unlisted home phone number because of harassment from some local
residents who oppose developing the park and have threatened to
burn down the auditorium, which was preserved in the first place
only because it served as a garage for the Inyo County Department
of Public Works.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objection is it's not being recognized truthfully,'' said
W.W. Hastings, 73, a retired banker and World War II Marine veteran
in nearby Bishop who has conducted a letter-writing campaign in the
local newspaper objecting to the Park Service's plans. ``The
Japanese were free to come and go. All it was was an assembly
center,'' he said. ``They were escorted there not to keep them
under control but just to protect them. It did have a loose
barbed-wire fence, but I saw them sneaking out all the time to go
fishing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those kinds of comments, according to Sue Kunitomi Embrey, help
explain why even now, many elderly survivors are deeply ashamed and
reluctant to talk about their camp experiences, and why it has
taken so long to get the park up and running.
</P>
<P>
   ``They focus on, `Oh, it was a not a concentration camp,''' said
Ms. Embrey, a 75-year-old retired teacher in Los Angeles who was 18
when she was taken to Manzanar with her family and now heads the
Manzanar Committee, the survivor group that pressed for creation of
the park. ``They don't focus on how it could have happened in a
democracy. I think it's very important that Americans remember what
happened. Everyone talks about the Holocaust Museum in Washington
being so popular, but that happened across the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who has heard the firsthand stories of dozens of
survivors who come to Manzanar on pilgrimages, says the most
painful irony of the camp remains the apple-pie Americanism of the
very people who were interned as threats to America. When some
internees threatened to tear down the camp's American flag in
protest over their treatment, the camp Boy Scout troop got wind of
the plan and formed a protective cordon around the flagpole,
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Stewart leads visitors around the groves of trees and
the remnants of gardens, his eyes are eagle-sharp. Not long ago, in
the ruins of the garden of Block 6, he saw a slender green shoot of
bamboo sprung to life again from the hard, rocky soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be more than 50 years old,'' he said in quiet
wonder. ``They say it grows in 20 year cycles, so it's coming up
again, just in time.''

AU PAIR'S MOTHER DENIES BEING PAID FOR INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Budgeted as Woodward-Elton; a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART   AND JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELTON, England _ In a rare impromptu interview, Louise
Woodward's mother adamantly denied that a London newspaper paid
them for an interview last fall, after Woodward had been convicted
of murder for the death of baby Matthew Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times do we have to say it?,'' Susan Woodward told
reporters stationed outside her home, most from Boston. ``We've not
been paid. We don't want to be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   But the London Daily Mail issued a statement Friday
contradicting her. The paper said Susan Woodward and her husband,
Gary, were paid for an interview last November, shortly after a
Middlesex County, Mass. jury had convicted their daughter of
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, the Woodward family was invovled in a fight to
clear their daughter's name,'' according to the statement. ``They
considered it necessary to receive payment in order to help fund
their legal battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Harvey Silverglate, a member of Louise Woodward's
defense team, said he spoke with his client Friday and she told him
she has never accepted payment for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only speak for Louise,'' he said. During a conversation with
her Friday evening, he said, Woodward ``confirms ... that she has
received no money. She has entered into no deal'' and has not
received any payments through her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Frederic L. Ellis, the Boston attorney suing Woodward
and her parents on behalf of Sunil and Deborah Eappen, said the
Woodwards' denials made him ``sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is the tip of the iceberg,'' Ellis said. ``We
believe there were other payments made to her and her family and we
believe that she has continued to negotiate other deals despite her
denials.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld
Woodward's manslaughter conviction in Matthew Eappen's death but
declined to order a new sentence, effectively freeing her.
</P>
<P>
   Within 68 minutes, the Eappens filed a wrongful-death suit
against Woodward in federal court, and later won a 12-day
injunction which blocks her and her parents from spending any
profits in a media deal.
</P>
<P>
   Since she was released in November, Woodward, her attorneys and
her parents have denied reports the family will profit from her
plight. The Daily Mail statement seems to contradict them.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Woodward's conviction, the newspaper said, public
opinion in Britain strongly backed her, and many believed the
teenage au pair had been railroaded.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling ``was vindicated within days of us publishing the
interview with the Woodwards when Judge (Hiller B.) Zobel quashed
the murder conviction,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate said that in November 1997, once the Woodward case
made international headlines, dozens of offers for paid interviews
flowed in _ including $100,000 from the National Enquirer and
$250,000 from News of the World.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Silverglate said, Louise Woodward reiterated
instructions she gave the defense team before trial: Reject all
offers for paid interviews.
</P>
<P>
   That position, Silverglate said, has ``just been consistent from
the day the case began to take on a high profile, which was long
before last November.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis said he strongly believes that secret deals are being
made for the story.

   In Elton Friday, Susan Woodward spent about 20 minutes talking

   ``Matthew's death has been difficult for her and she had not
been able to deal with it properly,'' Susan Woodward said.

vowed to protect her daughter from any intrusions on her privacy.
``She is not Princess Di and she won't be hounded to her death,''
Susan Woodward said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ OK, so McDonald's has a taste problem. The company
says a solution is in the works. The only question is whether
people will notice it.
</P>
<P>
   At a McDonald's restaurant near the corner of 34th Street and
Eighth Avenue in Manhattan recently, they apparently did not _ and
that means the fast-food giant also has a marketing problem on its
hands. Asked if they thought the fare had improved of late, several
customers put on puzzled looks. It was only after they were told
that the company had revamped its cooking methods that they perked
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems a little bit better,'' allowed Nicole Jung, a college
student in Manhattan, who was tucking into an Arch Deluxe
hamburger. ``The bacon looks like it's just been cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   At a nearby table, Leon Williams said that come to think of it,
his Chicken Selects strips did seem fresher and tenderer than ones
he had ordered in the past. ``When they had a slow day, they might
hold it too long,'' Williams, a postal clerk, said. ``This is the
way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors knock the new food-preparation system as too little,
too late. But McDonald's says it could become one of the defining
innovations of its half-century of corporate existence _ ranking
right up there with the introduction of indoor seating,
drive-through windows, breakfasts and play areas.
</P>
<P>
   The key element of the new approach is keeping the bread,
lettuce, onions, and all other nonmeat sandwich ingredients fresh _
and thus away from the wilting heat of the holding bins and the zap
of the microwave oven. Whereas before, fried meat and toppings were
assembled on a bun, then tossed under a heat lamp and finally
microwaved just before serving, now the cooked meat is kept warm
all by itself. Once an order comes in, it is placed with fresh
ingredients on toasted bread and put on a tray _ bypassing the
microwave altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the sandwiches taste fresher under the new method,
called ``made for you,'' the company says, but customers can ask
servers to hold the pickles or ketchup without having to wait
several extra minutes.
</P>
<P>
   All 13,500 McDonald's outlets in North America are expected to
be overhauled by the end of next year at a total cost of up to $380
million, the company said. (McDonald's will take a charge of up to
$190 million this quarter to pay for half of the cost, while
franchisees will pick up the rest.)
</P>
<P>
   The process has begun slowly, with only about 600 kitchens
remodeled in the last year. But the company believes the initiative
will help reverse its sagging share of the American market. ``It's
got to be the centerpiece of the growth in the U.S business because
I don't think it's practical to get growth solely out of new
stores,'' Jack Greenberg, the company's president and chief
executive officer, said in an interview at his corporate
headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill. ``I think sales momentum, the
changes we made, the trust and confidence of the operators, all
that combined over the last several months has given people a
better feeling about the U.S. business.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is counting on the new system to increase same-store
sales by at least 1.2 percent, as well as to save as much as $100
million a year in food costs, largely because only meat, and no
longer the buns and other ingredients, will be discarded when
sandwiches do not sell fast enough. (In theory, even that should
happen less often because a computer will now estimate the amount
that should be cooked instead of having a manager guess based on
how many cars are in the parking lot.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such projections could prove to be wishful thinking.
Last year, the company's share of the hamburger business in the
United States fell by one-tenth of a percentage point, to 42.2
percent, while archrival Burger King's portion surged to 19.4
percent from 18.2 percent and that of Wendy's, a unit of Wendy's
International, rose to 11.3 percent from 10.7 percent, according to
Technomic Inc., an industry consulting firm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Overall sales at McDonald's restaurants open for at least one
year have been stagnant, although the results have improved lately,
helped in part by last month's promotion of Beanie Babies. Overall
domestic revenues, meanwhile, were flat last year, at $4.6 billion.
Burger King is a unit of Diageo, formerly Grand Metropolitan.
</P>
<P>
   The core problem is no secret: McDonald's has long struggled
with complaints about the freshness of its trademark burgers. ``I
think our customers were telling us over the years that our food
was not up to speed,'' said Irwin Kruger, the owner of six
McDonald's restaurants in Manhattan and a franchisee for more than
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kruger said the company had neglected its domestic operations in
its aggressive attempt to expand overseas. Now, though, he thinks
it is back on track, ``refocusing its energy and having more of a
strategy and making sure the taste stays first.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors take a different view, saying McDonald's is simply
playing catch-up because it was slow to realize its old procedures
had become outdated. Moreover, they contend that the new system
lacks the potential to deliver the freshest food in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is a truly made-to-order system,'' boasted Denny Lynch, a
Wendy's spokesman. ``McDonald's is an assembled system. They
pre-cook their meat and it can sit there for 10 minutes. That's not
a freshly made hamburger hot off the grill.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch added that the founder, Dave Thomas, ``has said one of the
reasons he created Wendy's was because of the way McDonald's made
hamburgers with batch cooking and pre-select condiments put in heat
bins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls those mistakes,'' Lynch added.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Burger King crows that in letting customers choose
their trimmings, McDonald's has essentially adopted the approach
that it has long touted under its slogan, ``Have it your way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing new to us,'' a Burger King spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's is less concerned about its rivals' digs than about
the job ahead. It still has to convince customers that its burgers
really do taste better. As important, it must train thousands of
workers to use the system, and service could suffer during that
learning curve.

 &HT;    Ga. Blue Cross could seek partnership
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- As the health care industry rumbles through
consolidation, Georgia's biggest insurer, too, might be looking for
a partner.
</P>
<P>
   Past merger speculation has paired Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Georgia with Blue plans based in Alabama, Virginia and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The newest possible match, however, could be a huge
California-based insurer, WellPoint Health Networks, which has Blue
Cross roots as well. WellPoint has the money and the track record
to pull off such an acquisition, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Neither WellPoint nor Blue Cross of Georgia would comment Friday
on the possibility of talks between them. Blue Cross issued a
statement that said company policy is to comment only when a
decision has been reached to proceed with a new initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   For-profit WellPoint is acquisition-minded, having recently
picked up the health care business of John Hancock and
Massachusetts Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Its managed-care business in California is operated as Blue
Cross of California. WellPoint's health plans in Georgia are
offered under the UniCare label. Overall, the company has 6.7
million managed-care members.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint is among the best-run U.S. health insurers, said
analyst Todd Richter of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``They are a
prudent buyer; they buy things that are a good strategic and
cultural fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent megamergers in health insurance have included Aetna and
U.S. Healthcare, and a pending $6.3 billion agreement between
United HealthCare and Humana. Consolidation provides market clout
and cost efficiencies as insurers battle ferociously for managed
care business. A WellPoint acquisition likely would provide a
handsome payoff for the investors in Blue Cross' 1996 conversion
from a nonprofit to a for-profit company. It might also lead to a
multimillion-dollar settlement on a lawsuit by consumer groups.
They are seeking to recover hundreds of millions of dollars the
plaintiffs say were illegally transferred to Blue Cross when it
converted.
</P>
<P>
   That conversion gave about 70,000 policyholders five shares of
stock each in Cerulean, the new parent company. A group of wealthy
investors who put about $50 million into the plan received about 20
percent of Cerulean.
</P>
<P>
   If Blue Cross is acquired, ``the investors' return becomes a lot
higher than their investment risk,'' said Richard Winston, an
Atlanta financial analyst who opposed the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could cash out at about 15 percent to 20 percent return,
or they could convert their shares into common shares, if the
acquisition offer is high enough,'' Winston said. ``And that return
could exceed 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But before a possible Blue Cross deal goes through, the consumer
groups' lawsuit likely would be settled first, Winston said. ``It
would behoove them to clear any potential big liability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean millions for charitable health care
organizations in the state. Neither Blue Cross executive Charlie
Harman nor an attorney for the consumer groups would comment on
possible negotiations in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Such conversions of Blue Cross plans have run into strong
opposition nationwide from consumer groups, who say the insurers
have accumulated years of tax breaks as nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, legislative and regulatory actions have caused
billions to be set aside or designated for charity. For example,
all assets of Blue Cross of California, about $3.2 billion, have
been transferred to two health care foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that California conversion involved WellPoint,
formed in 1992 to operate Blue Cross of California's managed-care
business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, WellPoint and Blue Cross of California merged into a
stockholder-owned company. As a result, the foundations were
created.
</P>
<P>
   State Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, who approved Georgia
Blue's conversion, recently dismissed a petition by the consumer
groups to re-examine the deal. Oxendine would have to approve any
acquisition of Georgia Blue.

 &HT;    GM dealers displaying showroom confidence
 &HT;    By Kristi E. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- While General Motors' pipeline of vehicles has been
nearly shut off at the source, metro area dealers remain confident
that their showroom inventory won't trickle out soon.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 23 assembly plants, including Doraville, have been
closed and nearly 110,000 workers idled because of strikes at two
Flint, Mich., parts plants.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Clinton urged the union and automaker to
settle their disputes. GM Chairman and Chief Executive John F.
Smith Jr. said the company wants a quick resolution but said it has
to be one that makes GM more competitive. So far, neither side
seems willing to compromise as GM pushes to cut costs and the union
digs in to save jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Metro area dealers say the affects of the strike will be felt in
the showrooms in 60 to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the inventory is good, but if they're not building
anything, we'll see the affect down the road,'' said Daniel
Rothermel, general sales manager for Bob Davis Pontiac Oldsmobile
GMC Isuzu in Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   Most dealers have a six- to eight-week lag time between ordering
vehicles and receiving them, Rothermel said. He's more concerned
with the orders he's filing now for vehicles that won't be built
until negotiations between GM and the United Auto Workers are
settled and production resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Some models aren't affected. Chevrolet's Corvette plant in
Bowling Green, Ky., and the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn.,
remain open.
</P>
<P>
   Sales representative Jim Snyder at Moore Pontiac Quick GMC in
Canton said he's using the strike as a chance sell vehicles to
indecisive customers. ``It's made a lot of them make their move,''
he said. ``They know that this is as low as the price is going to
get.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Hood, general manager of Balmy-Strickland Chevrolet
Oldsmobile Pontiac in McDonough, said customers are used to hearing
the word ``strike'' and aren't paying attention to it anymore.
``Even if the workers come back tomorrow or next week, new
inventory won't show up for a few weeks or a month down the road,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This costs everyone: the union members who aren't getting pay,
the businesses around Doraville and average dealership stock will
go down every day,'' said Gregory Barranco, president of Barranco
Pontiac GMC in Lilburn.

 NEW YORK: learning curve. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It is going to be painful,'' said Ron Paul, president of
Technomic, the consulting firm. ``It's not an easy thing to impose
a new system on that many restaurants. McDonald's is basically a
factory and now what they are saying is `run the factory a
different way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Painful or not, the strategy could reap big dividends. It
already seems to be paying off at the midtown Manhattan restaurant
where customers were only dimly aware of a change in the taste of
their food. Kruger, the owner, says food costs there have declined
by about $100 a month while sales have increased 7 percent in the
year that the outlet has been using the new system.
</P>
<P>
   And elsewhere, some customers have noticed the change in cooking
methods. ``It seems like the Quarter Pounder is juicier,'' declared
Rosemary Frigo, a nurse from Downers Grove, Ill., as she devoured
an Extra Value Meal at the McDonald's in nearby Darien. ``The
Quarter Pounder used to be thrown in the microwave sometimes and
they would overcook the meat,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Frigo, who is also a regular at Burger King because her
17-year-old son Michael prefers Whoppers, also praised the service.
``It seems since they have this set up here it is pretty fast,''
she said. ``They kind of picked up on the competition's system.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Paleczny, a 19-year-old worker in the Darien restaurant's
kitchen, thinks the new method is more efficient than the old one.
``Before, you had to put the bun on a tray and dress it and
microwave the meat and wrap it and put it in a bin,'' he said.
``Now you just dress and wrap it and it cuts out like two steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts question whether the system can hold up during a
busy lunch rush or when a packed school bus shows up, but
McDonald's says not to worry. Food will arrive in about the same
time as before, it says, because it has shaved seconds off the
assembly process to keep production moving.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company developed a toaster that browns buns
in 11 seconds instead of half a minute. Bread suppliers had to
change the texture of the buns so they could withstand the
additional heat. Someone even figured out that workers could save
two seconds if condiment containers were repositioned to apply
mustard to sandwiches with one motion instead of two. And cabinets
with controlled temperatures and humidity levels were added to keep
meat hot and moist without having to be zapped in a microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg thinks the remodeled kitchens _ and the company's
new-found emphasis on improving existing domestic stores rather
than aggressively opening additional restaurants _ will give
McDonald's an advantage against competitors. But he concedes it
will be a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. business is going to continue to be tough,'' he said.
``Our competitors are not going to go away tomorrow and they are
going to keep getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the latest shots in the burger wars, McDonald's is now
testing a burger it calls the Big Extra that looks and tastes
surprisingly like a Whopper. The move came after Burger King
introduced the Big King last year, a burger that consumers would be
hard pressed to distinguish from a Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hopes McDonald's is placing on its new
food-preparation system, the revamping effort has built-in
limitations. Because the meat continues to be precooked, there will
still be some waste from beef or chicken that sits too long. And
the promise of a cooked-to-order burger every time is a bit of a
stretch. The computer that serves as the operation's nerve center
in each restaurant will still try to anticipate business, placing
advance orders when it spots an uptick in sales. As a result, some
customers will still get sandwiches made a little before they pull
into the drive-through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face the reality of what the system can do and what it
is going to do at crunch time,'' Paul of Technomic said. ``They are
not going to act like nobody is going to order a cheeseburger.''

ONE-THIRD OF TEACHER CANDIDATES FAIL READING, WRITING TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At least a third of the 1,800 candidates who took
Massachusetts' first teacher certification test are not qualified
because they can't read or write well enough, state Commissioner of
Education Frank Haydu III said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of candidates who failed the test may increase on
Monday, when the state Board of Education votes on what constitutes
a passing score. While at least a third failed the literacy
portion, as many as 59 percent failed overall, based on a standard
recommended by a panel of 300 educators.
</P>
<P>
   Haydu has recommended a standard under which 44 percent will
have failed the test overall.
</P>
<P>
   The two-part, eight-hour test was given as part of Education
Reform efforts to raise standards for both teachers and students.
Those taking the test included seniors or recent graduates of such
teaching colleges as Wheelock and Simmons; the Harvard School of
Education, and the Lesley College School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   In the literacy portion, which ``a strong student in tenth-grade
should be able to pass,'' said Haydu, the college graduates did so
dismally on spelling, grammar and writing, they showed an
``inability'' to construct proper sentences. Candidates did better
on the section that tested knowledge of their subject area.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of failures is not expected to affect the
hiring of an estimated 3,000 teachers by schools across the state
next year, because there are enough certified teachers to fill the
need.
</P>
<P>
   But a continued high failure rate by college graduates could
have profound ramifications over the next decade, as the state
retires almost 40 percent of its teaching force. Public schools
rarely hire teachers who are not certified.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call to all of us,'' said William Dandridge,
dean of the Lesley College School of Education. He said the problem
is not limited to students of education, but is a result of a
dumbing down of learning standards for all students, beginning in
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would this play out if you would require all college
graduates to take the same test?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But state Board of Education chairman John Silber said, ``Let's
blame the colleges,'' who ``pass students who haven't demonstrated
competency in subject matter.'' Silber wants the board to approve a
higher passing score than what Haydu has recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Students can retake the test this summer, or as many times as
they like until they pass it, Haydu stressed Friday. He and other
educators declined to estimate how many teachers now in classrooms
would fail the test if they had to take it. Before this year,
Massachusetts was one of only seven states that did not test
teachers for certification.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were criticized in April after college students found
out the scores would count toward certification only a week before
the test.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the actual student answers shown to reporters Friday
illustrated a strikingly poor grasp of English grammar. Some
sentences were missing verbs; in others, common words were
misspelled or incorrectly defined.
</P>
<P>
   Haydu said that because the test is new and more challenging
than other states' teacher tests, he is recommending a lower
passing score than the educator panel has recommended. He said he
could have gone even lower, as other states have done. He also
recommended the lower passing score to protect the department from
possible lawsuits from those taking the test, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though students will not receive their score for several
weeks, there was plenty of protest against the test Friday.
Education professors said it did not test teaching skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers are going to be taken to task for a test that does
not test what we teach,'' said Frinde Maher, an education professor
at Wheaton College in Norton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Kellie Jones, a 29-year-old graduate education student at
Simmons College in English as a Second Language, said parts of the
test would have been difficult for anyone. In one dictation
section, it ``was difficult to ascertain through the narration when
the sentence began. There wasn't appropriate inflection or tone.''
She said ``there was a lot of anxiety for students'' because many
were unaware the test would ``count'' until only days before it was
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Haydu said that despite the disappointing resuts, the test could
serve as proof that the teaching of writing and grammar must
improve at all grade levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a public policy debate,'' Haydu said.
``We all have to look at the issue of literacy.''

AU PAIR'S MOTHER DENIES BEING PAID FOR INTERVIEW

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELTON, England _ In a rare impromptu interview, Louise
Woodward's mother adamantly denied that a London newspaper paid
them for an interview last fall, after Woodward had been convicted
of murder for the death of baby Matthew Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times do we have to say it?,'' Susan Woodward told
reporters stationed outside her home, most from Boston. ``We've not
been paid. We don't want to be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   But the London Daily Mail issued a statement Friday
contradicting her. The paper said Susan Woodward and her husband,
Gary, were paid for an interview last November, shortly after a
Middlesex County, Mass. jury had convicted their daughter of
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, the Woodward family was invovled in a fight to
clear their daughter's name,'' according to the statement. ``They
considered it necessary to receive payment in order to help fund
their legal battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Harvey Silverglate, a member of Louise Woodward's
defense team, said he spoke with his client Friday and she told him
she has never accepted payment for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only speak for Louise,'' he said. During a conversation with
her Friday evening, he said, Woodward ``confirms ... that she has
received no money. She has entered into no deal'' and has not
received any payments through her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Frederic L. Ellis, the Boston attorney suing Woodward
and her parents on behalf of Sunil and Deborah Eappen, said the
Woodwards' denials made him ``sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is the tip of the iceberg,'' Ellis said. ``We
believe there were other payments made to her and her family and we
believe that she has continued to negotiate other deals despite her
denials.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld
Woodward's manslaughter conviction in Matthew Eappen's death but
declined to order a new sentence, effectively freeing her.
</P>
<P>
   Within 68 minutes, the Eappens filed a wrongful-death suit
against Woodward in federal court, and later won a 12-day
injunction which blocks her and her parents from spending any
profits in a media deal.
</P>
<P>
   Since she was released in November, Woodward, her attorneys and
her parents have denied reports the family will profit from her
plight. The Daily Mail statement seems to contradict them.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Woodward's conviction, the newspaper said, public
opinion in Britain strongly backed her, and many believed the
teenage au pair had been railroaded.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling ``was vindicated within days of us publishing the
interview with the Woodwards when Judge (Hiller B.) Zobel quashed
the murder conviction,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate said that in November 1997, once the Woodward case
made international headlines, dozens of offers for paid interviews
flowed in _ including $100,000 from the National Enquirer and
$250,000 from News of the World.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Silverglate said, Louise Woodward reiterated
instructions she gave the defense team before trial: Reject all
offers for paid interviews.
</P>
<P>
   That position, Silverglate said, has ``just been consistent from
the day the case began to take on a high profile, which was long
before last November.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis said he strongly believes that secret deals are being
made for the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really makes me sick _ the thought of her making money
from the death of this child, while telling supporters of hers ...
to contribute to a defense fund,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Elton Friday, Susan Woodward spent about 20 minutes talking
to journalists, and insisted she had not been paid. She spoke
briefly about her daughter, whom she said was striving to ``to get
her life back'' under difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew's death has been difficult for her and she had not
been able to deal with it properly,'' Susan Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   She also scolded the reporters who are still camped in town, and
vowed to protect her daughter from any intrusions on her privacy.
``She is not Princess Di and she won't be hounded to her death,''
Susan Woodward said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Pepsico Inc. on Friday fired the latest salvo in
what, for now, is a war of words with the world's largest
soft-drink company.
</P>
<P>
   In a 21-page legal brief, Pepsico urged the U.S. District Court
in New York not to side with the Coca-Cola Co., which last month
submitted a 26-page memorandum asking the court to throw out
Pepsico's antitrust lawsuit against the Atlanta-based beverage
giant.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed May 7, accuses Coca-Cola of using illegal
tactics to dominate the $54 billion fountain soft-drink business
Coca-Cola has a 65 percent market share to Pepsico's 24 percent.
Pepsico says Coca-Cola has a monopolistic lock on fountain
business, and that it has threatened to cut off the supply of Coke
products to independent food service distributors who also deliver
the Pepsi line to restaurants, movie theaters, s

 &HT;    CLINTON TO SEEK NUCLEAR MISSILE DE-TARGETING AGREEMENT FROM
CHINA
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Friday that China and the
United States should stop targeting each other with nuclear weapons
and that he would seek an agreement to accomplish that when he
meets with Chinese President Jiang Zemin next Saturday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The move could increase the security of both nations, help build
confidence between the two Pacific giants and strengthen global
efforts to contain the threat of nuclear war, Clinton said in an
Oval Office interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it'd be a good thing if we could get it,'' said
Clinton. ''I'd like to see it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said China's bloody 1989 crackdown on democracy
advocates near Tiananmen Square would weigh on his mind as Jiang
welcomes him in front of the Great Hall of the People, along the
western edge of the 98-acre square.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously I want to see Tiananmen Square, and I will think
about what happened there nine years ago,'' Clinton said. ''But I
also will be thinking about the last, turbulent century in China's
history and the fact that that whole setting there has been the
center of China's political life . . . There will be a lot to think
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton leaves Wednesday, June 24 for China. He will be the
first sitting American president to visit the communist country
since the Tiananmen massacre, which left hundreds of unnarmed
Chinese dead.
</P>
<P>
   Critics on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have said Clinton would
dishonor those killed in 1989 if he visits Tiananmen Square. The
president has rejected that argument, however, saying the Chinese
traditionally fete visiting heads of state at the Great Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has said Beijing must apologize for the 1989
crackdown ''sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   White House and Pentagon officials acknowledged last week that
the administration is working toward a nuclear de-targeting
agreement with China, though Clinton conceded Friday that
outstanding issues remain. Part of the problem is that China wants
the United States to pledge that it would not launch a nuclear
attack on China unless the Chinese launched such an attack first.
The United States refuses to renounce such so-called
''first-strike'' options.
</P>
<P>
   While neither country publicly discusses its nuclear targeting
regime, analysts generally believe both countries have
intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads on them
aimed at each other. That creates a dangerous hair-trigger
situation that poses grave risks of a miscalculation by one side or
the other.
</P>
<P>
   De-targeting such weapons would not mean they couldn't be used
against each other. They can be re-targeted within 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Clinton, de-targeting would sharply reduce the risk of
an accidental attack by one side or the other and could allow
critical time for leaders to defuse an emergency situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twenty minutes, in a world of instantaneous communications, is
an eternity,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   A de-targeting agreement, Clinton said, would also buttress
China's position as a force for stability in a potentially volatile
region, where recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan have
heightened fears of a nuclear exchange.
</P>
<P>
   He made his comments in an interview with Cox Newspapers,
McClatchey Newspapers and the CBS television network.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a dark suit, white shirt and brightly patterned tie,
Clinton answered questions centered on his China trip during the
half-hour interview, as his puppy, Buddy, wandered about
punctuating the president's comments with sporadic barking. Clinton
said that a busy week battling Congress over tobacco legislation,
monitoring events in the former Yugoslav republic of Kosovo and
working to buttress the sagging Japanese currency had left him with
less time than he would like to focus on his upcoming China trip --
and a softness beneath his eyes hinted at a week of less than
optimal rest.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, the president appeared fit, healthy and
tightly focused on interviewers' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the session he remarked that he was happy his daughter,
Chelsea, was returning to Washington from Stanford University on
Saturday night, in time to be with him for Father's Day on Sunday.

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Greece and Turkey are at odds again over the
divided island of Cyprus, with Greek planes landing on the island
and Turkish planes screeching overhead in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The latest quarrel reflected the fact that although the Cypriot
dispute is ostensibly between the Republic of Cyprus and the
ethnically Turkish enclave in the north, the greater conflict is
between their patron states, Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   This week's tension began rising on Tuesday when four Greek F-16
fighter jets accompanied by two military cargo planes landed at a
Cypriot airfield. Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of Turkey asserted
that by sending the aircraft to Cyprus, Greece had ``shown its
offensive intentions directed against Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, six Turkish F-16s flew across the island on
Thursday. They made several low-level passes over Greek areas.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Greek-populated Cypriot republic, Christos
Stylianides, said that Turkey was creating ``artificial tension,''
but that he did not expect the confrontation to lead to any ``hot
incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials said they were preparing an appeal to Britain
for help in calming tension on the island. Under terms of the
treaty that gave Cyprus independence in 1960, Britain is a
``guarantor power,'' along with Greece and Turkey, and thus has a
legal right to intervene in order to enforce terms of the treaty. A
government spokesman in London said that Britain would welcome an
appeal from either side.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the newly designated U.S. delegate to the
United Nations, who is also a special U.S. envoy assigned to deal
with problems on Cyprus, is due in Athens, Greece, on Monday.
Holbrooke's last visit there, in May, produced no substantial
results.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus has been formally divided since Turkish troops landed on
the island in 1974, saying they had been called to protect the
rights of ethnic Turks. In 1983 Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their
one-third of the island a separate republic, but it is recognized
only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Greece and Turkey are historic rivals, and tensions between them
have risen in recent months. Turkey is worried that new Russian
missiles that are to be stationed in Greek Cyprus will upset the
military balance, and that they could be used to attack its planes.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem of Turkey argued this week that the
missiles would ``not serve defensive purposes, but are an important
part of a Greek plan for possible aggression against Turkey.'' The
United States has urged Greek Cypriot leaders not to deploy the
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Greece was a key force in the European Union's decision last
December not to consider Turkey's application for membership.
Greece has also blocked the release of funds for Turkey. At a
European Union leaders' meeting last weekend in Cardiff, Wales,
Prime Minister Costas Simitis of Greece vetoed plans by Britain and
other countries to make a new overture to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Simitis said President Clinton had telephoned him in Cardiff and
urged him to soften Greek stances toward Turkey because they
``might lead to tension in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told President Clinton that this was not possible,'' he
said. ``My response was that Turkey, and not Greece, would be
responsible for any tension in the area.''

GE, KEMPER SETTLE EMLICO CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Kemper Insurance Companies and General Electric Co.'s
collapsed insurer, known as Emlico, reached an agreement Friday
that settles Kemper's claims against the failed GE unit. The size
and terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The pact resolved a reinsurance dispute between Kemper and the
Electric Mutual Liability Insurance Co. Ltd. (Emlico), as well as
direct insurance claims between Kemper and GE, according to a joint
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Emlico, founded by GE, is in bankruptcy proceedings after
relocating to Bermuda from Massachusetts in 1995 under a
controversial decision by the state's insurance regulatory body.
GE, a diversified manufacturing, technologies and services company
based in Fairfield, Conn., wants the failed unit to be fully
liquidated in Bermuda. Emlico reinsurers, including Long Grove,
Ill.-based Kemper, have mounted a legal battle to have the
proceedings done in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsurers are also seeking to limit what may be $2 billion in
cleanup costs related to environmental damage caused by GE at
several areas now deemed Superfund sites.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The postman never rings twice when he gets to Ezra
Shales' house on a half-empty strip of Beach 43rd Street in
Edgemere, Queens. A double take is more likely. There is no bell;
nor, for that matter, any doors, walls or people. Just a bright
yellow mailbox set into the sandy dirt by the cracked sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Shales has a house in name only, and even that detail won't be
decided until later Saturday during a housewarming party on the
block. For weeks, Shales has culled dozens of postcards that have
arrived at his lonely mailbox with suggested names for his
``Nominal Home,'' a sculpture set in a weed-covered lot near the
Far Rockaway boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   The home consists of bales of hay scattered on the narrow lot.
Each bale was slathered with plaster and labeled BED, DOOR, TABLE
and even DOG, all built to crumble through rain, heat and time.
Shales wants people to reconsider their ideas about the changing
faces and fortunes of the city. Although the postman has got used
to it, most people who walk down this deserted street just off the
concrete arches of the A train think the home is a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put a mailbox up on a street with no house, and you get
mail there,'' Shales said with wry satisfaction. ``Still, I like it
when people ask me what it's going to be. There's a refusal to
believe what you see. It tells you what people think about work,
art and land. And vacant lots.''
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of lots on this stretch of the Rockaway
Peninsula, thanks to ideas the city had in the 1960s about urban
renewal. Once home to bungalows and beachgoers, Edgemere and nearby
Arverne became desolate after blocks were razed for homes that were
never built. Recently, modest plans emerged to build affordable
housing and shops and reclaim some of the hundreds of empty acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my awareness of the city comes from having read about
archeology and reading things like Alfred Kazin's `A Walker in the
City,''' said Shales, a museum educator. ``In the city you think
about how it flows, how things are built and fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   He plopped his sculpture on a lot that a friend of a friend had
purchased years ago at a city auction. ``They were lifelong New
Yorkers who had always hoped it would come back,'' he said.
``Beautiful beachfront property, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   He cleared away some of the land, purchased some hay from a man
who also supplies the race tracks, and printed 10,000 picture
postcards of the sculpture, which he gave to friends, teachers and
anybody else he could find. In fact, he considers the postcards and
their suggested names as artistically important as the sculpture
itself. Among the recommendations are: Housilly, Baleful and No Mo
Ho.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making something here that people might not come all the
way out here to see,'' he said. ``You go to flea markets, though,
and you see people buying and selling old postcards. It's a funny
memento of a place they aren't even sure exists anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Shales knows that some people deride conceptual art as being
understood only by the black turtleneck crowd. Others look at
public art, if at all, as high-priced corporate street furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having this outside here, it's not about degrees, paper
degrees or provenance,'' he said. ``No pretensions. It just has a
kind of street value. That's what people talk about when they talk
about something having value. In economic terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why many people who pass by his house always ask if
he is going to put a fence around it. For protection, you know.
Like John Fillyaw, who stopped on the street a few days ago on the
way to visit his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is that?'' Fillyaw asked. ``What is it going to be?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It already is,'' Shales replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like that?'' Fillyaw said. ``You're putting up no fence?
Nothing?''
</P>
<P>
   Fillyaw tilted his head back as he beheld the lot. He liked it.
He liked the idea of things changing. Of course, he has long heard
talk about all kinds of changes promised for this neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think years ago they were talking about bringing casinos out
here,'' he said. ``That would have been good for New York. Now
Jersey's got it all.''
</P>
<P>
   As an electrician, he savored the thought of all the work that
would have brought his way. All that money. But, ever the optimist,
he ventured a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need lights out here,'' he said to Shales. ``I can put up
some garden lights. All low voltage.''

   SACRED-MUSIC (Fez Morocco) _ The fourth Fez Festival of World
Sacred Music, for all its variety, was limited to music by

Buddhist chanting to the drumming and dancing of West African

   SIDE-MAN-THEATER (Undated) _ After toiling for 20 years not
exactly anonymously but far from the bright lights of fame as a
freelance journalist, stand-up comic, playwright, screenwriter and
movie director, nobody is more surprised to see ``Side Man,'' a
memory play about jazz performers, land on Broadway than its
author, Warren Leight, 41. In jazz parlance, sideman refers to a
musician who works for hire on band jobs, who knows the standards
by heart and who can solo dazzlingly but also blend in with an
orchestra's sound. By Steven Drukman. (Moved).  &UR; ( &LR; Photo.

<P>
   SODERBERGH-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ When Lady Luck smiles on a
26-year-old first-time director, she doesn't take it kindly that he
ignores her and heads out on his own path. But now, at 35, after
five well-crafted bleak flops, Steven Soderbergh has returned to

   FILMS-STEREOTYPES (Undated) _ We live in a time when bullies are
in fashion and creative work that addresses social injustice or the
validity of someone else's suffering is likely to meet with braying
accusations of ``victim art'' and ``political correctness.'' Some
filmmakers accommodate themselves to such a climate by deploying,
with a wink and a naughty grin, the sort of stereotypes that began
to disappear from movies 30 years ago and that to some of us at
least, can't be redeemed by any amount of post-modernist irony or
neo-noir chic. By Karen Durbin. (Moved).

<P>
   MARK-MORRIS-DANCE (Undated) _ The Mark Morris Dance Group was
just eight years old and performing for the first time at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House when the company's general
manager, Barry Alterman, spoke about his vision for Morris in New
York: ``I want each of Mark's appearances in town to be an event.''
Now comes a Morris double bill at the opera house, Wednesday
through Saturday, with all the makings of still another ``event.''
The run includes Morris's final appearances, sometimes known as
``farewell performances,'' in his danced version of ``Dido and
Aeneas,'' Purcell's 1689. By Robert Greskovic. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   UKRAINIAN-DANCE (New York) _ The last time the Virsky Ukranian
National Dance Company visited New York, in 1988, Ukraine was part
of the Soviet Union and the troupe was beholden to its Moscow
sponsors. That is, it was strongly encouraged to perform Russian
dances along with Ukranian ones. This week Virsky, one of the
world's premiere professional folk troupes, returns to New York for
three performances at City Center, on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday
as part of a 38-city North American tour. And this time all the
dances are Ukranian. By Terry Trucco. (Moved).

   GENEVA-OPERA-HOUSE (Geneva, Switzerland) _ While other cities
have lost their beloved 19th-century opera houses in the wave of
overgrown performing-arts centers, the board of the opera company
here bucked the tide. At the same time that it took necessary steps
to preserve the Grand Theatre, Geneva's elegant opera house from
1882, it developed a second house in many ways as good as the old
one. By Paula Deitz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GABRIEL-FAURE-MUSIC (New York) _ Music tells no stories, but it
is a sign of human behavior. John Philip Sousa tells the world that
Americans want to make friends. The music of Gabriel Faure tells us
that the French are private, lonely, tender, furtive, wistful. Five
concerts of Faure's music at the Kaye Playhouse recently were
generously American, just as the music remained elusively French.
By Bernard Holland. (Moved).

   PROKOFIEV-MUSIC (Undated) _ Today, as composers are being told
to be more popular, Sergei Prokofiev may re-emerge as a role model
for the young and ambitious. The composer of the ``Classical''

and Juliet'' knew a thing or two about popularity. By David Schiff.

   RINGO-STARR-MUSIC (Undated) _ For a musician who was once part
of the most influential band in pop, spending more than a decade
rekindling a career must be an intensely frustrating business. But
listening to ``Vertical Man,'' Ringo Starr's 12th post-Beatles
studio album, one has to admire the cheerful industriousness with
which he has tried to recapture the success of his early hits,
``Ringo'' (1973) and ``Goodnight Vienna'' (1974). By Allan Kozinn.

<P>
   BRIAN-WILSON-MUSIC (St. Charles, Ill.) _ Brian Wilson is back.
That is, he's back gain. Brian Wilson has been back a lot over the

Wilson, and it is something he will have to deal with in marketing
campaigns for the rest of his life. By Neil Strauss. (Moved).

   DAGUERREOTYPE (Undated) _ The daguerreotype is perhaps the most
rapidly accepted and disseminated invention in history. In 1839,
shortly after his process was announced to the world, Louis J.M.
Daguerre wrote an instruction manual. Within three months, 29
editions were published in six languages. Now, through July 12, the
J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, which owns one of the most
important daguerreotype collections in the world, has more than 125
examples from its holdings on view, as well as a display of studio
and darkroom equipment from the collection of Matthew Isenburg. By
Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).

<P>
   IRVINE-MUSEUM-ART (Undated) _ Nearly lost in the sprawling
suburbs and high-tech industrial parks of Orange County, Calif., is
the unassuming Irvine Museum. It provides an unlikely setting for
the world's largest collection of California Impressionist
paintings. Now, some of the finest works of this underappreciated
genre have reached New York, bringing their airy palettes and play
of California light to the National Academy Museum in a show titled
``All Things Bright and Beautiful: California Impressionist
Paintings From the Irvine Museum.'' By David Kirby. (Moved).

<P>
   Fearsome volatility? Here's a pair of fund managers who have
lived and breathed it for years. Kevin Landis and Kendrick Kam
founded an investment club _ the Winners' Circle _ back in 1987,
venturing into the stock market just about a week before the
October crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the good sense to stay invested, and actually we
capitalized some more and bought more stock,'' Landis, 37, said.
The club kept going for years, he said, and ``in the end we all
made a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a story the two portfolio managers for Firsthand Funds in
San Jose, Calif., are likely to think about these days, as
technology stocks get whipsawed every which way.
</P>
<P>
   The fund they co-manage, Firsthand Technology Value, which is
based in San Jose, Calif., and used to be called simply Technology
Value, has posted some seriously big returns since it started in
May 1994.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it returned 61 percent in 1995 and an almost
identical amount in 1996. Last year, however, it badly
underperformed even its beleaguered technology fund rivals with a
6.5 percent return. The fund rebounded in this year's first quarter
with a 15 percent return, only to see that nearly wiped away in the
latest technology stock reversal.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should know that volatility is part of the Firsthand
package. Looking at the fund's longer-term returns, though, shows
how results have leveled out to create an impressive record. Over
the three-year period ended June 12, Firsthand returned 31.1
percent, more than double the 15.5 percent return of its rival
technology funds.
</P>
<P>
   The recent technology swings have not forced the managers to
think about about tamer sectors. In fact, they are so stoked that
they have started three additional technology funds in the last
eight months. And Landis and Kam say they are looking for a third
manager to help expand the firm's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever they tap will have to share a trait of the two managers:
industry work experience and a Rolodex of contacts. Landis and Kam
contend that firsthand knowledge helps them when it comes to
picking stocks in this wild sector.
</P>
<P>
   Landis worked for two years as new product marketing manager for
S-MOS Systems Inc., which makes integrated circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Kam, 38, was a co-founder of Novoste Puerto Rico Inc., a maker
of medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the original concept for Technology Value was that
technology professionals would not only invest in the fund, but
serve as industry informants to help the managers evaluate
companies. And, in fact, that has led them to some buys.
</P>
<P>
   About three years ago, some of Landis' industry contacts
suggested that he check out a company called Pacific
Microelectronic Center in Vancouver, British Columbia. The company
makes asynchronous transfer mode controller chips, a kind of
communications semiconductor that is an essential part of Internet
hardware. ``And everybody I asked said, `yep, PMC is the right
company,''' Landis said. But it was then owned by Sierra
Semiconductor, which had what he called an otherwise ``stale
product portfolio'' and so it did not interest him.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, Sierra Semiconductor announced that it was
discontinuing its old product lines to focus on PMC's networking
chips. The fund then began its purchasing in Sierra Semiconductor,
which changed its name to PMC-Sierra Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Landis first bought PMC-Sierra stock in August 1996, when it was
was trading at under $11. It closed last week at $45.625 and a year
from now, Landis said, the price ``should be north of $60.''
</P>
<P>
   PMC-Sierra is the highly concentrated fund's biggest position,
about 10 percent of assets. Other big positions are 8.8 percent in
Avant Corp., 7.2 percent in Vitesse Semiconductor Corp., and 5.9
percent in Adaptec Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Benz, an equity fund analyst for Morningstar Inc. who
follows Firsthand Technology Value, said that despite the fund's
spectacular run in 1995 and 1996, she had some concerns with a lack
of diversity in the portfolio, which is heavy in computer chip
companies.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt the fund's tactics can lead to major air
pockets in its portfolio. Landis calls Integrated Process Equipment
Corp., which sells equipment used to plane the surfaces of
semiconductor wafers as they are being made, an ``undiscovered
gem.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip industry leaders like Intel and IBM have adopted Integrated
Process technology, Landis said, and ``the mainstream is getting
ready to.'' But, Landis concedes, he was ``way too early'' in
buying Integrated Process stock. He started at about $30 last
summer, and the stock closed Friday at $10.25.
</P>
<P>
   Both Landis and Kam emphasize that in rapidly developing
technology companies, like Integrated Process, share value often is
not easy to discern from company reports. The company had a net
loss of $33.7 million on revenue of $144.7 million for the fiscal
year ended June 30, although it has since turned a profit. Landis
predicts that in the next two years, the company's shares will hit
$60.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kam's favorite picks for Technology Value has been
Arterial Vascular Engineering Inc., a company that makes coronary
stents, small devices of stainless steel mesh that cardiologists
implant in diseased arteries to hold them open after balloon
angioplasty. Kam started buying Arterial Vascular on a pre-split
basis above $10 in the summer of 1996, and he kept buying as the
stock dipped to $6 in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Arterial Vascular's stent was not yet approved for
sale in the United States, and competitors were coveting its
dominant position in Europe. But Kam again took advantage of
contacts, learning from from European cardiologists that none of
the new stents offered medical advantages over Arterial Vascular's,
and doctors preferred to keep using a product they knew and
trusted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Arterial Vascular got United States approval for its
stint, helping the stock surge to more than $30. Kam said he got
out at an average price slightly below that. It closed Friday at
$30.125. Kam says he has begun buying it again as its valuations
make it as good a buy now as it was in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the principal things we believe here,'' Kam said, ``is
that the people who understand any industry best are those that
have run companies or managed successful companies in these
industries.''

NEW STOCK IS FUELED BY NESTING BOOMERS 
</HEADLINE>

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21)  
 (af)  
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One part Pottery Barn, one part J. Peterman catalogue,
Restoration Hardware is the latest home store trying to capitalize
on the nesting urges of baby boomers to come to market.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' urges sent the stock ballooning up to $26.25 a share,
or 38 percent above the offering price of $19 on Friday, the first
day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The chain's name is a bit deceiving. It does sell hardware, but
none of it is really meant for restoring anything. The company's 47
stores are actually emporiums of big leather chairs, fancy dog
biscuit mix and the odd Russian flashlight or wind-proof lighter,
as well as doorknobs and lamps and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded by Stephen Gordon in Eureka, Calif., in
1980 and has spread to malls in 22 states with an off-beat product
mix that has some retail consultants calling it ``Pottery Barn for
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Its oddball assortment of hard-to-find items like the Russian
flashlight (which runs without a battery), old-fashioned wrenches,
Patio Daddy-O grill cookbooks and various gadgets do indeed have
the male appeal to distinguish Restoration Hardware from the mass
of mall stores aiming to attract female shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   But the retailer's bread and butter _ 42 percent of its sales _
is furniture and lighting, most of it with an Americana aesthetic,
and the key buyers of those products remain women. (Face it, it is
a special kind of fellow who willingly sets out on a Saturday to
survey some ``rollerball'' shower curtain rings.)
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for the initial public offering were high, and
Restoration Hardware did not disappoint. Exciting retail IPOs have
been scarce in the last six months, and Restoration Hardware's road
shows packed in all the major institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was exceptionally impressed,'' said Bruce Bartlett, who
manages Oppenheimer's Total Return Fund. ``I try to invest in
concepts that are leveraging the baby boom, and this concept hits
it on the nose. It appeals to both genders and people in the upper
income bracket.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, retail stocks have been hot this year. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's retail index is up 32 percent so far this year,
compared with a 13 percent rise in the S&AMP;P 500. The home
furnishings segment has traditionally been fragmented, and players
like Crate and Barrel have shown how to grab market share.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: Restoration Hardware is expensive. At
Friday's closing price, the company is already trading at roughly
45 times forward earnings, compared with a 17 multiple for Pier One
or 31 for Williams-Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this company has created an aura around selling
chairs and tables and knobs,'' said Linda Killian, a portfolio
manager at Renaissance Capital Corp. in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Restoration Hardware is just at the beginning of its
run. The company plans to open 25 more stores this year, and
roughly the same number in 1999. A catalogue to be introduced in
September will raise the profile of the store's name. New shoppers
will more than likely be tickled by the whole notion of romancing
the Bosco sauce.
</P>
<P>
   But like its shares, Restoration Hardware's goods are not cheap.
That club chair, for instance, costs $850, and much of the store's
furniture is priced much higher than Crate and Barrel or Pottery
Barn offerings. From an investor's perspective, it may have more in
common with a luxury retailer than, say, Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy or the American shopper's disposable income
should dip, gourmet dog biscuit mix and expensive leather chairs
are likely to be the first things consumers abandon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that the company itself has outstanding merchandising
and good management,'' said Tara Schuchmann, a managing partner of
Tara Capital Partners, a Dallas hedge fund with a retail focus.
``The biggest question for us is how long can people afford their
mortgage and still buy that cherry slate bed.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also likes to keep a lot of inventory in its stores,
which crowds out selling space, Ms. Killian noted. It could find
itself with bloated shelves at the end of a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   According to the prospectus, Restoration Hardware loses money
almost every quarter but the fourth of each year. Most retailers
depend heavily on the fourth quarter, but a furnishings store
shouldn't be as seasonal as, say, a toy store.
</P>
<P>
   Another nit: Gordon and other officers redeemed 1.3 million
common shares of common stock in May of 1997. But management still
owns 30 percent of the stock after the offering.
</P>
<P>
   If Restoration Hardware meets its goals of roughly 8 percent
annual same-store sales growth and fat 68-percent earnings
increases, investors who choose to hold the stock as long as they
would a couch from the company's stores could find themselves happy
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should have confidence that they can do what they want
to do,'' Ms. Killian said. ``In which case it will be an enduring,
unique concept.''

EDUCATION SECRETARY PROMISES SUPPORT FOR LATINO EDUCATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LORI RODRIGUEZ 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the heels of California's vote to curtail bilingual education
in public schools, the Secretary of Education promised national
Latino leaders in Houston Friday that the Clinton administration
would not abandon support for such programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of California made their decision,'' Richard W.
Riley told members of the National Association of Latino Elected
and Appointed Officials (NALEO). ``But I will not be stampeded by
those in Congress who now suddenly want to end bilingual
education.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, Californians approved Proposition 227, a
voter-initiative that would allow most students in that state one
year of intensive English training before putting them in regular
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton and I oppose the initiative which is now in
the courts,'' Riley said. ``Bilingual education programs are
working well in many states, including Texas, Florida and New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley also condemned an amendment to the Higher Education Act
proposed by Rep. Frank Riggs, D-Calif., that would ban affirmative
action in college admissions nationally. Patterned after
Proposition 209, another hot-button initiative previously approved
by California voters, the Riggs amendment has been bitterly
denounced by Latino groups, including NALEO and the Congressional
Hispanic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's remarks received a sustained, standing ovation from
NALEO members attending their 15th annual conference at the
Doubletree Hotel on Post Oak through Saturday. While United Nations
Ambassador Bill Richardson, who was selected by Clinton Thursday to
succeed Federico Pena as energy secretary, is a former NALEO board
member and current leader of the group, half of the 5,800 NALEO
officials are school board members.
</P>
<P>
   Education and affirmative action, said NALEO executive director
Arturo Vargas Friday, are major priorities,
</P>
<P>
   ``The executive branch doesn't control Congress but the
executive branch can veto what Congress does,'' Vargas said about
Riley's opposition to the Riggs Amendment. ``From the passion and
the words that he used, what I understood is that they're not going
to let this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at the conference, state Sen. Mario Gallegos contrasted
California's approval of racial and ethnic wedge issues with
Houston's successful defeat of the petition-driven referendum last
November that would have ended the city's minority contracting
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two bad words when you compare California and Texas,
and those bad words are initiative and referendum,'' said Gallegos,
the only Hispanic state senator ever elected in Harris County. ``As
long as I am in the Texas Senate, and I know my colleagues here
will back me up on this, we will never see initiative and
referendum here in the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Initiative and referendum, I don't care what the issue is, you
go out and get a bunch of signatures on a petition and, boom, it's
on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos and former City Councilwoman Gracie Saenz credited
former Mayor Bob Lanier with spearheading the drive that saved the
city's affirmative action policies. But even with the program in
place, they told NALEO members, Anglo men still get more than 70
percent of all city contracts.

SETTING AN ALARM TO TELL YOU WHEN TO SELL A STOCK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21)
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Calif., N.Y.)  (af) 
By ANNE TERGESEN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world where bull markets rage, interest rates sink and the
endlessly repeated apple-pie advice is to buy and hold, more than a
few investors have trepidations about selling. It can always seem
to be too soon: The winners may have further to climb, the losers
may be just about to redeem themselves, and patience may prevent a
mistake, or having to admit one.
</P>
<P>
   But sooner or later, everybody has to, or ought to, sell. And
the way the market has been behaving lately, with the Dow diving
400 points in five days, then rebounding a bit, then dropping
another 100.14 points on Friday, the mood of many investors may be
headed for the sooner end of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Is now a good time to sell? There is no certain way to tell.
Even professionals armed with sophisticated computer programs and
years of experience say that selling is more art than science.
</P>
<P>
   Still, without a disciplined approach to selling, investors risk
making the common mistake of basing decisions on emotions like
fear, pride, or greed rather than on a company's fundamentals, a
practice that can be costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All good money managers have sell strategies,'' said Stephen
Janachowski, a founder of Brouwer &AMP; Janachowski, investment
advisers in Tiburon, Calif. ``Individual investors, if they are
going to buy and sell stocks, should, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Some money managers cut their losses when a stock falls by a
certain amount. Others single out high price-to-earnings ratios or
earnings disappointments as reasons to say goodbye. But nearly all
adopt selling criteria that force them to stick to their investment
themes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bruce Hutson, manager of the Marshall Equity Income
Fund, always sells a stock when its yield dips 20 percent below the
average yield for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index _ no ifs,
ands or buts.
</P>
<P>
   With dividend-to-stock-price ratios at historic lows, parting
has become commonplace for Hutson's fund, which specializes in
undervalued large companies and aims to beat the S&AMP;P 500's yield by
at least a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric, Maytag, and H.F. Ahmanson are a few of the
stocks he recently excised from the portfolio because of low
yields. Hutson also sets a ``fully valued'' target price for each
stock he holds, and usually sells when a stock reaches its target.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Hutson's criteria have him selling more often than he
would like _ his fund's turnover is 60 percent _ but the results
are hard to argue with. The fund is up 17.7 percent in the last 12
months and is yielding 2.89 percent, well ahead of the S&AMP;P 500's
1.3-percent average, with less risk.
</P>
<P>
   Other money managers leave themselves some leeway to make
exceptions to selling rules. At the UAM FMA Small Company
Portfolio, for example, warning bells sound when a stock approaches
what the managers consider its full value, typically 20 percent or
more above the purchase price, said Kathryn Vorisek, vice president
of UAM.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ms. Vorisek and her colleagues decide the company's
outlook has improved since the target was set, they can be
persuaded to hold on.
</P>
<P>
   The fund did just that with Flowers Industries, a baking
company, and it was not sorry. Ms. Vorisek said a turnaround at the
company's Mrs. Smith's division, a recent cost-cutting plan, and
Flowers' growing stake in a revitalized Keebler justified
successively higher target stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The fund finally sold in March, after Flowers' market
capitalization surpassed $1 billion, the upper limit on the fund's
small-cap holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also has a ``butcher rule'' that calls for dumping
anything that falls more than 25 percent after the fund buys it,
but that too is not automatic, said Ms. Vorisek.
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, managers decide it signals a buying
opportunity. This flexible approach has helped the fund beat the
Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks by eight percentage points
over the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers say stop-loss limits like the butcher rule are
particularly useful with volatile or thinly traded stocks. Dan
Sullivan, who edits two newsletters and manages $175 million for
himself and clients that include his 93-year-old mother, is quick
to cut losses, sometimes selling one of the handful of fast-rising
momentum stocks he owns on a dip as small as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing you want is to be in them at the wrong time,''
said Sullivan, who has made his mother a millionaire even though
her portfolio's return has lagged slightly behind the S&AMP;P 500 over
16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vorisek said a butcher rule has another advantage. It
prevents managers from getting too attached to their favorite
holdings. ``It takes all the emotion out of a sale. You admit you
probably made a mistake, sell the stock, and move on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An important corollary is what might be called the Satchel Paige
rule: Don't look back. Even if a selling strategy produces one or
two spectacular blunders, it is worth keeping if it has generated
good returns over the long run, professional money managers say.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Brandywine Fund, Foster Friess focuses on
small-cap and mid-cap stocks that sell for an average of 18 times
1999 earnings, while delivering fast earnings growth of 20 percent
or more. When the fund buys a hot prospect, it generally makes room
by selling a slower grower, a strategy Friess calls ``pigs in the
trough'' because of the way hungry pigs displace satisfied ones.
</P>
<P>
   In early January, Friess' pessimism about future earnings
prospects convinced him that stocks in general were a bad bet, and
he moved three-quarters of the fund's assets into cash. His timing
was terrible, and he missed several months of double-digit gains in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Brandywine got back into stocks in March, when 1999 earnings
estimates made them seem a better bargain, but the damage was done,
and the fund's 12-month return slumped to 2.77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even after an experience like that, though, Friess is unwilling
to second-guess the sell discipline that served him well for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always regret not participating in the things that are
going up, but at the same time, if you know a strategy has worked
for 30 years, you don't want to abandon it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers caution against trying to trim a selling strategy
based on short-term results, and point out that transaction costs
and capital-gains taxes ought to figure in every selling decision.
Keeping a well-balanced and diversified portfolio can sometimes
mean pruning part of an overgrown holding, even if the fundamentals
do not call for a sale.
</P>
<P>
   And trying to outguess day-to-day price gyrations or bolts from
the blue like big mergers is generally just as futile when selling
as when buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask, `Does the combination of your buy and sell
strategies outperform the market?' '' said Richard Bernstein, chief
quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch. ``Or should you just
invest in an index fund and play golf?''

MANY EXPERTS QUESTION SPOCK'S DIET FOR CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
  (Repeating for all needing.)  
(ja) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The late Dr. Benjamin Spock, arguably the most influential
pediatrician of all time, has left children and their parents with
a surprising and rather demanding legacy: advice that they stick to
a vegetarian diet devoid of all dairy products after the age of 2.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh edition of his world-famous book, ``Baby and
Child Care,'' issued last month by Pocket Books just weeks after
his death at age 94, he recommends an approach to childhood
nutrition that many experts, including his co-author, Dr. Steven
Parker, consider too extreme and likely to result in nutritional
deficiencies unless it is very carefully planned and executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that there are harmful effects of a meaty diet,''
the new book tells parents. ``Children can get plenty of protein
and iron from vegetables, beans and other plant foods that avoid
the fat and cholesterol that are in animal products.'' As for dairy
foods, Spock says, ``I no longer recommend dairy products after the
age of 2 years. Other calcium sources offer many advantages that
dairy products do not have.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the influence of the book, pediatricians and nutritionists
have reacted with concern to Spock's new recommendations to raise
children on an all-plant or vegan diet. Throughout its 52-year
history, ``Baby and Child'' Care has been the second-best selling
book next to the Bible. Overall, parents continue to rely heavily
on Spock as an authoritative guide to raising children.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, pediatrician specializing in child
behavior at Boston City Hospital and a long-time admirer and friend
of Spock, called his new dietary recommendations ``absolutely
insane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with them at all,'' he said. ``A vegetarian diet
doesn't make any sense. Meat is an excellent source of the iron and
protein children need, and to take milk away from children _ I
think that's really dangerous. Milk is needed for calcium and
vitamin D.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts expressed concern about the ability of small children to
consume calories and fat to sustain normal growth on an all-plant
diet, as well as the diet's adequacy in supplying recommended
amounts of such essential nutrients as calcium, riboflavin, vitamin
D, iron and zinc and possibly even protein. They also said that
having to follow a vegetarian diet free of dairy products could
place undue social pressures on children, few of whom like to be
different from their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising children on an all-plant diet can be done, but it
would be like climbing Mount Everest,'' said Dr. Michael Georgiess,
professor of pediatrics and child development at the University of
Minnesota in Minneapolis. ``It would take an incredible amount of
planning and balancing of nutrients.'' Georgiess, who wrote the
chapter on vegetarian diets in the American Academy of Pediatrics
nutrition handbook, said that a strictly vegetarian diet ``involves
very significant risks. It would probably provide only about 60
percent of a small child's calorie needs and maybe the same
proportion of protein and would require supplementation with
vitamin D, calcium, iron and zinc.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc Jacobson, a specialist in adolescent medicine at
Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said, ``If a
strict vegetarian diet is part of someone's long-term culture, the
kids grow fine, though not as big. But for those who became vegans
recently, I can't say it's dangerous but there are risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the first edition of his landmark book in 1946,
Spock always included meat and milk products as part of a child's
recommended diet. Spock's revisions of what had been his most
recent nutritional advice _ to include small amounts of lean animal
foods in children's diets _ stemmed from a switch he himself made
to an all-plant diet in 1991, following a series of illnesses that
left him weak and unable to walk unaided. His wife, Mary Morgan,
said his health rebounded after he made the dietary change. He lost
50 pounds, regained his ability to walk and became healthier
overall and more energetic, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enabled him to revise his book before he died, which was
his most important goal,'' Ms. Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians for Responsible
Medicine, a Washington-based organization that advocates strict
vegetarian diets for everyone, said he had drafted the section on
nutrition in the new edition of Spock's book, but that Spock had
edited it to give it ``his personal touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morgan said, ``Ben had a hand in every part of the book''
and that he was ``very committed'' to the diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not difficult at all to get complete nutrition on a
vegan diet if it is supplemented with Vitamin D and B-12,'' Barnard
said in an interview. He said diet-related problems like obesity
and atherosclerosis begin in childhood and added, ``today's kids
are in worse health than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parker, the book's co-author and an expert in behavioral
pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, objected to the stringency of
the dietary advice and suggested that parents at least be offered
two alternatives. However, Spock rejected this idea, stating in a
letter to Parker that he wanted his book to be ``in the forefront''
of the growing awareness of the link between animal foods and
disease.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Parker said Spock felt his vegetarian diet ``improved his
quality of life and given him a new lease on life his last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed you should try to inculcate a taste for plant
foods early on and not acquire a taste for saturated fats, salt,
etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said a vegetarian diet ``can be healthy for kids,'' if
parents make sure they obtain all the nutrients they need, but that
he did not believe people had to be vegetarian as children to adopt
the diet as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said in an interview, ``I think the book is a terrific
book. There was no other area in which we had a disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   The book does makes some concessions to parents who do not go
the full vegetarian route. ``If you are including meats, poultry or
fish in your regular family routine, let me encourage you to
explore vegetarian meals and to serve as many meat-less meals as
possible,'' Spock advises parents.
</P>
<P>
   But the book says placing children on an all-plant diet will
their risk of developing such health problems as heart disease,
obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and certain diet-related
cancers later in life. Several studies have shown that, in general,
vegetarians are leaner and at lower risk of such diseases. As for
dairy products, Spock wrote that some children are allergic to
cow's milk and others have trouble digesting it. He also noted that
milk protein may trigger insulin-dependent diabetes in susceptible
children.
</P>
<P>
   However, several experts questioned the need to be so extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be sticking to dietary changes that have
demonstrable health benefits, like those outlined in the food
pyramid _ that's where the evidence is right now,'' said Dr.
Johanna Dwyer, nutrition expert at Tufts-New England Medical Center
in Boston who has studied the effects of vegetarian diets on growth
and development. The food pyramid, a dietary guide developed by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, emphasizes grain-based foods,
fruits and vegetables but also includes meats, poultry, fish and
dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer said it would be possible to provide growing children with
adequate nutrition by following Spock's recommendations, but added,
``most people would need a lot of help to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nutrition experts strongly disagreed with Spock's advice to
avoid dairy foods. The book states that ``most green leafy
vegetables and beans have a form of calcium that is absorbed as
well as or even a bit better than that in milk.'' But the experts
noted that calcium-rich vegetables contain substances like
oxalates, phytates and other fibers that interfere with calcium
absorption in the gut. (Spock also suggested calcium-fortified soy
milk and orange juice as sources of this mineral that is critical
to the proper development of bones.)
</P>
<P>
   As for diabetes, Dr. Susan S. Baker, a pediatric
gastroenterologist at the Medical University of South Carolina and
chairperson of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on
Nutrition, said the committee had examined the evidence for milk as
a factor in the disease and had found ``no real cause-and-effect
relationship between them'' that would justify eliminating dairy
products from children's diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is a compelling reason to avoid dairy products,
they should not be deleted from a child's diet,'' Baker said. ``It
would be very difficult for a child to get adequate calcium from
vegetables in the quantities needed to support optimal bone growth.
Milk is the most concentrated source of bioavailable calcium.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazelton said the advice was ``neither parent-friendly nor
child-friendly.'' He pointed out that ``although vegetarian
families, if they are very careful and conscientious, can eat a
balanced diet, most children in their second and third year are in
such rebellion about food, it's hard to get them to eat any
vegetables. This recommendation puts pressure on parents who in
turn will put pressure on their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Older children, too, would face added pressure, he and others
said, when forced to eat differently from their friends in social
situations. Susan Adams, a registered dietitian and nutrition
educator at the University of Washington in Seattle who has written
pamphlets with vegetarian meal plans, said, ``By restricting
children's diets so much, they can't interact normally in social
situations with other children. What's a birthday party without ice
cream? Having to be treated separately is hard on kids.''
</P>
<P>
   It can also be hard on parents, who might have to spend more
time preparing meals, including box lunches for their school-age
children. Ms. Adams said, ``Rice and pasta can be quick to fix, but
cooking beans and other vegetarian foods takes time. It's not the
way most people live today. Parents shouldn't be made to feel
guilty or that they are putting their children at risk
nutritionally because they make other choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Bonci, a dietitian in private practice in Pittsburgh,
said that parents who decide to raise their children on a
plant-based diet must make vegetarianism a family affair. Ms.
Bonci, who is herself a plant-only vegetarian, has two sons, ages 9
and 14, who are also vegetarians but who consume some dairy
products and eggs. She said, ``Children are so influenced by what
their parents are and are not eating, they will balk if their
parents don't eat what they do.''

Government and business leaders in Tokyo will wonder nervously, as
a senior Japanese diplomat put it: ``Has `Japan-bashing' turned

going to or coming from his nine-day sojourn in China has fed
Japanese fears that the United States may be ready to dilute its

BUSH-WILSON (Los Angeles) _ When Ruben Barrales heard that Texas
Gov. George W. Bush was going to be in California this spring, he
hustled into action to wangle an endorsement in his race for state
controller. ``The image of George W. Bush is one of an aggressive
leader who embraces the Hispanic community and our relations with
Mexico,'' Barrales said. ``This has brought him notice and a
following in California. He is a breath of fresh air out here ...''
Left unspoken is that the Bush image contrasts sharply with
California Hispanics' view of their own governor, Pete Wilson. To
some Republicans nationally it has come down to shorthand: the
``California approach'' and the ``Texas approach.'' By CRAGG
HINES. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PRISON-GANGS (undated) _ Two of the three men suspected of the
racially motivated slaying of James Byrd Jr. in Jasper were
believed to be affiliated with a white supremacist prison gang. In
fact, many who know suspects Bill King and Russell Brewer say they
exhibited no overt racial prejudices before they did hard time in
Texas prisons. After they got out, they were heavily tattooed and
spoke in a language sprinkled with racist epithets. The racist
gangs that thrive behind prison walls come from fear and a need for
belonging, according to prison experts. There are almost a dozen
such gangs in Texas prisons. By KATHY WALT. &QL; 
 &QL; 
JUVENILE-CRIME (Austin) _ Despite signs that a 1995 crackdown on
juvenile offenders is working, many Texans want even more stringent
sanctions for young criminals, including requirements that all
youthful offenders be sent to adult prisons when they turn 17 years
old and that all juvenile murderers be tried as adults, according
to the latest Texas Poll. By JOHN W. GONZALEZ. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MINOR-RIGHTS (undated) _ Erica was beaten constantly by her mother
as a child, and she always told herself she would be a different
mother and shower her children with love. She may never get a
chance to be a mother to her first child because of a judge's
decision last week. A family judge awarded primary custody of the
3-year-old to her grandfather and step-grandmother instead of
mother Erica. This is a feature story showing the pitfalls when
minors who sign joint custody agreements with their parents. By RON

INTERNATIONAL &QL;

FOREST-FIGHT (Eureka, Calif.) _ In the silence of the primeval
Headwaters Forest, which Houston businessman Charles Hurwitz
planned to cut, it's easy to believe the end of the clamorous
battle over this largest unprotected grove of ancient redwoods is
finally in sight. Beyond the virgin forest, however, the debate
hasn't grown much quieter in what may be its waning days. Lawmakers
are maneuvering. Press releases are flying. If the Headwaters fight
is drawing to a close, it's ending in much the same way it has
played out since 1986, when it became one of the most acrimonious
environmental issues of recent times. 3 TAKES. By BILL DAWSON &QL; 
 &QL; 
COLOMBIA-CAMPAIGN (La Dorado, Colombia) _ Although Horacio Serpa is
desperate for votes in Sunday's tight presidential runoff, he has
been operating a shoestring campaign. That's because both Serpa and
his opponent, Andres Pastrana, are haunted by the specter of the
campaign finance scandal that nearly toppled the government of
President Ernesto Samper. As a result, Serpa's rally here last week
seemed like a neighborhood pepfest with a stage that was full of
holes and a sound system that was underpowered. By JOHN OTIS.

<P>
   &QL; 
COLOMBIA-PRESIDENTS (Bogota, Colombia) _ When they leave the White
House, former U.S. presidents often disappear on the golf course,
make a few speeches, write memoirs. In Colombia, however,
ex-presidents often remain major powerbrokers. They have swayed
voters in this year's presidential elections by publicly endorsing
candidates and offering back-room advice. By JOHN OTIS. &QL;

gone off their lithium. The Dow industrials skidded 207.01 points
on Monday, to 8,627.93, only to soar 164.17 points on Wednesday.
The blue-chip average ended the week at 8,712.87, down 122.07 from
last week. Behind the stock market's zig was the currency market's
zag. The fall reflected fears that Asia's economic crisis would
hurt profits of American companies. Then the United States and
Japan bought yen to bolster the sagging currency, and investors
stampeded back into the markets, only to have second thoughts about
the Asian situation on Friday. The yen, which had neared an
eight-year low on Monday at 146.15 yen to the dollar, recovered to
end the week at 136.10. &QL;

   Strike Cripples GM &QL;

<P>
   General Motors' North American operations were crippled, with
100,000 employees out of work, most of its assembly plants shut
down and nearly 100 parts factories idle. At issue in what began as
a U.A.W. strike at two key Michigan parts plants are not only
short-term job security and workplace safety disputes, but also a
larger struggle over how far G.M. will go in adopting at home the
manufacturing techniques it is introducing abroad. G.M.'s
operations in Brazil, where outside suppliers assemble many parts
for new cars before delivering them to the assembly plant, have
become the company's most profitable, efficient and flexible. The
United Automobile Workers see G.M.'s reliance on outside suppliers
as a threat. &QL;

   After a month of contentious debate and too few votes for
passage, the Senate jettisoned a comprehensive tobacco bill meant
to discourage teen-agers from smoking. Although there appeared to
be almost no hope that it could be revived this year, leaders of
both parties vowed not to give up.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich said he would put forward a low-budget
alternative to the Senate bill, to discourage teen-agers from
smoking. President Clinton said: ``It's not dead over the long run
because the public health need is great. I've never quit on
anything this important in my life, and I don't intend to stop
now.'' &QL;

   Goldman Goes Public &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Clearly the tradition that Wall Street holds most dear is
profit. So little wonder that Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the Street's
last big private investment bank and by many measures its most
successful, decided to end its 130-year partnership and go public.
</P>
<P>
   The move could make Goldman a prime player in the financial
industry's rush to consolidate and allow the partners to capitalize
on the long-running bull market. Right? No, contended Jon S.
Corzine and Henry M. Paulson Jr., co-chairmen and co-chief
executives of the big investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said, ``This is not about money or cashing out.''
Paulson added, ``We don't think that being a financial conglomerate
is the way to go.'' They did say, however, that they intended to
make some acquisitions and to expand in Europe and Japan. &QL;

<P>
   Reports Are Mixed &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American economy has continued its excellent performance,
the Federal Reserve said in its ``beige book'' survey of regional
economic conditions, citing high employment levels and stable
prices. But the Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in May,
seasonally adjusted, the Labor Department said, bringing inflation
for the first five months of the year to a 1.5 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   The rise, although moderate, was the largest in 17 months. The
Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit for April
expanded to a new monthly high of $14.5 billion, well above the
$13.3 billion projected by many economists, in large part because
Asia's crisis has reduced demand for goods. &QL;

   A California Failure &QL;

   After two and a half years, three chief executives and $11
million in losses, California Advantage is filing for bankruptcy.
That's the managed care company that the California Medical
Association and 7,500 of its member physicians created to take on
the state's big health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack C. Lewin, a family practitioner and executive vice
president of the association, said that by offering subscribers
easy access to thousands of specialists, it tended to attract those
who were the sickest and costliest to treat. California Advantage,
which said it needed 40,000 subscribers to break even, is going out

   What better way to win favor with voters than to oppose taxes?
The House, citing the complexities and inequities in the tax code,
voted 219 to 209 to require that Congress come up with a new tax
system by Independence Day 2002 and scrap the current code by the
end of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Stretch, director of tax policy for Deloitte &AMP; Touche,
said wryly that it was easy to vote that way because the members of
Congress knew the president would veto any such law, rescuing them
from their folly. ``Sun-setting'' the tax code would make financial
planning impossible for both individuals and businesses, Stretch
said, citing dilemmas over issues like whether to rent or buy a
home, whether to put money into IRAs or other retirement plans and
whether to take capital gains on stocks. And businesses would not
know whether and how to invest in new plants and equipment. &QL;

   Chinese traders worked at their computer terminals at the
Shanghai Stock Exchange on Tuesday, even as the People's Bank of
China intervened to support the yuan, which is also called the
renminbi. The finance minister warned that the Asian crisis could
destabilize China's currency, a warning that some analysts suggest
influenced a decision by Japan and America to support the yen. A
Chinese devaluation could have kicked off a new wave of Asian
devaluations, leaving the region's economies in an even more
precarious state. &QL;

HOMELESS SEEKING RELIEF FROM TEXAS HEAT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CARLOS BYARS 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (HOUSTON) _ Homeless people are seeking relief from record-high
temperatures by spending the daytime hours in air-conditioned
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In a trend that normally occurs on cold winter days, the
homeless are spending time in shelters. The Star of Hope men's
shelter at 407 LaBranch on Friday reported an increase in the
number of men visiting during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in a break from normal practice, the Salvation Army Harbor
Light Center, 2407 N. Main, will be open Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The city is experiencing not only record and near-record highs
during the day but abnormally high temperatures at night. The
overnight low of 79 degrees reached early Friday morning tied the
record minimum set in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Daytime temperatures are averaging 6.4 degrees above normal in
Houston, the National Weather Service said. And the prediction is
that if current trends continue, Houston may set several records.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service said the daily average high of 94.7 degrees
makes this the third warmest June of all time. The highest average
maximum temperature is 96.3 degrees in 1980 and the previous second
warmest average daily high was 96.2 in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   The extended forecast offers little hope for relief, the NWS
said. National computer models indicate only a slight weakening of
the upper level high pressure ridge that presently dominates Gulf
Coast weather.
</P>
<P>
   So for relief, the homeless are headed for shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Arthur, spokesman for Star of Hope, said the agency's
walk-in center has about 600 men each week for showers and lunch,
which is an increase of 50 percent over the those served earlier
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter is closed during the day on Sunday, but Arthur said
it could be opened if the need becomes critical.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur said that in anticipation of the additional summer load,
the center spent $5,000 upgrading the air conditioning system.
</P>
<P>
   Rolan Chambless, spokesman for Harbor Light Center, said since
there is limited day labor available on weekends and most
social-service agencies are closed, the center will open at 10:30
a.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The center will provide lunch, dinner, an outdoor physical
activity area and an indoor area to read or watch TV, he said.
Information and referrals also will be available.
</P>
<P>
   Chambless said the center usually is open during the day only to
men in its drug- and alcohol-recovery programs. This gives these
men time to do the necessary cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   The center houses about 300 men each night, he said. Over the
weekend, another 100 to 150 men are expected to use the center
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see everybody take advantage of it, but we
have the guys who are going to go out to drink no matter what we
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the Star of Hope, a small group of men
and a woman made the most of a patch of shade as they waited for
the center to open.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heat, a couple slept, a man read while he kept an
eye on his drying clothes hanging on a nearby fence and the woman
shared a late lunch with pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Willie and another man who asked not to be identifiedagreed that
their situation is not too bad. There's only a problem on Sunday,
when the Star of Hope does not open until 3 p.m. and there is no
nearby place to get water.
</P>
<P>
   Harbor Light is a mile away, they said. They can't walk that
far, Willy explained, and if they did, they would just have to walk
back because ``this is where we live.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Open Door Mission, 5803 Harrisburg, there is no special
program. ``We don't asks guests to leave the property; we don't put
them out on the street,'' a spokesman said. ``We are open 24 hours
a day.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the Caring Heart Outreach Shelter, 6205 Jensen Dr.,
director Nora Seymore said officials are prepared to give people
relief from the heat but have had few, if any, takers.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Home for the Homeless, 4440 Bennington, also is open from
7 a.m. until 8 p.m. seven days a week, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Another traditional, if less known, resting place is the public
library. Spokesman Sheryl Berger said the downtown branch at 500
McKinney ``has four or five regular visitors, although I'm not sure
of their status. They seem to enjoy what we have to offer. They
seem to be avid readers for the most part.''

 (For release Sunday, June 21)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD KORMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are after the important dope on a public company, set
aside the glossy annual report and the spin-doctored announcements.
The really telling stuff is often in the filings to the Securities
and Exchange Commission, where the company has to come clean or
risk a securities fraud suit, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, getting at those filings has become much easier for
investors, thanks to the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis
and Retrieval system, known as EDGAR, which is available on the
Internet at www.sec.gov.
</P>
<P>
   But just as public education has not wiped out illiteracy, easy
access to dense, dry SEC documents does not make them easy to
decipher. To the uninitiated, EDGAR can seem an immense haystack of
boilerplate, arcana and gobbledygook, in which the valuable needles
of telling information can be especially hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Bates, who teaches corporate employees to find
competitor information in SEC filings, calls annual 10K's
``quintessential overload documents.'' ``It's all there, but it's
buried,'' she said. ``It's almost too rich.'' Less well-known forms
can be even more forbidding.
</P>
<P>
   Once an investor learns how to hack through the semantic
camouflage, though, the payoff can be great. A savvy EDGAR reader
might spot questionable policies, hidden vulnerabilities and
ticking time bombs before they make news and bite unsuspecting
stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   It takes practice to become proficient at mining EDGAR. But even
the casual investor can save a great deal of time by recognizing
details, phrases and sections where the most interesting tidbits
are likely to lurk.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it is impractical to read the filings of hundreds of
companies when first scanning for interesting businesses. Most
experts suggest developing a short list of target companies and
then reading the EDGAR filings on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC filings are becoming less off-putting as the commission
gradually forces companies to write their reports in plain English.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in October, companies must submit easy-reading cover
pages, business summaries and risk factors. The greater challenge
lies in ``getting people to the document,'' says Nancy M. Smith of
the SEC
</P>
<P>
   Here are some examples of places to look in SEC filings for
signals of potential trouble or strength.
</P>
<P>
   MISMATCHED NUMBERS _ Even a cursory glance at income statements
and balance sheets in a company's 10K report can turn up curious
figures. On March 31, a report for the 1997 fiscal year by FPA
Medical Management, a medical-practice manager in San Diego, showed
accounts receivable doubling from the year before and positive
operating income in a year when cash flow was negative, signs that
something _ the accounting or the business _ may be amiss.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers in the 10K were published in time for investors to
bolt before the stock tumbled to $2 from $14. ``If you are looking
for warning signs, look for confusing, contradictory numbers and
ignore the spin from management,'' said John Ransom, an analyst for
Raymond James.
</P>
<P>
   A BULL IN THE CORNER OFFICE _ Tultex Corp., a maker of cotton
sportswear, is losing money, and its stock is way off its 52-week
high. But SEC filings show that one investor apparently hasn't
given up hope _ the company's chief executive, Charles W. Davies
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   During Tultex's decline, he has been buying blocks of the
company's stock on the open market, paying $4.50 to $5.50 a share.
Each time he did, the assistant corporate secretary filed a Form 4
that shows up in EDGAR.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S THAT DOING HERE? _ Companies don't always report the most
telling information in the places you would expect. The part of a
typical 10K marked ``Liquidity and Capital Resources'' is usually a
bland section demonstrating that the company has enough money to
continue operating. But in SMC Corp.'s 1996 report, something very
unusual turned up there: Capital expenditures of $11.1 million,
including a $3.8 million corporate jet _ a lot of money for a
luxury motor coach maker whose entire operating cash flow that year
was only $4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   PAST EMPLOYMENT _ Proxy statements filed in EDGAR include
biographies of people who are up for election as directors. Judging
by Amcor Capital's proxy, Dale Paisley probably can't get a letter
of recommendation from Travelmax International, where he was chief
financial officer for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Amcor, a real estate and agricultural company in Coachella,
Calif., discloses in its proxy that Travelmax is suing Paisley and
others for ``fraud, misappropriation of funds, breach of fiduciary
duty and unjustified enrichment.'' It goes on to say that Paisley,
a former partner at Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, denies Amcor's accusations,
which involve an alleged attempt to illegally acquire large blocks
of Amcor stock very cheaply, and believes he has been released from
liability for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   CONFLICTS OF INTEREST _ Go straight to the phrase ``related
party transactions'' for a quick read on a company's determination
to stay free of suspicious entanglements with shareholders and
directors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10K for 1997 filed by Sulcus Hospitality Technologies, a
software maker in Greensburg, Pa., the company notes that it leases
its main office from a trust established by Jeffrey S. Ratner, a
principal shareholder and former director. When the company says
``these leases were not the result of arms length negotiations,''
it means no disinterested party has checked to see whether the
terms are fair to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY TIES _ In publicly traded companies where a single family
controls much of the stock, the line between shareholder and family
interest can be hard to draw.
</P>
<P>
   Zapata Corp. in Houston has been controlled by its chairman,
Malcolm Glazer, in recent years. While analysts have wondered
whether the company's strategy hangs together _ it diversified from
marine products and food service into Internet magazines and plans
to change its name to Zap _ the company's 10K filings leave no
doubt that the Glazer family does. Malcolm's sons Avram, Bryan and
Edward are directors, and Avram is chief executive; Malcolm's
daughter Darcie is employed by Zapata as an investment analyst.  &QL;

<P>
   OVERDUE NOTICES PILING UP _ Late filings appear with the letters
NT before the form name and can sometimes presage accounting
trouble. ThinkNew Ideas, an Internet advertising company, filed
notice of a late quarterly report May 15. When the NT-10Q appeared
May 21, it came with upward restatements of expenses for the
quarter ended March 31, 1997. Then, on May 27, the company reported
that it had dismissed its outside auditor in February.
</P>
<P>
   COURT TANGLES _ The ``Legal Proceedings'' section in SEC
documents will note problems that could drain money and distract
managers' attention, says John Bajkowski, a financial analyst with
the American Association of Individual Investors.
</P>
<P>
   Neuromedical Systems, which uses computerized scans to improve
cervical cancer tests, faces the formidable task of convincing
doctors, technicians and insurers to accept its methods.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, the Suffern, N.Y., company has been waging an
increasingly costly multifront war in the courts against two
rivals, Neopath and Cytyc. The patent infringement, business
interference and unfair competition suits probably won't have a
material financial effect, the company says in its 10K, but, as
they drag on, the company says costs during 1998 ``could be
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   CHUTZPAH _ Personality can seep through the boilerplate format
of SEC filings, and smaller companies sometimes reveal themselves
in unusual ways. Paradise Inc. in Plant City, Fla., strikes a note
of self-congratulation in its annual 10K.
</P>
<P>
   The company writes that it ``knows of no other manufacturer in
the Western Hemisphere'' that claims as big a share of the candied
fruit business.
</P>
<P>
   But self-confidence only goes so far. The report also says that
as of March, Paradise has failed to comply with new minimum
requirements for listing on Nasdaq's market for small-cap stocks.

NET JOB? DUNLAP HAS CHAIN SAW, WILL TRAVEL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On page 127 of the paperback version of his autobiographical
management manual, ``Mean Business,'' Albert J. Dunlap writes,
``People perform in the future the way they did in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly why Dunlap, dismissed last week as the Sunbeam
Corp.'s chairman and chief executive, will almost certainly be
scratched off the A-list when top-tier companies seek new bosses,
recruiters and management experts say.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, the former paratrooper got a lot of
mileage out of his patented modus operandi. He would parachute into
companies like Lily-Tulip or Scott Paper, cut thousands of jobs,
shut down factories and walk away, pronouncing his war on the
bloated balance sheet a success.
</P>
<P>
   But at Sunbeam, he was ignominiously tossed out after less than
two years by a board that said it had unanimously ``lost confidence
in Dunlap's leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap and his lawyer did not return calls seeking comment. But
the recruiter who placed him at Scott Paper in 1994 said the heyday
of ``Chain Saw Al'' ended with his abrupt departure from Sunbeam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional board is going to be less welcoming to him,''
said the recruiter, Thomas J. Neff, the president of Spencer
Stuart, an executive search firm. ``Only in a situation that is
viewed as a mission impossible, where other candidates may not have
the stomach to take them on, will perhaps the board and Mr. Dunlap
find a match.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is Dunlap's next move likely to be? Given Sunbeam's
well-publicized financial woes _ the company has posted two
quarters of unexpected bad results and said it would miss its
numbers for the current period and full year _ the experts say his
prospects are limited, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   If Dunlap wants to run another corporation, they say, he will
likely have to go to a smaller, low-profile public company (think
John Sculley, the one-time Apple Computer chairman and his brief
foray at Spectrum Information Technologies) or a struggling private
firm. He might be welcome overseas or could become a consultant,
advising companies on how best to trim fat. That career track,
though, would be heavy with irony: a chapter in Dunlap's book is
entitled ``Fire All the Consultants.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he chooses to do, ``he has become a victim of the trend
he was part of leading,'' said Rakesh Khurana, an assistant
professor of human resources and strategy at the Sloan School of
Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, fallen executives regularly rebound. But for the
best-paid, highest-profile bosses, the expectations are that much
greater and the impatience of corporate boards that much shorter.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, John R. Walter resigned as AT&AMP;T's president last
July under pressure from the board after only nine months. Gilbert
F. Amelio lasted less than a year and a half as chief executive at
Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   As for Dunlap, he will be busy for some time wrangling with
Sunbeam's board over his severance. That distraction, as well as
his age _ he is 60 _ are likely to make him a harder sell,
recruiters say.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is his notoriety, cultivated with coast-to-coast book
tours, biting one-liners hurled at the business press and speeches
peppered with flattering assessments of his own talent. ``Because
some executives can't make decisions or constantly make the wrong
ones,'' he has said, ``their incompetence virtually screams out for
an Al Dunlap.''
</P>
<P>
   It was such boldness, of course, that made his downfall national
news. And now he will reap what he sowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notoriety that he has now gotten as a result of this will
in some ways cast some kind of cloud, whether good or bad, on
whomever he goes to work for in the future,'' said John F. Johnson,
chairman of Lamalie Amrop International, an executive search firm.
``Now they've got to go in and say, `Well, we hired Al Dunlap, and
even though he didn't do well in his last role, we have confidence
he'll do well in this one.' I don't know that the Street will buy
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for Dunlap to retire to the golf course yet.
Andrew Ward, an assistant professor of management at Emory
University, who has studied the downfalls of chief executives,
said, ``I don't expect this is the last we've heard from Al
Dunlap.''

FRENCH PREMIER, IN U.S., SPEAKS OUT ON KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Friday
that the West faced a serious quandary in the southern Serb
province of Kosovo by trying to stop the violence there without
appearing to side with the ethnic Albanians who are fighting for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   While France insists that any NATO action in or over Kosovo be
authorized by the United Nations Security Council _ an
authorization that Russia threatens to veto _ the world cannot
ignore turmoil in Kosovo that threatens a regional explosion,
Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want a possible veto in the United Nations to be an
excuse to do nothing in the face of massacres,'' Jospin told
reporters Friday during his first visit to the United States as
prime minister. ``But the Russians face a dilemma, too,'' he added,
which he said he discussed with President Clinton in their Oval
Office meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it's difficult for Russia to use its veto,''
Jospin said, because the Kremlin would have to choose between the
good relations it needs with the West for its financial stability
and its older, more rhetorical solidarity with its fellow Slavs in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is a lot of convincing we have to do,'' he said,
urging Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, ``to come to his
senses'' and stop building support for the rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army through his attacks on innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic's attitude is irrational,'' Jospin said. ``The
international community accepts Kosovo as part of the Yugoslav
federation, so the solution is autonomy. There is a crazy evolution
of events, and I hope Milosevic will come to his senses.''
Milosevic withdrew autonomy from the province in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, a Socialist, was elected a year ago in a major defeat
for conservative French President Jacques Chirac, who had called
early elections. But Jospin is a pragmatic sort of socialist,
arguing that socialism means social justice and not national
ownership of the means of production.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of economic prosperity must be shared, he said
Friday, as must the pain of economic adjustment, like the
transition France is undergoing in its effort to adapt its
state-dominated economy to the demands of global competition.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chirac is ultimately responsible for France's foreign
policy, there is a sharing of power between the president and prime
minister, and Jospin has received the full treatment from the
Clinton administration. In addition to meeting with Clinton, he has
also met with Vice President Al Gore and the secretaries of state,
defense and treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, whose approval rating in France has never fallen below
50 percent, is a likely presidential candidate in 2002, and the
Clinton administration wants to get to know him better, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin and Clinton together attended the opening of a new
French-U.S. business council intended to promote trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Jospin has been preaching a new period of global
partnership with the United States and an end to the backbiting
that marked the end of Clinton's first term. The French foreign
minister at that time, Herve de Charette, and Secretary of State
Warren Christopher rubbed each other the wrong way over issues
ranging from Africa to the Middle East.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While their successors, Hubert Vedrine and Madeleine Albright,
have had their differences _ over U.S. sanctions on Iran, for
instance, and the Iraqi crisis _ both have worked hard to emphasize
common goals. Albright goes out of her way to speak the French she
learned in a Swiss school, and Vedrine praises her at every
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, for his part, insisted on speaking a vigorous, clear
English, and his various toasts and speeches have praised the
longstanding alliance between France and the United States and the
increasing understanding in America of European integration and
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing a clearer idea of France to the United States was one
of his prime goals, he said Friday. ``Do not be misled by
caricatures that would have you believe France to be so burdened by
its singularities and faults as to be incapable of adjusting to the
world now emerging,'' he said at the National Press Club. ``France
is in reality far removed from the gloomy picture some people
paint.''

DOW DROPS 100 TO END VOLATILE WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell again Friday as Wall Street closed
out a volatile week just the way it began: with waves of
large-scale selling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shares tumbled across the board, hitting blue-chip issues the
hardest, in an extremely heavy trading session that saw the Dow
Jones industrial average drop 100.14 points, or 1.14 percent, to
close at 8,712.87. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said Friday's selloff was a result of
trading related to ``triple witching,'' the day when options on
stocks, stock indexes and futures expire, which often creates
market havoc.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in a week filled with more serious concerns about economic
distress in Japan _ and the possibility that such distress might
set off a deeper economic slump in Asia _ it was no surprise that
share prices slumped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While prices were weak through much of the day, shares slid even
more on news service reports that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
had suggested that despite the U.S. intervention in buying the
Japanese yen earlier this week, Japan's economic recovery might be
long and difficult. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks helped lift bond prices Friday, sending the yield
on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue, which moves in the
opposite direction of the price, down to 5.66 percent from 5.70
percent a day earlier. The dollar also rallied against the yen as
optimism about Japan's recovery soured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough week,'' said Alfred Goldman, a market
strategist with A.G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis. ``The big question
is: How bad is the economic malaise in Asia?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last few weeks have not inspired optimism. Japan confirmed a
week ago that it had fallen into a recession. And on Monday, the
the yen fell to an eight-year low against the dollar, heightening
fears that the weakening yen could undermine other Asian
currencies. That day, the Dow plummeted 207 points, or 2.3 percent,
in one of the sharpest selloffs of the year. But on Wednesday ,
when the United States joined Japan in buying yen, the Dow
rebounded 164.17 points, or 1.89 percent.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As part of the coordinated effort, the Japanese government
agreed to resolve its banking crisis, and take steps to right its
economy. But if it cannot, investors are worried that American
corporate profits could be weakened. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, U.S. markets continue to be volatile. The Dow,
which reached a record 9,211.84 in mid-April, slid as low at
8,627.93 on Monday, a drop of 7 percent from its peak.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blue chips, however, have fared much better than smaller company
issues, which are generally flat, according to the Russell 2000
index of small company stocks, which is up just 0.3 percent.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even with the turbulence, though, both the Dow and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index are up more than 10 percent this year, and
so is the Nasdaq composite index, where some big technology stocks
trade. Indeed, Friday the Nasdaq stock market gained nearly 0.5
percent in one of the few signs of strength in the market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What Wall Street is worried about is a sharp slowdown in profit
growth in the first quarter, and signs of more trouble ahead.
Asia-related earnings warnings have already come from IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, Boeing and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the widely followed investment strategist at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., however, remains as bullish as ever,
contending that the ``supertanker'' U.S. economy is strong enough
to withstand the effects of turbulence in Asia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conference this week, she told investors that
``even if Asia stays extremely weak,'' the economy and the market
will remain strong, and she said the Dow could easily reach 9,300
by year's end. &QL;

RUSSIA ISN'T LIKELY TO RECEIVE MORE FUNDS NOW, IMF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The International Monetary Fund warned Russia on Friday
that it does not plan to provide the $10 billion to $15 billion in
additional assistance that the Kremlin is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fischer, the fund's second-ranking official, said the
request, announced Thursday, was for ``a lot of money, more than
the IMF can give to one economy.'' Fischer spoke at a news
conference in Sao Paulo, where he is attending a seminar on
Brazil's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer is to arrive in Moscow for new talks early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say they need the extra money to reassure
investors, prevent the devaluation of the ruble and stabilize the
financial markets. Many Western investors also agree the money is
needed, but the IMF has been more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's comments do not necessarily mean that other sources of
help will not be found, but no nations have announced any intention
to provide extra help. They might do so, however, if the IMF agreed
to provide more assistance and Russia's economy continued to
deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, the IMF provided $21 billion in aid; other
international groups and nations provided the rest of a $57 billion
package.
</P>
<P>
   Government released data Friday that indicated 1998 is likely to
be a year of economic stagnation for Russia, or even gradual
decline: The gross domestic product dropped two-tenths of 1 percent
in the first six months of the year, from the corresponding period
last year, the State Committee on Statistics reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russia suffers two ills: high interest rates and low prices for
its oil.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been forced to ratchet up the interest it
pays on treasury bills to attract nervous foreign investors. But
that has also vastly raised the cost of borrowing and choked off
investment and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide decline in oil prices has hurt the profitability
of the producing companies and made them even more reluctant to pay
taxes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite Fischer's comments, Russia is pinning much of its hopes
on securing billions more from the IMF. Before Russia can do so,
however, it has to remove some of the roadblocks that held up the
disbursement of an earlier $10 billion loan.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has deferred the latest $670 disbursement from this
loan, saying the government has not met all the conditions. Russian
officials said Friday that there are two main problems:
</P>
<P>
   _ A demand that Russia deny access to its oil pipelines to
companies that have not paid their taxes. The government has been
working out a plan that calls on Russia's 13 oil companies to pay
their taxes for June and then pay their arrears over the next three
months.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government's pledge that it will clamp down on the 20
biggest tax delinquents and speedily collect about $808 million in
back taxes. A Kremlin aide said that it would be difficult to meet
this goal and that the government hopes a compromise can be struck
with the IMF
</P>
<P>
   Friday, President Boris Yeltsin struggled to reassure the public
that the country would find a way out of its financial jam,
including the worsening problem of unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hanging on'' he said during a visit to Kostroma, 200
miles northeast of Moscow. ``But you know, we lack rubles, and
that's where the delays come from.''

OUTLOOK FOR LOW-SKILLED JOB SEEKERS IN TEXAS IS GOOD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (HOUSTON) _ The outlook for low-skilled job seekers in Houston
is good compared with many other urban areas, and typifies an
economic rebound among the nation's cities.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 38,691 Houston job-seekers with limited skills will
compete over the next few years for 33,030 jobs _ a gap of 5,661 or
about 1.2 potential applicants for each job, according to a report
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors measured the number of
low-skilled workers in 74 cities against the projected job growth
in related occupations through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report did not rank the 74 cities, Houston compares
favorably with other large urban centers and the national average.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, for example, the gap for low-skilled job seekers is
projected to be 6.4 for every job available over the next five
years. In Detroit, an estimated 23 workers will compete for each
job requiring limited skills.
</P>
<P>
   The results for Texas cities were varied, with Dallas projected
to have 1.7 low-skilled job seekers for every job, while Fort Worth
is projected to have more jobs than workers to fill them on the low
end of the employment scale.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the forecast indicates there could be 1.9
low-skilled workers for every one job available to them through
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Low-skill workers are defined as those having less than a high
school education, and are employed in areas such as food service
and manual labor.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Craig, professor of economics at the University of
Houston, said three specific employment categories help Houston's
overall rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of manufacturing here, and while you might
think of that as high-skilled labor, the bottom rung in
manufacturing really isn't,'' Craig said. ``Clearly, we also have a
lot of construction going on, and third, like all large cities, we
have a big service economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Craig noted, the lack of stringent business
regulation in Houston also favors low-skill workers _ in areas such
as daycare, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our service sector of the economy is relatively unregulated.
We assume people know how to take care of themselves,'' Craig said.
``That creates a lot of employment opportunities that some other
cities regulate out of existence.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Conference of Mayor's survey coincided with a State of
the Cities report issued by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, where officials also took note of the generally
positive employment outlook in the nation's cities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, entry level job creation grew by 34
percent in cities nationwide during the past year. In last year's
State of the Cities report, cities captured just 13 percent of
entry-level job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Officials attributed the increase to favorable employment trends
and a rebound in traditional urban economies creating jobs for
people coming off welfare and others with limited professional
skills.
</P>
<P>
   But Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo and others cautioned that
challenges remain for cities in the areas of housing and education.
</P>
<P>
   On providing enough jobs for low-skilled workers, a senior
housing official in Washington said despite the gains of cities
such as Houston, the national forecast of two workers vying for one
job remains ``a serious issue.''

THE LAST-STAND PARTNERSHIP ON WALL STREET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mo.)   (af)  
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The decision last week by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. to sell stock to
the public, ending 130 years of business as a partnership,
reflected common wisdom among Wall Street's giants: Any firm that
aspires to have enough financial power to remain an industry leader
has to turn to outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   Just one major champion of the Wall Street partnership remains:
Edward D. Jones &AMP; Co., the St. Louis-based brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
   Often described as the Wal-Mart of finance because of its
strategy of serving investors in rural areas long ignored by giant
stock retailers like Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber and Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, Jones has expanded rapidly into suburban America,
Canada and, starting last year, small towns in England.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' network now stands at nearly 4,200 offices, more than any
other firm's. Its goal is to have 10,000 offices within five years,
most staffed by a single broker and an office manager. Such brokers
make up roughly two-thirds of its 2,500 limited partners. Most of
the others are headquarters employees, including some secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the company could grow even faster if it
followed Goldman's lead. Certainly, there has never been a better
time to get a high price for a company like Jones, although the 158
general partners could not expect their stakes to be valued at
anything like the $100 million figure being bandied about for some
of Goldman's 190 partners.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman earned about $1 billion in each of the first two
quarters of the year, nearly 10 times Jones' net income of $114
million on revenue of $1.13 billion for all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   More capital would allow Jones not just to open new offices
faster but also to expand its meager share in investment banking
services that can be more lucrative than selling stocks. It could
also enter areas it now avoids, like trading for its own account.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones figures there is more to lose than to gain from
abandoning its partnership structure and the conservative business
strategy that has been built around it. The company has, in fact,
turned down offers to be acquired in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest mistake successful companies make is focusing
their analysis inward on what they do instead of outward on how the
world is changing,'' said John W. Bachmann, Jones' managing
partner. ``But we've decided to stick with the trade-offs we've
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Those trade-offs start with an investment philosophy that might
seem out of touch in the go-go 90s. Clients are typically directed
toward blue-chip stocks and bonds and then generally advised to
hold them with heirloom-like loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers do not push initial public offerings and the firm,
unlike, say, Merrill Lynch, has no in-house mutual funds that it
might be tempted to favor.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' trading desk in St. Louis purchases bonds not for the
firm's account but to provide inventory for the brokers. Similarly,
Jones gets involved in investment banking only to create new
securities for its clients. Indeed, neither trading nor banking is
treated as a separate profit center, eliminating a potential
conflict of interest with the firm's retail customers.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers are given the freedom to operate their offices almost as
independent businesses. They are pushed, though, to generate their
commissions by finding new customers and by adding to existing
accounts, rather than from trading or speculation. Those who earn
profits over the long term, participate in company training
programs and keep their compliance records unblemished become
limited partners.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' current strong buy recommendations include such warhorses
as DuPont, Campbell's Soup and Citicorp. Even in high-technology,
the favorites tend toward big names like Compaq Computer and
segment leaders like Applied Materials, the largest supplier of
semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 13 analysts follow fewer than 300 companies,
although their work is supplemented by research Jones purchases
from Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are periods of time when small stocks are in favor and
then the market works against us,'' said Mary Beth Heying, a
company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Not recently, however. Jones' recommended list gained 39.5
percent last year, outperforming the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index and the recommended selections of every other major broker.
It continued to outperform the S&AMP;P 500 in the first five months of
this year, returning 14.5 percent. But the five-year gain through
the end of last year of 120.4 percent was 20 percent less than the
S&AMP;P's and below that of most other brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   Bachmann frankly admits that he frets about his firm's ability
to prosper as Wall Street firms consolidate, banks and other
competitors plunge into stock brokerage and Internet-based services
offer investors bargain-priced trading from their home computers.
</P>
<P>
   Battling firms like Merrill Lynch for hotly contested suburban
turf is tough enough, especially since that Wall Street giant has
been paying big bonuses to lure away Jones' brokers. But Merrill is
at least familiar. Not so huge banks like Nationsbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still learning how to compete with them,'' Bachmann
said. ``They are great marketers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachmann says the changes in the competitive landscape have not
been surprising but the pace of change has been. Jones has
responded by hiring 150 broker candidates a month this year and
plans to step that rate up to 200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is gambling that rapid expansion can offset the marketing
advantages of larger competitors and the lower costs of new
Internet-based brokers.
</P>
<P>
   How far into the next century such efforts can carry the
partnership is Bachmann's big challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main threat to us is irrelevance,'' Bachmann said. ``If
our voice is drowned by giants or they price in ways we can't
compete, we'll be in trouble.''

BEWARE OF JAPANESE BEARING GIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic will be sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
212-556-4204.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21)  
 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like a bungee jumper who finally reached the end of
his rope, the Japanese yen made a mighty bounce last week. The yen
ended the week 7 percent above the eight-year low against the
dollar it hit just days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The bounce came courtesy of the United States Treasury, which
bought billions of dollars worth of yen in currency markets on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   What did Uncle Sam get for his big investment? Promises by Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga to
address their nation's economic problems. Something called ``the
Total Plan'' is supposed to allow Japan's banks to escape their
problem loans without causing a nationwide depression.
</P>
<P>
   This is supposed to impress. In fact, it sounds like little more
than hot air _ about which the Japanese know plenty.
</P>
<P>
   It was Japan, after all, whose Nikkei 225 stock index rang in
1980 at 6,556 and exited the decade at 38,916, a rise of nearly
sixfold. Yet even when the market was at its dizziest, high-level
officials at Japanese banks angrily denied that the Nikkei might be
a hot-air balloon. Punctured, the Nikkei now stands at 15,268, down
61 percent from its 1989 peak.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Rubin, the United States Treasury secretary, may
believe that the Japanese promises are substantive enough to
deserve a big-buck intervention. He may also think that the
measures needed to revive the country's comatose economy will be
taken. But others say the intervention was folly and that the yen
will once again descend.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to prop up the yen was a tactical error on the Treasury's
part, argues Andrew Smithers, president of the economic consulting
firm Smithers &AMP; Co. in London, because Japan's bureaucracy has
historically been antimarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese believe markets are there not to tell you bad
news, but to be manipulated so that you can alter the real world,''
Smithers said. By intervening, he contends, the Treasury has given
financial support to the antimarket elements within Japan's
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while dealing with bad bank loans is laudable, that
alone is not enough. Japan needs to raise its falling exports, a
strategy of which Japanese officials make no mention. In real, not
nominal terms, Japan's current account surplus fell from 3.76
percent of gross domestic product last December to 3.27 percent in
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because 45 percent of Japan's exports last year went to
now-decimated Asian countries, Tokyo must look elsewhere to sell
its goods. To compete in key markets like the United States and
Germany, however, the yen will have to fall, not rise, against the
dollar and the mark. Bolstering the yen just makes Japan's exports
more difficult to push.
</P>
<P>
   While world markets react warmly to Japanese promises, it's
worth remembering that these folks have been known to pledge one
thing and deliver another. Just last November, rumors swirled that
Yamaichi International, Japan's fourth-largest brokerage firm, was
near bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the firm's top-ranking executives came from Japan to meet
with officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New
York Stock Exchange. The executives assured the regulators that
Yamaichi, which had an American subsidiary, was solvent, and they
reiterated their commitment to the American markets.
</P>
<P>
   Not 10 days later, the firm petitioned Japan's Ministry of
Finance for permission to cease operations.

5 ATTRACTIONS FOR SUMMER JOY RIDING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Calif., Mo., Fla., N.J.)   (af)  
  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summertime blockbusters are not confined to movie theaters. To
entice repeat visits, amusement parks spend millions of dollars on
new thrill rides.
</P>
<P>
   This year, according to Amusement Business, which tracks the $8
billion industry, is a record one for roller coaster construction,
with nearly 80 being built worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The construction, said Tim O'Brien, an editor at the magazine
who focuses on theme parks, ``connotes a very positive attitude.
These parks are going forward knowing that the business is going to
be there.'' O'Brien cited five of the hottest new rides and
attractions. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE GREAT BEAR
</P>
<P>
   In Hershey, Pa., the state's first steel inverted roller coaster
is causing a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to scream as soon as they sit down. We don't even
have them buckled in yet,'' said Becca Combs, a ride operator at
the Great Bear, Hersheypark's newest attraction. The wait averages
an hour or more for a ride that lasts 175 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended from the track in overgrown car seats with their feet
dangling, riders are propelled into space at 58 miles an hour, as
if on a ski-lift gone berserk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enjoy your 124-foot drop,'' a recording intones. There's also
a 100-foot loop and a few barrel rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the effect is smooth, with no abrupt jolts or head
bumps. Many emerge weak-kneed, though, and with a new-found sense
of religion. ``I think I'm going to faint,'' said Lorie Sands, 41,
of Bloomsburg, Pa., who took her 15-year-old daughter on the ride. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Megan O'Matz &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RIDDLER'S REVENGE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To ride the loops and spirals of the Riddler's Revenge coaster
at Six Flags Magic Mountain, in Valencia, Calif., 40 miles north of
downtown Los Angeles, is to appreciate more sedate modes of
transportation _ like Southern California freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Tailgaters and kamikaze drivers seem harmless after you've been
tossed side to side and floated weightless during plunges on what
is billed as the world's tallest and fastest stand-up roller
coaster.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill ride begins with a 16-story incline, with spectacular
views of farmland. By the time the cars reach the crest, thoughts
shift to self-preservation: riders grip handholds, press against
backrests and plant feet to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The next two-and-a-half minutes are spent alternately lurching
along precipitous straightaways at 65 miles an hour, spinning in
corkscrews and gazing at the ground from the top of two loops.
</P>
<P>
   If a coaster is judged by headaches, lightheadedness and nausea,
then Riddler is a success. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Verne G. Kopytoff &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAMBA
</P>
<P>
   Cori Longfellow and Jenny Miller tried the Mamba roller coaster
at the Worlds of Fun park in Kansas City, Mo., ``so we could say we
did it.'' But the nearly three-minute, 75-mile-an-hour ride has
made them fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' said Ms. Longfellow, 27, a teacher from Fort
Riley, Kan. ``It takes so long to go up the first hill and then you
go down so fast you can't even scream.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost a minute, the coaster's car travels up, giving riders
the time to close their eyes, lift their arms and question their
sanity. After an agonizing pause, it plummets 205 feet before
climbing a second 184-foot hill.
</P>
<P>
   The second drop is followed by a 580-degree rotation _ more than
1{ full spins _ at 60 miles an hour, then five ``camel-back bumps''
to give riders ``air time,'' a sensation of negative gravity force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rush,'' Missie Brittain, 18, of Kansas City, said.
``You even forget to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Jilian Mincer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOURNEY TO ATLANTIS
</P>
<P>
   At Sea World in Orlando, Fla., a combined roller coaster and
water ride called Journey to Atlantis is an effort to recast the
park as something more than dolphin shows.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis is a pink palace 10 stories tall. As visitors await
their turn _ a 35-minute wait on a recent weekend _ they learn from
mock TV broadcasts that Atlantis has risen in the harbor of a Greek
fishing village. And the lost city is not only beautiful but also
inhabited by Allura, an evil spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Eight at a time, riders hop into roller cars done up as fishing
boats. The experience starts as a serene ride on a river past
scenes of village life, then shifts tempo as Allura takes control.
The plot line, however, is superfluous. What counts is the sheer
thrill of the attraction's final two minutes, when the real roller
coaster and water ride begins.
</P>
<P>
   The first 60-foot drop into the outside world is anticipated but
delightfully stomach-wrenching and soaking. It is followed by a
steep climb back into a candlelit cave.
</P>
<P>
   A second 60-foot plunge comes as a surprise, as the ``boat''
begins to fall in the dark. The ride ends with a flourish of fast
curves and splashes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BATMAN &AMP; ROBIN: THE CHILLER
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, Batman &AMP; Robin: The Chiller, at Six Flags Great
Adventure in Jackson, N.J., doesn't look like a big deal. Though 20
stories tall, The Chiller is dwarfed by The Great American Scream
Machine, whose white scaffolding dominates the park's skyline, and
lacks the ominous bulk of Batman: The Ride.
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared. The Chiller catapults riders to 70 miles an hour in
less than four seconds before shooting them 200 feet in the air
through a set of rolls and turns. The seven-ton trains are then
rocketed back to the gate in reverse, propelled by an
electromagnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiller is actually two rides. The icy blue Batman track
features four inversions; the Robin track, bright red, has six
rolls, to reflect the sidekick's youthful vigor. Each ride is 45
seconds long. &QL;

TEXANS COMMEMORATE JUNETEENTH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JO ANN ZUNIGA 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texans commemorated Juneteenth on Friday, marking the end of
slavery in the state with celebrations and educating children on
``healing spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest event in Houston remained the Juneteenth Freedom
Festival at Miller Outdoor Theater where a choir, bands and
barbecue attracted thousands despite high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   John Gorey, Miller's general manager, said the annual event
draws about 20,000. For the 25th year in a row, the National
Emancipation Association sponsored the event to commemorate June
19, 1865, when Union Gen. Gordon Granger read the Emancipation
Proclamation in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time blacks in Texas officially learned they
were citizens and not slaves, although President Lincoln signed the
Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863.
</P>
<P>
   News that the nation's slaves had been freed had reached the
Gulf Coast before 1865, but it was not until Granger's arrival that
Union soldiers were there to enforce it, according to Patricia
Prather, a local historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Sam Houston read an account of the proclamation in a
newspaper in 1862 even before President Lincoln signed it and
announced it to his slaves, freeing them,'' Prather said.
</P>
<P>
   Prather, who co-authored ``From Slave to Statesman: Legacy of
Joshua Houston, servant to Sam Houston,'' wrote an account of
Houston, in his Sunday best, making the announcement as both sides
broke down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they could not leave until the Union soldiers or the
Freedmen's Bureau came or they (freed slaves) would have been shot
down like dogs (by Confederacy supporters),'' Prather said.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent event of the Jasper killing of a black man by
three white men linked to white supremacy groups, Prather said
further education is still needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much has been suppressed about man's inhumanity to man. But if
we don't tell our children the truth, it's a disservice,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Julia C. Hester House in the Fifth Ward held a Juneteenth
celebration that included ``honoring of ancestors and elders and
healing spirits,'' an African tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The community center's senior citizens and and children from its
daycare and surrounding neighbors joined in the commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are recognizing the need for healing spirits as we recall
freedom from slavery and knowing what people went through before
us,'' said Sherri Clausell, the center's job developer.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony opened with a drum call and a senior adult and a
young child led the readings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of the celebration is education. It did not take
Texas two years to find out about the proclamation,'' Clausell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds dramatic. But the real deal was that it couldn't
happen until the Union came down with its troops to provide
protection.''

COMMENTARY: BOTH SIDES NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Double parentheses should be set as brackets.)  
(lb) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ I came here expecting to hear all about how
the Indian nuclear test was meant to cope with the Pakistani
threat. What I heard instead was Indians from across the political
spectrum insisting that their nuclear sound and light show on May
11 was actually meant to signal America and China that India views
their emerging ``alliance'' with great concern and will not let
these two powers carve up Asia without regard to India.
</P>
<P>
   Even those Indian politicians who denounce their nuclear tests
as a cheap, jingoistic maneuver by India's new Hindu nationalist
government, when you scratch them, will tell you these tests were
the only way for India to get what it wants most from the United
States and China: R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
</P>
<P>
   I finally realized the depth of this sentiment when I went to
see a saffron-robed Indian human-rights campaigner, Swami Agnivesh.
Surely, I thought, he will disavow this test. But no sooner did we
sit down on the floor of his simple Delhi house than he declared:
``We are India, the second-largest country in the world. You can't
just take us for granted. India doesn't feel threatened by
Pakistan, but in the whole international game India is being
marginalized by the China-U.S. axis.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as the Cold War was on, and the Soviets were in effect
protecting India against China, India did not feel an urgency to
develop its own nuclear weapon, notes Raja Mohan, strategic editor
of The Hindu newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But the Soviet collapse, coupled with U.S. pressure on India to
sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and not go nuclear, coupled
with the rise of China as an economic and military powerhouse, left
the Indians feeling they were on their own. Said Mohan: ``It was
clear that China had run ahead of us and they were being
incorporated as the world's No. 2 power and that we were being told
to stay in a small box, while the U.S. gave South Asia to China.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked India's defense minister, George Fernandes, what he
would say to President Clinton about the Indian tests, he answered:
``I would ask Bill Clinton why is it that you feel yourself so
close to China and you can trust China with nuclear weapons and you
can trust yourself with nuclear weapons and you can trust Russia,
France and Britain with nuclear weapons, but you cannot trust
India?''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes added: ``And now we have news that the U.S. and China,
during President Clinton's visit, will work out arrangements so
that their respective nuclear weapons will not be targeted on each
other. So the U.S. and China are settling their nuclear problems,
while we are obviously a nation that must not care for our own
security concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   India's former Foreign Secretary J.N. Dixit said to me: ``Your
government tolerates China no matter what it does. Whether it is
nuclear weapons tests or abuse of human rights, your government
says, `No, we cannot spoil relations with China.'''
</P>
<P>
   India's former Prime Minister I.K. Gujral _ a critic of India's
nuclear test _ elaborated: ``((Former U.S. Defense Secretary
William)) Perry went to Beijing and said China should take more
interest in South Asia. I asked myself: What is the purpose of
making this statement? Is it a division of areas of influence? If
you have decided that this side of Suez is an area of influence of
China, what should an Indian policy-maker do?''
</P>
<P>
   No American president has visited China in 20 years, added
Gujral, ``but Clinton doesn't mind going to China. ((What China
does in)) Tiananmen is all right, in Tibet is all right, in Taiwan
is all right. Everything ((China does)) is all right, but you
ignore our security concerns because we are poor and a non-nuclear
power. In your eyes either having a bomb or making money is what
matters. Well, money is very difficult to make. A bomb is not.''
</P>
<P>
   China, explained an Indian defense analyst, K. Subrahmanyam, is
the major rising power in the world, and when a major power like
China emerges, it needs to be counterbalanced. Russia balances
China from the north, Japan and Korea from the east, and now India
is doing it from the west and south. ``It is like embedding Germany
in NATO,'' he concluded. ``One day you will give us thanks for our
nuclear test.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of this makes sense, frankly, I don't know. But I do
know this: These views are widely shared here. And any U.S. policy
that ignores them, and just orders India to turn the clock back and
put its nuclear genie back in the bottle, is not going to work.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 21, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-ASIA-REVIEW _ No one then could imagine the kind of crisis
Asia faces today: economic meltdown. And if you listen closely to
the oratory of Washington before the most important foreign trip of
Bill Clinton's presidency, to China, things sound very different.
On Tuesday Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin took to the podium of
the White House to declare that ``China has been an island of
stability in Asia'' _ a savvy, responsible player in the global
effort to tamp out the economic firestorm that started in Asia a
year ago. And Japan? The view from Washington these days is that it
is spreading the bubonic plague of the markets _ wild instability _
and yet refuses to clean up its act. By David E. Sanger. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WORKPLACE-REVIEW _ These days, it seems people are trying to be
all they can and must be at the office, as the workplace has become
an increasingly popular but elusive spot to look for meaning and
fulfillment in life. It's fine to take the road less traveled, as
long as it means finding a less-congested route to get to the
office earlier. By Adam Bryant. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIANA-DEATH-REVIEW _ Eight months have passed since the Princess
of Wales died in what the French authorities have called a
straightforward car crash. But their flat assertions that it was
merely an accident have only encouraged theorists, who are still
busily inventing wacky stories. By Sarah Lyall. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ENTOURAGE-REVIEW _ The horde accompanying President
Clinton to China this week will number more than 1,000 people. The
presidential entourage and its paraphernalia fill four passenger
planes and several large C-141 military transports. By John
Broder. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASPIAN-OIL-REVIEW _ Halfway around the world, where the
Caucasus meets the Middle East, a rush is on to exploit what could
prove to be the world's richest oil bonanza. The Caspian is a
California-size body of saltwater _ the world's largest landlocked
body of water _ that may sit on as much as 200 billion barrels and
16 percent of the Earth's potential oil reserves. Even at today's
low prices, that could add up to $3 trillion in oil. By Elaine
Sciolino. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-PHONES-REVIEW _ The dream of an African renaissance is
all the rage these days on the continent, but without better
telecommunications it will be as hard to spread wealth and
democracy as it would have been for Florence and Chartres to spread
Renaissance culture without the old Roman roads. Only about 1 in
300 people in sub-Saharan Africa has a phone, making the financial
opportunities huge. By Donald G. McNeil Jr. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-WATCHDOG-REVIEW _ Midway through a news story about Steven
Brill's arrival as the newest major-domo in the booming industry of
media criticism, Howard Kurtz, a respected practitioner himself for
The Washington Post, suddenly found it necessary to open
parentheses confessionally in noting: ``The founder of Brill's
Content (to which this reporter is to be an occasional contributor)
could not be reached for comment.'' It was a moment of comic relief
badly needed by the Fourth Estate, run ragged these past five
months in its coverage of the allegations of sex and mendacity at
the Clinton White House. Here was the media watchdog watch turning
into a shimmering house of mirrors, with one watchdog sniffing out
the latest watchdog while properly noting the crisscross of
commercial interests at work in all the watching. By Francis X.
Clines. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COP-SUICIDE-REVIEW _ It happens dozens of times each year during
jittery hostage dramas and routine traffic stops: desperate people
lure police officers into shooting them in a phenomenon that has
come to be known in law-enforcement circles as suicide by cop.
There are no hard statistics showing the frequency of such
incidents, but experts estimate that up to 10 percent of the
roughly 600 fatal police shootings that occur in an average year
are caused by people actively seeking to die. By Alan Feuer. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO-REVIEW _ Republicans can usually win when they can
position themselves as the guardians of low taxes and small
government. By the same token, Democrats have the advantage when
they can frame an issue as one involving the protection of
children. The tobacco bill, the most ambitious measure before
Congress this year, lay across that political fault line. By David
E. Rosenbaum. &QL;

PRISON AMPLIFIES RACIAL BIAS, VIOLENCE 

</HEADLINE>

and ALLAN TURNER 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE _ Tim had been in prison less than 48 hours when he
was first approached by another convict hoping to make the
baby-faced teen-ager his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stuck a whole bunch of holes in him, and word got out that
this white boy took out a (black man),'' said Tim, using a racial
slur.
</P>
<P>
   Tim, now a 30-year-old parolee who asked that his last name be
withheld, talked about how he stabbed the other convict with a
handmade knife, a ``shank'' in prison lingo. In a terse,
matter-of-fact tone filled with vulgarities, he described the rage
that builds behind bars in the nation's second-largest prison
system and explained what drives some felons to join gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the white guys that are solid,'' he said. ``They are the
most dangerous, because they are the most violent in the system.
They'll kill in a heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   His words are chilling for the hatred they portend and their
frightening similarity to the types of racial epithets that
relatives and longtime acquaintances of Russell Brewer and Bill
King say those young men learned in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer and King, along with a third man, Shawn Berry, are
charged with murder in the savage dragging death two weeks ago of
James Byrd Jr. of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Byrd, a 49-year-old black man, was beaten and chained
to the bumper of a pickup, then dragged almost three miles along a
winding, bumpy back road by the three white suspects. Byrd's head
and right arm were torn off in the process.
</P>
<P>
   And while many who know Brewer and King say the pair never
exhibited any overt racial prejudices before they did hard time in
Texas prisons, Jasper and federal authorities have labeled the
gruesome killing a racially motivated hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Buentello, the chief expert on prison gangs for the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice, said that none of the men had
so-called ``badges,'' prison terminology for gang-related tattoos,
when they entered prison. (The TDCJ routinely inventories incoming
prisoners for tattoos.)
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who gave police a detailed confession in the Byrd case,
implicating Brewer and King as the main culprits, still has no
visible tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   But photographs provided by Jasper officials after their arrests
show that Brewer and King both have tattoos indicating membership
in the Ku Klux Klan and the white supremacist Confederate Knights
of America, Buentello said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't know if Brewer and King got the tattoos in
prison or after their release, but that both men were monitored
while they were at the Beto I Unit in Tennessee Colony for possible
membership in the KKK and CKA.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Brewer and King learned to hate other races while in
prison may never be known. But what happens behind bars that can
turn even previously unremarkable petty criminals into killers so
calloused that the viciousness of the crime is unfathomable?
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost have to live in a cell block to understand,'' said
Chuck, a 55-year-old parolee who also asked that his last name be
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Buentello identifies 10 major gangs operating inside Texas
prisons, including the Aryan Brotherhood, with about 425 members;
the Mexican Mafia, the largest with an estimated membership of more
than 1,400; the Texas Syndicate, another Hispanic group whose
membership is estimated at 800; and the predominantly black Bloods,
with about 170 members, and Crips, with about 660 members. In all,
Buentello estimates that 4,900 Texas convicts belong to gangs, less
than 4 percent of the 140,000 state prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't even count the groups in which King and Brewer
were believed involved. TDCJ doesn't classify KKK, CKA and Aryan
Circle _ all white supremacy organizations _ as gangs. Nor does it
count many street gangs, whose members may loosely organize behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   But such inmates and groups are monitored. A group does not
become a gang, according to TDCJ, unless it has a written
constitution or rules and engages in violent prison activities.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say three crucial federal court rulings in the 1970s and
1980s created the climate for rampant development of gangs and
similar groups. Those are the 1976 Guajardo case which resulted in
a ruling that allowed gang members at different prisons to freely
write each other; the 1979 LaMar ruling that desegregated prison
cells, exacerbating the racial tensions common in prisons
everywhere; and a 1982 court order in the Ruiz prison reform
lawsuit which abolished the building tender system.
</P>
<P>
   Building tenders _ usually older, white inmates _ functioned as
guards and spies. They maintained the social order among felons
through intimidation and coercion, and snitching on lower-ranking
inmates. When TDCJ could not hire additional guards fast enough to
keep the order that the old building tenders had, gangs sprang up
to fill the void, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck and Tim _ as well as prison administrators, lawyers and
criminologists _ say fear, along with a need for family, is a
primary reason prisoners join gangs.
</P>
<P>
   There is the fear of being raped, beaten or killed; of being
locked away for years or your entire life; of casting your eyes the
wrong way; of not learning fast enough the appropriate prison body
language _ the stature that says you're neither submissive nor
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   That fear, combined with crowded living conditions among
thousands of criminals who already have shown an inability to abide
by society's rules, gives rise to rage. Normally minor irritations,
such as the volume of a radio or the choice of a TV show, are
quickly amplified into major affronts, Chuck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all this damn noise going on, there's nothing good
happening to you and nothing to look forward to,'' Tim says. ``So
you sit up there and scheme and hate. And hatred is going to breed
hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned his hatred primarily toward blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hated them,'' he said. ``There were just too damn
many of them. You come to hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hated them,'' he said. ``There were just too damn
many of them. You come to hate them.''...
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He insists he was not prejudiced when he entered prison, but
learned to hate there. Despite his continued use of racial slurs,
Tim said he has overcome that hatred, thanks in part to intensive
peer counseling, in the 20 months he has been out.
</P>
<P>
   That racial hatred is not an uncommon reaction, according to
University of Houston criminologist Beth Pelz, a former inmate
counselor in the Texas prisons who extensively researched prison
gangs for her doctoral dissertation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like everyone's sitting in their cells and looking at
their feet and saying, `Gosh, I hate African-Americans or blacks,'
or `I hate Hispanics or whatever,' '' she said. ``Because in
reality they get along some of the time quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   But circumstances in prison are magnified, she said. When people
are looking for someone to blame, whether in prison or not, the
tendency is to point the finger at people who are different.
</P>
<P>
   And in prison, where blacks make up the largest group, white
inmates, who perceive they have lost social status because they are
suddenly a racial minority, the blame is often placed on blacks,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to TDCJ figures for 1997, African-American felons made
up 45 percent of the inmate population, 28 percent were Anglos and
27 percent were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   A 1979 inmate lawsuit supports the notion that some inmates, at
least at that time, believed that black convicts had favored
status.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed by white inmates at the Ramsey Unit, alleged
that the federal court order desegregating the prisons gave blacks
``exclusive privilege and favorable consideration in all aspects of
institutional rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also alleged that offenders, regardless of color
or ``personal tastes, characteristics, vocabulary, humor, behavior
or language'' were crowded together into small cells or dormitories
where racial and personal conflicts are aggravated and often flare
into violence and that ``fractious militants'' of ethnic groups
frequently fight and that blacks rape white prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said officials could not
readily determine what happened to that lawsuit but suspect it
``just went away.'' Besides, Fitzgerald said, the Ruiz lawsuit
addressed those concerns, forbidding inmates to be put in charge of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Pelz believes that the problems and perceived injustices in
prison are ``due to sheer numbers and the lack of liberty and the
deprivations of being in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then when you look around and the majority of the people,
or the people you see the most, are different from you, you begin
to say, `It's your fault.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Irrational, yes, parolee Tim said, but no less real. And ex-cons
have a difficult time ridding themselves of that rage once they are
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get out, you're mad as hell,'' Tim said. Both he and
Chuck say that rage starts boiling over outside prison when
parolees can't find a job or a place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Pelz, though, believes that gang affiliation has a lot to do
with inmates' backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The particular groups they tend to be involved with have a lot
to do with their attitudes and values before they got to prison,''
she said. ``There was a time when most of the gang members in Texas
prisons were gang members who had joined in prison. But now the
street gang members who are being incarcerated actually outnumber
what we were historically calling prison gang members.''
</P>
<P>
   While white supremacist gangs and groups like the Aryan
Brotherhood form along ideological lines, others tend to organize
for criminal activity purposes, and in prison that means
trafficking in drugs, tobacco products, sex and other illegal
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current focus on white supremacy groups as a result
of the Jasper case, prison gangs today _ unlike the mid-1980s when
violence was at a peak _ tend to co-exist in a tense truce,
according to some current inmate-members of the mostly black Crips.
</P>
<P>
   The prison world they know is a finely tuned balance of terror,
where ``respect'' is the key to multiple gangs co-existing as each
nurtures its behind-bars market in cigarettes, drugs and other
contraband.
</P>
<P>
   Crips members, who did not want to be identified, note that even
white supremacist groups like the Aryan Brotherhood generally
refrain from collective attacks on blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they respect us, we respect them,'' one Crip said. ``It's
when they disrespect us that trouble begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison gangs have a de facto negotiation system to defuse
potential conflicts, black gang members said. If members of rival
gangs tangle over a personal issue, in theory the isolated
combatants are permitted to resolve their differences without gang
interference.
</P>
<P>
   But violence often strikes like lightning. Diplomacy fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this white jump on a black,'' said a 23-year-old
Houston man serving 10 years for aggravated assault with a deadly
weapon. ``So we acted. We stabbed him. I don't remember exactly how
many were involved _ 15, 20. That was in Beto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we don't have time (to figure things out), we just
shove off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, all told, I've seen a dozen riots, whites, blacks,
all,'' said a 22-year-old Houston man who has served six years of a
20-year term for murder. ``There will be 20 or more, hitting,
stabbing. It depends on the gang and what started the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Another gang member, a 24-year-old Houston man doing time for
aggravated assault, recalled a riot at a San Antonio prison in
which at least 40 inmates, some armed with locks and improvised
knives, fought a bloody battle over a pair of contraband dice.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Crips agree they would die for their gang,
and some would be willing to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically it's a person looking for love,'' the 23-year-old
said. ``My mother died, my father died, my auntie did everything
she could for me. But the Crips offered love. That's the gang
appeal. That's why just about everybody joins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had open arms.''

 &HT;    Trial by fire

<P>
   WALDO, Fla. -- Jim Hooten stood under the 100-year-old oak trees
that tower over his modest wood frame house, watching a wall of
orange flames rage through the dense stand of pines that grows
nearly to his back door.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, he feared, his house and all he had worked for
would be gone, consumed by the latest wave of wildfires that have
swept across nearly 50,000 acres of bone-dry Florida the past
month. Scattered showers Thursday night and Friday weakened the
fires but did little to end the dangerous drought conditions.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, the fires in 34 of Florida's 67 counties had
destroyed about 12,000 acres of timber worth an estimated $10
million, injured at least 14 people and killed one person, damaged
about 80 buildings and 65 vehicles, and left at least 1,000 people
temporarily homeless . Across the line in Georgia, wildfires had
burned another 13,600 acres, including an estimated $14 million
worth of timber, near the Okefenokee Swamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were standing right here when we decided it was getting too
close and we had to get out,'' said Hooten, 62, a tall,
leather-faced ex-deputy sheriff. ``I was thinking, `That's a
lifetime of work going to hell in a handbasket.'''
</P>
<P>
   A half-mile away, Tammy Nichols and several other members of a
Florida Division of Forestry firefighting team were working
frantically to make sure that didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 10 tractors on it,'' said Richard Eastman, the team's
supervisor, who has 34 years of firefighting experience. ``We just
kept cutting lines, moving back and cutting lines.''
</P>
<P>
   A mile away from the firefighters at Waldo City Hall, Mayor
Louie Davis, City Councilmember Rodney Estes and City Manager Lee
Vincent came to the sobering realization that the fire just might
consume their entire town, burning the homes and businesses of the
1,100 residents.
</P>
<P>
   It was Wednesday afternoon, and they had just ordered the second
evacuation of Waldo in as many days. Fortunately, most of the
residents on the side of town nearest the blaze heeded the warnings
and left. Most went to stay with family or friends or to motels in
nearby Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   They got out just in time.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 p.m., winds were gusting out of the southwest at nearly 20
mph. The fire was raging dangerously close to a half-dozen
residences, and if it managed to cross a paved road on the town's
outskirts, quaint, sleepy Waldo would likely burn to cinders. The
flames would be fueled by the clapboards of the town's rustic,
wood-sided homes and the hardwood trees that shadow its streets.
``I walked outside and the heavy smoke was right over there,'' said
Vincent, pointing from the sidewalk in front of the modest brick
storefront that serves as City Hall. ``What worried me most was the
smoke was coming right over City Hall. That meant the fire was
coming right at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Davis and a few others hopped in a car and drove toward
the billowing column of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several houses there that when we went past, we
were pretty sure there was no way they could be saved,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hooten thought the same thing as he jammed his pickup into gear
and headed up his dusty driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have given you a quarter that this house would
still be standing,'' he said. ``Not a quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, Waldo survived.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted fire crews redoubled their efforts. The wind shifted a
little bit. The scorching sun, which has dried the state
relentlessly through three nearly rainless months, dipped into the
haze of smoke surrounding Waldo and raced to the horizon. As it
dropped, temperatures inched down from the 100-degree mark. As the
land cooled ever so slightly, a bit of moisture crept back into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hard work of the firefighters, a little shift in
the wind and a little bit of luck,'' Davis said the next day.
``That, and the Good Lord smiled on us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been an odd weather year for Waldo. All winter, the town
was inundated by unusually heavy rains. Flooding hit a few homes,
tore up some roads, and caused major problems at the wastewater
treatment plant. Waldo was part of a federal disaster relief
declaration for the flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Now it may be named a disaster area again, this time for fire
damage caused by drought. It's all been a little more excitement
than folks are accustomed to in Waldo, but a smalltown politeness
has prevailed. ``I've answered hundreds of phone calls and not one
person has been ugly,'' said Gail Monahan, who is married to Estes
and volunteered to staff City Hall during the crisis. ``They all
ask if their house is okay, and when I tell them `Yes,' they
immediately say, `Tell all the firefighters thank you, thank you so
much.' Small towns do pull together.''
</P>
<P>
   For hours on end, Monahan and others kept answering the
telephones. The calls came from people they know by name and
face_residents kept out because the fire danger was still too high.
</P>
<P>
   Some left behind pets and were worried the animals hadn't been
fed. Estes, a high school economics teacher, volunteered to go to
the houses in question to feed and water the pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to turn the air-conditioning on for one lady,'' he said.
``She took her dogs, but forgot she left her birds at home in a
cage. She was worried they would get too hot.''
</P>
<P>
   After 36 non-stop hours, the City Hall crew was exhausted but
giddy from adrenaline and the town's near-miss. Vincent figures he
slept about five or six hours total on Tuesday and Wednesday
nights. Tuesday he got home for a few hours before returning at
dawn Wednesday. Wednesday night he slept in Police Chief D.W.
Smith's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned off the phones in there and slept on a little pad
about an inch thick,'' he said. ``I finally took all the money out
of my pocket because I kept rolling over on it and waking myself
up.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fireline, Tammy Nichols and her team members didn't sleep
at all. They came on duty Wednesday morning and went straight
through until Thursday morning when they finally got a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' said Nichols, 31, a Florida forest ranger
the past 10 years. ``The flames were up to the top of the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols drives a bulldozer, cutting fire lines to try to stop
the flames from advancing. She wears a fire-retardant jumpsuit over
her pants and T-shirt, along with a hard-hat, a face shield and
heavy leather gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the flames jumped the fire breaks they were trying to
cut through the parched undergrowth. Bulldozers bogged down, even
threw a heavy metal track. Mechanics had to brave the flames to
repair the machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just moving too fast,'' Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols and the other forest service firefighters carry a
folded-up fire safety tent made of a space-age aluminum-foil type
material. If the fire engulfs them, they are supposed to jump off
their 'dozers, run back into the fire line they've cut and
hopefully find a spot where the fire has already passed. Then they
break out the tent and jump inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had to do it, `` Nichols said. ``We just try to be
real careful. I have a four-year-old daughter. I try to think about
her when I'm out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hebb, a forestry division district manager, ambled over to
the crew, who were gathered around a pickup waiting for a van to
carry them home for a few hours' rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want y'all to know how much people appreciate what
y'all have been doing,'' he told the firefighters, who stood in a
loose circle, their faces and clothes as dirty as frolicsome
children's. There was plenty of confirmation of that at the Hooten
house.
</P>
<P>
   The fire raged through the 40 acres of pine trees that Jim
Hooten was hoping to harvest in a few years as a nice addition to
his retirement income. It burned up a feed shed and two barns full
of farm equipment, antiques and family heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   But the family home still stands, untouched, a black fire line
still smoldering in the pines that march to within 20 feet of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never believed those boys would save that house,'' Hooten
said. ``They were spraying it down with foam when I left . . . I

 &HT;    Fireworks sale lights Florida officials fire
 &HT;    By Mary Lou Pickel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- With the county as dry as a tinder box
and north Florida up in smoke, Palm Beach County fire officials are
warily eyeing the start of the state's 16-day roadside fireworks
sale season, which starts today.
</P>
<P>
   Residents should realize that setting off fireworks is illegal
and could start a blaze, Palm Beach County Fire Marshall Jim Sweat
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a spark away from being another Flagler County,''
Sweat said, referring to the wildfires that have ravaged northern
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County firefighters have fought 52 brush fires in the
last two weeks, up from last year's average of 31, fire officials
said. Sweat has banned open burns in the county during the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And Jacksonville's mayor has banned all fireworks, saying the
risk is too great.
</P>
<P>
   Places such as The Acreage, the Palm Beach Ranchettes and other
areas close to undeveloped lands worry Sweat most because they
could burn if a forest fire heads east.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from caution and common sense, a new county rule seeks to
increase safety by clamping down on who buys and sells fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules:
</P>
<P>
   __ Customers must fill out a notarized affidavit swearing the
fireworks are for legal reasons, which include: quarrying, military
uses, shooting cap guns at sporting events, scaring birds from a
farm or fish hatchery and making signals at a railroad crossing.
</P>
<P>
   __ Vendors must post a $5,000 bond per site, up to a maximum of
$20,000 total, to cover any fines and costs of prosecution. The
county will return the money after the season ends on July 5 if the
vendor has obeyed the law.
</P>
<P>
   __ Vendors also must get a permit that shows they've been
inspected by the fire marshal, are registered with the state and
only sell permitted goods.
</P>
<P>
   Penalities for customers and vendors who break the rules are a
$500 fine and 60 days in jail or both.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies will patrol the 40-odd tents and two
wholesale fireworks stores in the county, looking for lawbreakers,
sheriff's Capt. Ed Bieluch said. It's illegal for most people to
buy firecrackers, county attorneys said, but that hasn't stopped
vendors from selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Tent vendors never have been allowed to sell fireworks _ things
that explode in the air such as Roman candles, torpedoes or bottle
rockets _ county attorneys said. Tents are only supposed to sell
sparklers.
</P>
<P>
   Stores can sell firecrackers because they have better fire
safety equipment and climate control, Chief Assistant County
Attorney Andrew McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat expects some problems with the rules because only a
handful of vendors have applied for permits so far.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, officials didn't expect that 84 stores such as Wal-Mart
and Sam's Club also would have to fill out permits. Sweat's office
sent packages to those stores last week. ``I haven't been off the
phone since then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat says he may have to give a little leeway to those who are
trying to comply because the rules are so new. But he plans to
pursue those who make no effort.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks vendor John Hunnewell, president of Loxahatchee-based
Paradise Farms, said he doesn't plan to follow the rules and has
sued the county, instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pathetic, every year you gotta file a new lawsuit because
they can't interpret a state statute correctly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunnewell said he plans to open three fireworks tents this year.
The average tent owner makes about $4,000 the week before the
Fourth of July, he said, but sales can reach as much as $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Phantom Fireworks manager Ira Schwartz said he has done
everything to comply with the law, including hiring notaries public
to notarize the affidavits that customers must sign, and adding a
copying machine to keep the records, as the rules require.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running a safe place and we're going to follow this law
and we feel everyone else should too,'' Schwartz said.

 &HT;    No green light: Talks between GM and UAW at a stand still
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers
headed into the weekend with no signs of resolving two parts-plant
strikes that have wiped out 90 percent of the automaker's
production and idled one-third of GM's Miami Valley work force.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes that began June 5 and 11 in Flint, Mich., have shut
down 23 of GM's 30 North American assembly plants and idled about
6,200 workers in the Dayton area at five local plants. Parts
shortages from the strikes have led to the layoff of about 110,000
workers, or about one third of GM's North American work force. More
GM suppliers also furloughed employees and closed factories Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As the impact widened, President Clinton urged the union and the
world's largest automaker to settle their disputes. GM Chief
Executive John F. Smith Jr. said the company wants a quick
resolution but it has to keep GM competitive. So far, neither side
seems willing to compromise as GM pushes to cut costs and the union
digs in to save jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having some dialogue but we're hearing the same
rhetoric,'' said Duane Zuckschwerdt, president of UAW Local 659,
which represents 5,800 workers on strike at a Flint metal-stamping
plant.
</P>
<P>
   With GM headed for a regular two-week shutdown on June 29, the
strike probably will last into at least mid-July, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the strikes caused about 1,400 more GM workers to be
laid off on Friday, including 1,200 more GM's Kettering suspension
parts plant.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 6,000 Dayton-area GM workers have been idled
by the Flint walkouts. Those layoffs include 3,900 at the Moraine
truck assembly plant; 1,250 at the Kettering plant; 526 at two
Dayton brake plants; 247 at GM's Vandalia air bag plant; and 115 at
the Delphi Chassis plant on Home Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The walkouts at GM's Flint Metal Center and an instrument panel
and engine-parts plant are costing the company an estimated $60
million a day in pretax profits. The halt to GM's production has
trimmed 0.3 percentage points off the U.S. economy's second-quarter
growth rate, according to First Chicago NBD economist Diane Swonk.
</P>
<P>
   GM shares fell 2 1/16 to 67 1/2. The stock has slipped 11
percent from the day before the first strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting increasingly nervous about the ultimate
impact of the strikes,'' said James Drury, fixed income analyst at
Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   GM's 8,000 U.S. dealers, meanwhile, are bracing for vehicle
shortages that may last through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   GM's virtual halt to the production of light trucks, among its
most profitable vehicles, poses an especially big problem as it
comes in the middle of the peak selling season, according to
several GM dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said in a commencement address at Flint's Kettering
University, the former General Motors Institute, that GM is
``committed to reaching a settlement as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the company must have an agreement that allows
it to meeting the demands ``of this changing marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the Friday, the only major GM assembly plants
operating were the Saturn car factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee, a
small-car plant in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, and sports car factory in
Ste. Therese, Quebec.

JAPAN QUIETLY NERVOUS AT CLINTON PASS-BY DURING CHINA TRIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ If Japanese leaders listen carefully Thursday afternoon,
they may hear the jets of Air Force One whisking President Clinton
high above their island nation, straight to his state visit in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Government and business leaders in Tokyo will wonder nervously,
as a senior Japanese diplomat put it: ``Has `Japan-bashing' turned
into 'Japan-passing?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision not to stop here going to or coming from his
nine-day sojourn in China has fed fears that the United States may
be ready to dilute its close, 50-year post-World War II
relationship with the richest and most developed nation in Asia in
favor of the strategic allure of the world's most populous country
and its vast economic potential.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration brushes aside any Japanese concern,
pointing to the plan to send Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
to Tokyo from China for consultations and the state visit of
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to Washington next month.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat, however, called the Hashimoto trip a
``consolation prize'' arranged after it became evident that the
Japanese government privately was irked at Clinton stiffing Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has lodged no official complaint, but as another Western
diplomat explained: ``There's nothing they can do about Clinton's
schedule, and they do not want to lose face by complaining
publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of President Nixon's dramatic overture to China
in the early 1970s, which the Japanese did not learn about until
moments before the public announcement, there has been concern that
Tokyo might again be left in the dark on U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some top Japanese foreign policy analysts believe the
Clinton administration has decided that China, more than Japan, is
the key to preserving both economic and political stability in the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of thinking certainly exists in the U.S. government
and with a good deal of influence,'' said Takashi Inoguchi, an
Asian affairs specialist at Tokyo University. He said, however, he
was not convinced it was the governing thought at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's man in Tokyo, Ambassador Tom Foley, the former House
speaker, has spoken out strongly against the view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not true. Not true,'' said Foley when questioned at a public
speech in Tokyo last month. ``Let me make the statement again as
strongly as I can.
</P>
<P>
   Japan in the 21st century will remain our close partner and ally
above all other countries in the region, and not China or any other
country.''
</P>
<P>
   On the record, Japan is taking the Clinton visit to China
stoically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improvement of U.S.-China relations would be helpful and
beneficial to peace and stability of the whole world, as well as
the Asian-Pacific region,'' said Shigekazu Sato, director of China
and Mongolian affairs at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, it's another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine days!'' exclaimed a Japanese government official. ``How
can he afford to spend so much time? It's like a vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   That view does not surprise some experienced Asia analysts in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese like to be victims,'' said Bruce Stokes,
Washington-based senior fellow with the Council on Foreign
Relations. ``They can say, (the United States and China) are
ganging up on us; this is our worst fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has visited Japan twice during his five-plus years in
office, and a White House official contended that the president's
trip to China was of historic significance because it will be the
first by a U.S. head of state to China since the pro-democracy
demonstrators were killed by Chinese army troops in Tiananmen
Square nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of a Clinton visit was complicated by former President
Carter, who during a visit to Tokyo in March said he expected
Clinton to stop in the Japanese capital on the way home from China.
A U.S. diplomatic source contended Carter voiced an assumption
without having spoken to the administration about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese leaders are further galled that Clinton's ``no side
trips'' itinerary seems to have been dictated by the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials had expressed a desire that Clinton's visit be
seen as precisely equal to their president's trip to the United
States last year, on which Jiang Zemin did not visit another
country. But China is also never sorry to see a little friction
between Washington and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese diplomat said that not only do Beijing and Tokyo have
ongoing differences _ including broad nuclear nonproliferation
questions as well as territorial disputes about islands in the East
China Sea _ but that the relationship remains ``under a shadow''
since Japan's occupation of much of China in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Also in dispute is Japan's request for a permanent seat on the
U.N. Security Council, a body on which China _ one of the five
full-time, veto-wielding members _ is not anxous to see another
Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes noted that Clinton's bypassing Japan on the upcoming
Asian trip is part of a ``convoluted'' situation, especially in
light of the current Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to stop, it would be incumbent on him to
publicly urge Hashimoto's government to take additional steps to
reinvigorate Japan's economy _ now judged by most international
analysts to be in recession for the first time in almost 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's gross domestic product, which accounts for more than
half of Asia's GDP, shrank at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the
quarter ending in March _ the second consecutive quarter of
contraction.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Japanese central bankers took the unusual step of
intervening in the currency exchange markets last week to bolster
the sliding yen.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese will be watching closely for any attempt by the
Chinese to rope Clinton into badmouthing Tokyo's recent economic
efforts, either in a joint statement or by a Chinese leader making
a public comment that it might be difficult for Clinton to
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Such an occurrence would be ``perceived as a poke in the eye to
Tokyo,'' Stokes said.
</P>
<P>
   Inoguchi said there ``some concern that Clinton might be drawn
into the Chinese stragem,'' and that ``if the two countries start
singing a song that is anti-Japan, it will not be welcome.

CARLOS CASTANEDA, MYSTICAL WRITER, DIES AT 72 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga.)  (lb) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Castaneda, whose best-selling explorations of mystical
and pharmacological frontiers helped to define the psychological
landscape of the 1960s, died two months ago just as privately and
secretly as he had lived, associates revealed this week. Befitting
a man who made an aesthetic out of mystery, even his age is
uncertain, but he was believed to be 72.
</P>
<P>
   He died of liver cancer on April 27 at his home in Los Angeles,
said Deborah Drooz, an entertainment lawyer, friend of Castaneda
and executor of his estate. She said he had suffered from the
illness for at least 10 months. After his death, his body was
cremated and the remains were sent to Mexico, she added.
</P>
<P>
   In books like ``The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of
Knowledge,'' Castaneda spun extraordinarily rich, hallucinogenic
evocations of ancient paths to knowledge based on what he described
as an extended apprenticeship with a Yaqui Indian shaman named Don
Juan Matus.
</P>
<P>
   His 10 books, etched in layer upon layer of psychological nuance
and intrigue, became international best sellers translated into 17
languages and were credited with helping to usher in the New Age
sensibility and reviving interest in Indian and Southwestern
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, scholars and critics have debated whether Don
Juan existed and whether the books were anthropology or fantasy,
fact or fiction, distinctions which no doubt amused Castaneda.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than respond, he lived in almost total anonymity,
refusing to make public appearances, or to be photographed or
tape-recorded. He continued to write up to his death and wanted his
death to remain as private as his life, Ms. Drooz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times reported his death on Thursday after it
was revealed by an Atlanta man who said he was Castaneda's son. He
said he heard about the death when he learned of probate
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos Castaneda was a very impeccable man,'' Ms. Drooz said.
``Everything he wanted done he made clear to the very end, and to
the very end he never remotely suggested he wanted an epitaph or a
eulogy or a press release about this death. He spend his life
eschewing media coverage and those around him respected that and
allowed him to pass peacefully without attention. It was no secret.
It just didn't seem appropriate to make a fuss.''
</P>
<P>
   But C.J. Castaneda, 36, who owns a coffee shop in suburban
Atlanta, and his mother, Castaneda's former wife, Margaret Runyan
Castaneda, both say they are skeptical of that account and question
why Castaneda's death certificate said he was never married and why
news of his death was kept from them.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Castaneda, who said they were married from 1960 to 1973,
said Castaneda was not her son's biological father but he had the
boy's birth certificate changed legally to say that he was the
boy's father. Ms. Drooz said Carlos Castaneda was estranged from
C.J. Castaneda, and the younger man was not his son.
</P>
<P>
   The death certificate lists a niece, Talia Bey, who is president
of Cleargreen Inc., which organizes seminars based on Castaneda's
teachings. A hearing on Castaneda's estate, which benefits from
enormous worldwide sales of his books, is to be held on July 2 in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   If confusion follows in the wake of Castaneda's death, it would
be consistent with the story of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda had said that he was born on Dec. 25, 1931, in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, and that Castaneda was an adopted surname.
Immigration records indicate that he was born on Dec. 25, 1925, in
Cajamarca, Peru, and Castaneda was his given name.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the United States in 1951 and was an obscure graduate
student in anthropology when he sent off a manuscript in 1967 to
the University of California Press in Los Angeles. The book was
released as ``The Teachings of Don Juan'' in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   After its paperback rights were resold, it became an
international best seller. In the book, in encounters at once
fanciful and intellectually and psychologically challenging, Don
Juan instructs his disciple about becoming a ``man of knowledge''
in ways that ``clash disconcertingly with our prevailing scientific
conception of reality,'' as Theodore Roszak put it in a review in
The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   As the book begins, Don Juan instructs his pupil through the use
of hallucinogenic drugs but as the book goes on, drugs are less a
part of the learning process.
</P>
<P>
   His second book, ``A Separate Reality: Further Conversations
with Don Juan,'' continues the education process, this time
focusing on the nature of sorcery. The third volume of the Don Juan
books, ``Journey to Ixtlan: The Lessons of Don Juan,'' is the most
personal of the three, focusing on what Castaneda has learned. A
review in Book World called it ``one of the most important
statements of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   The books made Castaneda an international celebrity, featured on
the cover of Time. But many of his later books received cooler
reviews. In The New York Times Book Review, Margot Adler described
``The Power of Silence: Further Lessons of Don Juan'' as ``an
unnecessarily cloudy pathway to the world of dreams and altered
states.''
</P>
<P>
   And his career was clouded almost from the beginning by the
controversy over whether Don Juan even existed or whether Castaneda
was, as one critic put it, ``one of the great intellectual
hoaxers'' of all time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   Castaneda insisted that Don Juan was real. But others have said
that, real or not, the books stand on their own both as windows
onto the spiritual currents of the '60s and as part of a long
tradition of vivid intellectual and spiritual quests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important question we can ask is not, `Can Juan Matus
be located in 1977 in Sonora, Mexico?' wrote Sam Keen in Psychology
Today. ``It is rather: ``What does Don Juan tell us about
ourselves, about the millions in this country and abroad, who have
read his words in 11 languages?' As an archetypical hero, Don Juan
may reveal to us something about the contours of the collective
unconscious and the longings of our time.''

SWISS BANKS' OFFER TO SETTLE HOLOCAUST CLAIMS IS REJECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Switzerland's three biggest commercial banks Friday
made a public offer of $600 million to settle claims from Holocaust
victims who have charged that their families' assets were stolen.
Jewish leaders immediately rejected the offer as ``humiliating,''
and said negotiations had broken down.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland
stopped short of saying that the offer was final, but in a
statement insisted they ``would not entertain unfounded and
excessive demands for payments above this amount.'' In addition,
they said, they would pay out any amounts that an independent
auditing group, led by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, determined was left in long-dormant bank accounts. While
that figure is a mystery, some Jewish groups believe it will total
hundreds of millions of dollars, once inflation since the 1940s is
taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown in talks which led to Friday's announcement raises
the likelihood that top officials in states and cities around the
United States, led by New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, could
declare a boycott of the Swiss-owned commercial banks _ and their
Wall Street subsidiaries _ when they meet July 1.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the disagreements highlighted Friday, this is a case
that both sides have an incentive to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups fear that if a class action lawsuit against the
banks proceeds in federal court, the issue will not be settled for
years, after many of the aging victims of the Holocaust have died.
The banks, for their part, desperately want to avoid a suit in U.S.
courts that will involve a lengthy discovery process _ which would
force into the public arena long-secret documents detailing the
banks' dealings with the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss government is opposed to a large settlement, because
it knows that the next target of suits will be the Swiss National
Bank, the government-run central bank that received more than 80
percent of Nazi Germany's stolen gold. So far the central bank has
not been named in the legal actions, but representatives of the
Jewish groups and other plaintiffs in the class action suits agreed
Friday to file that action next week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Swiss National Bank president Hans Meyer has repeatedly insisted
that U.S. courts have no jurisdiction over the central bank of
another nation. But he also added that the bank, which is reported
to keep upward of $24 billion in gold in the United States, was
``provisionally'' prepared in case Jewish groups tried to freeze
Swiss assets here while the cases were being resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's action came after weeks of disclosures about the
progress of the negotiations which infuriated the banks and the
State Department, which has quietly been acting to keep the
negotiations going. The banks apparently hope to force a settlement
by making their offer public.
</P>
<P>
   But World Jewish Restitution Organization co-chairman Avraham
Burg called the bank's offer ``very humiliating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people were killed because we were perceived and accused
of being the rich man of Europe,'' he told a television station in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be robbed as rich people and paid as poor beggars.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer the banks made Friday was for what has become known as
the ``rough justice'' fund. As the name suggests, it would provide
rough compensation to Holocaust victims and their heirs whose
records of stolen assets _ money, art and other goods those stolen
by the Nazis and later sent to Switzerland _ have been forever
lost.
</P>
<P>
   The offer excludes $70 million that the banks have already
contributed to a humanitarian fund, to help indigent survivors of
the Holocaust in their last years. So the new money on the table
Friday is actually $530 million.
</P>
<P>
   That translates into roughly $53 million in 1945 dollars. But it
appears that the amounts deposited in the banks by the Nazis, much
of it stolen, was far higher than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like sticking up a bank for $200,000, using the money,
and then offering to pay a $50,000 settlement,'' said Rabbi Marvin
Hier, the dean of the Simon Weisenthal Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The banks, however, insist that the offer is largely symbolic,
since it is impossible to come up with anything approaching a real
accounting of how much loot moved through Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all legitimate criteria, this is a fair offer,'' Credit
Suisse, Swiss Bank and Union Bank said in their statement. ``The
banks view this offer to be at the upper limit of what can be
justified, based on the facts and circumstances.''

CITING COSTS, MANY BIG INSURERS WON'T PAY FOR VIAGRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the nation's biggest health insurers have decided not to
pay for Viagra, the male impotence drug, under their prescription
drug plans. They said that providing the recommended 6 to 12 pills
per month would be too expensive, adding hundreds of millions of
dollars to annual costs.
</P>
<P>
   The drug has been promoted as an important enhancement to the
quality of life for many older men and their wives, but some health
economists have raised questions about the medical necessity of a
treatment for impotence and the expense relative to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest nonprofit health
maintenance organization, announced Friday that Viagra would only
be available as an extra benefit at an additional cost to employer
groups, or to individuals who buy it with their own money at Kaiser
pharmacies. ?
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, which has 9.1 million members in 19 states, said the
cost of covering Viagra would have exceeded $100 million a year.
Many Kaiser members are older men who are believed likely to
request the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare, another big insurance company, told New
York insurance officials this week that it would not cover Viagra,
except as an option at extra cost. Aetna estimated that covering
Viagra could add $50 million to its costs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid officials in a number of states, including New York,
have said they would not cover Viagra unless federal Medicaid
officials required it. Officials in Washington have said they did
not expect to require coverage when a doctor said Viagra was
medically necessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pfizer Inc., which makes Viagra, said many other insurers were
covering the drug. Patrick Kelly, a senior vice president of the
Pfizer Pharmaceutical division, said 2 million prescriptions had
been filled since Viagra went on sale in pharmacies in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer said big insurers covering Viagra included Blue Cross and
Blue Shield plans in California and Indiana, the NYLcare unit of
the New York Life Insurance Co. and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care,
based in Massachusetts, as well as the Defense Department health
plan.
</P>
<P>
   United Healthcare Corp., also a big national insurer, said it
had adopted an ``interim'' policy of approving eight pills a month.
Several big companies said they had not decided what to do about
Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Merck-Medco, a unit of Merck &AMP; Co., which sells drugs and
manages drug benefits for health plans, advised 1,100 customers to
limit coverage to 12 pills a month. Medco spokesman Kevin Colgan
said a survey by its sales staff found a variety of policies,
ranging from unlimited coverage to exclusion, as well as
requirements that physicians get approval before prescribing
Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer said it had recommended 10 pills a month, based on
results during its tests of the drug. But Kelly said six a month
was the number covered by most health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente spokeswoman Beverly Hayon said the issue was
``the affordability of health care.'' After a bruising struggle
over costs with the California Public Employees Retirement System,
Kaiser's biggest customer, the health maintenance organization
reduced a proposed rate increase to 10.75 percent from the 12
percent it originally sought, in a compromise announced this week.
Ms. Hayon said Kaiser's estimate of $100 million a year to cover
Viagra was conservative.
</P>
<P>
   She said the California pension fund had also decided to exclude
coverage of Viagra from its big self-insured health care networks,
which are separate from the Kaiser plans.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the New York state Health Department had a
different reason for excluding Viagra coverage. The spokeswoman,
Frances Tarlton, said that because of the great demand for Viagra,
it had a potential for abuse, including being sold on the street by
people who obtained it from Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Sevon, a pharmacy benefits consultant in Fairless Hills,
Pa., said the cost of Viagra would vary according to the age of a
health plan's members. For a Medicare plan, she said it could be as
high as $60 per member per year. For plans with younger members,
and therefore lower demand for the drug, the cost might be as low
as $5 to $12 a year.

1998c. Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Ruben Barrales heard that Texas Gov. George
W. Bush was going to be in California this spring, he hustled into
action to wangle an endorsement in his race for state controller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of George W. Bush is one of an aggressive leader who
embraces the Hispanic community and our relations with Mexico,''
Barrales said. ``This has brought him notice and a following in
California. He is a breath of fresh air out here . . .''
</P>
<P>
   What about the Golden State's own Republican governor, Pete
Wilson? The usually talkative Barrales, a San Mateo County
supervisor, demurred.
</P>
<P>
   His silence points to a growing view that in all things
Hispanic, Bush has become a touchstone for Republicans while Wilson
has become anathema. To some Republicans nationally it has come
down to shorthand: the ``California approach'' and the ``Texas
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear there are people eagerly pushing that,'' said
Wilson, who has chafed quietly at the comparisons with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilson camp believes the criticism in Republican circles is
being fueled by Bush supporters and driven by competition for the
party's presidential nomination in 2000 _ which both Wilson and
Bush may seek.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are actively promulgating the thesis that George Bush is
good for the Republican Party because he will attract Hispanics and
Pete Wilson is bad because he is anti-immigrant,'' said a senior
figure in the Wilson organization.
</P>
<P>
   The divergent opinions were accentuated in a recent poll by
Univision, a major Spanish-language television channel. Hispanic
residents in Texas gave Bush an 81 percent favorable rating;
Hispanic residents in California gave Wilson a 26 percent favorable
rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking two different points on the spectrum'' said
Harry Pachon, a political scientist at Claremont Graduate
University and president of the Toms Rivera Policy Institute.
``Wilson is seen as the Antichrist.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is due in large part to the passage, with Wilson's
leadership or support, over the last four years of three
voter-initiated measures in California that many Hispanics see as
anti-immigrant, although Wilson strongly denies such an intent.
Bush has criticized all three measures.
</P>
<P>
   The first, and for Hispanics most searing, was Proposition 187
in 1994, which sought to deny almost all state services, including
education and all but emergency medical treatment, to illegal
immigrants. The measure passed overwhelmingly, but a U.S. district
judge has ruled it unconstitutional, a finding which is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, voters approved Proposition 209, which dismantled the
state's affirmative action program. And on June 2, voters supported
Proposition 227, a measure all but abolishing the state's bilingual
education program.
</P>
<P>
   By this spring, Wilson had become such a politically polarizing
figure that the main sponsor of Prop. 227 disavowed the governor's
support of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is most closely identified with Prop. 187, which
coincided with his re-election campaign _ a stunning
come-from-behind victory that focused on his efforts to stem
illegal immigration. The campaign's keystone television commercial
featured grainy footage of illegals scurrying between cars at the
border as an announcer boomed: ``They keep coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Wilson aides now see that line as failing to draw
enough distinction between legal and illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the bullet in the opposition's gun,'' said one Wilson
adviser. ``We were outfoxed, out-PR'ed, outspun by a minority of
loud voices.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has spoken out against illegal immigration and the
financial burden it places on states such as Texas and California,
his rhetoric has been less sharp-edged than Wilson's. The Texas
governor described Propositions 187 and 209 as ``divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texan has also criticized various ``English only'' proposals
as an affront to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stand up and say `English only' basically says to a lot of
Hispanic people: `You don't count.' I think they do count,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Wilson each said in interviews that they had never
talked to one another about their differing approaches. Both said
they believed it stemmed from historic and cultural differences in
California and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexican-Americans have been an integral part of the economy
and the social fabric of our state since 1846,'' Bush said. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  .... the social fabric of our state since 1846,'' Bush said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although there are many old ``Californios,'' families who have
been on the West Coast since the days of the Mexican empire, many
more in Texas ``have been there for generations,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tack has drawn support from some Hispanic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's a superior approach,'' said Henry Cisneros, the
former San Antonio mayor who was housing secretary in the Clinton
administration before becoming president of Los Angeles-based
Univision.
</P>
<P>
   ``California Republicans have gone out of their way to alienate
the Latino community over the years,'' Cisneros said. ``And I think
it's in part a Pete Wilson legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Wilson was winning re-election two years ago, he
suffered a Latino backlash. Where he had gotten more than 40
percent of the Hispanic vote in 1990, it dropped to about 25
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson aides point out that is the same approximate quarter of
the Hispanic vote that ``the sainted Bush,'' as one referred to the
Texas governor, got in defeating Democratic incumbent Ann Richards
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polling indicates that Bush could get as much as 50
percent of the Hispanic vote in the fall election, although
Republican share of Latino vote is sometimes smaller on Election
Day than in polls during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the virus spread from Wilson to the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, they tried to demonize me, and then to engage in a sort
of guilt by association against Republicans,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis for Republicans in the California Assembly showed
that in the 1996 election cycle, the GOP suffered its ``worst
registration performance in six decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Without commenting directly on Wilson, Barrales, son of
immigrants who came to the United States from Mexico in the 1950s,
said: ``There is a lot of room for growth. The Republican Party has
lost a lot of good will _ unnecessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter last fall to California Republicans, Stuart K.
Spencer, a veteran party strategist, compared turning off Hispanics
to the GOP failure to win votes of Irish and Italian immigrants
earlier in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party has a sad and politically self-defeating history of
alienating immigrant groups and new voters,'' Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dramatically losing market share of the fastest-growing
segment of the electorate,'' he said. ``These voters should be with
us on the issues of jobs, taxes, government regulation, public
safety and the importance of family.''
</P>
<P>
   Without action, he said, California Republicans could doom
themselves ``to permanent minority status.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the political fallout in two states, there is a sense
that the ``Wilson effect'' has soured California's relationship
with Mexico _ at a time that Bush is eagerly courting Mexican
government and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, since his days as a mayor and assemblyman from San
Diego, has watched what he called ``this unfortunate love-hate
relationship'' between the United States and Mexico, including the
problems of illegal immigration and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson points out that California exports to Mexico more than
doubled in his eight years in office and have increased since
passage of Prop. 187.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business relations have never been better,'' said Jesus
Arredondo, California's assistant secretary for trade.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Wilson source said that Bush advocates are selling the
line that ``the Mexicans are so charmed by George W. and put off by
Pete Wilson that all the trade is going to Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   A Wilson confidante pointed to a quote from Texas Secretary of
State Alberto Gonzalez to the San Francisco Chronicle in April:
``If you're a Mexican businessman and you can make an equally
profitable deal with California and Texas, you're much more likely
to do it where you're more comfortable _ here,'' in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, without invoking Bush's name, believes his own approach,
which doesn't shy from expressing differences with Mexico, is more
based on reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make nice and ignore it, I think, is utter folly,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's administration was dumbfounded when Bush urged the
Clinton administration and Congress to again certify that Mexico
was cooperating in the anti-drug fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an act of total denial,'' said a senior figure in the
Wilson organization.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and even some of his critics point to demographic
differences in the Hispanic populations of the two states,
including California's larger number of illegal immigrants and the
more established Hispanic community in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Census figures suggest that California has almost three
times as many illegal immigrants as Texas _ in 1997 an estimated 2
million vs. 700,000. That means illegals make up 6.3 percent of
California's population to 3.8 percent in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of Hispanics in Texas are U.S. citizens, while in
California half of Latinos are not, said political scientist
Pachon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas there has been an accommodation, even though it was
sometimes ugly'' in ethnic terms, Pachon said. ``In California,
even though there has been a culturally more open environment, with
the influx of Latinos (in the 1970s and 1980s) there has been
enormous scapegoating. This has especially been true since the
economic hardships of the early 1990s. And people took advantage of
it.''

MIAMI GAINS REPUTATION AS CITY RIFE WITH POLITICAL CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Bribery. Kickbacks. Voter fraud. Cover-up. Miami is
engulfed in a series of high-profile investigations of public
corruption so pervasive that it is often mentioned in the same
breath as New York in the days of Tammany Hall and Chicago in the
heyday of the Daley Democratic machine.
</P>
<P>
   So far, a Miami city manager and a city commissioner have gone
to prison for obstruction of justice and bribery, and two county
commissioners have had to step down, one resigning to plead no
contest to a charge of lying in financial disclosure forms and the
other removed by the governor to stand trial on charges of bribery
and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a mayoral election was thrown out because of rampant
voter fraud, and in May a Miami city commissioner was charged with
covering up the fraud. A third Miami city commissioner is under
investigation for accepting a questionable loan from the Port of
Miami, and the port director has been charged with conspiring to
steal more than $1 million in port money for personal use and
political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Dade County state attorney's office estimates that in
the last five years it has charged at least 270 public employees,
including police officers, for crimes ranging from falsifying
records to ripping off drug dealers. Justice Department figures
show that between 1986 and 1995, South Florida was among the 10
leaders in federal prosecutions of public officials, along with New
York, Chicago, Los Angeles and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But if the charges here are similar to those in other big-city
scandals, interviews over the past few weeks with a wide range of
Miamians indicate that corruption festered here because of a
combination of homegrown traits: opportunity resulting from fast
growth, allegiances created by ethnic divisions and politics, and
lagging scrutiny as Miami's high crime rate and drug smuggling drew
most of the attention of law-enforcement agencies and the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corruption problem went unchecked for so long it became a
way of life,'' said Mark P. Schnapp, head of the U.S. attorney's
corruption section here from 1985 to 1987 and now a private defense
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials here argue that the recent cases do not show
Miami politicians to be more corrupt than those in other big
cities, only that more of them are getting caught now because of an
earlier lag in enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Dade County state attorney's office did not have a
separate public corruption unit until 1995, and it now has nine
lawyers. State Attorney Katherine Fernandez-Rundle said a drop in
violent crime has freed up investigative resources. U.S. Attorney
Thomas E. Scott, whose office has focused on drugs as South Florida
became the port of entry and headquarters for Colombian cocaine
traffickers during the 1980s and 1990s, said public outrage about
crooked politicians prompted him to double his corruption unit to
12 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of the corruption are another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Many public officials here blame a government they say has not
evolved fast enough to provide financial controls, oversight and
checks and balances to serve an ethnically diverse metropolis of
more than 2 million people that began to boom only about 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Ferre, a former Miami city mayor and county commissioner
who has lived here for 46 years, says governing in both the county
and the city is still largely left to executive administrators who
are appointed rather than elected. This structure was created as
part of a national anti-corruption movement and was intended to
bring professionalism to government.
</P>
<P>
   In many cities, the structure has proved the least corrupt form
of government, civic watchdog groups say. But Ferre argues that in
large areas with warring ethnic factions it leaves the elected
officials who appoint the city or county manager _ the mayors and
commissioners _ hungry for ways to gain more influence and less
accountable for oversight.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``the airport budget in 1996 was passed in 45
seconds,'' Ferre said. ``Here's a multimillion-dollar operation,
it's the single most important operation in the county, and we pass
the budget without discussion. Does that lend itself to a lot of
hanky-panky? You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami is filled with opportunities for public corruption. With a
county budget of $4.2 billion, a booming airport and seaport and a
need for new infrastructure like sewage lines to keep pace with its
growing population, Miami is an area where much of the economy
flows through government, a flow that appears as a common thread in
the corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
   James Burke, a Miami-Dade County commissioner indicted in
January on federal bribery and money laundering charges, for
instance, is accused of accepting an initial payment of $50,000
from a San Francisco company trying to get some of the county's
bond business, which pays for new construction. Carmen J. Lunetta,
director of the Port of Miami for 18 years, is accused of
conspiring to divert port money for a house and other personal
expenses through most of the 1990s as he built the seaport into one
of the largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When Lunetta, who like Burke has pleaded not guilty to the
charges, resigned a year ago, some county commissioners
acknowledged that he had seemed so successful that they did not
feel the need to scrutinize his management of the port. But Lunetta
appears to have pleased commissioners in other ways. The federal
indictment against him charges that one commissioner received an
$85,000 personal loan from port money and that another received
$1,000 for an election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 county commissioners and five city commissioners.
Their part-time status and low pay _ $6,000 a year _ seem to invite
candidates who are looking for side benefits, many officials and
political experts say. And with political campaigns getting more
and more expensive over the last decade, the candidates are
increasingly beholden to the special interests and political
machines that helped get them elected, others note.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials say there is a glaring need for
stricter curbs on lobbyists. Special interests play such a big role
here that when Armando Vidal sought the county manager's post in
1994, he met not only with the commissioners who would vote on the
selection but with contractors and lobbyists who do business with
the county. An important endorsement came from the late Cuban exile
leader Jorge Mas Canosa, the powerful head of the Cuban American
National Foundation who was widely regarded as the kingmaker of
Miami politics.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal said he met with Mas ``to get his thoughts as a concerned
citizen,'' according to sworn testimony given in 1995 in a state
investigation of county commissioners suspected of violating the
``sunshine law'' requiring governing bodies to meet publicly. Asked
what Mas' thoughts were, Vidal said, ``That he was going to talk to
or had talked to some of the applicants and that he didn't know who
really had support from the commission and that he basically wanted
a Cuban person for management.''
</P>
<P>
   The company Mas owned, Church and Tower, which is still
controlled by his family, is the subject of a state investigation
for a $58 million paving contract that county officials contend
overcharged taxpayers by millions. The company has blamed
subcontractors and the county inspectors who supervised the work
for any overcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal has not been charged with any crime but was dismissed in
March by the Miami-Dade County Mayor, Alex Penelas, for failure to
supervise county operations. Vidal in turn has gone to prosecutors
charging that Penelas dismissed him for his refusal to hire the
mayor's friends.
</P>
<P>
   The cozy relationships among government players here are fueled
by ethnic allegiances in a county population that is 55 percent
Hispanic, 25 percent white and 21 percent black. And those same
loyalties seem to have led to a high tolerance among voters for
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Kaplan, the white county commissioner who misstated his
income on financial disclosure forms, had been comfortably
re-elected with Jewish and Hispanic support despite such widely
publicized lapses as seeking to become a Latin America
representative of American Airlines while sitting on the county
commission's aviation committee. (He was turned down.) Miami City
Commissioner Humberto Hernandez, a Cuban-American, won re-election
last November while under indictment on federal charges of mortgage
fraud and money laundering unrelated to city business. (Hernandez
was removed from office for a second time after state prosecutors
charged him in May with helping cover up voter fraud.)
</P>
<P>
   When charges of corruption have involved black and Hispanic
politicians, cries of racism are often heard in the ethnic press,
with supporters often giving the accused officials the benefit of
the doubt. Among black voters who have already lost two
commissioners to criminal charges, word that a third black official
was under federal investigation spurred a call for prayers and
fasting in black churches and a campaign to raise money for his
legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   The official, City Commissioner Arthur E. Teele Jr., was being
investigated for receiving $85,000 from the Port of Miami while he
sat on the county commission in 1993. No charges have been filed,
and Teele has said he did not know the origin of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a powerless people for a long time,'' said the Rev.
John F. White of the Greater Bethel AME Church here. ``He has done
a credible job as a public official, and we want to make sure that
continues to happen. At this point we believe what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's problems have often been described as the growing pains
of a place that has endured massive foreign migration, introduced
district elections and other political changes in recent years and
is still too young to have the civic pride and established
institutions that could serve as counterbalancing forces to a
frontier mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Don Morrison, executive director of the Local Government
Institute, a 10-year-old group that provides ethics training and
consulting to municipalities, says most local governments manage to
stay clean, usually because of safeguards like ethics officers who
investigate complaints, stringent campaign finance laws and close
monitoring of government contracts. Some of those checks have just
begun here.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption has come at a cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Miami, the instability of losing elected
officials and administrators to either criminal convictions or the
political turmoil resulting from their cases comes at a time when
the city is still recovering from a financial crisis discovered
after the first corruption scandal in 1996 claimed the city
manager, the finance director and a city commissioner in one sweep.
</P>
<P>
   County officials say mistrust has left voters with little
appetite to raise taxes for services. And there is also fear that
all the bad publicity may hamper the area's ability to attract
investment and jobs. Already, a government that businesses have
often criticized as slow and bureaucratic seems even more
paralyzed. The criminal investigations, says Tito Riera-Gomez,
regional director of corporate and external affairs for BellSouth
Telecommunications, ``have subliminally affected people's
willingness to move forward with things. They fear they might do
something that could be interpreted as being improper.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigations have led to some changes. Today, for example,
there are tighter absentee ballot rules to prevent fraud, and a
former chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Miami serves
as Miami's ``corruption czar.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters have also signaled in two recent elections that there is
only so much they can take. An indicted former county commissioner,
James Burke, was defeated when he tried to recapture his seat in
March. And the wife of another former county commissioner, Bruce
Kaplan, lost when she ran for his seat on June 2 after he agreed
not to run himself as part of his plea agreement with the state
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Things may get worse before they get better. Bruno Barreiro, the
former state legislator who won Kaplan's seat, was six days late in
filing his campaign finance report in violation of state law and
faced a $3,000 fine after less than a week in office. He blamed the
mail. And while each criminal case has spurred others, Scott, the
U.S. attorney here, says that aggressive law-enforcement ``has not
translated to the cooperation level we want'' from potential
witnesses. For residents of Miami, it all adds up to a
disappointment that some say is comparable to the recent decimation
of their world champion baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain dispiriting consequence to all this,'' said
Max Castro, a sociologist at the University of Miami. ``People see
their government as a deception, a fraud as big as the Marlins.''

RECORD NUMBER OF CRIMINAL CASES ON BORDER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal justice system along the U.S.-Mexico border is
experiencing record criminal caseloads, with drug and immigration
offenders clogging courts and crowding prisons.
</P>
<P>
   From San Diego, Calif., to Brownsville, the surging caseloads
are the result of tougher drug and immigration laws, more agents
enforcing them and perhaps more illegal activity. The government is
also spending more money than ever to prosecute offenders in
federal court, a signal that drugs and immigration are a nationwide
priority.
</P>
<P>
   The problem may best be illustrated here in El Paso, where the
more than 800 federal criminal indictments in the 12 months
following Oct. 1, 1996, comprised nearly half of those in the
entire western district of Texas, an area that includes both Austin
and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments here are expected to double in the current
fiscal year, delaying civil proceedings and forcing federal
officials to rent county jail space in far-away locales such as
Groesbeck, some 650 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inundated,'' said Sam Ponder, an assistant U.S. attorney
who heads the El Paso office. ``I've got five attorneys who handle
the international bridges, each with about 100 cases. They can't
even remember who the defendants are.''
</P>
<P>
   In tiny Pecos, whose jurisdiction is the Big Bend borderlands,
the federal criminal caseload jumped to 253 in the 12 months
following Oct. 1, 1996, from 47 the year before, an increase of
more than 400 percent. The numbers could go higher this year.
</P>
<P>
   The western district of Texas, which includes the border from El
Paso to Del Rio, and the state's southern district, which includes
the stretch of international boundary from Del Rio to Brownsville,
now rank second and third respectively behind Southern California
in criminal cases filed.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers of indictments along the border are
unprecedented, they have not yet reached the levels of Houston,
where this year's caseload has already topped 1,900. Still,
considering that Houston dwarfs the border cities in size, the
increase in places like El Paso is astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Border crime has always been there,'' said Bill Blagg, U.S.
attorney for the western district. ``The difference is that now,
our resources are having an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   While the mushrooming statistics are encouraging to some,
signaling success in the war on drugs and illegal immigration, they
are alarming to others.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is not only whether the federal system can handle the
crush, but also the cost of it. The crackdown along the nation's
southern flank, which requires everything from a bigger Border
Patrol to more prosecutors to more prison space, is draining
hundreds of millions dollars from federal coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of equity. Border cities such as El
Paso say they have more than their share of the criminal burden but
not of the resources. El Paso has far fewer U.S. attorneys and
federal judges than San Antonio, for example, a city whose criminal
caseload is much lighter. (San Antonio's civil backlog does exceed
that of El Paso, however.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question may be whether the crackdown is indeed
stemming the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants. Despite the
numbers, the flow of drugs in particular remains a pressing
problem, and some at the center of the justice system are doubting
the government's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we making progress?'' said Harry Lee Hudspeth, one of two
federal judges in El Paso, which lies across the border from Ciudad
Juarez, Mexico, a city of more then 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the success in the drug war is not easy. But increased
interdiction along the U.S.-Mexico border does not appear to have
forced the price of narcotics up, which would likely be the case if
demand surpassed supply. Nor does America's hunger for illegal
drugs seem to have subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's depressing all the way around,'' said Hudspeth. The
government, the judge said, is mistaken in thinking that more
seizures and stiffer drug penalties in federal court can address
what he believes is a more complicated problem.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue is being debated on an international stage. At a
United Nations special session earlier this month, drug-producing
countries demanded that the United States address its own appetite
for narcotics rather than wage a global war on drugs. Nationally,
the war on drugs is also catching flak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is demand,'' said Daniel Abrahamson, director of
legal affairs for the Lindemith Center, which advocates more
liberal drug policies. ``This is a public health issue, not a
criminal justice issue.''
</P>
<P>
   To the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the
issue is one of public health and criminal justice, with the latter
getting the bulk of the resources. Some of that money is earmarked
for drug enforcement in El Paso, one of several federally
designated priority areas in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Congress is opening up its pocketbook for border
enforcement, authorizing a 118 percent jump in the Border Patrol's
$818 million operating budget since 1994. In El Paso, that means
nearly 1,000 agents policing the international boundary, compared
with some 600 four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Seizures are up, as are arrests along the border. The problem is
that most of these drug and immigration offenders are bit players.
This is especially true in narcotics trafficking, with so-called
mules hired to carry drugs clogging the courts and the kingpins
carrying on.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors say they are so consumed with routine drug and
immigration cases that they lack the time to build more
comprehensive cases that presumably could strike closer to the
heart of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   A typical defendant, ``plain vanilla,'' in the words of an El
Paso federal public defender, was Ricardo Ruvalcaba Vera, a
college-bound 19-year-old from Juarez who was offered $500 to drive
1982 Chrysler Le Baron through the Ysleta port of entry and leave
it, keys and all, at a nearby convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   From there, prosecutors presume, the car was to be driven to an
El Paso warehouse where the drugs would be stored.
</P>
<P>
   But the car was searched at the bridge last January and, with
the help of drug-sniffing dogs, U.S. agents recovered 70 pounds of
marijuana. As for Ruvalcaba, he was sentenced last week in
Hudspeth's courtroom to about a year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was foolish,'' said Ruvalcaba, a polite, somewhat shy young
man who lately has been shuttling back and forth between El Paso
and Kermit, some 250 miles away, where some of the 500 or so
overflow El Paso federal prisoners are held during their court
proceedings. If convicted, they are sent to a federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never before had a problem with the police,'' he said.
``It's been quite an experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruvalcaba will probably be of little help to U.S. officials
wanting to break Mexican smuggling rings. He knows the man who made
the $500 offer one night at the ElectriQ nightclub only as
``Lalo.'' U.S. officials say that's the way the Mexican traffickers
operate _ no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   While Judge Hudspeth sees little benefit in jamming the federal
justice system with prisoners like this, U.S. Attorney Blagg says
they can lead to good tips. Last month, he said, prosecutors used
information gleaned from drug haulers to return indictments on two
sizable rings operating near Pecos.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, law enforcement agents say, every ounce of
narcotics and every laundered dollar seized is a skirmish won in
the war on drugs. Last year, in fact, U.S. Customs agents at El
Paso's Bridge of the Americas confiscated $5.6 million in a
tractor-trailer headed south, thought to be a drug payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agents say such seizures can put drug
traffickers on the run. While the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency does
not take credit for the fall of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the
infamous Juarez kingpin who died last year while apparently trying
to disguise himself with plastic surgery, agents say they played a
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would Amado Carrillo have tried to change his looks if we
weren't making a difference,'' said Thomas Kennedy, assistant
special agent in charge for the DEA office in El Paso. ``Obviously
we were having some impact if he was trying to hide from us.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials hope the same sort of incremental strategy will
turn the illegal immigration tide. Armed with technology that
allows them to identify deportees trying to return and call up
their criminal history, officials are prosecuting immigrants who
before simply would have been bused back to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   One is Javier de la Torre Reyes, who last week appeared before a
federal magistrate in El Paso. Having been previously been deported
after serving time for shoplifting, he was nabbed at a port of
entry when he tried to pass himself off as a U.S. citizen. Now the
32-year-old Juarez man is looking at up to eight months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration law is especially harsh on felons, who can get up to
20 years for trying to enter the United States illegally, even
after they have served their time in U.S. prisons. Federal public
defenders say this is excessive, particularly in a community like
El Paso, where the back-and-forth from Mexico is part of daily
life.
</P>
<P>
   But Blagg said the harsh immigration laws, and the federal drug
statutes, have prompted a decrease in theft and violent crime along
the border _ at least on the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we target the right people, if we prosecute them, if we put
them in jail for a significant time,'' he said, ``we can have an
impact.''

EUROPEAN OFFICIALS MOVE TO APPROVE WORLDCOM-MCI DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (changes `Holland' to `the Netherlands')   (bl)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ After more than a month of negotiations,
European antitrust regulators Friday tentatively approved Worldcom
Inc.'s $37 billion takeover of MCI Communications Corp. after the
two companies agreed to concessions in the sale of MCI's Internet
holdings, industry executives involved in the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Though a few details still need to be clarified, the executives
said, Friday's agreement removes the biggest remaining uncertainty
about the ability of the two telecommunication companies to
complete their deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, MCI will sell its main Internet businesses
and will promise not to actively recruit its old corporate
customers. Under an agreement announced last month, MCI agreed to
sell its wholesale Internet business to the British telephone
company Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC, for $625 million. But that deal would
have allowed Worldcom to pursue that business again after the sale
_ a provision that brought protests from Worldcom's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   While the European agreement will prevent that, WorldCom will be
allowed to retain its crown jewel, Uunet, the world's largest
operator of the Internet's high-speed main artery known as the
backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom's shares closed Friday at $47.0625, up $1.3125. MCI's
shares rose $1.8125, to close as $56.50.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, neither Worldcom executives nor European Commission
officials would comment on the plans Friday. But privately,
officials on both sides confirmed that they had reached a working
agreement and would try to resolve a few remaining issues within
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department is examining the same issues as
European regulators, and is not expected to make its decisions for
several weeks. But Worldcom executives consider the European
objections to be their most serious problem. And the Federal
Communications Commission has allowed European regulators to take
the lead in determining how much of the combined company's Internet
backbone will have to be sold off before the deal can be given
approval.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A merger between MCI and Worldcom, which are now the second- and
fourth-largest long-distance telephone companies in the United
States, would create an entity with about $70 billion in sales and
a sprawling array of businesses in voice and data communications.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest part of that empire is in traditional long-distance
telephone service, but both companies provide high-speed data
communications, and Internet services are one of the
fastest-growing areas in both Europe and the United States. What is
more, the industry is quickly digitizing voice calls and moving
them to the Internet and other data lines as a cost-saving measure.
</P>
<P>
   Though MCI and Worldcom are both U.S. companies, European
regulators assert their right to review any merger in which the
companies have significant sales in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Karel van Miert, the European Commission's powerful competition
minister, objected several months ago that the combined companies
would have too much power in the area of Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   MCI agreed last month to sell Cable &AMP; Wireless its backbone
business, which serves local companies that provide Internet access
to businesses and individuals. But Van Miert pressed for more
divestiture, and MCI offered this week to sell off its retail
businesses that provide direct Internet access to corporate and
individual customers.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that MCI would have to sell more of its
Internet assets to satisfy European regulators, Cable &AMP; Wireless
sued MCI on June 10, demanding that it be given the right of first
refusal on any additional Internet assets MCI decided to unload. A
court rejected that claim last week.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission must reach a final decision on the
merger by July 15, though officials want to deal with it at their
meeting July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Van Miert met Friday in Brussels with what is known as the
merger task-force, which consists of competition regulators from
each country in the European Union. That group must recommend
either approving or rejecting a proposed merger, relying largely on
the work done by Van Miert's Competition Ministry in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Though the arguments over the Worldcom deal have been rather
arcane, the stakes are significant because of both the size of the
deal and its timing.
</P>
<P>
   The huge merger is part of a much broader race for position
between the world's giant telecommunications carriers, most of
which have formed global alliances. It also comes as the European
Union is forcing its own state-controlled telephone monopolies to
accept competition. That process began in earnest last January,
when most European countries simultaneously dropped rules that
prohibit competition in ordinary local and long-distance telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Though MCI has relatively little business within Europe,
Worldcom is an aggressive competitor here in several lucrative but
little-noticed niches of the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Through MFS Communications, which it acquired nearly two years
ago, Worldcom owns high-speed fiber optic networks in seven major
European cities, including London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and
Brussels. These networks serve big corporate customers, including
banks and financial institutions, and Worldcom is linking the local
fiber optic networks into a pan-European network that should be
completed next year.
</P>
<P>
   Through Uunet Technologies, Worldcom has become one of Europe's
biggest providers of Internet access services. In the last two
years, Uunet has bought up commercial Internet access companies in
Germany, Britain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the United States, where Worldcom has traditionally
been known as a cut-rate provider of long-distance service for
residential customers, the company's European focus has been much
more on big corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Now that European governments have lifted most of the
restrictions on competing with established telephone companies,
Worldcom executives are trying to broaden out and serve small and
medium-sized businesses.

   LA DORADA, Colombia _ The venue was a dusty soccer field in a
crime-infested slum. The stage was a collection of splintered
planks stretched across sawhorses. The sound system wasn't much
louder than a boombox.
</P>
<P>
   But Enrique Gaviria, an advance man for the ruling Liberal Party
presidential candidate, Horacio Serpa, refused to panic. Once a
roadie who toured with rock bands such as Lynyrd Skynyrd and Pink
Floyd, Gaviria has a show-must-go-on mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   To salvage one of Serpa's final campaign rallies in the stretch
before today's election showdown with Conservative Party candidate
Andres Pastrana, Gaviria pulled out his cell phone last week and
went to work.
</P>
<P>
   He called in carpenters to patch the stage and procured a bright
red carpet to hide the knotholes. He posted sharpshooters on the
rooftops. And he scoured the barrios for stereo gear to amp up the
sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always like this,'' said Aurelio Iragorri, tour manager
for the Serpa campaign. Local politicians ``tell you that
everything is ready, and nothing's ready,'' he said. ``It's a total
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   With polls indicating an extremely tight race, both presidential
candidates frantically barnstormed across rural Colombia to drum up
last-minute support.
</P>
<P>
   Serpa ventured into some of the most dangerous areas of this
war-racked nation. A Pastrana aide journeyed into the Andean
foothills last week to meet with top guerrilla commanders.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-way race on May 31, Serpa edged Pastrana by less than
34,000 votes out of the nearly 11 million cast. But he failed to
get more than 50 percent of the vote in that first-round election,
forcing today's runoff.
</P>
<P>
   As time ran out, so did the campaign money _ one reason for the
austere look of the Serpa road show last week. But Serpa's campaign
also took extreme measures to avoid any hint of impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   That's because President Ernesto Samper's 1994 election was
partly bankrolled by the Cali cocaine cartel, a scandal that nearly
toppled his government and brought international shame to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Serpa was one of Samper's top advisers during the 1994 campaign.
Although Serpa was cleared of any wrongdoing during that race, many
analysts insist that he had to have known about the influx of drug
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the narco-scandal, there's a lot of paranoia about
expenses,`` said Gaviria, who traveled to more than 300
municipalities during the past year in a second-hand bus decorated
with Serpa graffiti. ``Serpa is very scared about overspending and
being accused of illegal acts.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, there was no evidence of drug money filtering
into either campaign. However, both Serpa and Pastrana were
expected to exceed the legal spending limit of $6.6 million. Rafael
Mateus, of the independent watchdog group Citizens' Oversight,
predicted their bills could top $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates differ both in style and substance.
</P>
<P>
   A former interior minister in the Samper government, Serpa, 55,
has a walrus mustache and a fiery speaking style. He was at his
best stumping in the countryside, where he promised to build more
schools and hospitals, reactivate the farm economy and help the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has to teach me what it's like to have no food in the
house or no family salary. I'm against poverty, because I have
suffered from it,'' Serpa declared last week from the stage in La
Dorada, a Liberal stronghold 60 miles northwest of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   But due to Colombia's soaring fiscal deficit and economic
recession, analysts predict that the next government will lack the
money for populist programs and will be forced to follow a more
orthodox path.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, 44, a former TV journalist and mayor of Bogota, lost a
close runoff election to Samper in 1994. During this race, he
pledged to usher in a new era of clean government and fiscal
responsibility and to improve relations with the U.S. government,
which yanked Samper's visa in 1996 due to the campaign finance
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But as the son of a former president, Pastrana has had trouble
shaking his image as a moneyed technocrat out of touch with
Colombia's poor, who make up 53 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when asked about education initiatives during a TV
debate last week, Pastrana proposed tax breaks to students to buy
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana put together an effective media campaign, but Serpa had
done more legwork.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech in La Dorada, Serpa went house to house,
shaking hands. Last month, when his helicopter was about to touch
down in the northern state of Bolivar, gunfire rang out. Yet Serpa
insisted on landing and greeting his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Serpa also counted on his party's network of powerbrokers. The
Liberals have ruled Colombia for the past 12 years, and the party's
congressmen can deliver blocs of loyal voters.
</P>
<P>
   In La Dorada, Serpa's key contact was Sen. Victor Renan Barco, a
Liberal who has been in office for 30 years. Iragorri described him
as a regional godfather and ``the owner of all the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before the Serpa rally, Iragorri and Gaviria met with
Barco for four hours. They drank beer, watched a World Cup soccer
match on TV and talked politics.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose was to flatter the senator and cajole him into
delivering votes. ``This is called `oiling the machinery,' ''
Iragorri said.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, Barco dispensed favors to needy constituents
lined up outside his office. When a crippled lottery salesman
entered the room, Barco pulled out a fat wad of pesos to pay for a
wheelchair. The man promised to vote for Serpa.
</P>
<P>
   The next day at the rally, Barco took the stage and demanded
that the town support Serpa.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians who deliver votes can expect more federal money for
their districts, Iragorri explained.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, campaign aides were angling for posts in an eventual
Serpa administration. Gaviria pestered Serpa for a diplomatic post
in Madrid, so he can spend more time with his Spanish girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Such cronyism and quid-pro-quo arrangements are the kinds of
practices that Pastrana campaigned against.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy for winning today's election was largely based on
attracting the support of the 2.8 million voters who cast their
first-round ballots for independent Noemi Sanin, who finished
third.
</P>
<P>
   Sanin, however, refused to endorse either candidate, which was a
major blow to Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Pastrana may have received some help from the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the nation's
largest guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   Ending Colombia's 34-year-old civil war is the No. 1 issue in
the campaign, and both Serpa and Pastrana portrayed themselves as
the ``peace candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a communique released last week, the FARC's high command
said that Serpa had done nothing to promote peace while serving in
high government positions over the past decade.

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Unable to resolve pressing problems like drug
trafficking and civil war, recent Colombian presidents have fared
better after stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   Take former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen. He's 84. He left
office more than two decades ago. Yet he has been one of the most
influential players in Colombia's current presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. presidents, power often seems to evaporate the moment
they vacate the White House. Retirement often involves writing
memoirs, building presidential libraries, playing golf or inspiring
name changes for airport terminals.
</P>
<P>
   But in Colombia, former chief executives lead political parties.
They serve as ambassadors. They become trusted presidential
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Samper once joked that his job's main perk is
that he gets to be an ex-president.
</P>
<P>
   Some former presidents move on to the international stage. After
his government dismantled the Medellin drug cartel and helped
modernize the economy, Cesar Gaviria _ president from 1990 to 1994
_ was elected secretary-general of the Organization of American
States.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who was president in the mid-1970s, made the cover of
Semana, Colombia's largest magazine, last month simply by endorsing
ruling Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa for today's
presidential runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lopez's administration was plagued by charges of
widespread corruption, he is a Liberal Party guru who can make or
break presidential hopefuls. His weekly newspaper column helps
shape the national debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are never judged by what happened during their
governments,'' said Jesus Ortiz Nieves, an editor at the weekly
magazine Cambio 16, who wrote a cover story about Lopez last
November. ``But if you look at the results, some of them should
have been brought to the public pillory.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, former presidents are considered political wisemen,
partly because Colombia's Liberal and Conservative parties are
based more on personalities than ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parties are divided up, with two or three big figures in
each one,'' said Rodrigo Losada, a political science professor at
Javeriana University in Bogota. ``What they say or don't say
carries a lot of weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's Constitution allows presidents to serve for just one
four-year term. Since they can no longer vie for formal power,
ex-presidents become political referees _ kingmakers who are called
upon to settle internal party disputes.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely, however, that politicians will seek President
Samper's counsel once he leaves office on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Samper was elected in 1994 with the help of $6.1 million from
the Cali drug cartel. The scandal nearly led to Samper's ouster and
blackened Colombia's reputation. Claiming that his life will be in
danger once he leaves the presidential palace, Samper plans to
relocate to Spain or Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to find it tough to become an elder statesman,''
said one foreign diplomat.

IN VENEZUELA, PLAYING BALL BECOMES A WAY OUT FOR POOR YOUTHS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
By JOHN OTIS &QL; 
1998c. Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GUACARA, Venezuela _ If a young man grew up in a shanty playing
stickball with bottle caps on potholed streets, how hard can it be
for him to hit a perfectly stitched baseball? Or to turn a double
play on a manicured Major League infield?
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is one explanation Venezuelans offer when asked
why their nation has produced so many dominating ``beisbolistas.''
Like the Dominican Republic _ which has provided the largest number
of Latin American big leaguers _ Venezuela has become an El Dorado
for pro clubs seeking baseball prodigies.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive growth in salaries in the United States has turned
the sport into something more than the national pastime here. Much
like basketball in the United States, baseball can be a way for
poor Venezuelan teen-agers to move up in the world.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen Venezuelans are on Major League rosters this
season, including five-time Gold Glove winner Omar Vizquel of the
Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves slugger Andres Galarraga _
known as the South American Babe Ruth. Hundreds more have signed
minor-league contracts. And two dozen Major League teams now run
year-round baseball camps in Venezuela. The diamonds and sandlots
are also swarming with scouts from the professional leagues in
Korea, Taiwan and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every Little Leaguer in the country knows the story of
Jackson Mellion. A 16-year-old pitcher from the sleepy, seaside
town of Puerto de la Cruz, Mellion received a $1.6 million bonus
last year for signing a minor-league contract with the New York
Yankees. He had never even pitched in Venezuela's pro league.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga recently signed a $24.75 million contract with the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because so many players, like Galarraga and Vizquel, have made
it big, kids are now driven to play baseball. It represents
economic power,'' said Baldemar Bottini, whose son, Baldemar Jr.,
plays shortstop for a Caracas city league team.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Asuncion, who teaches English to youths attending a
``baseball academy'' run by the Houston Astros here, agrees.
``Baseball is a way out,'' he said. ``It's like winning the
lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport was introduced to Venezuela by American oilmen at the
turn of the century, and it quickly caught on. Boys often start out
playing stickball and can join join little leagues at the age of 4.
Venezuela's professional league attracts U.S. players looking to
hone their skills during the off-season. Pete Rose, Dave Parker,
Rod Carew and Greg Maddox have all played in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   On TV, baseball fanatics can watch Major League games every day.
``The passion for the big leagues is so strong that the (Caracas)
stadium never fills up during the playoffs. People will stay home
to watch the World Series,'' Rueda said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Venezuelans focused on Omar Vizquel, who made it to
the World Series with the Indians. He is one of a series of great
Venezuelan shortstops including Hall-of-Famer Luis Aparicio and
Dave Concepcion of Cincinnati's dominating ``Big Red Machine'' of
the 1970s. As a result, shortstop is the preferred position for
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask 200 kids, 150 of them want to play shortstop,''
Asuncion said.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising teen-agers are invited to the baseball
academies, which are like maquiladoras for U.S. teams. Cheap to
operate, they mold raw Venezuelan players into valuable exports to
the United States. Each Major League club receives 28 visas to
allow such foreign-born players to join their stateside farm teams.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Guacara, a farming town 60 miles west of the capital
city, Caracas, the Houston Astros operate one such academy. At the
start of practice one recent morning, 45 players wearing blue
Astros caps jogged around the outfield, which was littered with
fallen mangoes from nearby trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, baseball has always been everything,'' said Pablo
Morales, a lanky, 15-year- old pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Added a catcher, Kleber Zerpa, also 15, ``Baseball is in my
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Morales and Zerpa are confident that they will one day play
in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects undergo hours of daily instruction and weight
training. They are also given a balanced diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They run well and they may have good bat speed. But some
arrive here with nutrition problems and are really skinny,'' said
Pablo Torrealba, who runs the Astros academy in Guacara and used to
pitch for the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Besides fattening them up, trainers try to prepare the players
for life in the United States, since most will eventually sign
minor-league contracts with an average pay of $7,000 annually. Some
of the players come from broken homes and lack the discipline
required of professionals. In fact, poise, dedication and language
skills are almost as important as physical talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their performance can be affected if they don't understand
their coaches,'' Asuncion said after a recent English class held in
a church on the outskirts of Guacara. ``I also teach them to stay
out of trouble, to do their job and to save their money. What I
teach them here is for whatever career they end up having.''
</P>
<P>
   That's especially important because the average minor-league
career lasts about five years. What's more, fewer than 1 percent of
the players in the academies ever make it to the majors. To help
them cope with the pressure, the Astros team psychologist pays
frequent visits to Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their chances are very small,'' said Torrealba, who toiled for
nine years in the minors before being called up by Oakland.
``Everyone thinks they will get to the majors, but it's almost
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Venezuelan prospects, getting paid to travel around the
United States to play single-A baseball for a few, precious seasons
can be thrill enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they drop-out, it's a great experience,'' Asuncion
said. ``They come home more mature and more realistic about life.''

MINOR LOSES PARENTAL RIGHTS TO GRANDPARENTS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 

</HEADLINE>
 21-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV

<TEXT>
<P>
   If some people find Erica Zeman an unappealing person because
she kept her baby after being raped at age 14 and got married to a
38-year-old man when she was 17, then so be it, she says defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   But in her mind, those are not good enough reasons to remove her
firstborn child from her household, which a judge did two weeks
ago. Since Erica never mistreated her 3-year-old daughter Bianca,
she can't fathom why the judge decided the girl should live with
Erica's father and step-mother.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the decision of state District Family Judge ``Cactus
Jack'' Kagle is changed, Erica will only see her daughter every
other weekend, during parts of summers and some holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one deserves having a child taken away because society says
it's bad to have an age difference,'' said Erica, who married Mark
Zeman in December and recently had another child with him. ``All
the people who criticize me should have their child taken away when
their child is the center of their world.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual custody battle arose out of a joint custody
agreement Erica signed in January 1996 with her father and
step-mother, Kevin and Melodie Avis. At the time, Erica and Bianca
were living with the Avises in west Houston, and the agreement was
ostensibly needed so Kevin Avis could provide medical insurance for
Bianca.
</P>
<P>
   All three said last week that the Avises convinced Erica to sign
the agreement by reassuring her Bianca would live with her when she
became a legal adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Erica did something flighty,'' Melodie Avis added.
</P>
<P>
   Erica said she was told the only way the Avises would fight for
custody of Bianca was if Erica abused the child, which she was
never accused of doing.
</P>
<P>
   But when Erica left with Bianca last October to move in with
Zeman, Melodie Avis went on a mission to prove he was a child
abuser and to try to get Bianca back.
</P>
<P>
   State investigations have cleared Zeman of the allegations made
by Melodie Avis that he abused Bianca. Illinois investigators also
cleared him of accusations made there by his ex-wife that he had
neglected their children. Zeman's ex-wife lost a custody battle
over their son, but Melodie Avis said she has no reason to doubt
the veracity of her stories.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, only Kevin Avis has the right to determine where Bianca
lives. But Melodie Avis, who clearly has a role in the decision,
said she is far from ready to allow Erica to have Bianca.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, any 38-year-old man that gets involved with a
17-year-old child is a child molester anyway,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would allow Erica to have Bianca if she left Zeman,
she said Erica is still too ``immature.''
</P>
<P>
   Melodie Avis, 32, said she understands the love Erica feels for
Bianca because she also had a child out of wedlock as a teen-ager.
She said she was glad her parents helped her raise the two children
she had before she married Kevin in 1995, and wondered why Erica
did not welcome similar aid from the Avises.
</P>
<P>
   The Avises, who had their own baby, are already raising six
children, but feel they also need to care for Bianca for her own
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the evil step-mom wanting to take the child,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The case illustrates the potentially unforeseen consequences
when mothers who are minors sign joint custody agreements to help
provide financially for their infants, said a Houston family law
expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you enter into a joint custody arrangement, just because
you're the biological mother doesn't mean you will have more
rights,'' said Stewart Gagnon, a partner at Fulbright &AMP; Jaworski
who chaired a committee that played a major role in rewriting the
state's family law code in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is often likely that minors won't fully understand
the implications of signing the agreements and state laws have ``no
real obligations to make them understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagnon said he believes there should be mandatory education for
anyone who signs such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He added that if the mother is a minor, there is no reason a
court could not appoint an ad litem attorney to represent the
mother's interests, but it is unclear how often this is done. The
court did not appoint an ad litem attorney for Erica, but it
appointed one for Bianca.
</P>
<P>
   To Erica, the irony of all this is that she was a trusted mother
figure to her two younger sisters and younger brother for many
years because their real mother left home for months at a time and
frequently mistreated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would cook my sisters' and brothers' meals, give them baths,
and change their diapers,'' Erica said. ``We were real close,
because we knew we were all we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Their mother _ who was shunned while growing up in Korea because
she was an ``Amerasian,'' half American, half Asian _ left home for
good five years ago when Erica was 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day she left us I made a vow I would never make my
children feel what I felt growing up,'' said Erica, who graduated
from high school this spring and hopes to become a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Avis, 40, said he could do little about how his wife
treated the children because he was frequently away on military
missions and he fought in Operation Desert Storm in 1991. Before he
left the military and moved to Houston in 1992 to work as a
surveyor, the family lived in many places, including Korea, Germany
and Ft. Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Erica became pregnant with Bianca by a 21-year-old man who was
convicted of aggravated sexual assault and waived his parental
rights.
</P>
<P>
   After signing the joint custody agreement, Erica and her
step-mother intermittently argued over how to raise Bianca. But the
arrangement did not truly sour, they said, until the Avises learned
last fall that she was engaged to Zeman and was pregnant with his
baby.
</P>
<P>
   The machinations to take Bianca away from Erica began the day
she left the Avises' home on Oct. 2. She first stayed with Zeman,
but then with other friends.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Zeman's ex-wife called Melodie Avis alleging he had
neglected his own children and that he was being investigated by
various law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the next few days, Melodie Avis said she
repeatedly asked police to arrest Zeman at either his apartment or
workplace at a car dealership for outstanding traffic warrants. She
said police wanted ``to put him behind bars so they could
fingerprint him'' to possibly link him to other incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Zeman said he lost both his job and apartment because of the
police visits and Melodie Avis' false accusations. He landed a job
as a salesman at another car dealership.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, without Zeman or Erica's knowledge, Melodie Avis
obtained a temporary restraining order from a judge keeping Erica
away from Bianca because of Zeman's alleged history of child abuse.
Melodie Avis' affidavit also said, ``At this time Crime Stoppers
and the U.S. Marshal are working on a case against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianca was already with the Avises when the order was issued.
The Zemans say the Avises took her from a day care center without
permission, but the Avises say Erica left the child with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just cried,'' Erica said about her reaction to the TRO.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 18, Zeman showed a judge letters from various law
enforcement agencies explaining he was not being investigated for
anything. By this time, he had also been cleared of Melodie Avis'
allegations of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The judge returned Bianca to Erica, giving the Avises visitation
rights during Christmas vacation.
</P>
<P>
   But one month later, the Avises brought the judge documents
showing Zeman also was being investigated for child neglect in
Illinois. The Avises denied these charges were filed by Zeman's
ex-wife to help their case. The judge allowed Erica to keep Bianca,
but wanted to hold a hearing in Harris County after the Illinois
matter was scheduled to be heard on March 4.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, however, a hearing was held in which the Avises were
granted extended weekend visitations every week from Wednesdays
through Sundays. The judgment was entered because neither the
Zemans nor their attorney, Jim Farmer, showed up.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were never notified. Farmer said the Avis'
attorney, Bruce Zivley, had no proof that he ever notified the
other side. Zivley said it was the court's duty to inform Farmer,
and a court clerk did so.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said if he had been notified by the court he would have
come.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter and distrustful, Erica refused to take Bianca to the
Avises until late April, after a judge had already cited her for
contempt and had threatened to send her to jail.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Kagle denied the Zeman's request to have a jury trial to
hear the final disposition of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Zivley said the judge denied the motion because Zeman didn't pay
his jury fee. Zeman has a certified mail receipt showing he
notified Zivley on May 4 and a receipt from the county dated May 1
showing he paid his $30 jury fee.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview at the Avises' home, they showed a reporter
a videotape they made to ostensibly show how much Bianca fears
going to the Zemans' home.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time for Bianca to leave the Avis' house during a
recent visit, Melodie Avis clutched the girl and spoke in grave
tones about how Bianca needed to go back to her mother's.
</P>
<P>
   As Bianca became more and more agitated, one of Melodie Avis'
daughters from before her marriage to Kevin Avis tried to calm
Bianca down by saying, ``Nobody's going to hurt you, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Melodie Avis interrupted her daughter, telling her, ``Don't say
that, you don't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm careful not to make promises to kids that I'm not sure
about,'' she explained to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The Zemans said they will try to appeal the ruling, but they
don't have much money for a protracted legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   The families, who belong to the same church, initially tried to
resolve their differences with the help of their pastors. In a
letter dated Nov. 20, Mark Zeman expressed this wish to Kevin Avis:
</P>
<P>
   ``As it says in 1 Corinthians 6:1-8, `we should not take our
disputes to worldly courts, but resolve them with the help of God
and our fellow believers.' ''

PREPARATION BUILDS FOR CLINTON'S TRIP TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among the learned volumes and fat briefing books on
China piled by President Clinton's bedside to prepare him for his
trip next week is a videocassette of ``The Gate of Heavenly
Peace,'' a gripping three-hour documentary about the Tiananmen
Square demonstrations of June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   There are many lessons in the film, which takes a cold-eyed look
at the weeks of pro-democracy protests and the June 4 massacre that
brought them to a sudden end.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most profound lesson is expressed by a teacher who
warned his students before the protests about the tactics of the
demonstrators, knowing that the government would not tolerate
usurpation of China's most sacred public place. Progress toward a
more open and tolerant society in China would come only gradually,
the professor said, and with much pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``History is this kind of process,'' he told the filmmakers,
Carma Hinton and Richard Gordon. ``There's no way to sort things
out neatly.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the heart of the message that the president's advisers
have been pressing on Clinton as they subject him to a crash course
on China's culture, its recent history and the fragile state of
United States-China relations. Do not ask too much, nor expect too
much, from a single visit, they advise. It is but one step on a
long journey.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential seminar has been unusually compressed, with
much of the serious work yet to be done as Clinton and his huge
entourage prepare to depart for China on Wednesday. The trip,
originally set for late fall, was moved up to reward China for
perceived progress on human rights and to put Clinton on display on
the international stage as a distraction from domestic personal and
political difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The preparation of the president is being conducted chiefly by
his national security adviser, Samuel Berger, assisted by numerous
specialists from throughout the government, think tanks and
academia.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Berger's office has been deluged with solicited
and unsolicited advice from Congress, interest groups, business
organizations and China experts.
</P>
<P>
   One overwhelmed senior White House adviser doing preparatory
work said he receives 40 phone messages and 40 faxes a day but
answers only the most urgent. ``We're engaged in heavy triage
here,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the contributions from outsiders, the White House
has received a torrent of background papers from the State,
Defense, Commerce and Agriculture departments, the Central
Intelligence Agency and the trade representative's office. All have
to be distilled into the material that will be presented to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Aides involved in preparing the president and Hillary Rodham
Clinton do not know (or will not say) whether the Clintons have
plowed through the voluminous material they have already received.
As is his custom, Clinton is not likely to begin cramming for the
trip until just before his departure. And he will have 16 hours
aboard Air Force One en route to his first stop, in Xian, to study.
</P>
<P>
   While government China experts have been toiling virtually
around the clock to complete the details of the trip, the
president's attention has been only episodic, according to one
senior official involved in the planning.
</P>
<P>
   He consulted with aides before delivering a major address on
China policy at the National Geographic Society on June 11. He
spent an hour on Thursday meeting with religious leaders who
recently returned from a visit to China to observe the progress
toward religious freedom there.
</P>
<P>
   But he also had to make time to attend political fund-raisers,
to monitor the collapse of antismoking legislation and to socialize
with journalists at a White House picnic. He travels to Nashville,
Tenn., on Monday to speak at a conference on the American family.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The real crunch begins early next week, when the president is to
meet privately with a group of China scholars and other experts,
aides said. But no time has been set for the meeting and no
invitations have gone out, they added, and Clinton may not find
time for a final review session with outsiders before his
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Among those the president has consulted in the past are Harry
Harding of George Washington University, Kenneth Lieberthal of the
University of Michigan, Nicholas Lardy of the Brookings
Institution, Michael Swaine of the Rand Corp., Merle Goldman of
Boston University and Richard Solomon of the U.S. Institute of
Peace.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's classwork centers chiefly on substantive issues
_ missile proliferation, human rights, Asia's economic troubles _
he is also being briefed on matters of protocol and the behavior
expected of a visiting head of state.
</P>
<P>
   The White House does not want to repeat an ugly incident that
marred the last presidential visit to China, President Bush's
two-day trip to Beijing in February 1989. The White House invited a
prominent dissident, Fang Lizhi, to a banquet and then stood
helplessly by as Chinese authorities forcibly prevented Fang from
attending.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. blunder and the Chinese reaction could have been
anticipated if Bush had been more sensitive to his host's needs,
according to Robert Kapp, president of the U.S.-China Business
Council, who has studied and worked in China for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understand, China is a place where for 5,000 years the
correctness of your behavior depends on the role you are playing,''
Kapp said. ``The role of foreign guest is very formalized, with a
series of conventions on both sides. He must show respect for his
hosts, and while he may speak bluntly about his concerns, he must
do so in a way that allows the Chinese to maintain their dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, there is no public meeting with dissidents on
Clinton's schedule. But aides suggest that the president will find
a way to quietly visit with outspoken opponents of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't respond very well to threats and to
isolation,'' Clinton said in brief appearance at the White House
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides marvel at how quickly the president learns his
brief and steps into his prescribed role. While they are under
intense pressure to complete the preparation before the nine-day
trip, Clinton appears blithely unconcerned about the grueling
public schedule he faces and its potential pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he thrives on that kind of thing,'' one senior White
House official involved in the preparations said. ``It's like an
actor before a big performance _ the whole phase of being down
before the curtain comes up, and then going on and putting on the
show.''

MANY IN POLL WANT STIFFER LAWS ON JUVENILE CRIMINALS
<TEXT>
<P>
   (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) &QL; 
 &QL; 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ &QL; 
1998c. Houston Chronicle &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Despite signs that a 1995 crackdown on juvenile
offenders is working, many Texans want even more stringent
sanctions for young criminals, including requirements that all
youthful offenders be sent to adult prisons when they turn 17 years
old and that all juvenile murderers be tried as adults, according
to the latest Texas Poll.
</P>
<P>
   But kids aren't the only targets of those wanting to reduce
juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   A significant number of those polled said parents should be held
legally accountable, through fines or imprisonment, for the
criminal acts of their children _ a notion that Texas lawmakers
rejected as unconstitutional when they rewrote the juvenile justice
code.
</P>
<P>
   The poll said that while Texans still overwhelmingly support the
death penalty for adults, most people oppose a proposal to allow
death sentences for offenders as young as 11. That proposal is
likely to be debated in the 1999 legislative session because of the
national rash of schoolhouse shootings by juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unanimously, Texans described juvenile crime as a
``serious problem'' and most of the respondents said parents are
the ``major cause'' of juvenile delinquency. A distant second on
the blame list was drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 adults were queried by the Scripps Howard Texas
Poll on juvenile crime issues earlier this month. The results,
calculated by the University of Texas Office of Survey Research,
carried a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   On several issues, the results indicated widespread support for
harsher treatment of young offenders:
</P>
<P>
   1) Seventy-three percent of the respondents said juveniles in
the custody of the Texas Youth Commission automatically should be
sent to adult prisons when they turn 17 years old. Current law
gives juvenile court judges the option of transferring them to
adult prisons of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   2) Fifty-five percent said juveniles, regardless of their age,
should be tried as adults if they're accused of murder. Existing
law specifies that murder suspects must have been at least 14 when
they committed the crime in order to face trial as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   3) Twenty-five percent favor a change in law so juries can
impose death sentences on juveniles as young as 11 years old, even
though the U.S. Supreme Court requires that the offender be at
least 17.
</P>
<P>
   Some 66 percent of the poll respondents rejected the proposal,
but its chief proponent said the findings are nonetheless
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regard this as an awakening call to Austin that enough is
enough,'' said state Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, who plans to
submit the death penalty proposal in next year's session.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts is expected to encounter stiff opposition there. Gov.
George W. Bush has already stated he sees no reason to change
current law that sets 14 as the age at which a juvenile can be
certified to stand trial as an adult. State Rep. Toby Goodman,
R-Arlington, architect of the 1995 reform package and chairman of
the House Committee on Juvenile Justice and Family Issues, likewise
opposes Pitts' suggestion. It was first floated after the quintuple
homicide at a Jonesboro, Ark., school attributed to youths 13 and
11 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman described Pitts' proposal as unconstitutional and ``a
moot point,'' adding, ``I'd be opposed to it even if there weren't
a Supreme Court decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing other poll findings, Goodman tossed cold water on the
idea of punishing parents for their kids' crimes. Again, it's a
problem of unconstitutionality, he said, noting that lawmakers
carefully analyzed the parental responsibility issue in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The result, he said, was a decision to allow juvenile judges to
hold parents in contempt of court if they don't see to it that
their children make restitution and attend school and counseling
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sentence a parent to jail for something the child
did _ unless the parent participated in the act, and then they
would be a co-conspirator anyway,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that public sentiments about the severity of the
juvenile crime problem belie statistics indicating that existing
reforms already have made a positive impact. The Texas Department
of Public Safety reported that the 181,625 juvenile arrests in 1997
represented a 2.4 percent decrease compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's particularly important because the (number of) offenses
for which juveniles can be referred to the juvenile authorities has
increased significantly,'' Goodman said. ``All the statistics are
indicating that what we did worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than formulate a strict rule requiring all juveniles to
be tried as adults, lawmakers opted for flexibility with hopes that
confinement by the TYC would be effective, Goodman said. Even so,
the law leaves room for long-term incarceration for aggravated
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can try a juvenile as an adult if the juvenile court
waives jurisdiction and if the offense was committed after the
juvenile's 14th birthday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, ``if a 10- or an 11-year-old commits murder, they're
subject to a 40-year prison stay. They're subject to a 10-year
minimum before they're released and I don't think the public's
aware of that,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Poll coordinator Ty Meighan said the results, when broken
down by region and age groups, yielded a few intriguing findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interestingly, younger Texans are least likely to support
fines or prison for parents of juvenile criminals,'' he said.
Thirty-seven percent of 18- to 29-year-olds said they would support
such a law, compared with 53 percent of respondents 60 and older.

HEADWATERS FOREST FIGHT ENDING MUCH AS IT BEGAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL DAWSON 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUREKA, Calif. _ In the silence of the primeval Headwaters
Forest, which Houston businessman Charles Hurwitz planned to cut,
it's easy to believe the end of the clamorous battle over this
largest unprotected grove of ancient redwoods is finally in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the virgin forest, however, the debate hasn't grown much
quieter in what may be its waning days.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are maneuvering. Press releases are flying. And a
young woman named Butterfly is living in a tree she calls Luna,
declaring in as many interviews as her supporters can line up that
a pending deal to preserve Headwaters isn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   If the Headwaters fight is drawing to a close, it's ending in
much the same way it has played out since 1986, when it became one
of the most acrimonious environmental issues of recent times.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year Hurwitz, Maxxam's chief executive, seized
control of Pacific Lumber Co. with high-interest junk bonds from
the later-jailed Michael Milken. The Houston businessman also
controls Kaiser Aluminum and Sam Houston Race Park.
</P>
<P>
   After a study showed Pacific Lumber had more standing timber
than was thought, Hurwitz doubled its logging rate and replaced
``selective'' harvesting with clearcutting, which removes all the
trees from an area.
</P>
<P>
   The redwoods in the 3,000-acre Headwaters grove, some worth tens
of thousands of dollars, tower more than 300 feet above fern-clad
slopes where they took root a millennium and more ago. In the dim
light, fading slashes of blue paint on huge trunks are the only
obvious signs that humans ever set foot here. They mark the trees
Hurwitz once planned to cut down.
</P>
<P>
   But if a sale negotiated with state and federal officials in
1996 can be finalized in the next few months, the Headwaters grove
will become the core of a government preserve of 7,500 acres. That
could also close the last major chapter in a much older
conservation issue.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years after large-scale logging of old-growth redwoods
began, prominent Californians in 1918 founded the Save-the-Redwoods
League. Raising funds to buy groves, they expressed feelings of awe
and reverence for the ancient trees that echo in the later
Headwaters debate.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists seeking to save Headwaters combined spiritual
and biological arguments for protecting the old-growth ecosystem
and its wildlife. In Hurwitz, they confronted a philosophy that
views redwoods as an agricultural commodity, like corn or wheat _
insensitive, some individuals who know him say, to aspects other
than economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it's a clash of values,'' said Rabbi Les
Scharnberg, an environmentalist from Arcata, Calif., near
Headwaters, who has talked with Hurwitz. In keeping with his usual
practice, Hurwitz declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The coast redwood, world's tallest tree and one of the oldest,
grows only in a thin band from mid-California to southern Oregon.
Of the original 2 million acres of old-growth redwoods _ trees
about 200 years and older _ only 5 percent remains, mostly in
parks. Pacific Lumber owns most major ancient groves in private
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Company and state officials would not release figures, but the
Save-the-Redwoods League estimates Pacific Lumber had cut half the
old-growth redwoods it had when Maxxam took over. Proposed
restrictions would let it cut about half of what is left.
</P>
<P>
   These land-use rules, which would govern the 202,000 acres PL
would keep after selling Headwaters, resulted from months of thorny
negotiations by company and government officials. A federal habitat
conservation plan would protect an array of wildlife species. A
complementary state forestry plan would guard watersheds and ensure
``maximum sustained production'' of timber.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, the habitat plan would grant a much-desired permit
under the Endangered Species Act, authorizing otherwise illegal
actions _ ``incidental'' deaths of protected wildlife and
destruction of their habitat. In recent years, PL has had trouble
keeping an old-growth mill running at the same time it complied
with that law, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The Headwaters sale is contingent on adoption of the two plans,
expected to be issued for 90 days of public comment this month
after weeks of delay as biologists and lawyers massaged fine
points. When an agreement on key principles was announced in
February, California's Republican Gov. Pete Wilson declared it
``puts an end to years of debate'' over Headwaters. That hasn't
come close to happening yet, however.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would allow logging on about 10,000 acres of
old-growth redwoods, 8,700 acres of old-growth Douglas fir and
176,000 acres of younger trees. The rules would prohibit logging
redwoods on nearly 8,000 acres, including 4,200 acres of old-growth
in all but one of PL's major remaining groves and in smaller,
scattered stands. This ban would last 50 years, but could end
earlier if numbers of the marbled murrelet, a rare seabird species
that nests in old-growth trees, increase enough.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ...a rare seabird species that nests in old-growth trees,
increase enough.
</P>
<P>
   Separate rules to reduce erosion into streams were designed to
protect coho salmon. Scientists say logging and other practices
have decimated its populations in northern California and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Wilson put the state's share of the $380 million
sale price negotiated for Headwaters in his proposed budget to
avoid possible voter rejection in a bond issue. Despite strong
support from his one-time electoral opponent, Democratic U.S. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, the prospects for approval remain in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers allied with environmentalists and commercial salmon
fishermen have won committee approval for a measure to require
stronger conservation rules before state funds are provided.
</P>
<P>
   Maxxam spokesman Bob Irelan said, however, that the negotiated
rules are ``as far as the company can go.'' And Feinstein, who
brokered the Headwaters sale, has warned that state legislators
will kill the deal if they insist on tougher logging restrictions.
Without California's share, a federal appropriation of $250 million
expires in March.
</P>
<P>
   The very word ``Headwaters'' says a lot about the issue's
remarkable trajectory to national prominence since its earliest
days.
</P>
<P>
   A trespassing hiker from Earth First!, a small, structureless
group, coined the name in 1986 when he discovered the grove.
Although they objected to the name for years, Hurwitz and his
companies finally started using it themselves, despite Earth
First!'s role as their fierce and persistent critic.
</P>
<P>
   The group is responsible for an unremitting barrage of invective
aimed personally at Hurwitz. It also has staged a long series of
``nonviolent direct actions'' to slow logging, which Pacific Lumber
President John Campbell calls ``antics.'' (In the 1980s, the group
was accused of ``tree-spiking'' _ pounding large spikes into trees
_ which endangers loggers and mill workers.)
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Earth First! activists have locked themselves
to equipment and staged ``tree-sits'' in an old-growth area along a
stream outside Headwaters, where logging might be regulated more
strictly under the pending land-use rules.
</P>
<P>
   Earth First! has a ``no compromise'' philosophy, but after years
of failed political attempts at settlement _ including five federal
and three state legislative efforts and three state bond measures _
compromise is the essence of the deal now pending.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Wheeler, secretary of the California Resources Agency and
former national director of the Sierra Club, said it ``recognizes
both the need for the economic use of land zoned for that purpose
and identifies those parts of Pacific Lumber's holdings that hold
transcendent natural value and ought to be in the public domain.''
</P>
<P>
   As with most compromises, longtime combatants are uncomfortable
with this one. Although he signed the agreement, Campbell said he
``can't see the justice and the breadth of it.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of controversy and a changing regulatory situation,
however, company officials ``were after some sort of certainty,''
he said. ``We felt we needed to resolve the issue and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Lanman, program director of the private Environmental
Protection Information Center in Garberville, Calif., is not that
reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   ``No deal's better than a bad deal _ that's just the way it
is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   EPIC, oriented toward research and litigation, was founded in
the late 1970s to fight aerial herbicide spraying on private and
federal timber lands.
</P>
<P>
   It has played a key role in the Headwaters issue's history,
filing 16 lawsuits over PL's logging practices since the Maxxam
takeover. Perhaps most crucial was a landmark case that extended
the Endangered Species Act's protection of wildlife habitat to
logging on private lands.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, Lanman said the federal habitat plan's waiver,
allowing some wildlife deaths and habitat disruption, is ``a
license to kill,'' and would ``undermine the law and biology we
have worked on so many years.''
</P>
<P>
   A former organizer for the United Farm Workers Union, Lanman
learned about forest and watershed issues when she and her
then-husband moved to Humboldt County, where PL operates, to become
self-reliant homesteaders.
</P>
<P>
   They were part of a back-to-the-land migration to northern
California that was far more in tune with the countercultural ethos
of the 1960s than the freewheeling business climate of the Reagan
era, when Hurwitz gained fame with corporate takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the college town of Arcata boasts the nation's first city
council with a Green Party majority, and the area's most famous
cash crop may not be trees: ``If marijuana were ever legalized,
this place would be Kuwait,'' a local prosecutor joked.
</P>
<P>
   If Hurwitz ever doubted Humboldt critics' ability to magnify the
Headwaters cause beyond their small communities, as some California
observers believe, he was soon proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Local environmentalists complained that he was liquidating a
priceless forest to pay off junk bonds, and the national media
picked up the theme. In 1989, even the conservative Reader's Digest
blamed ``corporate greed'' for ``California's chainsaw massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   The company tried to fight back, assailing ``radical
environmentalists'' and their ``emotional'' motives for saving the
Headwaters grove when much larger areas of old-growth redwoods were
already in parks.
</P>
<P>
   Even some critics concede Hurwitz introduced ``industrial
forestry'' policies at PL that were already common at other
northwestern timber companies. But the symbolism of Headwaters as
the ``last stand'' took root, along with the ``greed'' charges
Maxxam still tries to combat. Recently, it has publicized a
revisionist study by two University of Southern California
economists, who say Hurwitz acted mainly to boost profits, not pay
off his debt.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, it was not the sparring in the news media
but the Endangered Species Act that pushed the Headwaters issue
into talks that produced the pending settlement _ particularly,
decisions by federal officials to grant its protection to the
marbeled murrelet in 1992 and the coho salmon in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Without environmentalists' legal challenges to PL's harvest
plans under the species law, ``the company would have just
bulldozed its way through,'' and ``would have cut all their
old-growth by now,'' said Jeff Barrett, who joined PL as fish and
wildlife director this spring.
</P>
<P>
   A company lawsuit against the U.S. government, alleging its use
of the species law confiscated property without compensation, also
moved the issue toward resolution. Sources say Clinton
administration officials wanted to avoid an expensive legal fight
over this ``takings'' issue while the law is vulnerable to attack
in the Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who negotiated the federal habitat plan, meanwhile,
say it goes as far as the limits of the species law allow,
restricting logging only insofar as it would ``jeopardize'' the
continued existence of the murrelet and coho.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, who helped negotiate those rules as a consultant for
Pacific Lumber, said they will make it the industry leader in
protecting the environment. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``It's not an exaggeration to say this company is committed to
doing business totally differently than it has ever done business
before _ or any other timber company in the Northwest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have targeted the plan's temporary salmon rules,
however, because they are not as strict as federal officials'
no-logging buffer zones along streams in national forests. Erosion
can kill salmon eggs, fill pools where the fish's tiny prey thrive
and harmfully raise water temperatures in wider, shallower
channels. After a three-year study, officials will tailor
site-specific restrictions for PL that will probably be more
permissive than the temporary rules in some cases and more
restrictive in others, said Jim Lecky of the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based Sierra Club has pressed California
lawmakers to require changes in the salmon rules as a condition for
funding the Headwaters sale, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to give Charles Hurwitz another pot of money,
we'd like to know what we're getting in return,'' said Elyssa
Rosen, a regional representative for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said the rules, ensuring 75 percent to 95 percent of the
benefits of unlogged forests, will ``substantively restore coho
salmon on our land.'' Allowing some stream disturbance is
consistent with historical conditions in ancient groves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A biological debate about the marbeled murrelet's needs was
central to the question of how many acres of PL's old-growth forest
would be off limits to logging in the rules. The company argued for
16 months that selling the Headwaters grove provided enough habitat
for the bird, said Phil Detrich, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
official.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the company agreed to set aside ancient redwoods on
lands including all but one of six other large remaining groves _
its ``lesser cathedrals.'' This ban will last 50 years, but could
end earlier if the murrelet's status improves so much that
officials remove it from legal protection.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, PL would get to log in its choice of one of two
``lesser cathedrals'' _ Owl Creek, at the heart of EPIC's landmark
lawsuit, or Grizzly Creek, which the Save-the-Redwoods League wants
to buy to add to a state park.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Headwaters grove, environmentalists, elected
officials and others have called for Hurwitz to transfer extra land
to public ownership in a ``debt-for-nature'' swap to settle federal
banking charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   In a civil hearing that resumed last week in Houston, the Office
of Thrift Supervision alleges reckless banking practices by him and
others caused United Savings Association of Texas to fail in 1988,
costing taxpayers more than $1.6 billion. Hurwitz's attorneys say
the charges are politically motivated, and he was a victim, not
perpetrator, of the failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there were a debt, we wouldn't swap it for trees,''
Maxxam's Irelan said.
</P>
<P>
   But company and government officials evidently have discussed
the idea. In April, the Press Democrat of Santa Rosa, Calif.,
quoted Feinstein saying a ``debt-for-nature'' swap was possible,
and another U.S. official confirming talks have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding that report, Irelan said there is ``certainly not
anything ongoing'' in the way of discussions. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The best known advocate of ``debt-for-nature'' at the moment is
a woman from Arkansas, who came to Humboldt County last fall on a
``spiritual journey'' after recovering from severe injuries in a
traffic accident. She has lived since December atop one of Pacific
Lumber's ancient redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   PL had planned to cut this hilltop stand, next to an earlier
clearcut blamed by some residents for a 1997 landslide that
destroyed several homes in the tiny community of Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, Julia Butterfly (originally Hill) completed six full
months on her 180-foot-high platform _ the longest by far of many
``tree-sits'' by Earth First! activists over the years. Her
endurance has reaped a bonanza of coverage by CNN, Time, People,
Newsweek, The New York Times and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds almost kind of hippie-ish and hokey, but to heal the
forest, we have to heal ourselves first,'' the 24-year-old woman
said in an interview by cellular telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to tell Mr. Hurwitz that I love him as a human
being but I'm very, very sad about what he's doing because he's not
just destroying the forest, but destroying people's lives,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's chanting the same mantra _ Charles Hurwitz,
debt-for-nature,'' said Campbell, PL's Australian-born president,
with weary annoyance about such activities on company land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Headwaters is set aside,'' he said. ``We've set aside
additional old-growth. We're putting in a comprehensive landscape
scheme here. It's time for them, I think, to turn their energy to
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have used ``misinformation, certainly less
than factual statements'' during the long dispute, he said. ``They
have demonized Charles Hurwitz and they have demonized Pacific
Lumber when this is not true. I am affronted by that. It seems
almost un-American.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has been marked by angry confrontations over the
years between environmentalists and timber workers. Someone set a
fire at Campbell's house three years ago. In 1996, Hurwitz showed
up on a list of names found in later-convicted Unabomber Theodore
Kaczynski's Montana cabin, and last year a California protester hit
the businessman with a pie.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Darryl Cherney, prominent Earth First! activist and
publicist, is suing the FBI and Oakland police for allegedly
mishandling the investigation of an unsolved 1990 incident in which
a bomb exploded in a car, hurting him and severely injuring fellow
activist Judi Bari. Cherney and Bari, who died of cancer last year,
were arrested but released without charges.
</P>
<P>
   Cherney, a singer of his own biting topical songs and author of
other broadsides against Hurwitz, makes no apologies despite
Campbell's ``demonization'' charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Charles Hurwitz as a human being, very sick with the
greed disease,'' he said in the tiny office of his Environmentally
Sound Promotions business in Redway, Calif., where a colleague
maintains the ``Jail Hurwitz'' site on the World Wide Web
(www.jailhurwitz.com), dealing with the banking allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Cherney predicted protests and lobbying against the Headwaters
agreement will accelerate as the congressional funding deadline
next March approaches. But he admitted that if the deal goes
through, ``a lot of wind could be taken out of the sails of the
Headwaters Forest cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanman said EPIC will probably sue again if the habitat plan is
adopted as proposed. And Campbell said the company will continue
acquiring new timber land if the deal is finalized, but probably
return to its ``takings'' suit if it falls through.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of yet more litigation doesn't seem to appeal to
anyone, however, least of all Mike Spear, regional director of the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marbeled murrelet,'' he said, ``has a very poor chance of
coming out ahead when you throw it into claims court.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 49 deaf Mexican men and women whose ordeal as
virtual slaves in a quiet Queens County neighborhood shocked New
York and attracted national attention will be allowed to stay in
the United States, federal officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The illegal immigrants, who were forced to peddle trinkets in
the subway and turn over their earnings to ``bosses'' who sometimes
beat and abused them, will be permitted to remain because of their
help in convicting their tormentors, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The news came as the federal criminal case against the men and
women who victimized them ended on Friday with the sentencing of
the last of 18 bosses. The man, Agustin Rodriguez-Torres, was
sentenced to to the time he has already served, 10 months, for
crimes including conspiracy to commit slavery and harboring illegal
aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service said the
deaf Mexicans, who have been held under the agency's custody at a
motel in Queens for almost a year, would be released within 30
days. Then, city officials said, they will be allowed to stay in in
city-owned housing in Brooklyn for as long as they need to, and
will be free to go wherever they choose. The city has reserved $1
million for their care, said Gerome M. Hauer, the director of the
Mayor's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wishnie, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union
who represents the detainees, said he was relieved to hear that the
government did not intend to deport them. ``They are excited that
the case is over and the bosses who oppressed them are going to
jail,'' he said. ``At the same time, they are anxious to leave the
hotel and begin new lives in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how the Mexicans might make a living, but Wishnie
and city officials said several nonprofit organizations were
willing to pay for whatever training and schooling they will need
to be self-sufficient. In the meantime, other organizations are
prepared to help them to apply for whatever federal welfare
benefits and health care they may be eligible to receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be clothed, fed, their children will go to school.
They'll get everything they need,'' Hauer said. ``The mayor has
repeatedly said he is committed to help them and we will.''
</P>
<P>
   An INS spokesman, Russell A. Bergeron Jr., said the workers
would be allowed to apply for a special visa granted to people who
contribute significantly to a criminal investigation. Although the
workers do not have the visas yet, ``it is highly unlikely any of
them will be denied,'' Bergeron said. Those who want to return to
Mexico will be free to do so as soon as travel can be arranged, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Wishnie said that 10 to 15 of the workers want to go home,
including a woman who has not seen her two sons for years. However,
he said, many are worried about going back to Mexico because they
fear retaliation from the families of the men and women they helped
to convict.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the criminal case came exactly 11 months from the day
when four deaf Mexican immigrants walked into a police station in
Queens and handed an officer a note asking for help. An
investigation revealed that the immigrants were part of a larger
group of indentured laborers who had been smuggled in the country
and forced to work up to 20 hours a day selling $1 trinkets in the
city's subways. They were living in two cramped apartments in
Queens and sleeping on the floor. If they did not earn enough money
for their bosses, they were beaten and starved.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty people were indicted; two remain in a Mexican jail
awaiting trial and 18 pleaded guilty in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Rodriguez-Torres, who was sentenced on Friday,
was an enforcer who beat the workers and held them down while the
ringleaders shocked them with stun guns. His sentence was lenient,
though, because Rodriguez-Torres never initiated the violence
himself, prosecutors said, and because he cooperated with the
government from the start. He indicated in court yesterday that he
was sorry for what he had done and that he wanted to go home.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, about 45 of his victims watched from three benches
at the front of Judge Nina Gershon's courtroom. They looked serious
and transfixed, with their eyes moving from the judge to the sign
language interpreter translating the proceedings. Only after the
session was over did they begin to smile; several also wept
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   The other 17 bosses had been sentenced earlier this year to jail
terms that ranged from 14 years for Adriana Paoletti, the woman
considered to be the ringleader, to 5 years of probation for Frank
Coenen, who was charged with conspiracy to commit slavery but
cooperated with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied with the job we did, that the sentences were
fair and that justice was served,'' said Sandy Cohen, a prosecutor
in the case. Cohen said his office was seeking to extradite the two
bosses who remain in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the workers were found in the houses in Queens,
similar cases of abuse against deaf Mexicans were discovered in
North Carolina and in Chicago. Bergeron said the workers in North
Carolina had all opted to return home, but he did not know the
status of those in Chicago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the New York case wended its way through the courts, the
workers and their 11 children, including one born last week, the
fourth to be born in custody, were held at Westway Motor Inn, a
motel in Queens because they were important witnesses for the
prosecution of their ``bosses'' and because they entered the
country illegally. They filled their hours making arts and crafts,
watching Spanish language soap operas and playing board games.
Their view from their rooms was an expressway that leads to La
Guardia Airport. Beyond that, a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were detainees of INS, they were not allowed to go
outside without and escort and still are not. INS officers continue
to guard the doors to the motel.
</P>
<P>
   Wishnie said that for a long time the government did not raise
the possibility that his clients would be allowed to stay, refusing
to discuss the options until every single one of the men and women
convicted had pleaded guilty. It was only in February of this year,
he said, when the federal prosecutors in charge of the case began
exploring the possibilities of offering a legal status, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The visas they could soon receive, known as S-visas, are offered
to cooperating witnesses who can provide information for the
prosecution of cases in the United States, or those who, having
provided the information, fear for their lives once they return
home. They are difficult to obtain because INS grants only up to
250 a year for the entire country. To apply for one, the petitioner
has to have a law enforcement agency as a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the Mexicans have three sponsors: the INS, the
U.S. attorney and the Civil Rights Division of the Justice
Department. All agreed that visas were justified because of the
workers' ``significant contributions to the arrest, indictment and
conviction of the principals in this important case.'' The fact
that INS itself is sponsoring them makes them likely to receive the
visas, because the final decision is made by the attorney general
and INS.
</P>
<P>
   Once they have the S-visas, they can apply for legal residency
in three years, and for citizenship in five more years.

   STADIUM (Phoenix) _ The Arizona Cardinals and a group of backers
unveiled the largest redevelopment project in Arizona history
Friday, a $1.5 billion master-planned community on the Tempe-Mesa
border that would include a massive convention center and domed
stadium for the NFL team. The Cardinals said they would kick in as
much as $200 million to the 900-acre project, including$75 million
up-front. They claim that is the largest contribution a team has
ever made to a stadium project. The public would be asked to pay
$320 million through a voter-approved quarter cent sales tax that
would run for 20 years. Backers envision 12,000 people living
within Rio Salado Crossing and 10,000 people workingin a huge
office complex. By LISA GONDERINGER. Story will move in the ``A''
category.
</P>
<P>
   CARDS20 (Phoenix) _ Although Michael Bidwill says the Cardinals
are ``committed to Arizona,'' he and the team say they are not
focusing on anything beyond the November stadium vote. BY KENT

CLINTON URGED TO MEET TOP CHINA DISSIDENT
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A group of 55 democracy advocates from around China
has called on President Clinton to meet with a prominent Beijing
dissident during his visit to China next week as a visible symbol
of America's commitment to human rights. In a letter to President
Clinton faxed to foreign news agencies and to the U.S. embassy, the
group said the planned official welcome for Clinton ``on the bloody
red carpet on Tiananmen Square,'' where the military crushed
student-led demonstrations on June 3 and 4, 1989, was ``a source of
great grief.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting President Jiang Zemin, the letter said, Clinton
should meet with Xu Wenli, a 54-year-old veteran of democracy
activities from the late 1970s who spent 12 years in prison. Xu has
recently re-emerged as one of the most active remaining dissidents
inside the country, making public demands that the Communist
government allow free labor unions, multiple political parties and
an independent human rights monitor. In the last few months he has
been briefly arrested several times and warned to curtail his
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold that meeting with Mr. Xu Wenli, or at least strongly
demanding to meet with Mr. Xu Wenli, is a way to indicate that you
are genuinely concerned about the cause of democracy and human
rights,'' the letter said. If Clinton does not make the effort, it
said, ``we will not be able to believe that your trip to Beijing
will have any significance other than helping the Chinese
government to cast off the diplomatic shadows of June 4 in exchange
for your own political interests.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. embassy said the letter had been
forwarded to Washington. However, diplomats here said it was
extremely unlikely that Clinton would want to provoke the outrage
of the Chinese government by seeking a meeting with such an
outspoken critic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will firmly press the cause of human rights
during his visit, from June 25 to July 3. But overall, the trip has
been carefully scripted to cast light on China's growing diversity
and progress, in keeping with the desire of both governments to
cement smoother ties.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jiang's state visit to the United States last year, China
has sent from prison into exile its two most famous dissidents, Wei
Jingsheng, a contemporary of Xu's, and Wang Dan, a student leader
of 1989. But rights monitors abroad say that thousands of people
remain in jail or labor camps for publicly advocating democratic
change.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's letter was written by Wang Zechen, a lawyer in Liaoning
province. Most of the remaining signers are, like him, little known
either inside China or abroad but are part of a network of people
who, in the face of steady police harassment, are communicating by
e-mail and fax to call for major political change.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Xu, together with the best known among the
signers of the new letter, Qin Yongmin of Wuhan, started faxing out
regular reports on arrests of dissidents and other rights
developments. But the reports recently ceased after both men were
detained overnight and their fax machines, computers and other
materials confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are hoping that China will offer at least one nod
to human rights concerns during Clinton's visit, by announcing a
firm date for signing the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
   When China said last winter that it planned to sign the
document, which involves commitments to free speech and assembly,
the U.S. government said it would stop pursuing resolutions
critical of China's human rights policies in an annual U.N.
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   China did not say when it would sign or how soon after signing
that it might ratify the convention, nor did it say what
reservations it would make that would exempt it from selected
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   When China does join the convention, U.S. officials argue, it
will be subject to inspections and probing reports, a useful way to
nudge legal improvements here. But in the years before that occurs,
both countries will avoid confrontations over rights in the U.N.
forum.

IS DISNEY'S MAGIC GONE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Shares of The Walt Disney Co. have lost more than 15
percent of their value since reaching an all-time high seven weeks
ago, as Wall Street has become concerned that the entertainment
giant won't meet growth targets.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Disney declined 4 7/16 (seven-sixteenths) to 107 9/16
(nine-sixteenths) Friday and traded as low as 106 7/8
(seven-eights) as a trio of leading media trackers reducing
earnings estimates, following a loss of 2 5/16 (five-sixteenths) on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts cited a quartet of factors for the cuts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nonblockbuster performances of ``The Horse Whisperer'' and
``Six Days, Seven Nights,'' along with long-term concerns over
Disney's reduced spending on live-action films and increased
competition in animation.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cannibalization'' of attendance at its older Florida theme
parks due to Disney's Animal Kingdom, which opened in April, and
next year's opening of Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disappointing ratings at Disney's ABC television network and
increased costs of telecasting pro football at ABC and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   _ Soft sales of consumer products due to weaker economies in
Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Reif Cohen of Merrill Lynch and Richard Simon of Goldman
Sachs both sliced a dime from their forecasts for the fiscal year
ending Sept. 30, to $3. Ed Hatch of UBS Securities lowered his 1998
projection by 19 cents to $2.96 and cut 42 cents from his 1999
forecast to $3.25.
</P>
<P>
   Disney earned $1.89 billion, or $2.75 a share, on sales of
$22.47 billion in fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who has a ``hold'' rating on the stock, expects Disney's
shares to fall to 100 eventually. That would represent a 21 percent
decline from the all-time of 127 1/8 (one-eights) reached on May 4
amid optimism over prospects for Animal Kingdom, 1998 films and new
ventures such as Disney's cruise line.

TEMP AGENCIES HAVING HARD TIME WITH HIRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A tight labor market is putting the squeeze on the
hiring efforts of employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
   While a booming economy means more businesses are hiring, it
also means skilled workers are harder to find. That's a dilemma for
the staffing services industry, whose members include Manpower,
Kelly Services, Adecco, AppleOne and On Assignment Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a challenge for the staffing services industry to
be able to find people,'' said Bruce Steinberg, spokesman for the
National Association of Temporary and Staffing Services, a trade
group in Alexandria, Va. ``I think that growth will continue to be
constrained by low unemployment.''
</P>
<P>
   Manpower, the biggest U.S. temporary employment company, said
its annual growth has slowed to between 7 percent and 8 percent
from 10 percent to 12 percent. It said the decline is due to a
tight labor market, not from lack of business.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rudolph, On Assignment's chief financial officer, said
finding job candidates is harder, ``but we're able to fill
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of most of the publicly traded temporary employment
companies _ including Manpower and On Assignment _ have lost value
on Wall Street as a result of the bleaker forecast. Manpower shares
have fallen 26 percent in the past five trading days, while On
Assignment's have dropped 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The low jobless rate prompted AppleOne Employment Services to
take an innovative approach: This spring, it launched its
``Rehirement'' program, which seeks out people with established
careers who are not ready for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   To better find pools of potential job applicants, AppleOne is
opening seven new offices inside Wal-Mart stores this year to add
to about a dozen locations nationwide. None is in Southern
California.

KUCHAR HOLDING HIS OWN AGAINST THE PROS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On his Georgia Tech golf team, Matt Kuchar plays
second fiddle to Bryce Molder, the 1998 collegiate player of the
year. In the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament, he finished
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But surround him with a bunch of professionals at a major
championship and the perpetually perky Kuchar kicks it into a
higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   During yesterday's second round at the U.S. Open, for instance,
Kuchar kicked around British Open champ Justin Leonard and U.S.
Open champ Ernie Els for a second consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar, 19, carved out a 69 at the Olympic Club to move to 1
under par through 36 holes for a two-day total of 139, while his
more-celebrated playing partners struggled. Els, who shot a 70,
stands at 5 over. Leonard, who soared to 75, is 6 over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been beaten by an amateur in a long time,'' Els
said. ``At one point, I told him, `After this week, you might as
well turn pro. You'll have a 10-year exemption.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the PGA Tour rolled back the exemption limit for
major-championship winners to five years earlier this season. But
Els' point is well-taken. Kuchar, the toothy, upbeat media darling
who finished 21st at the Masters Tournament, has a legitimate
chance to become the first amateur since 1933 to win the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't try to convince Kuchar, who stands at two strokes off
the lead, of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Kuchar said, when asked if he felt like an
Open contender. ``I'm just having a great time, trying to play one
shot at a time, and I'll add it up at the end. I had no
expectations coming in here. But, who knows? Maybe I will win.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did at the Masters, the reigning U.S. Amateur champ has
become a gallery favorite at the Open with his engaging smile and
wide-open playing style. After hooking a drive into the left rough
at No. 9, Kuchar tried to play a 4-wood out of the tall grass to
reach the green in regulation. Instead, the ball went dead right
and he took bogey.
</P>
<P>
   After making double-bogey at No. 14, Kuchar attacked the pin at
the 15th hole and wound up in the tall rough on the short side of
the green _ a definite no-no, according to the textbook on Open
course management. Yet Kuchar pulled out a sand wedge and chipped
in for birdie from 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like the wheels were coming off after I missed the
green on 15. Then the chip went in, and all of a sudden, all the
momentum came right back,'' said Kuchar, who will be a junior if he
opts to return to Georgia Tech in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   As his son climbed the leader board, Peter Kuchar, who serves as
Matt's caddie, repeatedly pumped his fist or gestured gleefully
after good shots. At one point, Leonard asked Peter Kuchar to step
back so he could hit. On the 17th tee box, Els had to wait to hit
while Peter Kuchar walked in the rough more than 100 yards down the
fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Kuchar's father had been a distraction during the
round, a visibly distressed Leonard said: ``Next question. It does
me no good to answer that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar, who spent last week taking four final exams at Georgia
Tech, said his father exhibits ``very good golf etiquette'' on the
course and did not understand why he would be a distraction to
other players.
</P>
<P>
   The looming distraction for Kuchar, at this point, is a decision
on whether to return to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Masters, it was too bad to see that $40,000 go to
waste,'' Kuchar said of the paycheck he bypassed by competing as an
amateur. ``I'd love to turn pro. The money looks real good. But I
have no idea when it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The last amateur to dust the reigning champs from the British
and U.S. Opens through 36 holes was Leonard, who got the best of
Nick Faldo and Tom Kite in 1993 at Baltusrol Country Club. He opted
to finish college before joining the PGA Tour in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would advise Kuchar to do, Leonard didn't waver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay in school,'' Leonard said. ``He's playing great ... but I
think it's too important to finish school. Once you leave, you're
never going back. No one should kid themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar, at this point, figures people are kidding themselves if
they expect him to become the first amateur to win the Open since
Johnny Goodman in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in junior tournaments, I would be playing in the
last group and thinking, `What am I going to say when I get the
trophy?' I never won a single junior event,'' Kuchar said. ``So, I
have kind of learned to not think about that. Right now, I'm just
having a great time and I'm pretty close to contention.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the teen-ager has humbled two of golf's four
reigning major champions in a head-to-head setting over 36 holes.

Milutinovic works his magic
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well-traveled coach guides Nigeria past Bulgaria, into second
round
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ Before Friday's pivotal match against Bulgaria, Nigerian
coach Bora Milutinovic was asked about the rampant rumors
circulating that he actually had been fired three weeks ago but got
an 11th-hour reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   How lucky do you feel now, Bora, since you're leading maybe the
most surprising team of the World Cup into the second round?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Bora Milutinovic,'' he said. ``I always feel lucky. I'm
just that way _ a good soccer coach and a lucky man.''
</P>
<P>
   How else could the magnificent World Cup run the Nigerians are
making be explained?
</P>
<P>
   The Africans have hitched their hopes to a coach with a golden
World Cup touch, and it is paying off big, much like things did
when Milutinovic coached Mexico (1986), Costa Rica (1990) and the
United States (1994).
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria again put on a terrific show Friday, much to the delight
of its enthusiastic fans, in a 1-0 victory over 1994 Cup
semifinalist Bulgaria at Stade Parc des Princes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Nigerians opened the '98 Cup with an impressive
3-2 upset of Spain, which was considered the favorite to win Group
D _ the so-called ``Group of Death.'' Now, with two victories and
six points, Nigeria has already guaranteed itself first place in
the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great compliment to African football that we have
qualified for the second round,'' Milutinovic said. ``This team
earned its place. It was a nervous team before we played Spain, but
now it is a confident team. Winning resolves everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Long considered a talented team but one prone to fall short of
expectations, the Nigerians have played wonderfully.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's game against Bulgaria, Victor Ikpeba kicked in the
eventual game-winner in the 27th minute after a big run sparked by
Jay-Jay Okocha, with Daniel Amokachi getting a nice assist to a
sliding Ikpeba, who pushed it past the goalie.
</P>
<P>
   It was an athletic, well-designed play that the Nigerians would
repeat often during the day, although only the one goal hit the
net. Nigeria outshot Bulgaria 21-13 and had seven shots on goal to
Bulgaria's three.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing a very disciplined game but keeping the pressure
on the goal,'' Ikpeba said. ``We're making plays that are difficult
to make, but they seem easy.''
</P>
<P>
   For Milutinovic, it is an all too familiar World Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   He now has coached four nations past the first round of the Cup.
In 1986, he helped Mexico to the quarterfinals. In 1990, Costa Rica
became the first Central American team ever to make it past the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Milutinovic survived his own firing.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the Nigerian soccer federation tired of the sluggish
efforts put forth by the Nigerians in Cup-preparation matches and
told Milutinovic he would be replaced. But Nigerian president Sani
Abacha stepped in and told officials to keep Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Abacha died of a heart attack, but the
federation officials kept to his order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could thank (Abacha),'' Milutinovic said. ``He would
enjoy this game that we are playing now.''

 Intergraph Punched By Intel   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Intel struck back at its rival Intergraph Corp. this week, asking
an Alabama judge to throw out the central portion of Intergraph's
lawsuit against Intel.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Santa Clara chipmaker also is seeking unspecified damages
from Intergraph, an Alabama maker of large corporate computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're conducting a vigorous defense,'' Intel spokesman Chuck
Mulloy said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Intergraph's lawsuit forms part of the basis of the antitrust
action that the Federal Trade Commission launched against Intel
earlier this month. In addition, Intergraph already has won a
preliminary injunction, under which Intel now must share key
information with Intergraph, and rebuffed Intel's efforts to move
the case from Alabama to California.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which recorded more than $25 billion in sales last year,
controls more than 90 percent of the market for microprocessors,
the chips that run personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Intergraph sued Intel in November, charging that the giant chip
company used its market clout to bully it in a patent dispute. With
a filing late Wednesday, Intel said it had the right to use its
intellectual property to defend itself, making a legal formality of
claims that it had already asserted in public statements.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Edwin Nelson set a trial
date of Feb. 14, 2000. Nelson also indicated that he will hear
arguments on Intel's motion for summary judgment around October,
Mulloy said.
</P>
<P>
   Before this dispute, Intel and Intergraph enjoyed a cooperative
relationship. Intel supplied Pentium chips for Intergraph's
workstations &UR; .  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As part of that relationship, Intel also supplied advanced
information about the next chips it would release, enabling
Intergraph to speed up the designs of its machines.
</P>
<P>
   Intergraph says the relationship soured when Intel sought patent
rights to Intergraph's Clipper chip. Intel says it has the rights
to the Clipper chip, thanks to a quirk of law.
</P>
<P>
   The Clipper chip was owned by Fairchild Semiconductor. When
National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild, it also took ownership
of the rights to the Clipper chip, but it quickly sold those rights
to Intergraph.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, however, says because it has a broad cross-licensing
agreement with National, it now has the rights to the Clipper chip.
When Intergraph denied those rights to Intel, Intel responded by
withholding the advanced information about its Pentium chips, an
action that Intergraph says hurt its business.
</P>
<P>
   Under the preliminary injunction that Judge Nelson granted in
April, Intel has been supplying Intergraph with the advanced
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intergraph's case isn't just about patent infringement,''
Intergraph chief executive Jim Meadlock said in a statement
yesterday. ``It's about Intel's willful and unconscionable
anti-competitive behavior that threatened to put Intergraph out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, the FTC, citing similarities between Intergraph's
case and prior disputes that Intel had with Compaq Computer Corp.
and Digital Equipment Corp., filed suit charging the company with
abusing its monopoly in microprocessors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Guiding a chestnut gelding as it stepped carefully over
obstacles in a ring in Huntington, N.Y., Tricia Schrader could have
been any novice rider preparing for her first competition. She sat
erect. She seemed confident, in control. Not until she spoke did
her disabilities become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ... feel,'' she said, very slowly, in a barely audible
whisper, pausing during a practice one Saturday last month, ``I ...
feel ... I'm ... the ... master ... of ... the ... horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, doctors told Ms. Schrader she would never again
master walking, let alone riding. She was 17, a week from her
senior prom, when a truck rammed into the side of her car. After
eight months in a coma, she awoke with head injuries that
immobilized her legs and skewed her balance and muscular control.
She has thrown herself into all kinds of therapies. But riding, she
said, actually lets her feel normal for a while _ and it is the
only therapy that is not a chore.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of physical and occupational therapists are
using horses in treatment, contending that the physical rigors of
riding strengthen the limbs and muscles of people with cerebral
palsy, multiple sclerosis, paraplegia and other disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   And some proponents of therapeutic riding go even further,
asserting that the emotional bonding and mental discipline involved
can help children with autism and patients with addictions and a
range of emotional and behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely powerful tool,'' said Barbara Glasow, a
founder of the 500-member American Hippotherapy Association, whose
name refers to the medical use of a horse. ``You can achieve
posture and balance control in half the time,'' compared with
therapeutic devices and machines, she said. ``It improves mobility,
flexibility, fine motor control.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more compelling, she said, are the emotional benefits.
``Autistic kids learn to talk about horses,'' she said. ``Using
horses to open a person's diaphragm and get them breathing better _
that's physical therapy. But horses that give a child the desire to
talk _ that's magic.''
</P>
<P>
   While the concept of riding as therapy is not new, the notion of
horses as healers who can touch troubled souls is attracting a wave
of attention in popular culture. Films and best-selling books
portray horses as full-fledged characters, with their own
personalities, emotions and wounded psyches.
</P>
<P>
   In the film version of the novel ``The Horse Whisperer,'' Robert
Redford plays a laconic Montana trainer who does crisis counseling
for Pilgrim, a traumatized horse _ and through that, connects with
its owner, a chilly New York mother, and her injured daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Buck Brannaman, a horse trainer from Sheridan, Wyo., who was one
of the models for the Redford character, speaks almost mystically
of the powers of horses. ``Horses,'' he said, ``are incredibly
forgiving. They fill in places we're not capable of filling
ourselves. They've given people a new hope, a new lease on life. A
horse really wants to please you, to get along.''
</P>
<P>
   Metaphysical musings aside, riding therapy is not for everyone.
The majority of disabled riders are children, but some young
patients are terrified and want nothing to do with the horses. And
while many disabled people who use horse therapy get discounts,
stables that offer the therapy are few and far between, mostly
because they are expensive to run.
</P>
<P>
   And while the practice has been recognized by the associations
of physical and occupational therapists, it is not approved by the
American Medical Association _ or covered by the vast majority of
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that there are only a few scattered studies on the
subject. More research may emerge, though, now that some colleges
are adding horse therapy to existing equine studies programs, said
Octavia Brown, director of equine studies at Centenary College in
Hackettstown, N.J., where students can major in therapeutic riding.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Zaro, executive director of the Autism Society of America
in Bethesda, Md., said she had little information about the
effectiveness of riding in treating autism. But, like others who
work with handicapped people, she said an activity like riding
could probably do no harm, and might well help by improving
confidence and coordination.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Kampmann of Riverside, Conn., whose 7-year-old autistic
daughter rides, said the greatest benefit was an intangible one.
``Mostly, it's a normal thing she can do,'' Ms. Kampmann said.
``Anything a typical child could do, that your child can do, you
jump on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many adult riders with disabilities, like Christina Nazzaro, 38,
of Bethpage, N.Y., also find the experience liberating. ``I love, I
love,'' Ms. Nazzaro, who is deaf and developmentally disabled,
said, signing the words enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of therapeutic riding has grown steadily since
the North American Riding for the Handicapped Association in Denver
was founded in 1969. More than 500 centers around the country,
including 39 in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, are
affiliated with the group, which certifies instructors and offers
insurance. About 60 new centers join each year while about 40 drop
out, mostly for financial reasons, said Bill Scebbi, executive
director of the riding group.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of psychologists are even using horses in treating a
variety of mental and emotional problems, from troubled teen-agers
and young sex offenders to the sexually abused and people with
anorexia. These psychologists say riding gives troubled people
feelings of being in control and teaches power through gentle
behavior. Antisocial teen-agers must curb aggressive behavior to
win a horse's cooperation. Victims of abuse can develop trust in a
horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horses are kind and gentle, but large enough to protect
themselves,'' said Philip Tedeschi, a social worker at the Resource
Center for High-Risk Youth in Denver. ``Holding the reins,
controlling a large animal _ it's tremendously uplifting to kids
who've been downtrodden and out of control. It really works with
notoriously difficult juvenile offenders.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Physically disabled people, like those with cerebral palsy or
multiple sclerosis, benefit by moving with the horse, exercising
their unused muscles and relaxing their rigid ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gait of a horse is an exaggerated form of the gait of a
person,'' said Jay Colan, executive director of Pegasus Therapeutic
Riding in Darien, Conn. ``Forward and back, side to side, up and
down. For someone who doesn't have the experience of walking, being
on a horse trains muscle groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Most instructors are people who have ridden since childhood and
learned therapy techniques at the riding centers, in college
courses or through training offered by the Riding for the
Handicapped group. Both instructors and volunteers are schooled in
safety measures. Horses, too, are trained to be steady and to
ignore distractions like a child's pummeling. The trick is to get
riders off spooked horses uninjured, Colan said. ``We train people
to catch them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scebbi said he knew of no serious injuries among riders at
member centers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the insurance necessary to run a therapeutic
riding stable, combined with the cost of buying and caring for
horses, can make it a struggle to keep a riding center going.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Gatti, a special education teacher, founded Pal-O-Mine
Equestrian Inc. on Long Island, which is where Ms. Schrader rides.
After five years, Ms. Gatti is still depending on her parents for
support. Officially she charges $50 an hour for lessons, but many
of her 150 clients cannot afford that and end up paying less.
</P>
<P>
   Pegasus, with 200 clients and 10 centers, has an annual budget
of $500,000. It has received some relatively large donations,
including $5,000 recently from the Christopher Reeve Foundation.
But most of its budget comes from events like fairs and raffles,
and it depends on hundreds of volunteers who work as riding aides
or who raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it because, when the alarm goes off, we can't wait to go
to work,'' Ms. Gatti said.
</P>
<P>
   Most disabled children who have tried the therapy cannot wait,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents say, `My kid talks about horses, he draws horses,'''
Colan said. ``This is about socializing, too. This may be their
only outdoor recreation.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty Roberts, author of ``The Man Who Listens to Horses,'' said
children find horses compelling: ``It's a huge animal. It's
athletically superior, and it wants to be your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   When Michelle Teichmann _ a 12-year-old with severe cerebral
palsy _ began riding five years ago, she flopped over the horse's
neck like a rag doll. Now, with an aide behind, holding her hips,
she sits, swaying forward. Walking along each side is another aide.
</P>
<P>
   The bouncing motions strengthen her trunk and force her to
straighten her back, said her mother, Camille Teichmann. In a year
or two, perhaps, she may be able to sit up without support. At
Pal-O-Mine, Michelle was squirming with excitement when she was
placed on a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbing, she grinned, as she did since being wheeled out of the
car for her lesson. Not much else makes her grin this much, her
mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to get somebody in a clinic to do those movements on a
machine is boring,'' said Jane Fitzpatrick, a physical therapist at
Pegasus. ``Kids on horses will do this for 40-minute sessions and
have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Schrader, riding is not just a pleasure but a chance to
excel. At a disabled-riding competition last month in California,
she placed first in two events. It was the first time she had
competed since high school, where she was on the swimming, bowling
and soccer teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I am trotting,'' she said, as Pat, her mother,
interpreted. ``Next year I will be cantering. The year after, maybe
I will be jumping.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding and winning, she added, ``was a high for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me feel like myself again. I haven't felt like that in
10 years.''

 Software Group Seeks Probe Of Microsoft   By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Netscape, Justice Department, Ralph Nader: Meet Microsoft's latest
critic _ the Software Publishers Association.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the Washington, D.C., trade group counts Microsoft as
one of its biggest members, it asked the Justice Department
yesterday to investigate Microsoft's practices in the corporate
software server market.
</P>
<P>
   In a 40-page report, the group accused Microsoft of using
monopolistic practices in promoting Windows NT _ which is a
corporate operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This paper goes to the heart of the question: Is there
opportunity in the software industry?'' said Ken Wasch, president
of the association, which represents 1,200 firms.
</P>
<P>
   But some say the question should be: Why is the trade
association biting the hand that feeds it?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really stupid,'' said Rob Enderle, analyst at Giga
Information Group in Santa Clara. ``This is not what you do as a
trade organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft agrees. In a sharply worded letter, Microsoft Chief
Operating Officer Bob Herbold accused the trade group of caving in
to pressures from a few members that are Microsoft competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new `white paper' seems to be the latest iteration of
some sort of anti-Microsoft campaign by a few SPA members and some
of your staff,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this is not the group's first &LR;   &LR; anti-Microsoft action.
In February, the SPA released a thinly veiled attack against the
software giant as part of a set of ``competition principles'' for
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, SPA President Wasch has been increasingly outspoken
about his concern that Microsoft's monopoly needs to be restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's action, however, was the group's most direct attack
yet. The report, titled, ``Competition in the Network Market: The
Microsoft Challenge,'' states that Microsoft is unfairly leveraging
its dominance of PC desktops into a new market _ networked
computing.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the report alleges that Microsoft:
</P>
<P>
   _Requires third-party software developers to make programs run
on Windows NT in order to be labeled compliant with Windows 95 or
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   _Bundles other software applications, such as Internet programs,
with Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   _Charges customers less for other Microsoft products if they
purchase Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   _Discourages competitors by announcing new features of Windows
NT months before they are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charges mirror almost exactly the accusations leveled
against Microsoft related to Windows 98,'' said Mike Elgan, editor
of Windows Magazine in Jericho, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Despite the SPA's stance, a Microsoft spokesman said the firm
has no plans to quit the trade group.

SPORTS COLUMN: KUCHAR CAN'T WIN OPEN. OR CAN HE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It can't happen. The 98th U.S. Open here at
Olympic can't be won by an amateur golfer, if only because an
amateur golfer hasn't won the Open since 1933. But if Matt Kuchar
is still under par after the final round Sunday, his 20th birthday,
well, maybe, just maybe, an amateur could win.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Matt Kuchar, the big kid with the big smile that
lighted up the Masters two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be a junior at Georgia Tech, but he's not even considered
the best golfer on the team there. He didn't win the recent
national collegiate championship. He didn't even win the Atlantic
Coast Conference tournament title.
</P>
<P>
   But as the reigning U.S. Amateur champion, he was an automatic
entrant in both the Masters and the Open.
</P>
<P>
   At Augusta National he tied for 21st at even-par 288. And as the
Amateur champion, he teed off here in a threesome with Ernie Els,
the defending Open champion, and Justin Leonard, the British Open
champion, during the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   With a one-under-par 69 yesterday for 139 after 36 holes, the
6-foot-3-inch teen-ager from Lake Mary, Fla., was six shots better
than Els, seven better than Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   If the kid were to shoot another 139 over Saturday and Sunday,
well, maybe, just maybe, he would be the first amateur to win the
Open since Johnny Goodman in 1933 at North Shore in Glenview, Ill.
Goodman's 287 edged two of that era's best pros, Ralph Guldahl and
Craig Wood.
</P>
<P>
   But win or not, Kuchar's boyish smile is lighting up Olympic
just as it lighted up the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun when you are in the fairway and on the green,'' he
said in the interview tent. ``In the rough it is definitely no fun.
But it's a grind too, much more of a grind than Augusta was. You
have to concentrate just every shot, every hole. If you let down an
inch, this course will grab you.''
</P>
<P>
   When his tee shot on the 157-yard 15th hole hopped into the
rough, it appeared that Olympic had grabbed him. During a double
bogey on the previous hole, he had left what he called an ``easy
bunker shot'' in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like the wheels were coming off when I missed the
green on 15, and then the chip went in,'' he said. ``All of a
sudden all the momentum came right back and I parred out. I made a
good up-and-down on 16 and on 17 a par is almost like a birdie. I
played pretty solid once I chipped in.''
</P>
<P>
   A teen-age amateur isn't supposed to do this at the Open. Then
again, he did it at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Augusta really requires precise iron shots,'' he said. ``But
here you have to be precise with the driver, with the 3-wood, with
the 3-iron, with all the irons. But I'm only halfway there. We'll
see what happens in the next two days.''
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia Tech, however, Kuchar is No. 2 on the golf team
behind Bryce Molder, the college golfer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a terrific player, I guess the best player in college
golf,'' Kuchar said. ``We compete a lot, just matching scores. When
we do get a chance to play together, it's a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Molder and Kuchar have been selected for the U.S. team of
college golfers that will go against British college golfers for
the Palmer Cup at St. Andrews, Scotland, this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we will be partners,'' Kuchar said, referring to
Molder, ``and really have a good time cleaning up.''
</P>
<P>
   College golfers carry their own golf bag but here, as in the
Masters, Kuchar's father, Peter, has been his caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if my dad would be good for other guys, but he's
great for me,'' he said. ``He really keeps me calm. And seeing him
get excited is just a lot of fun for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Leonard was asked about Peter Kuchar's outbursts, he
replied, ``Next question.'' After a pause, Leonard added: ``It does
me no good to answer that question. Do you understand?''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Matt Kuchar has talked about getting his
business-management degree at Georgia Tech before turning pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really don't know,'' he said. ``I really haven't thought
about it. Dad and I really haven't thought about it. It's all up in
the air. I'm just kind of rolling with everything right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolling along on the Open leader boards. But nobody asked him if
he thought he could win the Open. After all, an amateur can't
possibly win the Open.

BISHOPS DECRY SEX, VIOLENCE AS ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops issued an appeal Friday to
the entertainment industry and the government to reduce the public
portrayal of sex and excessive violence.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that pornography and images of violence ``gravely harm
the moral and psychological health'' of society, the bishops
offered a mixture of criticism and encouragement, specifically
warning about the use of the Internet to distribute obscenity and
prejudice, while also declaring that parents have more influence
over their children than they may realize.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, titled, ``Renewing the Mind of the Media: A
Statement on Overcoming the Exploitations of Sex and Violence in
Communications,'' was adopted by a vote of 207-11 at the bishops'
annual spring meeting which is being held through Saturday in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Francis Maniscalco, a spokesman for the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the statement arose in part
out of concerns expressed by Cardinal William Keeler, archbishop of
Baltimore, who has been active in interfaith efforts against
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Maniscalco said, ``It's a reaction to the outcries
we have heard from people who say, `I can't watch television with
my kids.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, the bishops voice concerns about a wide range
of media _ faulting talk radio for angry remarks, the music
industry for songs with obscene lyrics, video games that rely on
violent images and the advertising industry for using sex to sell
products, sometimes with models who could be mistaken for minors.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement did not solely fault the producers of what the
bishops referred to as indecent and obscene material. ``Those who
freely choose to support the industries which purvey pornography
and graphic violence have a responsibility not only for themselves,
but for those who will be trapped in what the Catechism of the
Catholic Church calls `the illusion of a fantasy world' filled with
sex and violence,'' the bishops said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bishops said the government needed to use its
existing regulatory powers over broadcasting, they also said that
they did not favor censorship. Instead, they called on leaders in
entertainment companies to be self-regulating.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking to parents, the bishops said that parents share a
bond with their children ``that nothing else can replace no matter
how much, at any given moment, children seem to look elsewhere for
example and guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   Maniscalco said that in recent years, Keeler has been meeting
privately with top officials at Hollywood studios and television
networks to discuss some of these issues. ``We're in dialogue with
so many groups in society,'' he said, ``we thought we ought to be
in contact with these people who run these culture-forming
industries.''

HUGHES ELECTRONICS PLANS TO DIVEST WHITTAKER SHARES

   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ Hughes Electronics Corp. is selling the
107,841 shares of Whittaker Corp. stock it acquired in May,
according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents filed by
Whittaker.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, based in El Segundo southwest of Los Angeles, received
the stock as royalty payments on sales that Whittaker was required
to pay as part of its purchase two years ago of the Hughes LAN
System division, which was renamed Whittaker Communications Inc.
and has since been discontinued, according to Whittaker officials
and the documents filed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' shares represent less than 1 percent of Whittaker shares
outstanding, which closed Friday at 13 3/64 (three-sixty-fourths),
up 3/64 (three-sixty-fourths). Whittaker, based in Simi Valley
northwest of Los Angeles, makes fluid control and fire safety
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sale of the stock was part of a continuing re-evaluation
of the company's business plan,'' Hughes spokeswoman Marcy Garber
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lexington, Mass.-based electronics giant Raytheon Co. sold its
entire 1.97 million shares of Whittaker stock on June 12 to Beverly
Hills-based investment group Canpartners Investments IV LLC for
$11.95 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker chairman and chief executive officer Joseph Alibrandi
said Whittaker Communications was shut down in early 1997. The
technical know-how that was left was sold along with Xyplex earlier
this year to Los Angeles-based MRV Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' sale of the stock is unlikely to have a negative effect
on Whittaker, Alibrandi said. Hughes has been talking to an
investment group that is interested in purchasing the stock, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's been done, but I'm pretty confident it
will be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not know the name of the group, and Garber refused to
identify the company.

   NEWPORT R.I. _ In picture-perfect weather across Rhode Island
Sound Friday, the largest fleet of boats in 16 years took off for
Bermuda in the biennial showcase of blue-water racing on the East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Led by four Maxis, which are concluding their world
championships, most of the 163-boat fleet enjoyed steady southwest
breezes that made the start a brisk and well-sailed spectacle.
However, the last two classes started in the teeth of an
approaching thunderstorm that deadened the wind.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four Maxis _ Sayonara, Morning Glory, Boomerang, and
Alexia _ is expected to take line honors, reaching St. David Light
on the tip of Bermuda 635 miles away tomorrow night. Boomerang
holds the record with a time of 57 hours 20 minutes. Two new Bruce
Farr 60s, Deep Powder and Rima, are also expected to make quick
time across a route that intersects the tricky Gulf Stream on its
eastward passage.
</P>
<P>
   The largest fleet ever was in 1982, when 178 boats entered, and
numbers dropped off dramatically through the '80s. But the fleet is
building up again.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruising Club of America and Royal Bermuda Yacht Squadron
host the historic race. In every off year, Beverly Yacht Club in
Marion hosts a detuned version of the race, sailed mainly by
amateur cruisers. Newport-Bermuda allows all means of high-tech
equipment and professional sailors and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Two entries this year, Fei Hu III and Mackintosh, are Canadian
boats that sailed to the start from Toronto. According to George
Bauer, a race spokesman, these two sailed the most arduous route to
get to Friday's start _ through canals, lakes, the Hudson River,
and Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the race will be monitored by the 117-foot
communications vessel Rainbow, which will release up-to-the-minute
standings over the World Wide Web at www.rbyc.bm/newportfinlog.htm

   NEW YORK _ Open positions of short sales on the New York Stock
Exchange increased 2.3 percent in the last month, to 4.02 billion
shares as of June 15, up from 3.93 billion a month earlier, the
exchange reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new figure equaled 1.8 percent of all shares listed on the
Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   On the smaller American Stock Exchange, short interest rose 3.7
percent, to 196.5 million shares as of June 15 from 189.5 million
shares, the exchange reported.
</P>
<P>
   A short position is created when an investor sells shares that
have been borrowed. If the share price falls, the investor can
profit by buying shares at a lower price to replace the borrowed
ones.
</P>
<P>
   While an increase in short positions may indicate a rise in
bearish attitudes toward stock prices, the volume of short
positions can also be affected by complex trading strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The largest Big Board short position _ 78.6 million shares _ was
in Compaq Computer Corp. U S West Media Group showed the largest
decrease, to 3.8 million shares from 32.1 million in mid-May.

CONGRESS NARROWS DIFFERENCES IN IRS OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress moved closer Friday to final passage of
legislation that would overhaul the Internal Revenue Service, as
House and Senate negotiators resolved many of the differences in
the details of their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Several contentious issues remain unaddressed, including how to
pay for what would be the most sweeping changes to the agency in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But members of both parties, eager in a congressional election
year to rein in what is perhaps the most unpopular of government
agencies, said they were optimistic that they could reach agreement
in time for the House to vote on final passage next week and for
the Senate to act right after the Fourth of July recess.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed its version of the legislation late last year,
and the Senate passed a broader and more expensive bill last month.
In negotiations this week that involved lawmakers of both parties
and the Clinton administration, all sides agreed to scale back some
of the Senate bill's provisions, people involved in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would create an independent board to oversee the
agency, provide more legal protections for taxpayers engaged in
disputes with it and spur an internal reorganization to make it
more efficient and more responsive to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Charles Rossotti, the
commissioner of internal revenue, issued a statement calling the
progress on the legislation ``a major step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes to which negotiators agreed were a narrowing
of some of the protections the Senate bill would have granted to
taxpayers fighting collection actions and to so-called ``innocent
spouses'': taxpayers who maintain they were unaware of tax
avoidance or fraud by their husbands or wives.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes should save several billion dollars of the
estimated $18 billion cost of the Senate bill over 10 years, moving
the final legislation closer to the House version, whose estimated
10-year cost is $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators also agreed to adopt the Senate version's
approach to shifting the burden of proof in some tax-court cases
from the taxpayer to the IRS. The Senate version would impose a
less rigorous definition of the cooperation with the revenue
service that taxpayers would need to show in order to force the
agency to prove them liable. Under current law, the burden in such
cases rests on taxpayers, to prove that they are not liable.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the negotiations said it remained unclear how
Congress would pay for the legislation's costs, which stem
overwhelmingly from revenue loss that would result from restricting
the IRS' power to pursue taxpayers with whom it is having disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would pay for many of its provisions by changing
the rules under which elderly people can shift money from one type
of individual retirement account to another. The change would
generate additional tax revenue over the next 10 years but would
cost the government billions after that, and Democrats have
criticized it as a substantial tax break for the wealthy.

 ASTRA TO BUY OUT MERCK IN VENTURE  (ja) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astra A.B., the Swedish pharmaceuticals giant, announced Friday
that it would buy Merck &AMP; Co.'s half of their American joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
   The parting of the two companies, which will take at least 10
years, helps both companies. Hakan Mogren, Astra's chief executive,
announced in March that he would like to seek a merger, but Astra's
venture with Merck was a major hindrance.
</P>
<P>
   Merck, however, charged a high price. It will immediately stop
paying its share of expenses, but continue to pocket revenue from
the sale of Astra's existing products and those in the pipeline.
Astra can end Merck's revenue sharing by paying the company at
least $4.4 billion in either 2008, 2012 or 2016.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also gives Merck a revenue stake in the popular
Prilosec ulcer drug until 2017, provided sales of the drug remain
at a certain level.
</P>
<P>
   Merck will also pocket additional money if Astra should merge or
be acquired. If a deal occurs, Astra must pay Merck $675 million to
$1.5 billion. And as a sweetener to the deal, Astra agreed to lend
Merck $1.4 billion over 40 years at 6 percent interest.

KELLER PROVES HE'S A KEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAINT-JEAN d'ARDIERES, France _ In 1990, he was a tourist in
Tuscany, a college kid along for the ride with a passport and a
team bag. Four years ago, Kasey Keller watched the World Cup on
television, the third keeper on a roster that carried two.
</P>
<P>
   This time he's the iron man, all but certain to be occupying the
goal for every minute of every match. And on a team that has
struggled to score all year, Keller may well be the difference
between the US soccer team making it to the second round again or
packing for home next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to be given the opportunity,'' says Keller, who
probably will need to blank Iran tomorrow night in Lyon to keep the
Yanks alive. Keller thought he would get that chance in 1994 after
earning a rep as a zero-based guardian with Millwall in the English
First Division.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody thought Keller belonged on the roster except coach
Bora Milutinovic, the Spanish-speaking Serb mystic who went with
Tony Meola and Brad Friedel instead. For nearly three years while
he was piling up shutouts in southeast London, Keller didn't pull
on a US jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as Milutinovic was let go in 1995, Keller's phone
rang. Timo Liekoski wanted him as one of the overage players for
the Olympic team. And Steve Sampson wanted him for the national
squad. ``Both of them told me the same thing,'' Keller says. ``That
it was out of their hands in 1994 but that they thought I should
have been there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Keller, who grew up on an egg farm in Lacey, Wash., had been on
the radar screen since 1988, when he led the University of Portland
to the NCAA Division 1 Final Four as a freshman. He was 20, still
an undergraduate, when he made the 1990 Cup team and watched the
Yanks' three-and-out from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never played a pro game in my life,'' Keller says. ``But
it would have been OK if I'd played because I didn't know that I
shouldn't have been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller went straight from college to Millwall's crucible,
playing in the raucous ``Den'' on Cold Blow Lane before thousands
of profane fans penned into terraces behind him. Nobody quite knew
why the club had hired a Yank (``At the very beginning, it was,
`why?''' Keller says), but after he started 51 straight matches in
1992-93 and posted 16 shutouts, nobody in the Den was asking
questions. Instead, they chanted, ``U-S-A, U-S-A,'' whenever Keller
clamped his mitts around a ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start to play, it doesn't matter if you're a
Martian,'' Keller realized. ``If you do a good job, you're
accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   When Keller played more than 100 matches the next two seasons
and hung up another 35 shutouts, he became part of the London
wallpaper. ``It's like it would be if I were in Seattle playing for
the Sonics,'' says Keller, who now plays for Leicester City in the
Premier League. ``You walk around town and everybody knows you. You
walk around another town and everyone knows you there, too. Rugby
has its niche and cricket has its niche, but in England, everything
is basically football. That's all you read in the papers, see on
TV, hear on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller and a lot of other folks figured he'd be a cinch to make
the US team for the 1994 Cup. But Milutinovic thought otherwise.
``Managerial decisions come and go,'' says Keller. ``There've been
a lot of players who play for one coach and not another. The only
one who knew was Bora, and I don't think you'd get it out of him.
Everyone else speculated.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller took his omission philosophically. ``It was win-win for
me, actually,'' he says. ``Most everyone thought I should be
playing and I didn't have to prove it. I was 24 years old. It
wasn't a big deal. I knew if I kept playing, I'd be given another
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Liekoski and Sampson rang him up, Keller was reborn. He
captained the Olympic team and played every minute. The Yanks were
5-1-3 (with six shutouts and 562 consecutive scoreless minutes) in
Cup qualifiers in which he kept goal.
</P>
<P>
   Keller blanked Mexico and Argentina in 1995. And he made five
saves on the legendary Romario in this year's historic 1-0 decision
over Brazil. ``That was the greatest performance I've ever seen by
a goalkeeper,'' Romario said. ``It was an honor to be on the field
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Romario isn't here this time. He was sent home injured and
weeping days before the opener. Keller, who watched Romario on the
tube four years ago, is center stage now. He is no longer the
Tuscan tourist, no longer the third man out. This time Kasey Keller
has a passport, a team bag, and a full-time job.

THE DREAM IS ENOUGH FOR LIU'S NEW COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ind., Ohio, N.C.)   (bl)  
 By RON DICKER    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ray Martin received the telephone call informing him that
he would be Long Island University's new basketball coach, he
screamed. But during Friday's news conference at LIU, Martin was a
man of muted expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said his goal was to win Northeast Conference
championships, a far cry from the Final Four aspirations voiced by
his predecessor, Ray Haskins, who resigned when his ambition grew
too big for the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's enough right now,'' the 43-year-old Martin said
of his objective. Martin signed a one-year contract, just like all
LIU faculty members, and will earn between $70,000 and $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a native of Long Island City, Queens, starred at Mater
Christi High School in Astoria, Queens, before playing for Notre
Dame. His 18-year career as an assistant coach includes eight years
at North Carolina State and, most recently, two years at Miami of
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has never been a head coach except for three games last
season when he took over for Miami Coach Charlie Coles, who became
ill. But John Suarez, LIU's athletic director, said Martin's
experience in the Atlantic Coast Conference and his familiarity
with New York clinched the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been through the wars,'' Suarez said. ``He won't get
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   LIU expects a difficult season after two years of more than 20
victories and two post-season appearances. The Blackbirds are
losing Charles Jones, the nation's leading scorer, and Mike
Campbell, the team's second-leading scorer. And one of the top
recruits, guard Devon Fowler of Philadelphia, has yet to meet
academic requirements.
</P>
<P>
   It was Haskins' gym-first approach that first created a conflict
with the administration. Asked whether she laid out academic
guidelines for the new coach, Gale Stevens Haynes, LIU's provost,
said: `'I didn't have to. He gave me a piece of who he is, not a
piece of what Gale wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he would first mine New York for recruits and slow
down Haskins' run-and-shoot scheme while still keeping an up-tempo
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we win, I don't mind,'' said guard Issiah Francis,
one of a handful of players who showed up to meet their new mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, his wife, Valerie, and their four children, ages 6 to
16, have yet to begin house-hunting. Martin might hold off because
the July 8 start-date for writing letters to high school seniors is
approaching. But Martin, a career underling who will finally be the
boss, can wait for the house part. He is home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `'It's a dream come true,'' he said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ As Frontier City rose near here alongside
legendary Route 66 in 1958, not even its owners could have harbored
illusions that the 60-acre amusement park would ever rival the talk
of the industry, the three-year-old Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by the time a local real estate development company
bought a controlling stake in 1982, the park was so rundown that
the new owner planned to demolish it and put up an office and
retail complex instead.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of Route 66 is only a memory, replaced by Interstate
35. Yet Frontier City still stands, spruced up and profitable.
</P>
<P>
   For when Frontier escaped the wrecking ball _ courtesy of
plummeting oil prices, which sent Oklahoma's economy into a
tailspin _ the owner had little choice but to operate the park
itself. And in the years since, that potentially disastrous
investment has turned into a gusher: its owner, Premier Parks Inc.,
is now the second-biggest theme park operator in the world, behind
only the Walt Disney Co. itself.
</P>
<P>
   Like the cars of a roller coaster inching up the first big rise,
the company that would eventually become Premier took its time
getting ready to expand, spending more than a decade to collect a
dozen or so small parks around the country. And then this year,
seemingly from out of nowhere, Premier shifted into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9 it stunned the industry by agreeing to pay nearly $1
billion in cash for the dozen Six Flags parks owned by Time Warner
Entertainment and an investor group led by Boston Ventures. A month
later, it went international, buying a 49.9 percent stake in six
parks in Europe. And it is not done yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there are opportunities for more acquisitions,'' said
Kieran Burke, Premier's understated 41-year-old chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is hardly in danger of losing its top spot any time soon.
The 31 parks now in Premier's stable had about 38 million
admissions last year, much less than half the estimated 86 million
that Disney packed into its 6 parks. (Disney's Animal Kingdom in
Florida, its seventh park, opened in April this year.)
</P>
<P>
   And Disney and Premier aren't really even direct competitors.
Premier operates regional parks, mostly for day trippers, many of
whom become season ticket holders and drop in frequently during
summer, if only for a few hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Disney runs ``destination parks,'' which have much higher ticket
prices and serve as magnets for its large resorts. Moreover, while
Disney operates its five parks in the United States year-round, all
but one of Premier's parks are seasonal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Premier executives insist that they don't have Mickey on
the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never viewed our long-term goals or performance as
competition with Disney,'' said Burke, a Harvard-trained lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at least one other comparison is quite telling. ``While
Disney remains the theme park industry leader, with the theme parks
their best-performing business over the past year, Premier is
growing faster than the entire Disney company,'' said Larry C.
Petrella, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have sent the company's stock up 75 percent since the
Six Flags deal was announced. The stock, which closed on Friday at
$59.0625, has more than tripled since Premier went public on June
4, 1996, it was $18 then a reflection of the company's sizzling
financial performance: attendance, revenues and earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization have increased by 7,
9 and 12 times, respectively, since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the question is whether Premier's management is up to
the tasks it has set for itself. The purchase of Six Flags, after
all, is a bit like a minor league team buying the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Six Flags' 1997 revenues were $708.7 million, more than three
times Premier's $193.9 million. Six Flags drew about 27 million
visitors last year, with four of its parks, including Great
Adventure in Jackson, N.J., accounting for more than 3 million
each.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Premier's total attendance was less than 11
million, and only one of its parks, Elitch Gardens in Denver,
reached even 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts regard Burke and his team as better theme park
operators than were Time Warner's managers. Ned P. Zachar, senior
managing director of Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, said he
expected Premier to consolidate operations and improve margins.
</P>
<P>
   How hands-on is Premier management? Burke and other senior
executives get hourly updates by computer of attendance figures at
each park.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Burke thinks it's time for a breather. ``Over the
next 12 months,'' he said, ``we'll be focused largely on
integrating our newest parks.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is making a tender offer for the remaining interest
in the six European parks it operates with Walibi SA. It paid
Walibi $43 million for its 49.9 percent stake in March. And Monday,
it plans to add the Six Flags name to its Kentucky Kingdom park in
Louisville, the first of a number of proposed name changes.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Six Flags deal, Premier also obtained the
exclusive right for 55 years to use Warner Brothers characters like
Bugs Bunny and Tweety Bird, in its American and Canadian parks.
Analysts expect the characters to bolster attendance and
merchandise sales at Premier's original properties.
</P>
<P>
   Premier derived 51.2 percent of its revenue last year from the
sale of food, merchandise, games and rides, or about $8.50 a
person. But the average expenditure at Six Flags is nearly $10
higher, said Petrella of Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a recent report by Nationsbanc Montgomery estimated
that merchandise sales averaged only about $1 per person at Premier
but about $5 at Six Flags. So every additional dollar per person
that Premier can generate from the cartoon characters, the report
said, ``could translate into incremental revenue of $12 million to
$13 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Premier's high-speed financial ride, it would be fitting
to report that Burke went into the amusement park business because
he was unable to shake a childhood passion for roller coasters, or
that beneath his Harvard pinstripes beats the heart of a
buttoned-down Barnum.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that while he enjoyed visiting parks as a child,
Burke, the Bronx-born son of a homicide detective, did not contract
the amusement park virus until after joining Premier's predecessor,
Tierco Group, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Burke had taught high school English, practiced
corporate and real estate law and worked as an investment banker at
Drexel Burnham Lambert. Through his work at Drexel, he came to know
some of the family members who controlled Tierco. When offered the
chief executive's position there, he readily accepted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now an amusement park junkie, Burke regularly takes his four
children, aged 6 to 13, on the rides at Premier parks and those of
the competition. So do most other Premier executives, including
James F. Dannhauser, the chief financial officer and also a Harvard
law graduate, and Gary Story, the president and chief operating
officer, who started in the amusement park business at 16 and has
managed parks from Mexico to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   (Burke and Dannhauser are based in New York; Story and most
other senior executives have offices in Oklahoma City.)
</P>
<P>
   Rides, after all, are the heart of the business _ the draw that
brings people back again and again. When Premier added a river
rapids ride at Frontier City in 1990, for example, attendance
increased by 60,000 that year and has continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
   (The Oklahoma City park was briefly closed for cleaning and
safety inspections after it was hit a little more than a week ago
by a tornado and high winds that caused a few injuries and some
minor damage.)
</P>
<P>
   Premier prides itself on running family parks with rides for all
ages. At its Adventure World in Largo, Md., for example, visitors
may choose from a water park, 14 children's rides and 34 adult
rides, including Roar, a world-class wooden roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed recently at the park, Selina Bankert was about to
take her three sons home to Annapolis, Md., for their naps. She
would be back many more times this summer, she said, because she
was a second-year season ticket holder, and her 5-year-old son,
John, and his 2-year-old twin brothers, Scott and Paul, loved the
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good value for us,'' she said of her season ticket,
which she bought for $44, ``because we come at least once a week
for an hour or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, at the 109-year-old Elitch Gardens in
Denver, Tommy and Adaire Toms of York, Neb., are among some 75,000
season ticket holders. This day, the Toms, who spend a good deal of
time in the Denver area, were accompanying their son,
daughter-in-law and two of their 11 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here soon after our first date in 1955,'' Toms said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We danced to all the big bands,'' Mrs. Toms remembered,
ticking off several band leaders, including Harry James and Les
Brown, whose photographs hang on the walls of the park's rebuilt
Trocadero ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Waving to their grandchildren suspended in the air inside a huge
teacup _ one of 48 rides in the park, including a $30 million
package of new attractions installed last year _ Mrs. Toms said,
``It's still a great place to spend a day with kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim O'Brien, an editor of the weekly Amusement Business magazine
in Nashville, said that while Premier parks have generally shunned
the glitz _ and high prices _ that accompany the better-known
high-technology rides, ``their rides have always been good and have
been getting better.'' Those at Six Flags are ``just awesome,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, the smaller attendance and lower
admission prices at Premier parks have had no noticeable effect on
the company's financial performance _ except maybe to enhance it,
by impressing on management the value of running a lean operation.
</P>
<P>
   After acquiring Elitch Gardens last year, Premier promptly moved
park executives from a high-rise office tower to the park itself.
And Premier is now in the process of trimming the ranks at Six
Flags Astroworld Houston, which had 140 full-time employees, twice
the number at Elitch, where attendance is about the same.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonal operation of Premier's parks is another reason for
the company's success, Burke said. ``It enables us to operate with
fewer full-time employees year-round,'' he said. ``We also do a
rigorous budgeting process from September to December, we refurbish
every ride at every park, and we plan our marketing campaigns, our
telemarketing and our group sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another explanation of the company's strength goes back to
the early days with Frontier City. The company realized that it had
become part of ``a fragmented industry with a lot of parks out
there that didn't have the necessary capital or management
skills,'' Burke said. ``So we knew if we could demonstrate to the
financial community that we could turn Frontier around, we could
acquire other parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Before its purchase of Six Flags, Premier concentrated on
acquisitions in areas that had at least a million people within a
100-mile radius, and today it has parks in 16 of the top 25
markets, including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York,
San Francisco and Washington. With the Six Flags purchase, some 175
million Americans live within 150 miles of a Premier park.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Premier maintained a low enough profile to
execute its game plan virtually undetected. That is why so much of
the industry and Wall Street were taken by surprise when Premier
bought Six Flags for $965 million, plus the assumption of about
$890 million of debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface, Premier paid a pretty full price,'' said
Zachar of Nationsbanc Montgomery. ``But Six Flags' cash flow last
year was about $160 million, and those parks were undermanaged, so
there are still margins to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   How? ``Warner's made money from its parks,'' Burke said, ``but
they were in the amusement park business not so much for the
revenue as for the sale of merchandise and the exposure of their
characters. But our only business is parks. So this transaction
allows each of us to concentrate on our core business.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts share his confidence. Both Petrella of Lehman and Jill
S. Krutick of Salomon Smith Barney say the company's stock could
trade at $70 or more in 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Once the 12-month breather is over, where will the Premier
roller coaster go next? Possibly it will range farther abroad to
areas that are only now awakening to the lure of amusement parks,
namely Europe, Asia and Latin America. Many foreign markets, Burke
said, are as fragmented as the United States was in the 60s and
70s.
</P>
<P>
   That could make for a thrilling ride.

PRESBYTERIANS ASK MEMBERS TO REMOVE HANDGUNS FROM HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for minor rewrite of lede graf; changes vote tally from `4-1'
to `more than 3-1' in 2nd graf; minor rephrasing in several
places)  
 (ATTN: N.C., Kan., Ohio, Va., Calif.)   (mk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a strikingly strong statement on individual responsibility
and guns, the top policy-making body of the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.) has passed a resolution calling on the denomination's 2.6
million members to begin removing handguns and assault weapons from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, passed by more than 3-1 at the church's annual
General Assembly late Thursday afternoon, follows a three-decade
stream of declarations by several major Protestant, Roman Catholic
and Jewish organizations favoring restrictions on handguns and
assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Presbyterian officials and other church leaders said the
assembly's resolution took a different tack in asking for
individual action by church members, rather than seeking a purely
legislative remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, which comes after recent shootings at schools
around the country, says the General Assembly should ``call upon
all Presbyterians to intentionally work toward removing handguns
and assault weapons from our homes and communities,'' adding that
church members should ``develop community strategies and create
sanctuaries of safety for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Its new ground is in speaking directly to Presbyterians to do
something,'' said the Rev. Kathy Lancaster, a Presbyterian official
who specializes in criminal justice issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National
Council of Churches, said, ``It's taking this very serious issue
and bringing it home.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that some of the boys and youths accused in the recent
school shootings had been involved in local churches, Dr. Campbell
said, ``Maybe we're not doing all we could as church people to
teach people a lifestyle of living nonviolently.''
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterians' resolution is strictly advisory, rather than
binding. Nonetheless, it stirred up about 40 minutes of debate in
the General Assembly, an annual eight-day gathering that is winding
down at the Charlotte, N.C., Convention Center. The resolution was
favored by 393 commissioners, or delegates, while 120 voted against
it.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment that would have modified the resolution's language
by removing the reference to handguns was defeated 361 to 144.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ward, a commissioner from Wichita, Kan., who spoke in favor
of the amendment, said in an interview after the vote that ``our
church is treading on something that's legal and trying to say to
all of us who use shooting as a sport'' that that sport is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution does not mention rifles, shotguns or hunting. In
1990, the assembly adopted a resolution calling for handgun control
but said the statement was not intended to ``disparage the
legitimate ownership and use of firearms'' for hunting, collecting
and recreational sports. Others at the assembly who opposed the
amendment described it as a ``feel-good'' measure that would have
little practical effect.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harley, a lawyer from Springfield, Ohio, said, ``If you
look into history, you'll see the first thing totalitarian
dictatorships have done is disarm its citizenry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ann Holt, a retired teacher from Raleigh, N.C, who voted for
the amendment, said it was ``the church's responsibility to make a
response'' to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner who made the motion proposing the resolution
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for her response to the resolution, Tanya Metaksa, chief
lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, said that the NRA was
sorry that the Presbyterian assembly ``would suggest to their
parishioners that self-defense is no longer an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Metaksa said that 2.5 million times a year, a firearm is
used for self-defense, ``and 95 percent of those times no shot is
ever fired, but people's lives are saved.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   Although critics have accused the church's leadership of being
liberal-leaning, Presbyterians are an ideologically diverse group.
Lately they have waged a fierce internal fight over whether to
allow the ordination of homosexuals as ministers, elders and
deacons. In 1997 the church amended its constitution to bar such
ordinations by declaring that those who are ordained must be either
monogamous within marriage or celibate as unmarried people. An
effort to soften the amendment's language failed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is we're a slice of middle America,'' said the Rev.
Douglas Oldenburg, a seminary president who was elected last
Saturday as the denomination's moderator, one of its top officials.
``I have no idea what percentage of us have handguns _ probably
more than I'd wish.''
</P>
<P>
   The church has long been among the religious groups that favor
restricting access to handguns and, most recently, assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these declarations date to 1968, when the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert Kennedy were assassinated.
But some were issued in 1975, after two attempted assassinations
against President Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Others have come more recently, with the rise in urban violence
and drug abuse in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, a committee of Catholic bishops in the United States
called for ``effective and courageous action to control handguns,
leading to their eventual elimination from our society.'' The
bishops reaffirmed that statement in 1992 in a pastoral message on
substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1975, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, which
represents about 800 Reform synagogues, called for eliminating the
manufacture, sale and possession of handguns except for use by
police, the military and licensed gun clubs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the United Church of Christ's General Synod asked for
legislation requiring safety devices on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the United Methodist Church, building on earlier
statements, recommended that the denomination's churches be
designated as ``no gun zones,'' prohibiting all firearms. The 1990
Presbyterian statement, which focused on handguns and assault
weapons, criticized the entertainment industry for the
``glorification of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Friday, Presbyterians at the assembly expressed
differing opinions about the resolution. The Rev. Thomas Nance Jr.,
a Richmond, Va., minister who described himself as being ``on the
right wing of things,'' said he voted for the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just too much violence and we have to do some things
to insure the safety of people in this country,'' Nance said.
</P>
<P>
   But Arlynn Barner, a Los Angeles real estate salesman who voted
against the resolution, said, ``I would feel uncomfortable without
a handgun in my home for protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Oldenburg, the moderator, said he voted for the resolution.
``Will it make a difference? Who knows?'' he asked. But he added,
``Now it's up to individual Presbyterian families to follow the
counsel, the advice, of this assembly or not.''

HUNDLEY GETS NO-TRADE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the last month, Todd Hundley has lost his catching
job to Mike Piazza, been asked to learn a new position, nearly
completed his rehabilitation from elbow surgery and read that some
in New York Mets management are concerned about his work and
drinking habits.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Mets did what they could to temper the tumult
surrounding Hundley's season. At his request, the Mets agreed to
include a no-trade provision in Hundley's contract for the rest of
the 1998 season. This clause, according to general manager Steve
Phillips, grants Hundley ``peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement also represents a compromise. Hundley feared
being traded to a team with a losing record, but the Mets did not
want to give him a no-trade clause for the entire length of his
contract, which runs through the 2000 season. The Mets wanted a way
out should Hundley's attempt to remake himself into an outfielder
fail.
</P>
<P>
   So, during the remaining two years of Hundley's contract _ and
during the 2001 season should the Mets pick up the option year of
the contract _ the Mets granted Hundley a limited no-trade clause.
In essence, Hundley and the Mets said Friday, Hundley can veto a
trade to only about half of the teams in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am traded,'' Hundley said in a conference call Friday.
``I have the option to make sure it's to a contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Seth Levinson, Hundley's agent, said that while the list of
teams Hundley could agree to be traded to would change at various
times during the years covering the new agreement, the list would
be generally defined by the teams' winning percentages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fairly simple,'' Levinson said. ``You can look at the
standings and figure it out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the meantime, Hundley continues to work on his skills in the
outfield, where Phillips said Hundley would play when he returns to
the Mets lineup probably sometime following the All-Star Game
break, July 6-8. Hundley is taking daily batting practice, throwing
to restore strength to his rebuilt right elbow and shagging fly
balls in both left and right field at the Mets complex in Port St.
Lucie, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' Hundley said. ``It's challenging and not as easy
as I thought it would be. But I know I'm a good enough athlete to
make the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hundley may be a defensive risk in the outfield, he can
only help the team's offensive production there. None of the
regular Mets outfielders has more than nine home runs, and entering
Friday night's game with the Florida Marlins, Bernard Gilkey had
the highest batting average at .251.
</P>
<P>
   And Gilkey was out of the lineup, recovering from an injury
suffered when he was hit by a pitch above his left eye a week ago.
Another outfielder, Butch Huskey, is also sidelined with soreness
in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you move away from home plate, the transition usually gets
easier,'' manager Bobby Valentine said, assessing Hundley's chances
of succeeding in the outfield. ``It would be impossible for someone
to learn to be a catcher at this stage, and the next toughest thing
is coming from the outfield to the infield. I think Todd can do it.
He's a good athlete, and I hear he's working hard on the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Hundley's no-trade clause, Phillips said it was one step in a
long-term effort to make sure Hundley remains a Met and is
comfortable taking his place in the same lineup as Piazza, the
All-Star catcher the Mets obtained four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right thing to do,'' Phillips said. ``And it gives
Todd some control over his destiny beyond this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, however, was emphatic that there would be no
competition between Piazza and Hundley for the catcher's job _ even
if Piazza signs a contract to return to the Mets next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unrealistic,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza said he was happy for Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can only help us,'' he said. ``And if that's what Todd
wants, I'm glad for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, asked whether Friday's no-trade agreement assuaged any
of the bitterness he felt last month when the team's management
leaked its concern about how much he was drinking, said the
no-trade provision was not a response to that episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about me feeling I've been wronged,'' Hundley
said. ``I might quite possibly not fit in on this team next year,
and this is a way for me to control my options.''

AMANDONED TEXAS COMMUNITY BEGUN BY FORMER SLAVES WILL AGAIN COME TO
LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARY SALTARELLI 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANBURY, Texas _ A Hood County community settled more than a
century ago by former slaves will celebrate Juneteenth on Saturday
for the first time in more than 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   The last resident moved away in the late 1930s, and all that
remains of The Colony, nine miles southwest of Granbury, is an old
cemetery with 75 to 100 graves, many of them unmarked. It had been
unkept for several years until about 100 volunteers began restoring
it in March of last year.
</P>
<P>
   But some still recall the Juneteenth celebrations _
commemorating the day that Texas received word of the signing of
the Emancipation Proclamation _ that were held when the community
was thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to spend the night before barbecuing,'' recalled
Marvin Allen, 71, of nearby Fort Worth, whose father was pastor of
the community's Methodist church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day they would have ballgames. It was a good
celebration. Folks would come from Cleburne, Stephenville,
Granbury, anywhere from probably 100 miles. There were at least 200
folks there in its heyday.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's celebration will be from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., with a
barbecue lunch from 1 to 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Perkins, president of The Colony Cemetery Committee, which
is hosting the celebration, encouraged those who have recollections
of the historic community to attend and share their memories.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, whose father is buried at the cemetery, said he plans to
attend and hopes to see other descendants of former residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will serve a two-fold purpose,'' Allen said of the
celebration. ``It's kind of like a family reunion and it's a
community get-together, getting out and getting to meet folks.''
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery was neglected for several years after its
caretaker, R.D. Edwards, was killed in a car accident in 1991. He
had been the last resident to move away from The Colony in the
1930s, but periodically returned to clean the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery committee hopes to obtain Texas Historical Markers
for the cemetery and for the original settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said The Colony _ not related to the modern-day Denton
County city of the same name _ was forgotten for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew anything about it,'' he said. ``All of the sudden,
it's come to life again.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Goin, vice president of the cemetery committee, said
residents of The Colony helped build Granbury's old limestone
structures and were instrumental in rebuilding the nearby town of
Tolar after a devastating fire in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he is pleased that Granbury residents are working to
preserve the old cemetery and the traditions of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been for them, it would have gone on and nobody
would be left to tell the tale,'' he said.

BUFFETT TAKES GENERAL RE INTO HIS FOLD

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warren Buffett added to his vast financial empire Friday, buying
the largest U.S. reinsurance company for $21.7 billion in stock.
Reinsurance companies specialize in covering the risks of other
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of General Re Corp. by Buffett's investment
company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., sharply expands his presence in
insurance. General Re, based in Stamford, Conn., would join a
stable of insurers that includes Geico, National Indemnity and
stakes in several other companies.
</P>
<P>
   For Berkshire, a phenomenally successful investment vehicle,
General Re offers an additional $24 billion in stock and bond
investments held by the insurer. And while General Re is already
the world's third-largest reinsurer (after Munich Re and Swiss Re,
both European companies), a combination with Berkshire Hathaway
would give it more capital so that it could provide greater
coverage and expand its operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are creating a Fort Knox here,'' Buffett said Friday at a
New York news conference. ``Previously, General Re has been limited
in how much business they have been willing to take on. Now they
will be a position to do anything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett is known for not overpaying for companies, and analysts
said he paid in the low range of what other recently acquired
reinsurance companies have fetched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it was a bargain,'' said James English, the
senior property and casualty analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities,
``but I think what he paid was reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinsurance can be an extremely profitable business. Reinsurers
promise, in effect, to cover much of the claims of their clients _
other insurance companies _ for a relatively small portion of the
premiums collected from corporations and individuals. And they
agree to pay if the insurance companies suffer huge losses. But
huge losses are rare, and often the reinsurers have little to pay
out.
</P>
<P>
   General Re's revenue of $8.25 billion last year was down
slightly from $8.30 billion in 1996, and Ronald Ferguson, the
chairman and chief executive, said in May that revenue was not
expected to grow this year. But analysts said this reflected a
trend toward lower prices for corporate insurance and did not
suggest a company in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Re is certainly an exceptional franchise,'' said Alan
Murray, a senior analyst with Moody's Investors Service, the
credit-rating agency.
</P>
<P>
   The merger was announced after the close of the market Friday.
But in after-hours trading, the Class A shares of Berkshire
Hathaway, the highest-priced stock on the New York Stock Exchange,
rose $1,900 to $80,900. General Re shares jumped $51.50 to $275.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, General Re shareholders will
receive the equivalent of $276.50 in Berkshire Hathaway stock for
each of their shares.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations for the deal were conducted chiefly between
Buffett and Ferguson, who have known each other for 10 years, with
little help from bankers and lawyers outside their organizations.
They started talking about a year ago, Buffett said. The talks
broke off, and resumed about a month ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to insurance, Berkshire Hathaway's holdings range
from H.H. Brown Shoe Co., the leading North American shoemaker, to
interests in jewelry and furniture stores, substantial stakes in
Coca-Cola Co., and Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   Among its insurance holdings, National Indemnity is heavily
involved in providing coverage to other insurers against
catastrophes like hurricanes and earthquakes. Buffett said National
Indemnity would complement General Re, which also takes on high
risk but provides a great deal of coverage to back up claims made
by large and medium-size corporations, a business without great
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost certain the two companies will write significantly
more business together than they would if they operated
separately,'' Buffett said.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett said he did not have ``lots of great ideas or even lots
of good ideas'' on how to invest the new money that would be
available through General Re.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``there will be a time when we do have a good
idea, and when we do, we will deploy all the money we can get our
hands on.''

ABANDONED TEXAS COMMUNITY BEGUN BY FORMER SLAVES WILL AGAIN COME TO
LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (Resending to fix summary line) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARY SALTARELLI 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANBURY, Texas _ A Hood County community settled more than a
century ago by former slaves will celebrate Juneteenth on Saturday
for the first time in more than 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   The last resident moved away in the late 1930s, and all that
remains of The Colony, nine miles southwest of Granbury, is an old
cemetery with 75 to 100 graves, many of them unmarked. It had been
unkept for several years until about 100 volunteers began restoring
it in March of last year.
</P>
<P>
   But some still recall the Juneteenth celebrations _
commemorating the day that Texas received word of the signing of
the Emancipation Proclamation _ that were held when the community
was thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to spend the night before barbecuing,'' recalled
Marvin Allen, 71, of nearby Fort Worth, whose father was pastor of
the community's Methodist church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day they would have ballgames. It was a good
celebration. Folks would come from Cleburne, Stephenville,
Granbury, anywhere from probably 100 miles. There were at least 200
folks there in its heyday.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's celebration will be from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., with a
barbecue lunch from 1 to 2 p.m.

HEJDUK AND U.S. SOCCER TEAM HAVE GOALS IN COMMON
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story, which was sent and held Thursday, is now
restored.)  
(ja) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France _ He wears his hair to his
shoulders. He proposed to his wife in the Pacific Ocean surf,
holding her with one hand and his surfboard with the other. Even
into last year, Frankie Hejduk struggled to determine whether his
profession would be surfing or soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, this free spirit was kicked off the U.S.
soccer team for missing a team flight to China. But his searing
speed, boldness in attack and renewed dedication have won him a
place on the World Cup squad. He provided the only scoring chance
in Monday's humbling 2-0 loss to Germany, and is expected to start
Sunday's crucial match against Iran in Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   When given the nod at halftime on Monday, with the U.S.
trailing, 1-0, Hejduk (pronounced HAY-duck) searched for something
to wrest his team from its timid start. Baseball players break out
the rally caps, but soccer players don't wear hats, so Hejduk went
to his rally shorts, turning his game pants around, number facing
the back.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, he had practiced his trademark reggae dance in
his hotel room, just in case he scored a goal. And nine minutes
into the second half he launched a diving header that appeared to
be a certain score, only to be thwarted by a desperate reach from
the German goalkeeper, Andreas Kopke.
</P>
<P>
   Against Iran, the Americans will again need his assertive
efforts to get behind what is considered a penetrable defense. Goal
scoring figures prominently in the tie-breaker system used at the
World Cup. The Americans feel they must win by at least two goals
on Sunday and win or draw against Yugoslavia next Thursday to have
any chance of advancing to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk is expected to replace Mike Burns at right wing in
midfield, and Coach Steve Sampson is considering whether to play
with two forwards instead of one. The idea is that the Americans
must be aggressive from the beginning and not lie back as they did
against Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Politics continue to swirl around this game. But politics don't
seem to resonate in the slightest with the 23-year-old Hejduk. He
was only 5 in 1979 when the Americans were taken hostage at the
U.S. embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he knew about the Great Satan appellation given to the
United States by Iran's conservative clerics, Hejduk said blankly,
``What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   He had much the same incredulous reaction in January 1997, when
he did not hear his watch alarm, and he missed a team flight to
China. Infuriated, Sampson dismissed Hejduk from the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was finished,'' Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk said that, at the time, he wasn't sure whether he
preferred soccer over surfing. A native of Cardiff, Calif., he had
been a state surfing champion in high school. But his parents
convinced him that a soccer scholarship to UCLA was not an
opportunity to be wasted. Nor, he later realized, was a chance to
play in the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know whether I wanted to do this for a living or not,
but it kind of woke me up,'' Hejduk said of the China trip.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, Hejduk and Sampson met to clear the air.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage and the birth of a young son have brought maturity and
discipline to Hejduk, according to Sampson, who granted him a
second chance. And Hejduk says he now sets six alarm clocks instead
of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just doing it for me anymore,'' Hejduk said of his
family. ``Now I have someone to support and be a role model for.''
</P>
<P>
   His biography was not included in the 1998 soccer team media
guide. But Hejduk intrigued Sampson with his tireless running in a
1-0 victory over Brazil in February and scored in a 3-0 exhibition
victory over Austria in April. Then he missed the final four World
Cup tuneups with a hamstring injury and was nearly cut from the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy again, he remains one of the few real American threats
with his ability to sprint ceaselessly down the wing. Except,
perhaps for Cobi Jones, no one on the team can match Hejduk's
enduring speed. And few demonstrated the absolute fearlessness that
he showed against Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lack of concern about who's on the other side,''
Sampson said.

TEARS OF JOY FLOW FREELY AT COMPLETION OF 100 HABITAT HOMES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMIE STOCKWELL 
and SHANNON WRIGHT 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sha Lyn Lewis said she would try not to cry. But the tears
flowed anyway at the dedication Friday of her new home, one of 100
built by Habitat for Humanity for the 1998 Jimmy Carter Work
Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot of emotions right now,'' said Lewis, who, with a
friend, will move into the new house in near northeast Houston next
week. ``I'm excited. I'm really thankful. I serve a good God.''
</P>
<P>
   She was hardly alone in her excitement as dozens of sweaty,
paint-speckled volunteers gathered at the front of the house to
joke about the hard work and heat and congratulate each other on a
job well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw people I see every day at work, and this week I saw a
different side of you,'' said volunteer Steve Furbacher, a senior
vice president of the energy company that sponsored Lewis' house.
``We didn't come with experience, but we came with will. And I know
lots of us have things on our desks back at work, and the piles
have gotten a little deeper this week, but, if you're like me, the
work seems a little easier. We built a house. Now it's going to
become a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the largest Habitat for Humanity project, the Jimmy
Carter Work Project brought together nearly 6,000 volunteers, about
1,500 of them from across the country, to spend a week under the
blazing sun building affordable homes in Second and Fifth Ward area
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers, under the guidance of professional craftsmen and
Habitat staff, labored on every aspect of the houses, from framing
and siding to wiring and painting. Initially slowed a bit by the
sweltering heat and humidity, volunteers worked overtime to
complete the homes in time for the presentation to their new owners
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Over on Sakowitz Street in east Houston, volunteers gathered on
freshly cemented driveways and held hands. Some sang ``Amazing
Grace'' and ``America the Beautiful.'' Others laughed and teased
each other as the last coats of paint were applied and grass and
trees were planted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is really no other feeling that can match that of
handing the keys to the house to the new owner and seeing their
faces light up,'' said Mary Lou Bowman, a volunteer from Ft.
Lauderdale. ``To know in your heart that you've made a difference
is incomparable.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President Carter, who with wife Rosalynn worked alongside
the volunteers throughout the week, walked from door to door in the
newly refurbished east Houston neighborhood Friday, presenting each
new homeowner with a Bible and encouraging words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me great honor to present these houses to the new
homeowners. God bless you for your efforts,'' he said, shaking the
hands of Shaline and Wade Gibson as they stood on the sidewalk in
front of their new single-story, yellow house on Sakowitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so proud,'' Wade Gibson said. ``Much love to everyone
who put their heart into this.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the new owners was required to put his or her own back
into the construction for 300 hours of ``sweat equity'' in order to
qualify for the small three- and four-bedroom homes. The new owners
buy the houses from Habitat for Humanity with no-interest mortgages
of up to $46,000.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 new houses almost doubles the number of Habitat for
Humanity homes built in Houston since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Though the project officially ended Friday, some work remained,
including finishing the interiors, landscaping and inspecting the
100 new homes on Houston's east and near-northeast sides.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Saturday, volunteers and Habitat staff will inspect
the houses to ensure they are ready for move-in day, June 27.
</P>
<P>
   New homeowner, Tamara Franshaw, 36, said she was blessed to have
worked all week with many caring individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just wonderful when you have people working together like
this, people you go to church with and work with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Franshaw said she could hardly wait for her three daughters to
step inside their new home next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of love and heart was put into this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of sweat. But volunteers said the sunburns and sore
muscles they endured could not compare to the deep gratification
they felt from doing something for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to giving birth and getting married, it's the next most
emotional experience of my life,'' said volunteer Kimmy Hallman.
``I have caught the mission of Habitat and what it stands for and
the impact it has left on me will stay with me forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, volunteers and new homeowners convened again to
attend an ecumenical service at First Baptist Church of Houston and
a volunteer celebration at the Transco Tower's Wall of Water.

HABITAT FOUNDER HAS TAKEN ON `GOD'S WORK' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN MAKEIG 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a near-divorce that inadvertently propelled Alabama
attorney and businessman Millard Fuller into a Christian ministry
that since the 1960s has erected thousands of homes for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Linda, had left him, gone to New York. He traveled
there for a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   When that succeeded, the Fullers sold their direct-mail company
and he quit practicing law in Montgomery, Ala. They simply gave
away their $1 million proceeds to Christian ministries and small
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went looking for what would be God's work,'' he explained
Friday as his latest project _ the Habitat for Humanity effort to
build 100 homes in a week in Houston with 6,000 volunteers sweating
out 100-degree days _ was approaching an end.
</P>
<P>
   His debut at building homes for the impoverished came in 1969 in
southwest Georgia. He helped a man and his family replace their
shack.
</P>
<P>
   The recipient signed his new mortgage with an ``X.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that man's daughter is an attorney in Washington, D.C., and
Fuller considers that small beginning a sort of lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A house is a foundation on which a family can grow,'' said
Fuller, 63, a tall, thin grandfather of four.
</P>
<P>
   The experience started what since has grown into a veritable
unending crusade to put up simple houses.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 60,000 have gone up worldwide in numerous places. And
with Fuller as president of Habitat for Humanity International
based in Americus, Ga., and employing more than 400, thousands more
houses are coming.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them are similar to the 1,100-square-foot,
three-bedroom houses being finished in Houston this week. The many
erected in African countries are much more humble _ a couple of
rooms, no indoor toilets or kitchens, total cost $2,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, at least, Fuller and his workers have been
unmolested by the government. In Uganda, the military confiscated
their trucks to haul corpses away from battlefields _ a problem
Fuller's best known volunteer, former President Jimmy Carter, was
able to solve with one telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller considers the Houston project a success, despite some
personnel not arriving on time, minor thefts from three work sites
and numerous volunteers ailing from the relentless heat.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening's end of the marathon project did not mean Fuller
can take a break to rest up. He leaves Saturday for Boston, makes
other stops for speeches and fund-raisers, and by July 10 will be
off for Asia for more work on homes in Sri Lanka, South Korea and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   By next March he will be in the Philippines where 250 more homes
will go up.
</P>
<P>
   And the list continues, edging toward his goal of simply
eliminating poverty housing entirely.

   What makes Leo run?
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 16 months, Leo J. Hindery Jr. has been the good
cop to John C. Malone's bad cop at Tele-Communications Inc., the
nation's second-largest cable operator.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining TCI in March of last year, Hindery has improved
the company's image on Wall Street by selling cable systems to
reduce its staggering debt. Delighted investors have shown their
approval by sending TCI's long-depressed stock up 149 percent since
the February 1997 announcement of his coming arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, his assiduous schmoozing has won over even the
most vociferous critics of Malone's often arrogant style. ``I think
in a very short period of time, Leo has tried to deliver a
different kind of message about the company,'' said Andrew J.
Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a public
interest law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Hindery has accumulated a personal fortune of at
least $70 million, much of it from a huge TCI stock-option grant.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to Hindery than the stick-figure portrayal of
a rich, hard-working president. Realistic as he has been in
tackling TCI's problems, when it comes to his own life he has the
puzzling habit of relating stories about the difficulties of his
childhood that are at odds with the accounts of his family members.
</P>
<P>
   At a 7 A.M. breakfast interview recently at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel in Manhattan, during one of his frequent business trips to
New York, the 50-year-old executive recounted how he had left home
at the age of 13 to fend for himself.
</P>
<P>
   His parents didn't bother looking for him, he said, because
``they didn't care if I left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cheaper having me out of the house,'' Hindery
continued. He said he lost touch with his family _ was ``living
with people,'' that ``the Jesuits got me through'' and that he
joined the merchant marine at age 16.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his family, however, doesn't remember it that way.
In separate telephone interviews, Hindery's widowed mother, sister
and brother all said that Hindery lived at home until he graduated
from high school. His younger brother, Michael, a dean at Stanford
Medical School, remembers that when Leo Hindery was in his early
20s, he got his kid brother a job at the mining company where he
then worked, Utah International, based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Rev. William F. LeRoux, assistant dean for
university relations and Hindery's former professor at Seattle
University, Hindery's alma mater, said that in his recollection,
Hindery had remained close to his father throughout his college
years. Father LeRoux, Michael Hindery and his mother, Marie, could
not recall a stint by Leo Hindery in the merchant marine.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with these discrepancies late last week, Hindery said
that his recollections of events that took place decades ago were
less benign than those of others, and he stood by his accounts of a
difficult childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never exaggerate about that,'' he said. And he insisted that
he had spent several summers working on a ship called the U.S.S.
Avila off the Northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past hurts, and I don't like it,'' Hindery said.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Zaleznik, Konosuke Matsushita professor of leadership
emeritus at the Harvard Business School, said storytelling is a
pattern among some American business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatized accounts of childhood might well reflect ``the need
to create a mythology about himself that may protect him from more
painful memories,'' Zaleznik said. Business luminaries including
Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford, he said, have portrayed themselves
as ``the lonely figure who was hurt and injured and travels through
life, overcoming all travails to become a success.''
</P>
<P>
   That an executive might exaggerate his past could send up red
flags for an investor _ or spur confidence that his drive to
succeed could work for the benefit of his employer.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Hindery's energy seems well harnessed at
TCI, which among cable operators is eclipsed in size only by Time
Warner. His success in part may come from his skill in telling
people what they want to hear while maintaining his positions. And
he may have the ideal partner in Malone, TCI's chairman, who seems
to care little about what people think of his company.
</P>
<P>
   During Hindery's tenure, TCI has transformed itself from a
company that customers, investors and regulators loved to hate into
one of the more solid and image-conscious performers in the cable
industry.
</P>
<P>
   An incident at a cable-industry conference in Atlanta last month
illustrated the soothing effect the president has had in his role
as diplomatic counter to his blunt boss. Malone had just upset
congressional leaders and broadcasting executives by threatening to
drop all-news cable services if the federal government forced TCI
to carry high-definition television signals.
</P>
<P>
   But before another Malone-induced media imbroglio could move
into high gear, Hindery rushed out a conciliatory statement that
``no cable customer will be disenfranchised from receiving an HDTV
broadcast signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: TCI was not suddenly caving in to public
pressure. But the company, which had rarely taken account of public
opinion until Hindery came on board, was finally showing some savvy
in playing industry politics. Hindery at least indicated that TCI
would continue a dialogue with the government about cable's role in
the HDTV business.
</P>
<P>
   Revamping TCI's image has been a gargantuan task. Malone, long
considered a brilliant strategist and technical expert, built TCI
into the nation's dominant cable operator by gobbling up cable
systems but investing less than many other operators in customer
services. Malone had no problem playing the corporate heavy, once
even declaring that Reed E. Hundt, then the chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, should be shot.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``John is a kind of John Wayne,'' observed Hundt, who left the
commission last fall. ``He didn't see a lot of reason for the
government to be in his business.'' Malone declined to be
interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery's more measured approach to both the government and the
balance sheet appears to be paying off. To consolidate operations,
he began to negotiate joint ventures with companies that had cable
systems adjacent to TCI's. The ventures offered their owners
economies of scale and let TCI focus more intently on its remaining
cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals, when completed, will let TCI reduce the debt on its
own balance sheet by $4.7 billion, or 32 percent, to $9.6 billion,
while still retaining a minority stake in the new companies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the crucial ratio of debt to cash flow available to
make interest and debt payments is expected to fall to about 4.5 by
the end of the third quarter of 1998 from 6.1 at the end of 1996,
improving TCI's credit rating and making its borrowings less
costly.
</P>
<P>
   True, the creation of these joint ventures will also reduce the
number of TCI subscribers by 30 percent, to about 10 million. But
it will streamline operations, since TCI will have 60 percent of
its customers in 10 states, rather than sprawled across 24 states.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery boasts that he is a master of reading people. ``I know
people. I know them better than anyone knows them. I don't talk
about it much, but I never make mistakes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't always so good at getting along with them. Before
going to TCI, Hindery founded various limited partnerships,
collectively known as Intermedia Partners, to invest in cable
systems. All three of his general partners left after disputes with
him, according to several people formerly associated with the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery upset at least one of those partners by pressuring him
to reduce his stake in the partnerships, one insider said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the former partners, Ed Allen and Ted Liebst, declined to
comment, and the third, David Rozzelle, did not return phone calls.
Hindery said simply that ``they left.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, Hindery has apparently established good rapport
with his underlings at TCI. A hard driver who puts in 15-hour days,
he has replaced 25 managers, mostly from within. To give employees
a stake in TCI's growth, he has nearly tripled the number of
nonofficers and nondirectors in the stock-option program to 440
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were about three people in the option program
before,'' he said at the recent breakfast meeting _ the first of
three he held that morning.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important, Hindery throws himself into the task
of marketing TCI with unrestrained gusto. He can be as obsessive
about promoting the company as he is about selling himself.
</P>
<P>
   When an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter put out a lukewarm
report on the company, for example, TCI angrily responded by taking
away its investment banking business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malone was never that sensitive, but Leo takes what an analyst
thinks of the stock as a personal thing,'' said one person close to
the situation. Hindery countered that Primestar Partners, a
satellite-TV consortium in which TCI is a member, has done business
with Morgan Stanley since the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his efforts have helped polish the cable industry's
image. Many people say the arrogance of the cable executives was at
least partly responsible for the Cable Act of 1992, which
reregulated the industry.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, when Hundt took office at the FCC, 128 members of
Congress and a third of the Senate told him that the the first
round of cable price cuts were not adequate because the industry
had effectively lobbied for regulation with huge loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Burdened by debt and government regulation, TCI's stock declined
from the end of 1993 to the start of 1997. Finally last year, as
the stock languished and pressure mounted on the company, Malone
himself brought Hindery aboard.
</P>
<P>
   He has proven a respectful subordinate. ``John has a great sense
of the industry and he sees things,'' Hindery said. ``He is
brilliant. I am clever. I am not as smart as John.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic, yes; modest, no. ``I think we all have our strengths
and weaknesses,'' Hindery said. ``John can be anything he wants to
be, but it is better for us if I go run the company, and he figures
out where we are going to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Malone, who avoided industry association roles, Hindery
has just been named head of the National Cable Television
Association. And he is far more willing than Malone to work with
Washington and community franchise boards.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hundt recalled that last summer, during a weeklong
outing for media moguls organized by Allen &AMP; Co., the investment
banking firm, Hindery laid out to him TCI's plan for selling cable
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked whether the FCC could work with it,'' Hundt said.
``He smoothed the way.''
</P>
<P>
   TCI, of course, has not entirely changed its spots. Hindery and
Malone are currently arguing with broadcasters on how much
bandwidth the broadcasters are entitled to for HDTV signals.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street clearly likes the new team. True, its stock's
149 percent surge since the announcement that Hindery was coming on
board has fallen short of the rival Cablevision Systems' 257.2
percent leap in that time, though it exceeds Comcast's doubling and
has kept pace with the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   More important, TCI has regained Wall Street's confidence. In an
event almost unimaginable five years ago, the Association for
Investment Management and Research in Charlottesville, Va., awarded
TCI a prize for the most improved investor-relations program in the
media industry last year. And there is an obvious effort to make an
immensely complex annual report clearer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hindery is in the office or on the phone by 5 a.m. and says he
doesn't need more than four or five hours' sleep a night. He
attributes that drive to his ``weird'' childhood in Tacoma, Wash.,
where, he said, ``I started paying for everything in my life when I
was 9 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work in the fields, and I would give the money to my
family, partly because that was how my family worked and partly
because I was so mad at them,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a such a crummy childhood. You just can't know how cruel
my parents were. Nobody beat me, but there was just a total absence
of affection. I got a Christmas gift once. It was a belt, a size 38
belt. I weighed about 125 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members confirm that Hindery had a job picking berries at
the age of 9. But they describe his childhood as reasonably
structured, saying he held down such prosaic jobs as packing
grocery bags at a Safeway supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leo lived at home with us through high school and had the same
treatment and gifts,'' said Michael Hindery, who insisted that he
remained attached to his older brother for years after.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hindery acknowledges that she has had her share of
emotional problems. In telephone interviews, she said she suffered
from the eating disorders of anorexia and bulimia, had low
self-esteem and was estranged from all three of her children.
</P>
<P>
   And both Hindery brothers agree that their parents, who had not
gone to college, insisted on hard work. ``I worked in shipyards
full time to put myself through school,'' Leo Hindery said. ``I
went to sea and I drove trucks, and I picked crops. I did every
crummy job.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Seattle University, he said, he attended
Stanford's business school, subsequently going to work for Utah
International, a mining company. After General Electric acquired
the company in 1976 (it has since sold it), he moved to Wall
Street, where he served as managing director and chief financial
officer of A.G. Becker Paribas, the investment banking firm.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the media world when he was hired by the Chronicle
Publishing Company in San Francisco, where he was chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Like many executives at the notably fractious Chronicle, his
performance at the media company got mixed reviews. Some members of
the Theriot family, which owns the company, felt he was too
ambitious, while others applauded him for helping to bring deal
making to the stodgy concern.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he decided to go out on his own, and raised $200
million to buy cable systems through a series of partnerships,
creating Intermedia.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, Malone offered Hindery the chance to run TCI.
Hindery says he accepted because of his affection for Malone, whom
he knew through industry circles, and because he welcomed the
chance to straighten out the nation's second-largest cable
operator.
</P>
<P>
   Money wasn't a consideration, he says. Even so, there was
certainly a lot of it. First, Hindery sold his stake in
Intermedia's cable systems to TCI for $55 million in stock and
cash. Hindery left $20 million of that in the company, though with
strings attached to encourage employees and advisers to stay on and
run it.
</P>
<P>
   And at TCI, Hindery got himself a lucrative options grant. By
the company's own reckoning, his 4.425 million options were worth
$27.7 million when they were granted. Adding in two other grants
that were not valued, the executive-compensation expert Graef
Crystal estimates the total value at more than $35 million, making
Hindery the recipient of one of 1997's largest option packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have been more well deserved,'' Hindery said.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock has gone up since his arrival, it is in part
because Hindery works like a maniac, a style even his family can
find taxing. Hindery described himself as somewhat of an absentee
father to his teen-age daughter, and his wife said that living with
her husband was rather like having an eccentric uncle in the attic.
``You get used to it after a while,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eccentricity might well be Hindery's defining characteristic,
driving both his need to perhaps embellish his life story and his
need to succeed. Indirectly, then, his very eccentricity seems to
have brought some management sanity to Tele-Communications. Whether
it will always play such a positive role is a harder call.

GIULIANI SEEKS STRICTER LICENSING FOR CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having declared victory in campaigns against
corruption at garbage-carting companies and in the Fulton Fish
Market, the Giuliani administration now has its sights on another
target: New York City's giant $24 billion construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a proposal to be submitted Monday to the City Council, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani will ask for the power to determine through
licensing regulations which companies are fit to work on public or
private construction projects in the city. Contractors could be
denied licenses if they were found to ``lack good character,
honesty and integrity'' _ a broad standard that includes
criminality, ties to organized crime, tax delinquency and a record
of poor workmanship.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, the legislation is expected to have far-reaching
effects on a huge industry with more than 9,000 companies and
90,000 workers who are responsible for projects ranging from the
erection of skyscrapers to modest renovations in apartment
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Friday they were proposing the
licensing procedure because they believe that persistent corruption
within the industry has elevated the cost of construction in the
city. Industry officials said they had not seen the mayor's plan
and declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the proposal is a five-member New York City
Construction Commission, appointed by the mayor, with broad
regulatory and investigative powers. Several large cities and
scores of states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, have
limited forms of regulation, but none as extensive as the
administration proposes for New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Under current laws, the city has virtually no licensing controls
over companies that do private construction work. A contractor is
required only to obtain a permit from the Buildings Department
certifying that its plans comply with the city's zoning and
building codes.
</P>
<P>
   The city, however, can bar a construction company from obtaining
municipal contracts on grounds that the company is considered
professionally unqualified or that its officials lack integrity _
for example, if they have financial ties to organized-crime
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that abuses are still rife in the
industry despite numerous law enforcement crackdowns over the last
20 years against mobsters, dishonest contractors, corrupt union
officials and city inspectors who took bribes to overlook
violations. According to the officials, the costs of construction
in the city are 35 percent above the national average and they
attribute most of the inflated prices to bid-rigging and other
corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also takes aim at contractors with poor safety records.
Officials cited the deaths of two pedestrians this year who were
struck by falling bricks, and the extensive problems caused last
year by crumbling walls in a midtown office building, as evidence
of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is about accountability,'' Randy Mastro, the deputy
mayor for operations, said in an interview Friday. ``It is also
about higher standards and personal and professional integrity in
an industry that has been plagued by corruption and safety problems
in the recent past and over many decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastro said he felt the city's proposal is on firm legal footing
since similar mechanisms for regulating the waste-carting industry
and the Fulton Fish Market have survived legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has credited the tough licensing policies for
eliminating Mafia influence in the businesses, for increasing
competition and for sharply lowering private garbage-removal costs
and the wholesale prices of seafood.
</P>
<P>
   The past initiatives of the mayor, a Republican, were swiftly
approved with strong support from City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani and Vallone are now locked in an acrimonious budget
dispute and Vallone's support for the construction-industry bill
was not evident Friday. In a terse statement, he said that the
mayor's office had not consulted him about the bill and that he was
unaware of its contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, what we want is a bill that goes after corrupt
businesses and does not hurt honest business people,'' Vallone
said.
</P>
<P>
   By seeking to regulate construction companies, the
administration will be tackling a politically more powerful and
affluent industry than trash haulers and fish merchants, who
opposed the attempts to monitor their businesses and investigate
their backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The heads of construction-industry trade associations said they
knew that a bill was being prepared but they declined to comment
until they could study its actual language.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry leaders, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the proposal would likely be seen by some in the
business as costly intrusions in enterprises that are vital to the
city's economic health.
</P>
<P>
   The trade association officials said corruption and the
influence of organized crime was not pervasive and that
construction prices in the city were elevated by labor costs and by
congestion that delays deliveries of equipment and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mayor's proposal, the licensing commission would have
the following powers:
</P>
<P>
   _ To conduct background investigations and the fingerprinting of
the principal officers and investors of companies applying for
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ To examine the financial and tax records of company officials
and investors.
</P>
<P>
   _ To deny licenses to companies affiliated with organized-crime
figures or who employ subcontracting companies that the commission
finds unfit for licenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ To demand as a condition of licensing that a company hire an
independent auditor and monitor approved by the commission to
oversee the company and to guarantee its integrity and fitness to
operate in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials who violate commission regulations would be
subject to misdemeanor charges and fines of up to $10,000 and six
months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal mandates that the commission phase in the licensing
by beginning with the 400 to 500 major contractors that have
obtained at least $3 million in contracts in the city in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Giuliani, as the U.S. attorney for the
Southern District, and Mastro, as one of his top prosecutors, were
involved in the conviction of more than 30 Mafia leaders and
associates on racketeering charges involving multimillion-dollar
construction contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutions alone have not solved the problem,'' Mastro said.
``As part of a long-term strategy, comprehensive regulatory reform
is needed to end the hidden `mob taxes,' and the end results will
benefit the public and businesses through lower building costs and
rents in the city.''

DICK GIBSON, 72, JAZZ PRODUCER AND FAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   (bl)  
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Gibson, a longtime jazz aficionado and the producer of what
he called an annual jazz party in Colorado, died at the Red Rocks
Health Center hospice in Denver on Wednesday. He was 72 and lived
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from diabetes, said his son Robey.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson ran his jazz party for some 30 years, starting in 1963,
and usually during the Labor Day weekend. Each year, he took
musicians he liked to towns in Colorado, including Vail, Aspen,
Colorado Springs and Denver, along with critics and fans, and for
three days different formations of musicians played.
</P>
<P>
   Those events pulled together musicians who had not seen one
another in years, and the spontaneous nature of the festivities
created a casual sort of brilliance, where the musicians were
playing for themselves and friends. The parties were also important
because they were held during a period in which jazz had fallen out
of favor in American culture.
</P>
<P>
   While Gibson strove to break even, bringing in up to 500 paying
guests at a time, they were in a sense underground events, where
the overlooked idiom of mainstream jazz had its yearly reunion in
front of its fans. And out of each party inevitably came other
parties, along with recording and club dates.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson had a widely varied career. An expert on Oriental rugs
and cloisonne, he also wrote fiction, worked as an investment
banker and made a fortune by forming the Water Pik company, which
he sold in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a jazz entrepreneur, having formed the World's
Greatest Jazz Band in 1968. It included Bob Haggart on bass, Yank
Lawson on trumpet, Bob Wilber on reeds, Ralph Sutton on piano and
Gus Johnson on drums.
</P>

   What makes Leo run?
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 16 months, Leo J. Hindery Jr. has been the good
cop to John C. Malone's bad cop at Tele-Communications Inc., the
nation's second-largest cable operator.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining TCI in March of last year, Hindery has improved
the company's image on Wall Street by selling cable systems to
reduce its staggering debt. Delighted investors have shown their
approval by sending TCI's long-depressed stock up 149 percent since
the February 1997 announcement of his coming arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, his assiduous schmoozing has won over even the
most vociferous critics of Malone's often arrogant style. ``I think
in a very short period of time, Leo has tried to deliver a
different kind of message about the company,'' said Andrew J.
Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a public
interest law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Hindery has accumulated a personal fortune of at
least $70 million, much of it from a huge TCI stock-option grant.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to Hindery than the stick-figure portrayal of
a rich, hard-working president. Realistic as he has been in
tackling TCI's problems, when it comes to his own life he has the
puzzling habit of relating stories about the difficulties of his
childhood that are at odds with the accounts of his family members.
</P>
<P>
   At a 7 A.M. breakfast interview recently at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel in Manhattan, during one of his frequent business trips to
New York, the 50-year-old executive recounted how he had left home
at the age of 13 to fend for himself.
</P>
<P>
   His parents didn't bother looking for him, he said, because
``they didn't care if I left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cheaper having me out of the house,'' Hindery
continued. He said he lost touch with his family _ was ``living
with people,'' that ``the Jesuits got me through'' and that he
joined the merchant marine at age 16.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his family, however, doesn't remember it that way.
In separate telephone interviews, Hindery's widowed mother, sister
and brother all said that Hindery lived at home until he graduated
from high school. His younger brother, Michael, a dean at Stanford
Medical School, remembers that when Leo Hindery was in his early
20s, he got his kid brother a job at the mining company where he
then worked, Utah International, based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Rev. William F. LeRoux, assistant dean for
university relations and Hindery's former professor at Seattle
University, Hindery's alma mater, said that in his recollection,
Hindery had remained close to his father throughout his college
years. Father LeRoux, Michael Hindery and his mother, Marie, could
not recall a stint by Leo Hindery in the merchant marine.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with these discrepancies late last week, Hindery said
that his recollections of events that took place decades ago were
less benign than those of others, and he stood by his accounts of a
difficult childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never exaggerate about that,'' he said. And he insisted that
he had spent several summers working on a ship called the U.S.S.
Avila off the Northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past hurts, and I don't like it,'' Hindery said.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Zaleznik, Konosuke Matsushita professor of leadership
emeritus at the Harvard Business School, said storytelling is a
pattern among some American business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatized accounts of childhood might well reflect ``the need
to create a mythology about himself that may protect him from more
painful memories,'' Zaleznik said. Business luminaries including
Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford, he said, have portrayed themselves
as ``the lonely figure who was hurt and injured and travels through
life, overcoming all travails to become a success.''
</P>
<P>
   That an executive might exaggerate his past could send up red
flags for an investor _ or spur confidence that his drive to
succeed could work for the benefit of his employer.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Hindery's energy seems well harnessed at
TCI, which among cable operators is eclipsed in size only by Time
Warner. His success in part may come from his skill in telling
people what they want to hear while maintaining his positions. And
he may have the ideal partner in Malone, TCI's chairman, who seems
to care little about what people think of his company.
</P>
<P>
   During Hindery's tenure, TCI has transformed itself from a
company that customers, investors and regulators loved to hate into
one of the more solid and image-conscious performers in the cable
industry.
</P>
<P>
   An incident at a cable-industry conference in Atlanta last month
illustrated the soothing effect the president has had in his role
as diplomatic counter to his blunt boss. Malone had just upset
congressional leaders and broadcasting executives by threatening to
drop all-news cable services if the federal government forced TCI
to carry high-definition television signals.
</P>
<P>
   But before another Malone-induced media imbroglio could move
into high gear, Hindery rushed out a conciliatory statement that
``no cable customer will be disenfranchised from receiving an HDTV
broadcast signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: TCI was not suddenly caving in to public
pressure. But the company, which had rarely taken account of public
opinion until Hindery came on board, was finally showing some savvy
in playing industry politics. Hindery at least indicated that TCI
would continue a dialogue with the government about cable's role in
the HDTV business.
</P>
<P>
   Revamping TCI's image has been a gargantuan task. Malone, long
considered a brilliant strategist and technical expert, built TCI
into the nation's dominant cable operator by gobbling up cable
systems but investing less than many other operators in customer
services. Malone had no problem playing the corporate heavy, once
even declaring that Reed E. Hundt, then the chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, should be shot.

AGENT: VAN EXEL EXPECTS TO GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ A labor standoff and imminent lockout of players has
put a chill in the usually heated offseason swap meet of NBA
talents. But amid that uncertainty the Lakers are certain about
this much: They will attempt to trade point guard Nick Van Exel by
the time training camps open this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Executive vice president Jerry West made that much clear to Van
Exel's agent the day after the Lakers were eliminated from the
playoffs. All that remains is finding the right return package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after the playoffs, they said he was gone.... We've been
operating on that assumption since,'' said agent James Bryant of
Pro Serv.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, as per usual policy, won't confirm West made the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry West had a conversation with James Bryant.... We're not
going to comment on what was said in those private conversations,''
Lakers spokesman John Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a Van Exel trade is as much a June tradition as Michael
Jordan chomping championship cigars, and yet Van Exel has weathered
several offseasons of such chatter.
</P>
<P>
   This time it sounds like more than just idle speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to happen,'' Bryant said. ``Who knows
where.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where'' might be the sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick's not going to go to just any situation,'' according to
Bryant, and his objections to certain teams could potentially
scuttle a deal. Though the NBA does not allow no-trade clauses in
player contracts, a handful of coveted players _ notably Kenny
Anderson and Rony Seikaly _ worked trades in their favor this
season by refusing to report.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant didn't indicate Van Exel would follow that route, but
said any deal ``needs to be a mutually worked through situation,''
with input from Van Exel's camp. Bryant said he's not insisting on
a trade to a contender. He also figured a trade to the Eastern
Conference was likely _ ``I suspect Jerry West doesn't want him
somewhere where (Van Exel) can hurt (the Lakers).''
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel, 26, has one year remaining on a five-year, $10.5
million contract and poses both a bargain and a gamble to any
suitors. He's coming off his first All-Star campaign and led the
league in assist-to-turnover ratio, but finished the season with
just a 13.8-points-per-game average _ lowest since his rookie
season _ after undergoing right knee surgery in late February.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel also has a chronically sore left knee and although he
never cited injuries as a factor, Van Exel struggled in the
playoffs, shooting 23.8 percent in the conference finals loss to
Utah.

<P>
   ``John is a kind of John Wayne,'' observed Hundt, who left the
commission last fall. ``He didn't see a lot of reason for the
government to be in his business.'' Malone declined to be
interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery's more measured approach to both the government and the
balance sheet appears to be paying off. To consolidate operations,
he began to negotiate joint ventures with companies that had cable
systems adjacent to TCI's. The ventures offered their owners
economies of scale and let TCI focus more intently on its remaining
cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals, when completed, will let TCI reduce the debt on its
own balance sheet by $4.7 billion, or 32 percent, to $9.6 billion,
while still retaining a minority stake in the new companies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the crucial ratio of debt to cash flow available to
make interest and debt payments is expected to fall to about 4.5 by
the end of the third quarter of 1998 from 6.1 at the end of 1996,
improving TCI's credit rating and making its borrowings less
costly.
</P>
<P>
   True, the creation of these joint ventures will also reduce the
number of TCI subscribers by 30 percent, to about 10 million. But
it will streamline operations, since TCI will have 60 percent of
its customers in 10 states, rather than sprawled across 24 states.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery boasts that he is a master of reading people. ``I know
people. I know them better than anyone knows them. I don't talk
about it much, but I never make mistakes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't always so good at getting along with them. Before
going to TCI, Hindery founded various limited partnerships,
collectively known as Intermedia Partners, to invest in cable
systems. All three of his general partners left after disputes with
him, according to several people formerly associated with the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery upset at least one of those partners by pressuring him
to reduce his stake in the partnerships, one insider said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the former partners, Ed Allen and Ted Liebst, declined to
comment, and the third, David Rozzelle, did not return phone calls.
Hindery said simply that ``they left.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, Hindery has apparently established good rapport
with his underlings at TCI. A hard driver who puts in 15-hour days,
he has replaced 25 managers, mostly from within. To give employees
a stake in TCI's growth, he has nearly tripled the number of
nonofficers and nondirectors in the stock-option program to 440
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were about three people in the option program
before,'' he said at the recent breakfast meeting _ the first of
three he held that morning.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important, Hindery throws himself into the task
of marketing TCI with unrestrained gusto. He can be as obsessive
about promoting the company as he is about selling himself.
</P>
<P>
   When an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter put out a lukewarm
report on the company, for example, TCI angrily responded by taking
away its investment banking business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malone was never that sensitive, but Leo takes what an analyst
thinks of the stock as a personal thing,'' said one person close to
the situation. Hindery countered that Primestar Partners, a
satellite-TV consortium in which TCI is a member, has done business
with Morgan Stanley since the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his efforts have helped polish the cable industry's
image. Many people say the arrogance of the cable executives was at
least partly responsible for the Cable Act of 1992, which
reregulated the industry.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, when Hundt took office at the FCC, 128 members of
Congress and a third of the Senate told him that the the first
round of cable price cuts were not adequate because the industry
had effectively lobbied for regulation with huge loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Burdened by debt and government regulation, TCI's stock declined
from the end of 1993 to the start of 1997. Finally last year, as
the stock languished and pressure mounted on the company, Malone
himself brought Hindery aboard.
</P>
<P>
   He has proven a respectful subordinate. ``John has a great sense
of the industry and he sees things,'' Hindery said. ``He is
brilliant. I am clever. I am not as smart as John.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic, yes; modest, no. ``I think we all have our strengths
and weaknesses,'' Hindery said. ``John can be anything he wants to
be, but it is better for us if I go run the company, and he figures
out where we are going to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Malone, who avoided industry association roles, Hindery
has just been named head of the National Cable Television
Association. And he is far more willing than Malone to work with
Washington and community franchise boards.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hundt recalled that last summer, during a weeklong
outing for media moguls organized by Allen &AMP; Co., the investment
banking firm, Hindery laid out to him TCI's plan for selling cable
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked whether the FCC could work with it,'' Hundt said.
``He smoothed the way.''
</P>
<P>
   TCI, of course, has not entirely changed its spots. Hindery and
Malone are currently arguing with broadcasters on how much
bandwidth the broadcasters are entitled to for HDTV signals.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street clearly likes the new team. True, its stock's
149 percent surge since the announcement that Hindery was coming on
board has fallen short of the rival Cablevision Systems' 257.2
percent leap in that time, though it exceeds Comcast's doubling and
has kept pace with the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   More important, TCI has regained Wall Street's confidence. In an
event almost unimaginable five years ago, the Association for
Investment Management and Research in Charlottesville, Va., awarded
TCI a prize for the most improved investor-relations program in the
media industry last year. And there is an obvious effort to make an
immensely complex annual report clearer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hindery is in the office or on the phone by 5 a.m. and says he
doesn't need more than four or five hours' sleep a night. He
attributes that drive to his ``weird'' childhood in Tacoma, Wash.,
where, he said, ``I started paying for everything in my life when I
was 9 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work in the fields, and I would give the money to my
family, partly because that was how my family worked and partly
because I was so mad at them,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a such a crummy childhood. You just can't know how cruel
my parents were. Nobody beat me, but there was just a total absence
of affection. I got a Christmas gift once. It was a belt, a size 38
belt. I weighed about 125 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members confirm that Hindery had a job picking berries at
the age of 9. But they describe his childhood as reasonably
structured, saying he held down such prosaic jobs as packing
grocery bags at a Safeway supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leo lived at home with us through high school and had the same
treatment and gifts,'' said Michael Hindery, who insisted that he
remained attached to his older brother for years after.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hindery acknowledges that she has had her share of
emotional problems. In telephone interviews, she said she suffered
from the eating disorders of anorexia and bulimia, had low
self-esteem and was estranged from all three of her children.
</P>
<P>
   And both Hindery brothers agree that their parents, who had not
gone to college, insisted on hard work. ``I worked in shipyards
full time to put myself through school,'' Leo Hindery said. ``I
went to sea and I drove trucks, and I picked crops. I did every
crummy job.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Seattle University, he said, he attended
Stanford's business school, subsequently going to work for Utah
International, a mining company. After General Electric acquired
the company in 1976 (it has since sold it), he moved to Wall
Street, where he served as managing director and chief financial
officer of A.G. Becker Paribas, the investment banking firm.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the media world when he was hired by the Chronicle
Publishing Company in San Francisco, where he was chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Like many executives at the notably fractious Chronicle, his
performance at the media company got mixed reviews. Some members of
the Theriot family, which owns the company, felt he was too
ambitious, while others applauded him for helping to bring deal
making to the stodgy concern.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he decided to go out on his own, and raised $200
million to buy cable systems through a series of partnerships,
creating Intermedia.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, Malone offered Hindery the chance to run TCI.
Hindery says he accepted because of his affection for Malone, whom
he knew through industry circles, and because he welcomed the
chance to straighten out the nation's second-largest cable
operator.
</P>
<P>
   Money wasn't a consideration, he says. Even so, there was
certainly a lot of it. First, Hindery sold his stake in
Intermedia's cable systems to TCI for $55 million in stock and
cash. Hindery left $20 million of that in the company, though with
strings attached to encourage employees and advisers to stay on and
run it.
</P>
<P>
   And at TCI, Hindery got himself a lucrative options grant. By
the company's own reckoning, his 4.425 million options were worth
$27.7 million when they were granted. Adding in two other grants
that were not valued, the executive-compensation expert Graef
Crystal estimates the total value at more than $35 million, making
Hindery the recipient of one of 1997's largest option packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have been more well deserved,'' Hindery said.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock has gone up since his arrival, it is in part
because Hindery works like a maniac, a style even his family can
find taxing. Hindery described himself as somewhat of an absentee
father to his teen-age daughter, and his wife said that living with
her husband was rather like having an eccentric uncle in the attic.
``You get used to it after a while,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eccentricity might well be Hindery's defining characteristic,
driving both his need to perhaps embellish his life story and his
need to succeed. Indirectly, then, his very eccentricity seems to
have brought some management sanity to Tele-Communications. Whether
it will always play such a positive role is a harder call.

THE LACK OF TRUTH BRINGS A BOUNTY OF CONSEQUENCES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In December, Patricia Smith was on top of this town,
her center-parted braids and half-smile dominating the cover of
Boston magazine's issue on the city's most intriguing women.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Ms. Smith was winning ovations from hundreds of
adoring literati at the Taos Poetry Circus with her fiery
declamation of a poem about an 11-year-old gang member about to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Ms. Smith was in disgrace, her brilliant journalism
career mourned by colleagues and admirers, her downfall gloated
over by enemies, after she was caught fabricating quotes and
characters in her Boston Globe columns.
</P>
<P>
   But the focus of scrutiny also moved Friday to Mike Barnicle,
The Globe's superstar columnist, whose tough-guy style and devoted
following recall the famed New York columnist Jimmy Breslin.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dershowitz of the Harvard Law School said Friday in a open
letter to The Globe that were also serious questions about
Barnicle's credibility and that the newspaper's decision to demand
the resignation of Ms. Smith, who is black, and not Barnicle, who
is white, ``raises serious questions of a double standard, possibly
based on race, gender and ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz has accused Barnicle of falsely attributing a racist
and sexist remark to him in 1990. He said The Globe, which is owned
by The New York Times Company, did not dismiss Barnicle ``because
he's too valuable and he appeals much more to the core constituency
of The Globe than she does.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of Dershowitz's comments and the case of Ms. Smith, The
Globe has initiated a full review of columns by Ms. Smith and
Barnicle since January 1996, when the newspaper began a system
under which editors occasionally double check metropolitan
columnists' sources, a spokesman for The Globe, Richard Gulla, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle failed to return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, 42, was also unavailable for comment Friday, said
Michael Brown, her husband and a fellow poet. It was not clear what
she would do next, he said. Asked in a brief telephone interview if
she would concentrate on a work-in-progress, a novel in poem form
about a young gang member, he said, ``It would be wrong to make
that inference at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   What was clear, at this stage, is that her words will be deeply
missed by an array of colleagues and readers who valued her columns
championing blacks, Hispanic residents, the poor, women, gay men
and lesbians, AIDS patients and others.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith was the only black female columnist at a major Boston
newspaper, and colleagues say that though she often drew criticism
for writing too often or too outspokenly about race, she wrote with
widely acclaimed linguistic talent and drew attention to people
whose views are often ignored or discounted. She was a Pulitzer
Prize finalist this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find her enormously talented, and I believe that she had an
important voice in this market, in Boston,'' said Scott Powers,
arts editor at The Globe, who has known Ms. Smith for almost 15
years. ``There are a number of people here, including me, who
looked up to her tremendously _ as a creative person, as a
journalist, as an important voice and just somebody you felt you
could rally around.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zachary Dowdy, president of the Boston Association of Black
Journalists, said, ``I think people feel as if they had lost a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Or an enemy. On WRKO radio, the conservative Boston Herald
columnist Howie Carr suggested Ms. Smith be called ``Patricia
Pinocchio Smith'' and said the departure of the ``preachy, pompous,
man-hating'' columnist made him so happy that he needed no Father's
Day present.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith reached her lofty columnist status from relatively
humble beginnings. She grew up lower-middle-class in Chicago,
daughter of a newspaper-loving father who was murdered when she was
20. At 21 she had a son by a man who later left her.
</P>
<P>
   She broke into journalism as a typist at The Chicago Daily News,
and her self-fueled career start, she wrote in her farewell column
Friday, could have contributed to the overdrive that led her to cut
corners: ``To make up for the fact that I didn't get that `correct'
start in journalism, I set out to be 10 times as good by doing 10
times as much,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But from the beginning, it seems, Ms. Smith also took some
poetic license with the truth. She told a jobs fair for minority
journalists this winter that she gained her first writing job on
the Chicago Daily News, reviewing music performances, by lying to
an editor and saying she had heard black people discussing a
boycott of the newspaper because it reviewed so few performances by
blacks, The Providence Journal-Bulletin reported earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, a review of an Elton John concert that she wrote for
The Chicago Sun-Times contained such inaccuracies _ including which
songs were performed _ that questions arose as to whether she had
attended at all. Powers, who was her superior at the time, said she
attributed the mistakes to inattention and other circumstances, and
he kept Ms. Smith, who was then only an editorial assistant and
aspiring reporter, from writing for a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   But when, eight years later, Ms. Smith was being considered as a
columnist at The Globe, he did not bring that old gaffe up: ``I
don't believe it would have been fair to her or the paper to raise
the issue,'' he said. ``I regarded it as a lesson learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith's columns on Mondays and Fridays turned into some of
the most controversial and discomfiting writing in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial of the British au pair Louise Woodward, for
example, she wrote that ``If Louise Woodward had been a black woman
accused of killing a white child, the public would have called for
the electric chair to be wheeled directly into the courtroom.'' And
concerning a dispute over development in Cambridge's Central
Square, she castigated ``slimy and greedy bottom-line visionaries
summarily raising their grubby middle fingers toward a community
they've vowed to destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   She also delved into accusations of racial discrimination in
Boston's public transit system, and offered slices of life from the
street that often reflected the opposite side of Boston from the
more white, Irish-American areas where Barnicle seems most
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she wrote two columns a week, Ms. Smith also gained
renown as a poet, publishing volumes of poetry and organizing
public readings at a Cambridge lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Her poetic habits of mind may have contributed to Ms. Smith's
willingness to blur the lines of truth, said Jeff Johnson, a copy
editor and friend of Ms. Smith at The Sun-Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very creative person,'' Johnson said, ``and she
probably didn't consider that all the rules of journalism applied
to her.''

   STOCKS END VOLATILE WEEK LOWER IN WAVES OF SELLING
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices fell again Friday as Wall Street ended a wild week
just the way it began: with waves of large-scale selling. Blue-chip
issues were hit the hardest and pulled down the Dow Jones
industrial average by 100.14 points, or 1.14 percent, to close at
8,712.87. Broader stock indexes also dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The declines partly reflected selling related to expiring stock
index and futures contracts. But traders said shares also weakened
for the same reasons that undermined stocks all week: economic
distress in Japan and the possibility of a deeper slump in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Open positions of short sales on the New York Stock Exchange,
which some traders view as a measure of bearish sentiment,
increased 2.3 percent in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   IMF WARNS RUSSIA ON AID
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has warned Russia that it does not plan to provide the
$10 billion to $15 billion in additional assistance that the
Kremlin is seeking. Russian officials say they need the extra money
to reassure investors, prevent the devaluation of the ruble and
stabilize the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ASTRA AND MERCK TO PART WAYS
</P>
<P>
   Astra, a leading Swedish pharmaceuticals company, will buy
Merck's half of their joint venture in a deal that could be worth
as much as $10 billion. Both companies stand to benefit from the
breakup of the alliance, which will take at least 10 years to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE BANKS DENY MERGER PLAN
</P>
<P>
   News reports in Japan said the government might merge two weak
banks, Long-Term Credit and Nippon Credit. The banks denied the
reports, but their shares jumped and led investors to believe such
mergers are planned as a way to strengthen the debt-troubled
Japanese financial system.
</P>
<P>
   CAMCO IN $3.1 BILLION DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Schlumberger agreed to buy a smaller rival, Camco International,
in a $3.1 billion stock swap. Camco, based in Houston, will operate
as a division of the leading oil-services company. Its stock rose
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   GM CHAIRMAN SEEKS END TO STRIKE
</P>
<P>
   John F. Smith, the chairman of General Motors, called for a
speedy resolution of the two-week strike that has shut down
virtually all of the carmaker's North American assembly plants and
has idled more than 100,000 workers. But even as Smith sought labor
peace, the impact of the strike spread further, idling two more
plants and 5,000 additional workers. Analysts said a settlement and
resumption of production is unlikely before GM's annual two-week
shutdown, starting June 29.
</P>
<P>
   FIGHT LOOMS ON BRAZIL PHONE SALE
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government plans to proceed late next month with
the breakup and sale of Telebras, the giant telephone holding
company, in an $11.7 billion sale that would constitute the largest
privatization in Latin America to date. Opposition politicians are
not so enthusiastic, however, and are threatening legal action to
block or revoke the sale.
</P>
<P>
   INSURERS SAYING NO TO VIAGRA
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente, the United States' top nonprofit
health-maintenance organization, became the latest big health
insurer to decide that it will not cover Viagra, the
impotence-treatment drug, except as an extra benefit at additional
cost. Health insurers have said that providing the recommended six
to 12 pills a month would be too expensive, adding hundreds of
millions of dollars to annual costs.
</P>
<P>
   SWISS BANKS' OFFER REJECTED
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's three biggest commercial banks offered $600
million to settle claims from Holocaust victims who have contended
that their families' assets were stolen. Jewish leaders immediately
rejected the offer as ``humiliating,'' and said negotiations had
broken down.

NYC TAXI BOARD LIKELY VIOLATED OPEN MEETINGS LAW, JUDGE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state Supreme Court judge in Manhattan said Friday
that the Taxi and Limousine Commission apparently violated the
state's open meetings law when it met in private May 28 shortly
before approving most of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's strict package of
taxi safety rules, according to lawyers for both the city and an
industry group suing to overturn the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said Judge Franklin Weissberg said he would decide
by July 2 whether to throw out the commission's votes. If he did,
the commission would have to start the approval process over again
if it wanted to pass the rules. The judge also said that at least
one of the rules _ he did not say which _ seemed improperly vague,
lawyers on both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's 17 rules have been attacked by drivers and owners
since they were proposed in April. On May 28, after seven hours of
public testimony on the rules, the commissioners disappeared for an
hour. When they reconvened, they immediately voted to approve 15 of
the rules, including measures to increase sharply the amount of
insurance taxis and car services must carry and to suspend or
revoke cabbies' licenses much more quickly for violations.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the rules were modified during the recess. Votes on
two others, one requiring cab owners to post a $100,000 insurance
bond and the other cracking down on drivers, were postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Two industry groups representing fleet owners and taxi managers
said in a lawsuit that the votes were improper because the meeting
just before the vote, and several others, were in violation of the
open meetings law.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which requires nearly all meetings of public bodies to
take place in the open to insure that agencies stay accountable to
the public, gives judges wide discretion on whether to overturn
actions that may have been influenced by improper meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The city argued in court papers filed Friday that the
commissioners did gather in private several times during breaks on
the day of the vote but that the meetings addressed legal issues.
The open meetings law makes an exception for meetings protected by
attorney-client privilege. Three commissioners appointed by the
mayor filed affidavits in support of the city's side in which they
described the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But according to both sides in the suit, Weissberg said that
nothing in those affidavits refuted an affidavit filed by another
commissioner earlier this month in support of the industry's suit.
</P>
<P>
   In that affidavit, Commissioner Alberto Torres swore that at
three different closed-door meetings in the course of the day, the
commissioners debated among themselves the merits of the rules and
discussed which rules they were ready to vote for and which should
be modified.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who was appointed by Bronx City Council members, is one
of the five members on the eight-member commission who were not
appointed by Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   According to Merril Mironer, a lawyer for an industry group in
the suit, the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents
15 fleet owners, Justice Weissberg said the meetings seemed likely
to violate the open meeting law and that the main question was
``what he should do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Mironer said, also asked what harm would be done if
the votes were set aside and the measures considered anew.
</P>
<P>
   The city's lawyer, Hillary Weisman, called Mironer's account
accurate. Weissberg left town after Friday's hearing and could not
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weisman said that the city did not know yet what it would do
if the judge overturned the vote, but she said she did not think he
should.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not concede that there was a violation of the open
meetings law,'' she said. ``But even if there was, most courts do
not invalidate activity even if they find the open meetings law was
violated.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Freeman, the executive director of the state's Committee
on Open government, which advises governments on proper conduct,
said recently that courts had ruled variously in cases like this.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I would hope that in view of the intent of the
open meetings law that if a court found that the deliberative
process occurred in private, and that a consensus was essentially
reached behind closed doors, that was merely rubber-stamped at an
open meeting, a court would find that the action was taken in
private and that it could be invalidated.''

FISHER WANTS TO TAKE BACK GUILTY PLEA IN BUTTAFUOCO SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ When Amy Fisher agreed to plead guilty to the
1992 shooting of Mary Jo Buttafuoco she said she believed she had a
promise from the Nassau County district attorney to help her win
early parole and entry into a work-release program. Now she says
the district attorney, Denis Dillon, has broken that promise and
she wants to vacate her guilty plea and proceed to a trial, even
though she has spent more than 5 1/2 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But in papers filed in State Supreme Court here Friday morning,
the sixth anniversary of the shooting, Dillon said that no such
promise was ever made by him or the chief prosecutor in the case,
Fred Klein.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing Ms. Fisher's request, Dillon said that Ms. Fisher's
lawyer at the time, Eric Naiburg, had vigorously pursued the
possibility of a plea bargain and that it was eventually agreed
that if Ms. Fisher pleaded guilty, she would be sentenced to 5 to
15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time did I ever promise or in any other way represent or
suggest to Mr. Naiburg, defendant, or anyone else, that, in return
for defendant's plea of guilty, I would recommend that she be
released on parole,'' Dillon said. ``Nor did I ever promise or
represent that this office would not oppose defendant's parole.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the case go to trial, Ms. Fisher, if convicted, could
face a sentence of 12{ to 25 years for attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher contends that Naiburg, of Hauppauge, N.Y., assured
her that such an agreement was ``guaranteed'' and ``written in
stone.'' Now 23, Ms. Fisher is in the Albion Correctional Facility
in upstate New York. She was denied parole in June 1997, after
Dillon recommended against her release.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the prospect of such a long term of imprisonment did not
appeal to me, I opted to plead guilty based solely on the
understanding that I would be released from prison after serving
the minimum portion of my sentence,'' Ms. Fisher said in a sworn
statement in late April, submitted along with her request to have
her guilty plea set aside in preparation for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Naiburg, in a statement filed with the court, said that in
return for Ms. Fisher's cooperation, Klein promised that the
district attorney's office would make a recommendation for work
release for Ms. Fisher when she became eligible after serving three
years of her sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Naiburg acknowledged that the agreement was not made part of the
plea or sentencing record. He said that it was contingent on Ms.
Fisher's continuing cooperation in the investigation of Ms.
Fisher's lover, Joey Buttafuoco, which was going on then.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher, who was 17 at the time, contended that Buttafuoco,
now 41, had been actively engaged in the planning of the assault
against his wife and that Buttafuoco had engaged in sexual
intercourse with her when she was 16 years old, making him
responsible for the crime of rape in the third degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fisher fully fulfilled her obligations,'' Naiburg said,
noting that her cooperation led to Buttafuoco's plea of guilty to
the rape charge for which he served six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Naiburg, after reading the statements filed Friday by the
district attorney's office, said, ``Unfortunately, this was a
matter that will now have to be fought out in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher has since engaged a new lawyer, Bruce Barket, of
Garden City, N.Y., who said Friday that he would soon file a
response to the statements filed Friday with Judge Donald DeRiggi.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is certain,'' Barket said. ``Amy Fisher believed she
had a deal. She was deceived and treated unfairly.''

GLOBE ACTION UNFAIR, SAYS DERSHOWITZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Outspoken defense attorney Alan Dershowitz Friday
accused The Boston Globe of employing a double standard ``based on
race, gender and ethnicity'' for asking columnist Patricia Smith to
resign after she admitted fabricating characters and quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Resurrecting an eight-year-old feud, the noted Harvard Law
School professor said the paper should also have asked for the
resignation of columnist Mike Barnicle after he allegedly
fabricated a quotation in which Dershowitz made a boorish, racist
slur.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1990 quotation in dispute was never verified or
disproven, Dershowitz said Barnicle admitted fabricating it in
private conversations with him and with mutual friends. He said
Barnicle also extended an apology _ but not an admission _ on the
David Brudnoy radio show in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, who is on vacation in Europe, said Friday that ``the
only thing I regretted on the Brudnoy show was that I had not been
able to reach Dershowitz despite trying three times.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper had begun a review of Barnicle's columns from
January 1996 to the present before Dershowitz went on television
and faxed a letter to the Globe, with copies to the major Boston
media outlets, accusing the newspaper of racism and sexism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Globe's check of a number of columns during that period
has so far turned up no fabrications, and about the Dershowitz
column, there remain only allegations and continued dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Said Barnicle Friday: ``Every time I have gone into the Globe
and sat down and written my column for the last 25 years, I have
never violated the trust my publisher has placed in me, nor have I
violated the trust, faith, and confidence I hope my readers have
placed in me. This is a sad time for the paper and for Patricia
Smith. It is particularly despicable that a pack of parasites has
been participating in a feeding frenzy over the misfortune of
others. As for Alan Dershowitz, he's simply running true to form.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Globe spokesman Richard P. Gulla stressed that
Barnicle had never admitted to or been found to have fabricated
quotes. In response to the allegation of a double standard, Gulla
said, ``The Globe believes that the past two days have vividly and
painfully demonstrated that the Globe will apply vigorous standards
to its employees, and no one will be exempt from those standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe Friday also reviewed the five columns for which Smith
won this year's American Society of Newspaper Editors Distinguished
Commentary Prize, and the additional five for which she was named a
finalist for the 1998 Pulitzer Prize. Of those 10 columns, six were
about public issues or events, two were personal reflections _ on
the death of Chicago columnist Mike Royko and a friend's brother _
and the two remaining contained people whose identities the
newspaper identified through various databases.
</P>
<P>
   The Dershowitz letter inflamed a controversy that began with the
paper's announcement Thursday that it had asked for and received
Smith's resignation after she admitted that she had invented
quotations and characters, who in two cases were the foundation for
entire columns. Smith, 42, had written a twice-weekly column since
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem for me is this: I have compassion for Ms. Smith,''
said Dershowitz, the defender of such high profile clients as O.J.
Simpson and Claus Von Bulow, in a telephone interview. ``She sees
Barnicle being criticized for fabricating and nothing happens.
Then, for her to get this termination when Barnicle didn't even get
a rebuke. ... I think Barnicle is such a popular writer _ he's on
television, too _ that he gets special treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Globe editor Matthew V. Storin said Friday, ``We
are aware of allegations of a double standard. We believe our
actions in Patricia's case were fully considered and fair. We would
respond in the same way in any other instance involving the same
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin also said, ``During the time I have been editor of the
paper, I have had no reason to doubt the authenticity of Mike
Barnicle's columns.'' Storin became editor in March 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 column, which was about Dershowitz's
publicity-seeking and entitled ``Open Mouth, Get In Paper,''
Barnicle closed with a scene in which he described the only meeting
between the two men, at Out of Town News in Harvard Square,
Cambridge. The conversation had taken place eight years previously,
and Barnicle wrote that during it, Dershowitz said, ``I love Asian
women, don't you? They're ... they're so submissive.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Globe and in subsequent columns in the Boston
Herald in 1990 and 1992, Dershowitz said the two men exchanged only
brief greetings, and there was no mention of Asian women. His son,
he said, witnessed the conversation and backed him. Barnicle said
there were two witnesses, one of whom had died in the intervening
years; he would not name the other. Sheldon Cohen, the newsstand's
owner, who introduced the two men that day, said he could not
recall the conversation or any witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, the newspaper's ombudsman wrote that he
could not determine who was telling the truth, but was skeptical of
Barnicle's ability to remember the quotation. ``The real issue is
credibility,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz Friday said Barnicle admitted twice to fabricating
the quote. In the first instance Dershowitz cited _ from his
transcript of the show _ Barnicle replied to a caller to the
Brudnoy show who asked about the quotation in the Dershowitz
column, ``I gotta tell you about Alan Dershowitz ... he's got a
legitimate beef with me. ... I apologize to Alan Dershowitz.''
According to the Dershowitz transcript, Barnicle said he had
written an upcoming column about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WBZ-radio discards tapes after five years, Brudnoy said. But
Brudnoy _ and Dershowitz himself _ conceded Friday that Barnicle's
olive branch did not include an admission of fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz said the second admission from Barnicle came in a
phone call from the columnist, and in a message the columnist asked
mutual friends, Richard and Doris Kearns Goodwin, to relay to
Dershowitz. The Goodwins, close friends of Barnicle, strongly
denied that Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason we would have been involved,'' Kearns
Goodwin said Friday. ``Absolutely not. I'm sure we never talked to
Dershowitz about this. We cannot be part of this corroboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz said Barnicle told him he had ``gotten carried
away,'' because the lawyer attacked then-Senate President William
Bulger, a frequent Dershowitz target.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz Friday issued a challenge to the newspaper and to
Barnicle to publish the column Barnicle mentioned on the Brudnoy
show, which never appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him produce that column so the public can see his
statement in 1992 and what it is now. If he is saying he didn't
make up the quote, then he's repeating that I said that racist
remark. If he dares to repeat the fact that I said that, there'll
be an opportunity for me to cross examine him, and I would love to
cross-examine him.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been other allegations about Barnicle fabrications
over the years, none substantiated. In 1973, a Blue Hill Avenue gas
station owner denied having made a a racial slur, and sued
Barnicle. The case was finally settled in 1982, with the judge
saying portions of the disputed quotations appeared in Barnicle's
notebook, but that he could not verify the entire statement. He
ordered damages of $25,000, plus about $15,000 in interest dating
back to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Magazine story in 1991 about Barnicle _ and a
subsequent short-lived running feature entitled ``Barnicle Watch''
_ raised questions of his veracity, but never established that he
had fabricated any sources or quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Based on questions about both Smith and Barnicle, the newspaper
in January 1996 began requiring its three metro columnists _ who
have some of the most prominent platforms in the paper _ to supply
editors identifying details for anyone quoted in their columns.
</P>
<P>
   Over time the system lapsed into occasional inquiries, the
editors acknowledged. Yet in recent months, when there were
concerns that quotations in Smith's columns were, as her editor
said, ``too perfect,'' the paper began checking her columns again.
</P>
<P>
   Managing Editor Gregory L. Moore, who edited Smith's columns
beginning in early 1996, confronted her with six names and asked
her to verify them. Over the course of a two-hour conversation
Wednesday, she admitted that four of the people did not exist. The
fabrications ranged from a one-paragraph character and quotation in
an otherwise factual column about alleged kidnapper Stephen Fagan,
to entire columns about fictitious people.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's statement Friday said it would review all Smith
and Barnicle columns dating back to January 1996, when the new
editing procedure was formally established by editor Storin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that review is completed, it will be shared with Globe
readers,'' Gulla said.

CAMPBELL IN LINE FOR A TOP NHL JOB
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four months after being dismissed as coach of the Rangers, Colin
Campbell is a top candidate for one of the most difficult jobs in
the National Hockey League _ senior vice president and director of
hockey operations.
</P>
<P>
   The post has been held for the last five seasons by Brian Burke,
who has said he is ready for a new challenge, possibly as an NHL
general manager. The most public and controversial duty of Burke's
job is ruling on suspensions and fines of players who foul each
other during games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in hockey for 25 years,'' said Campbell, who
confirmed Friday that he had been interviewing with Commissioner
Gary Bettman. ``I've been in a lot of aspects of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   No announcement for a new appointment has been scheduled,
according to Frank Brown, a league spokesman. The decision is
Bettman's alone and would not need to be ratified by the Board of
Governors, which meets next Thursday in Toronto to vote on rules
changes and other league matters.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also could be considered as a coaching candidate by
several teams. Anaheim, Chicago and Florida are without coaches.
There is speculation in Toronto and Vancouver that Mike Murphy of
the Maple Leafs and Mike Keenan of the Canucks also could be
replaced. Burke, a former assistant general manager with the
Canucks, is said to be a candidate for the vacant general manager's
job in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The candidacy of Campbell, who is well connected at many levels
of the sport, has much to offer for an expanding business that has
suffered some growing pains over the past year. Campbell is a
native of southern Ontario, in Canada, a nation in which some say
they feel increasingly estranged during the Bettman era, which
began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A Campbell appointment could send a signal and rebuild a bridge
to a constituency that supplies more than 60 percent of the players
as well as most of the coaches, general managers and referees.
Politically astute, Campbell networks well with many people on many
levels, particularly those with whom he shares a common culture. In
player relations, his difficulties tended to be with some, not all,
Europeans and French Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Around news media and team personnel behind the scenes, Campbell
is approachable and glib, an important quality in a job that
demands constant explanations of suspensions, rules changes,
scheduling and building operations. Around the Rangers, Campbell
consistently displayed a willingness to work long hours, to answer
even the most difficult questions with candor and to confront
problems in a straightforward manner.
</P>
<P>
   He occasionally showed flashes of temper in verbal
confrontations with other coaches and opposing players and would
call up reporters to complain when he did not like what was written
about himself or his team. An NHL defenseman for 11 seasons,
Campbell was never a star player. But he learned survival skills
and frequently expresses gratitude and appreciation for what is
positive about the hockey life.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers General Manager Neil Smith, Campbell's boss in New York,
said ``I've talked with him a lot'' about his possibilities in an
executive role, and about ``where I thought he'd be successful and
where he'd have difficulty.'' &QL;

A GOOD CATCHER BLOCKS OUT THE BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Jorge Posada lamented his three at-bats without a
hit to a teammate Thursday night, after the Yankees' 5-2 victory
over the Cleveland Indians. Joe Girardi, the team's other catcher,
assured Posada that, in fact, he was essentially responsible for
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Posada repeatedly and expertly knocked down breaking balls and
changeups that bounced in the dirt, several times with a runner at
third base, and had 12 blocks in all, according to Gary Tuck, who
coaches the Yankee catchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some tough ones to block,'' Tuck said. ``But he had a
great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Blocking balls in the dirt is imperative when catching Orlando
Hernandez, the starter Thursday. Hernandez throws curveballs and
changeups when he is ahead in the count, which has been often in
his three games as a Yankee. Rather than aim the pitches at the
edges of the strike zone, Hernandez intentionally bounces them, to
insure that the batter can do nothing more than flail
unsuccessfully.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, however, Hernandez must have confidence that his
catcher has the ability to block the ball, and before the catcher
calls for either a breaking ball or a changeup, he has got to
believe that he can knock down the ball. Against the Indians on
Thursday, Hernandez aimed at the dirt and Posada kept everything in
front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job,'' Hernandez said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Posada and Girardi practice blocking balls before every game in
the Yankee bullpen. Tuck will stand 20 feet in front of them and
fire balls into the ground, and Girardi and Posada try to control
the bounce, like hockey goalies trying to contain rebounds. The
goal of the catchers is to keep the ball in front of them, rather
than allowing it to bounce to either side or get by them.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi and Posada will use their shoulders like flippers in a
pinball game, twisting their torsos to redirect a bouncing pitch
back to the plate. Tuck rests an undersized glove on the plate, and
as soon as one of the catchers can make a ball roll into the mitt,
the drill is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Posada is a converted infielder who, as a catcher, used to reach
for pitches instead of moving his body to block them. But he has
improved greatly, Tuck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you want to do is get in the habit of blocking
everything,'' said Tuck, noting that the Yankee catchers try to
block balls in the dirt even when the pitcher is warming up between
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about these two guys is that they're not
satisfied where they're at,'' Tuck said. ``They're always trying to
get better with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada said: ``It's a part of the game that's taken for granted.
But it can make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter Bounces Back
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter rejoined the Yankees on Friday night after playing
one exhibition game with Class AAA Columbus. He was activated from
the 15-day disabled list and was in the starting lineup at
shortstop against the Indians, having recovered from a strained
abdominal muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter reported that turbulence bounced his commuter plane all
over the sky. ``I almost pulled a rib cage on the flight,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Sojo played well in Jeter's absence, but the return of
Jeter should help the leadoff hitter, Chuck Knoblauch, get better
pitches to hit. Knoblauch scored in only 3 of the 13 games that
Jeter missed.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees returned Shane Spencer to the minor leagues to make
room for Jeter.

POLISH SCULPTOR WORKS AT CONCILIATION
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time Pope John Paul II visited the New York
area, in October 1995, he stayed less than a week and drew 125,000
people to an open-air Mass in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the pontiff returned _ in representative form, that
is _ as a larger-than-life bronze statue, his robes flowing and his
right hand outstretched in blessing, a figure that will adorn the
grounds of a Roman Catholic shrine off Route 31 in Washington,
N.J., for the next six months. The shrine is about an hour and a
half from Manhattan by car.
</P>
<P>
   The statue is one of four large works by a Polish sculptor,
Maksymilian Biskupski, which officially go on display on July 11 at
the 100-acre pilgrimage shrine operated by the Blue Army of Our
Lady of Fatima, an organization that commemorates an apparition of
the Virgin Mary in Portugal in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week in Manhattan, Biskupski, 39, who works
in both abstract and realistic styles, said reconciliation, between
nations and religious groups, was a central theme of his work. But
he is concerned, too, with preserving the memory of people who have
suffered under dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, he presided as a memorial he created to Poles
killed under Communist rule was unveiled in Warsaw, in a ceremony
attended by Lech Walesa, Poland's president at that time. The
sculpture, titled ``To the Fallen and the Murdered in the East,''
consists of the bed of a railway car stacked mainly with rough-hewn
crosses.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, he opened a portfolio of plans for future
projects to show one intended for the memory of Jews murdered by
the Nazis, in which twin pillars of outstretched hands support a
semi-circular stone carved with a Star of David.
</P>
<P>
   Biskupski and Mary Ann Sullivan, the Blue Army's spokeswoman,
spread out photographs showing the statue of John Paul II arriving
at the shrine on a flatbed truck and being lowered to the ground by
a crane.
</P>
<P>
   The other works by Biskupski that are to be displayed at the
shrine are a statue of a crucified Christ that rises from a tree
stump and wears of a crown of nails; a medieval Polish monk, St.
John of Dukla, whose arms are open as if to embrace, and a towering
``cross of reconciliation,'' whose horizontal beam consists of
outstretched arms and whose base is covered with reaching hands.
</P>
<P>
   Those sculptures, along with the statue of the pope, will be
placed so visitors can approach closely, Ms. Sullivan said.
Biskupski ``wants people to touch them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels that when a person comes into the world, they first
know the world through touch.'' Ms. Sullivan said. ``So touching is
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   High season at the shrine began a month ago, on May 13, the
anniversary of the date in 1917 when, according to the church, Mary
appeared to three children near the Portuguese village of Fatima.
The children returned to the site of the vision each succeeding
month until Oct. 13 of that year, saying that the Virgin reappeared
to them each time. In 1930, church authorities declared that the
apparition was valid, a recognition that has since turned Fatima
into a major pilgrimage destination.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey shrine draws widely, too, attracting about 33,000
visitors annually. Most come from May 13 to Oct. 13, the
anniversary dates of the apparition, Ms. Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Biskupski, to judge by the news clippings he carried with him,
had received some attention in Germany, where he has lived since
1986, and in his native Poland. In the United States, he said, he
hopes to find sponsors for a large memorial he would like to
construct for people who died under Communist rule worldwide. He
would call it the Chapel of Reconciliation, he said, displaying
photographs of a model that included a structure surmounted by one
of his ``reconciliation crosses,'' with exterior walls adorned with
statues of bound and chained people. It would be surrounded by
concentric circles of gravestones.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his own religious beliefs, Biskupski sought to place
himself in a broad context.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Christian,'' he said, but added that he found space for
reflection in many places.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it's a Catholic church or a Protestant
church or a Russian Orthodox church, the most important thing is to
pray,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter if I'm Catholic, or
Protestant, or Jewish, or Muslim, or Buddhist. We must make a
reconciliation.''

AD CAMPAIGN FOR SOCCER ANGERS SOME FEMINISTS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Soccer is usually the great unifier, the one hallowed
passion that brings warring Italians together. When the first
matches of the World Cup began last week, even the irreconcilable
Italian Parliament agreed to hold sessions in the morning, which by
odd coincidence leaves their afternoons free to watch the matches.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the World Cup, usually the apotheosis of social
harmony, has opened a huge rift in Italian society. It is not the
customary war between the sexes, because Italian men are cloistered
all month in front of their television sets. Instead, the World Cup
has set off a bitter debate between Italian feminists and those who
call themselves post-feminists over how women should be portrayed
in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The opening salvo was a series of three spots for the World Cup
coverage on the Italian state network RAI-TV; they also appear in
newspapers and magazines. One shows frontal and profile mug shots
of an Italian woman, a parody of a ``wanted'' poster. On the side a
box lists her traits. ``Sex: female. Profession: girlfriend.
Behavior: relentless. Distinguishing characteristic: tireless.
Common expressions: Let's go out, Let's go out, Let's go out.'' At
the bottom, the warning: ``Avoid Her.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, produced by the Italian branch of the
advertising company McCann-Erickson, was an attempt at levity about
a national obsession that is perhaps the only topic Italians treat
with high seriousness. But it drew no smiles from Italian
feminists, who denounced it as perpetuating a crude stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Silvia Costa, president of the government Commission on Equal
Opportunity, fired off an angry letter to RAI directors demanding
that the network pull the ad.
</P>
<P>
   RAI declined. ``I didn't consider it for a second,'' said
Giuliana Del Bufalo, 50, the network's public affairs director.
``Frankly I was a little surprised at the reaction. There is plenty
to complain about in the way women are portrayed in Italian
advertising _ either housewives or beautiful bimbos _ but this is
not degrading to women. If anything, it's embarrassing for men.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she added, she had braced herself for complaints that
the ads mocked Italy's two sacred icons, soccer and mothers.
</P>
<P>
   One spot features a smothering Italian ``Mamma'' (her most
common expression: ``Did you eat?''). ``That's an old, tired
stereotype, but it's also true,'' Mrs. Del Bufalo said sheepishly.
``The first thing I ask my 15-year-old son when I get home is `Did
you eat?'''
</P>
<P>
   One oddity is that the ad campaign was produced by women, most
of whom said they considered themselves post-feminists and who
argue that even though Italian society is still lagging in the
battle for equal rights, women have made sufficient strides to
allow a bit of self-mockery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at all the barricades for women's rights in the '70s,''
said Anna Innamorati, director of McCann-Erickson Rome, one of the
very few women to run a company in Italy. ``But I see no reason why
we Italians cannot laugh at ourselves.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The condition of women in Italy, however, is no more a laughing
matter than it is in the United States. Despite notable
improvements over the last two decades, there are still gaps in the
fight for equality. Italian women on average earn 30 percent less
than men in the same field. Women are poorly represented in
politics, making up only 9 percent of the members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And efforts to alter the way women are portrayed in the news
media are mixed. The notorious quiz show ``Colpo Grosso,'' in which
housewives who failed to answer questions correctly stripped to
their underclothes, is no longer on the air. But female nudity is
still a mainstay of Italian journalism and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The news magazine Panorama, the equivalent of Time or Newsweek,
won points with women's groups in 1996 by declaring that it would
no longer put naked women on the cover. But last week, with a new
editor, Panorama's cover was embellished by the model Naomi
Campbell lying naked, with stones artfully covering her private
parts, to illustrate a story on summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nudity doesn't sell magazines,'' said an editor who did not
wish to be identified. Asked why, then, the magazine featured a
naked woman on the cover, he replied, ``We want to sell
magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenge, even by feminists, is Italian style. This week Noi
Donne, Italy's best-selling feminist magazine, published a survey
of 800 women that suggested that 26 percent were planning to cheat
on their boyfriends and husbands during the World Cup. The poll
sample was too small to be entirely credible, but that is not why
some Italians expressed doubts about the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Daniela Gambino, who is writing a daily column about the World
Cup for her newspaper Ultime Notizie, wondered, ``Where are they
going to find lovers, now that there is an obvious scarcity?''
</P>
<P>
   Some Italian wives say they actually welcome the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I be angry if my husband wants to watch the soccer
matches?'' asked Silvana Pennisi, 40, a corrections officer. ``The
difference from my mother's day is that our husbands no longer
forbid their wives from going out without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pennisi organized a women's night out _ pizza and a
nightclub _ timed to Italy's victorious match against Cameroon on
Wednesday night. ``As long as I can get out, he's welcome to stay
home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, many Italian women are also watching the matches.
Renato Mannheimer, a sociologist, just published his own study of
soccer and discovered that 48 percent of women consider themselves
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads are a little out of date,'' he said, referring to the
RAI spots. He pointed out that the Italian passion for soccer among
both men and women had grown sharply in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It spans both genders and all social classes,'' he said.
``Politics is over, even the debate about entering Europe is
finished. There is nothing left to care about except soccer.''

SILVER CHARM JOINS FRAY FOR GOLD CUP SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long-awaited confrontation between two heralded horses
became a reality Friday when Hollywood Park got word that Bob
Baffert was sending Silver Charm, winner of the Kentucky Derby and
the Preakness last year, to face Skip Away in the $1 million
Hollywood Gold Cup next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be there, barring anything unforeseen,'' said Bob Lewis,
a California beer distributor who owns Silver Charm. ``All plans
are to run in the Gold Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, who won the Gold Cup last year, is entered again in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who also won the Derby and the Preakness this year with
Real Quiet, said from Churchill Downs that ``the plan is to run
Silver Charm in the Gold Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert added: ``He works Tuesday. I'm confident he'll work well
and, if he does, the Gold Cup is a go.''
</P>
<P>
   The race had been billed as a showdown between Gentlemen, who
has won 9 of his last 12 starts, and Skip Away, who has won his
last six races and was voted champion older horse of 1997. But it
suddenly became a three-way battle with the addition of Silver
Charm, who won the $4 million Dubai World Cup in March and ran
second in the $750,000 Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs
last week.
</P>
<P>
   It will feature the three best older horses in the country:
Silver Charm at 4, Skip Away at 5 and Gentlemen at 6.
</P>
<P>
   A war of words broke out recently between Baffert and Sonny
Hine, the trainer of Skip Away, over which horse was ducking the
other. It had appeared very likely that their two horses would not
meet until the $1 million Pacific Classic in August, or possibly
not until the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic in November. But it
was believed that Lewis intervened to bring Silver Charm home right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, who has won 8 times and finished second 6 times in
14 starts to earn $4.8 million, will leave Louisville with Baffert
on Sunday and fly to his California base at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   The horse ran second in the Foster Handicap, and Baffert said
Friday, ``That race didn't take anything out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hine welcomed the news that his longtime rival would make the
scene next week, saying, ``I hope he's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away has won 15 of his 33 starts and earned $8.3 million,
second to Cigar's record total of $9.9 million. He has been
training at Belmont Park, where he was involved in an incident
during a morning gallop Friday when another horse, Pacificbounty,
slipped in the mud and fell in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away ducked to avoid the fallen horse and unseated his
exercise rider, Jose Sanchez, who was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But Skip Away got loose for a while and joined other horses
along the track until taken in tow by an outrider and delivered to
Hine, who said later: ``I've been all over him, and nothing seems
wrong. We're not leaving for California until Thursday, and the
only way we wouldn't go is if something came up where we couldn't
work him.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: IN SHANGHAI, FINE POINTS ARE CRUCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When New York's Lincoln Center Festival announced that it was
presenting a production of the classic Chinese opera ``The Peony
Pavilion'' as its centerpiece next month, many wondered whether so
arcane an offering could capture the attention of even a few
hundred theatergoers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the sets, props and costumes remain tied up in Shanghai,
the production is the center of an international incident involving
diplomats from at least three countries.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard for Americans to understand why. Why would the
Municipal Cultural Bureau of Shanghai, which detained the cargo at
the Shanghai airport Thursday, take such drastic action over
seemingly minor artistic issues?
</P>
<P>
   But for the bureau, nothing involving Kunqu, the most refined
and venerated of the many forms of Chinese opera, is minor, and
``The Peony Pavilion,'' written by Tang Xianzu in 1598, is
considered the Kunqu masterpiece. The bureau claims a proprietary
interest in the way Kunqu is presented, because the genre was born
in Kunshan and grew up in Suzhou, both close to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Chen Shi-Zheng, who is directing the Lincoln Center production
for the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company, has his own ideas about how
Kunqu should be presented. Chen, an American who was born and
reared in China, feels that current performance conventions have
little to do with the way Kunqu was performed in the 17th century
and just as little to do with conveying human actions and emotions.
</P>
<P>
   He is presenting the work at its full 20-hour length, perhaps
for the first time anywhere in the modern era, and he recently
staged a preview in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who came to see it criticized it for having too
much life,'' he said by telephone from Shanghai on Thursday. ``It
was too relaxed, not rigid enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the distinctions at work are subtle. In particular, it
should not be thought that the production's eroticism, which is at
the center of the dispute, bears any relationship to the explicit
eroticism Westerners know so well.
</P>
<P>
   Kunqu (pronounced kun-SHU), even more than other forms of
Chinese opera, relies on stylization of gesture. Fluidity is
everything, as typified by the ``water sleeves'' of costumes,
which, unraveled, may extend to the floor. Movement is not angular
and direct but sweeping and curved.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was magnificently illuminated recently by Ben Wang,
a Kunqu authority in New York, in a series of lectures at the China
Society, presented in conjunction with the Lincoln Center
production. Gestures and movements around the stage, Wang
explained, tend to be circular, because the Chinese believe that
the circle represents the perfect union of opposites, the yin and
the yang. Within this fluid universe, each poetic word is acted out
in elegant fashion.
</P>
<P>
   As may well be imagined, there is little room within such
conventions for anything approaching overt eroticism. In recent
rehearsals, for example, Chen was grappling with the decision as to
whether the young heroine, Du Liniang, should sit on the lap of her
male counterpart, Liu Mengmei: everyone, of course, being fully and
beautifully clothed.
</P>
<P>
   The eroticism, in fact, originates in the text. ``The Peony
Pavilion'' is a fantastical love story in which ``Beautiful Du,''
as she is called, pines to her death for want of a lover, leaving
behind a self-portrait. When Liu discovers the painting and is
smitten, Du is restored to life through the power of love. The
eroticism is refined, just as it is in works of Tang's contemporary
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The amorous scene especially in question is one of the opera's
most famous, ``The Dream Interrupted,'' in which a handsome young
scholar _ Liu, though Du doesn't know him yet _ appears to Du in a
dream, and they make love.
</P>
<P>
   In Chen's production, the lovemaking is to occur only by
suggestion and behind a screen. But unquestionably, to judge from
recent rehearsals, Chen tries to humanize the young characters,
dispensing with much of the stiffness of current convention.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, he applies touches both older and newer than
current convention. On one hand, he tries, in the manner of the
Western early-music movement, to reimagine how the work might have
been performed in the 17th century; on the other, he injects such
modernisms as break dancing in the acrobatic scenes indigenous to
Chinese opera. He also harks back to Chinese folk traditions, with,
for example, a funeral procession for Du that trails out of the
theater and culminates in a burning of effigies.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the issues in the current negotiations. In the Shanghai
preview, the comic character Sister Stone (named for her
impregnable maidenhood and played by a man) added improvisation,
which Chen has agreed to remove, as not intrinsic to the
production. But other objections go to its very heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to show only the `best' of China,'' Chen said
Thursday. The statement was an ironic echo of what Chen had said
shortly before in Shanghai, after proudly showing off the sets,
props and costumes for the production, which he had had made in
traditional modes by the most skilled craftsmen and seamstresses
available: ``I want to show the best of China.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, matters remain at a stalemate despite the
intervention of high-level diplomats from the United States and
France (where the production is scheduled to go next).
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a problem,'' an official of the central office of the
Shanghai municipal government confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If the cargo is not shipped Sunday, as Lincoln Center hopes, the
next opportunity will occur only on Thursday, and problems may
arise with the opening of the production and the festival,
scheduled for July 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful,'' Nigel Redden, the festival's director, said
Friday. ``If it's Sunday, we're in fine shape. If it's Thursday,
we're cutting it extremely tight. But we will do absolutely
everything we can not to miss the first performance, even if it
means working around the clock.''

Young Kuchar just soaking it all in
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Pardon Matt Kuchar for the good time he has been
having at the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   He's young, and apparently someone forgot to tell him the U.S.
Open is supposed to be a serious grind, not a fun break from
classes and exams. And he certainly wasn't supposed to contend for
America's national golf championship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was Kuchar after a 1-under-par 69 Friday, grinning
from ear to ear and sitting only two strokes off the second-round
lead, very much in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just having a great time,'' Kuchar said. ``I am taking it
one hole at a time, and I am at 1-under (139) and pretty close to
contention. It is exciting. It is exciting when you get that twinge
in your stomach. That is really what golf is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar, who just finished his sophomore year at Georgia Tech,
went from relative obscurity to stardom this year at the Masters,
when his quick smile and obvious enthusiasm won over even the most
hardened of golf fans. His golf game wasn't too bad, either.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar, who got into the Masters by winning the U.S. Amateur
Championship, finished as low amateur at Augusta National and
earned a return trip to the Masters by tying for 21st.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the Masters, and this is the U.S. Open. Golf's
toughest test. Golf's most demanding moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rough, it is definitely no fun,'' Kuchar said. ``And it
is a lot of a grind, much more of a grind than Augusta was. You
have to stay focused. You have to concentrate on every shot, every
hole. If you let down an inch, this course will grab you.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is fun when you are in the fairway and on the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is where Kuchar was for most of Friday. He made nice
birdie putts on Nos. 7 and 8, rolled in a 20-footer for birdie on
No. 12 and then chipped in from 10 yards on No. 15 for his fourth
birdie of the day. The blemishes on his card came on No. 9, where
he missed the fairway left, had to knock the ball back out and made
bogey, and on No. 14, where his bunker shot landed in the left
rough and he ended up with double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuchar recovered on the par-3 15th hole, despite missing the
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the heavy rough, into the grain a little bit,''
Kuchar said. ``It wasn't a very good lie. I knew I really had to
hit it pretty hard to get it to the hole. I ended up getting
through it nicely and trickling into the hole. That was a great
momentum saver.''
</P>
<P>
   That left Kuchar in remarkably good shape heading into the
weekend, although history shows he has little chance of being in
the winner's circle Sunday. The U.S. Open has been won by an
amateur only eight times, and four of those victories belong to
Bobby Jones. The last amateur to win it was John Goodman in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the U.S. Open trophy has always gone to the
professional golfers. In fact, no amateur has even threatened to
win the tournament in the last 26 years, but that doesn't mean
Kuchar is going to have any less fun trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a continuation of a dream, just like Augusta was,''
Kuchar said. ``I know I could wake up tomorrow, and it could be
over. It is quite a test of golf, and to be in the position I am in
now after two days is fantastic. But I am only halfway there. There
is still two more days of golf left. We will see what happens in
the next two days.''

POLITICS OVERSHADOWING AUCTION OF BRAZILIAN PHONE GIANT 
</HEADLINE>

 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Amid fierce election-year politics, the
Brazilian government has announced plans to go ahead late next
month with the breakup and sale of Telebras, the giant Brazilian
telephone holding company.
</P>
<P>
   The government has placed a minimum $11.7 billion price tag on
its controlling share of the 12 Telebras-affiliated companies
scheduled to be auctioned off on July 29. The sale would constitute
the largest privatization in Latin America to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real opportunity and one of the few that exist right
now,'' said John Mein, president of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians are not so enthusiastic, however, and are
threatening legal action to block or revoke the sale.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for the auction of Telebras, the government broke
the holding company into three fixed phone systems, eight cellular
concessions and one long-distance company, and created an
independent regulatory agency, Anatel, that will monitor the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Telebras sale is expected to be followed by a second auction
of so-called mirror licenses for competing companies, thus ending
the Telebras monopoly on fixed telephone lines. In 2002, the
industry is to open to even broader competition.
</P>
<P>
   Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros, Brazil's Communications
Minister, has been gauging investor interest in New York and
Europe. So far, he told reporters traveling with him, Telefonica de
Espana and France Telecom have shown a keen interest in the sale.
Among United States companies, Sprint, MCI, BellSouth and Airtouch
are expected to submit bids.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum price the government has set for the sale is well
below the $25 billion to $35 billion that Sergio Motta, Mendonca de
Barros' predecessor, who died two months ago, had repeatedly said
the privatization would fetch. Mendonca de Barros said the price
had dropped largely because the government opted to end the
Telebras monopoly and sell licenses to create unlimited
competition. The subsequent sale of those licenses could bring in
an additional $8.7 billion by 2001, government officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the economic turbulence in Asia has made investors
somewhat more skittish about emerging markets generally.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, the whole sentiment toward Brazil and emerging
markets was much more positive than today,'' said Rodrigo Fiais, an
investment adviser at Banco Itacu here. ``We're in a much more
volatile period of investment decision making.''
</P>
<P>
   Direct investment in Brazil, however, has remained strong, Fiaas
said. Though the Brazilian stock market has dropped steeply in the
last eight months, economists predict that the country will draw an
average of $2 billion a month in direct foreign investment this
year.
</P>
<P>
   And interest in the telecommunications sector has been steadily
building. With just 10 percent of the country's 160 million people
owning telephones, Brazil is considered to be fairly bursting with
pent-up demand for phone service.
</P>

   Purificacion Carpinteyro, senior counsel and director for
international regulatory affairs at MCI, said the company was
specifically interested in Brazil's long-distance service. ``MCI is
not a short-term investor,'' she said in a telephone interview from
Washington. ``Brazil has a good future and a stable economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale is scheduled to take place three months before the
first round of presidential elections in October. And the
unexpectedly low floor price has turned the auction into a volatile
election issue.

<P>
   The American depository receipts of Telebras, which are traded
on the New York Stock Exchange, are a convenient vehicle for
investors to bet on the Brazilian economy, and their price has
fallen sharply in recent months over uncertainty about emerging
markets in general and about the Brazilian elections. Telebras
ADR's closed Friday at $107.9375, down about 36 percent from their
high of $169.25 last July.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Telefonica de Espana and a Brazilian media group
agreed to pay 1.18 billion reais, or $1.02 billion, to increase
their stake in Companhia Riograndense de Telecomunicacoes, known as
CRT, one of four Brazilian telecommunications companies that do not
belong to the state-owned Telebras system. The price was higher
than analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, the opposition candidate, Luiz Inacio ``Lula'' da
Silva of the left-of-center Workers' Party, has called for an audit
of the process by which the Telebras minimum price was set, and has
vowed to scrutinize any contracts the government awards. da Silva's
vice-presidential running mate, Lionel Brizola, has vowed to revoke
any privatization of the phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Da Silva is arguing that the sale should be put off until market
conditions improve, and he has accused the government of going
ahead with the sale ``possibly to create a slush fund for the
election campaign.'' President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, in
response, threatened to sue his rival for slander, while his
Communications Minister likened the criticism of privatization to
Nazi propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Though the remarks against privatization might ordinarily be
dismissed as mere election-year grandstanding, polls show da Silva
running in a dead heat against Cardoso, who is the first Brazilian
president ever to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and executives said the threat of legal challenges to
the privatization could deter investors and drive down bids.
``It'll scare them away,'' said Alexandre Barros, an economic
consultant based in Brasilia. ``Except for one wise contrarian
who'll clean up.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pesky low pressure will swirl over northern New England,
producing yet another day of ample clouds and patchy showers across
the interior. Near the coast, morning fog will yield to a mix of
sun and puffy clouds with isolated thundershowers.
</P>
<P>
   Warm, muggy air will cover the rest of the Northeast and Middle
Atlantic states. Pockets of fog and low clouds will give way to
hazy sunshine and growing cumulus clouds by mid-morning. Some
clouds will mature into thundershowers over the northern
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Record warmth will occur in the Southeast Saturday, as the
mercury could surpass 100 degrees east of the Appalachians. Across
Florida, it will not be quite as hot, as clouds and isolated
thundershowers develop, while brush fires produce smoky conditions
in the north. Meanwhile, a few thunderstorms will blossom from the
Deep South to the lower Mississippi valley as a disturbance lifts
the sultry air mass.
</P>
<P>
   Strong to severe thunderstorms with hail and high winds will
erupt from near the western Ohio valley to the upper Midwest. The
greatest risk for tornado-producing thunderstorms will near the
western Great Lakes, where the combination of a surge of dry air
near 10,000 feet and jet stream disturbance ignites a volatile
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, searing heat will engulf much of the southwestern
Plains and western Texas as blazing sunshine and hot winds from the
southwest prevail. In contrast, moist winds from the north will
sponsor another cool, showery day in parts of the northern Rockies.
The West Coast will be mostly tranquil.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Wettest Month
</P>
<P>
   Although less than two-thirds of the month has passed, June has
become the wettest summer month on record in Salt Lake City. A
unseasonable midweek tempest that dropped up to 2 feet of snow in
the Wasatch mountains east of the city caused over 1.5 inches of
rain in the city. The rain brought the monthly total to 3.71 inches
eclipsing the rain record for any summer month which was set in
August 1968. Excessive summer rain is very uncommon in Salt Lake
City. The surrounding mountains act as an effective barrier to
moist air masses. Average rainfall in each month from June to
September is less than an inch.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If Steven Brill had simply written an opinion column for his new
magazine, condemning the news media for their conduct in the
coverage of the Monica Lewinsky investigation, Washington might
have been able to ignore it. If all he had done was to get Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel, to admit leaking information to
reporters, the storm might have passed after a brief downpour of
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But what Brill did this week in the inaugural issue of his media
review, Brill's Content, was far more brazen and ultimately
subversive of the insular culture of the nation's big newspapers
and networks. His immensely long and detailed examination of the
first three weeks of Lewinsky coverage _ identifying anonymous
sources and calling prominent reporters ``lap dogs'' _ jackhammered
directly into the basement of the nation's media establishment,
which is unaccustomed to such visible light.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine had rather loudly announced its arrival in a
suspicious neighborhood, and the reaction was commensurate: Within
hours of its publication, reporters and editors in New York and
Washington were demanding retractions, accusing Brill of dishonesty
and questioning his motives.
</P>
<P>
   The clamor called to mind Murray Kempton's line that reporters
are not thin-skinned; they have no skins. Michael Isikoff of
Newsweek called the article ``utterly garbage.'' The Wall Street
Journal, in an editorial, called it ``rank sensationalism.''
Michael Kelly, a syndicated columnist and senior editor of The
National Journal, said the basic theme of the article was
``flat-out wrong.'' Brill, summoned to talk shows and telephone
interviews to explain himself, found his subjects giving him a
publicity bonanza beyond his wildest business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Many journalists said that any attempt to look into their
sources and dissect a humanly flawed process made them profoundly
uncomfortable; others said Brill's research was simply shoddy. In
interviews this week, many of the same reporters who complained of
being misquoted in the article said their problems with it went
beyond inaccuracy _ they were troubled by its very nature, its
assumption that sources were a legitimate area of inquiry, its
undermining of the way journalists do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing good about that piece _ it was not in any
way a service,'' said Susan Schmidt, a Washington Post reporter who
has been covering the Lewinsky story and has unsuccessfully sought
a correction from Brill about a quotation she says she never
uttered. ``It's misleading, it's a gross distortion. This is very
bad journalism, and nobody should be subjected to this sort of
thing.'' Ms. Schmidt was accused in the article of doing
``stenography'' for Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Judd, an ABC News reporter who was skewered by Brill for
what he said were flimsily sourced reports that President Clinton
and Ms. Lewinsky had been caught together, said that while Brill
had a right to ask who her sources were, she was appalled that he
would do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it extraordinarily peculiar and inappropriate for one
journalist to be asking another who their sources are,'' she said.
``It's off limits; we don't do it. And then when I wouldn't say, he
speculated in print about who my sources were.''
</P>
<P>
   None of those in the proud profession conceded that any of their
habits might change as a result of the magazine's sudden presence
over their shoulder. Brill, the founder of The American Lawyer
magazine and the Court TV cable channel, said he never expected
they would. But he admitted to being amazed by the ferocity of the
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start this magazine counting on the press to be the
way to get readers to want to read us,'' he said. ``The onslaught
from everybody was surprising even to me.'' He recalled a similarly
stormy reaction from the legal community to the birth of The
American Lawyer in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reaction was clearly due to the towering pile of
journalistic errors Brill cataloged in his 25,000 words and 29
pages. Many of the incidents and mistakes had been recounted
before, but their presentation in one place seemed overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlines of the media screwups on this story were pretty
well known,'' said Howard Kurtz, the media reporter for The
Washington Post, who was quoted in the article, has written about
the article and also wrote a freelance piece for the magazine's
first issue. ``But Brill has added some important new details and
gotten acknowledgments from the likes of Tom Brokaw that
journalists had their foot on the gas pedal, and at times seemed to
be careening out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   A more typical reaction was that of Evan Thomas, an assistant
managing editor of Newsweek, who said that while the idea for the
article was a good one, the article itself was flawed. ``Nowhere in
the story does it indicate the care and deliberateness of our
approach to the story, which is a really important thing for us,''
he said. ``But it's probably pointless to whine about it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few things that most reporters regard as sacred is
the protection of their sources, whom they rely on in order to get
closer to the truth behind the official version of events.
Reporters know this relationship is subject to manipulation. But
many said they were surprised to see Brill try to puzzle out the
sources for various stories about the Lewinsky investigation, and
expressed concern that his article could make it harder for them to
get sources to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Brill, who said he believes the press has relied too heavily on
leaks handed out by Starr's office, is cheerfully unconcerned with
the effect of his inquiries into sourcing, which he likened to a
Pentagon reporter's sometimes justified attempts to learn military
secrets. If the process shows reporters to be sloppy, to be easily
misled, to curry favor in exchange for leaks, then so be it, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame anyone for not telling me their sources, but
they shouldn't blame me for asking,'' he said. ``Reporters are in
the business every day of asking people to tell them things that
they may have promised to keep secret. That's what I'm doing when
I'm asking a reporter who a source is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brill said that in at least one case the reaction to his article
has been unprofessional, and in doing so he perhaps unintentionally
demonstrated that there is plenty of thin skin to go around. He was
extremely angry Friday that The Washington Post said he had
retracted part of his article dealing with The Wall Street
Journal's role in the Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   The Post ran a short item about the first substantive correction
Brill has issued of his article. On Thursday, he said in a
statement that he was wrong in describing a sequence of events by
which The Journal had erroneously reported that a White House
steward had testified to seeing the president alone with Ms.
Lewinsky near the Oval Office. (Brill had written that The Journal
had published the article on its Internet site before being told
that the White House wanted a half-hour to prepare a comment.
Friday he conceded that the paper had known, but chose not to wait
the half-hour.)
</P>
<P>
   Brill said he hadn't ``retracted'' a section of his article; he
had simply admitted to having erred on a minor point that amounted
to one phrase in a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seeing that story today, I really think that some
parties, including The Washington Post, are showing their thin skin
in a very unprofessional way,'' he said, adding that he thought The
Post was retaliating against him out of anger at being criticized
in his magazine. ``When I started the magazine, I said the only
people more sensitive to criticism than lawyers are journalists;
the only difference is they have a way to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if The Post had published the item to get back at Brill,
Robert Kaiser, the newspaper's managing editor, responded, rather
wearily, ``No.''

AIDS GROUPS STUNNED BY NEW YORK'S PASSAGE OF PARTNER NOTIFICATION
MEASURE 
 
</HEADLINE>
 (ja) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Advocates for HIV-positive people in New York Friday
heard with disbelief the news that the state Legislature had passed
a bill requiring that the names of infected people be reported to
the state and mandating that government workers contact the sexual
partners of those people.
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly's approval of the HIV tracking measure, in
the waning hours of the session, could help change the nation's
system of monitoring the epidemic. As the state with the nation's
highest rate of AIDS cases, New York could be influential in
prompting other states to adopt such reporting.
</P>
<P>
   But many advocates for people with HIV, and even some supporters
of reporting the names of those people, called the requirement that
state health workers notify partners intrusive and coercive. These
advocates said the new mandate would only reinforce some people's
reluctance to be tested for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the worst piece of legislation on AIDS ever to pass the
state Legislature,'' said Jeffrey Reynolds, the director of policy
and public relations at the Long Island Association for AIDS Care.
``We have enacted a law that will drive people from testing because
of the fear of being identified in their community and the fear of
having the Health Department at your front door.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, sponsored in the Assembly by a Queens Democrat,
Nettie Mayersohn, was approved on the last day of the session to
the surprise of advocates who had believed that the bill had no
chance of passage in this session. For years, AIDS advocacy groups
had resisted such a measure, and members of the state AIDS Advisory
Council, which advises the Legislature and the governor, were
unable to agree on how to put such a reporting program into effect.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, had kept
notification bills from coming to a vote for years. But on Thursday
night, he relented in the face of pressure from other Democrats to
allow the measure to be considered, and the legislation was
approved 112 to 34. The Senate had earlier approved the bill, and
aides to Gov. George Pataki said he intended to sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, the names of people infected with the
AIDS virus would be reported to the state Health Department, which
would keep a central registry of the names of infected people.
Local health agencies would interview all people reported as
testing positive, ask them to name their sexual partners, and then
warn those partners that they had been exposed to the virus. The
legislation also appears to allow government health workers to
contact spouses and known sexual partners without the consent of
the infected person.
</P>
<P>
   The law, however, would not penalize those who refused to
divulge the names of their sexual partners. And the legislation
would preserve some sites where people could be tested anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight states, including New Jersey, already require the
reporting of the names of people with HIV, but those states account
for only a third of all AIDS cases. And many of those states do not
require the tracing of contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Planned Parenthood of New York City, Alexander
Sanger, called the legislation misguided. ``The way to stop this
epidemic is to make testing easier, more available and affordable,
not by Draconian legislation that threatens punishment and the fear
of repercussion from health authorities disclosing, without your
consent, private health information,'' Sanger said.

STEWART HANGS ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Payne Stewart birdied his first three
holes, opening a five-stroke lead in the 98th US Open, novices and
rookies and newcomers to Open golf murmured, ``It's over ...
Stewart is running away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the wind was swirling, the rough was snarly, and the Open
has long had a tradition of sticking its tentacles into golfers who
dare have red numbers like ``5'' and ``6'' and ``7'' on the
leaderboard beside their names in the second round. The sun is less
likely to sink in the evening sky than a Friday Open leader with a
sub-par score of 6 or 7 under is sure to sink in the Open.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was Friday that Stewart, his score by then a mere 4
under, looked over an 8-foot birdie putt on that damnable 18th
green, tapped his ball, and watched as it rolled ... and rolled ...
and rolled .... before ending ``20 or 25 feet from the hole,'' he
said. Birdie? The Open sent Stewart home with a bogey 5.
</P>
<P>
   While Stewart (71_137) may lead the Open after two rounds by one
stroke over Jeff Maggert (69) and Bob Tway (70) and two over Lee
Janzen (66) and amateur Matt Kuchar (66), he looks decidedly
unsteady. He made the turn at The Olympic Club 6 under but was
fortunate to come home 3 over as he struggled and struggled just to
save pars.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's late collapse, which included bogeys on the 17th and
18th, enabled a slew of golfers such as Jack Nicklaus, Paul
Azinger, and Fred Couples _ all at 147 _ to breathe easier as they
made the cut since they are within 10 strokes of the leader. They
might have made the cut, anyway, since the top 60 and ties play
onward, but they would have had to wait until the last golfer
finished his round as darkness fell over the Pacific to know for
sure.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart left the course muttering at that vicious 18th green,
the hardest of the day for the Open golfers to read as they
averaged 2.01 putts on it. So quick was that green that Kirk
Triplett incurred a penalty stroke when his putt approached the
pin, only to begin rolling down the hill away from it, and he
placed his putter atop the rolling ball about 4 feet from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   That green, said Stewart, ``is bordering on the ridiculous. When
you have putts roll up to the pin, stop, and begin rolling back,
that's bordering on the ridiculous. I don't think I was the only
one who talked to a USGA official about the pin placement on the
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Casey Martin _ who won a court victory allowing him
to ride a cart because a debilitating circulatory condition makes
walking difficult _ made the cut with a solid 71_145. Tiger Woods
recovered in the late afternoon from near extinction for a 72_144.
</P>
<P>
   On the sixth hole, it seemed that the Tigermania of the last 15
months was officially done as Woods circumnavigated the green,
needing four putts to get down from 25 feet. That double bogey left
Woods 8 over at the time, and it seemed his stay at the Open would
be brief, like those of Ben Crenshaw (160), Nick Faldo (149), and
Davis Love III (153).
</P>
<P>
   But Woods birdied the seventh and eighth, came home in 33, and
spared himself the ignominy of missing the cut at the Open, which a
few observers picked him to win. Meanwhile, Brad Faxon of
Barrington, R.I., who has always struggled at the Open because of
his wayward driver, was tied for eighth with a 68_141.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen briefly tied Stewart as he played in late evening and
drew even with a birdie on the 609-yard 16th. But he immediately
gave two strokes back on the par-4 17th when he found the right
rough, found the high rough on the edge of the green, put the ball
in a bunker, and did not rest until he wrote a ``6'' on his
scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kuchar, the Georgia Tech student and US Amateur champ,
provided a highlight amid the travails. ``I'm just having a great
time,'' said Kuchar, whose 20th birthday is tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the few _ the very few _ golfers who could use
such words on this day.

TURCOTTE PRAISES JOCKEY COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVE IVEY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ While touring the country this year to
commemorate the 25th anniversary of Secretariat's storied 1973
Triple Crown triumph, retired jockey Ron Turcotte is often asked by
young riders for advice.
</P>
<P>
   Turcotte, who will be 57 next month, has a stock response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell them to keep their ears and eyes open and keep
their mouths shut,'' he said last night at Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie. ``I also remind them to put everything they make away,
because you never know when a rainy day is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   For Turcotte, that rainy day came July 13, 1978. A spill at
Belmont Park left him paralyzed from the waist down.
</P>
<P>
   Turcotte was in town for the NTRA All-Star Jockey Championship.
He lauded the four-race event for putting the spotlight on the
jockeys instead of the horses. He also had another reason to praise
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   One percent of the total nationwide betting on the jockey
championship will be donated to the disabled riders fund
administered by the Jockeys Guild. The inaugural event last year
helped raise about $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dwell on what happened to me, but accidents can and do
happen. It is good to be prepared,'' Turcotte said. ``It is
comforting for the jockeys to know that someone is looking out for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Turcotte and Secretariat owner Penny Chenery were honored
Thursday during the live race card and at a banquet yesterday.
Turcotte also spent several hours signing autographs and chatting
with fans.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the distinguished jockeys attending the weekend
festivities, perhaps none made as long a journey as Turcotte.
Together with his wife, Gae, he drove 2,500 miles from his home in
the eastern Canadian province of New Brunswick, averaging about 500
miles a day in his specially equipped van.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always just preferred taking the van over flying,'' he
said. ``Gives us a chance to see new places and meet new people.''
</P>
<P>
   It also keeps Turcotte where he made so many memories _ memories
like riding to a 31-length victory in the 1973 Belmont Stakes _ in
the driver's seat.

Elarton gets chance 
he's been waiting for
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astro takes mound today in big-league debut
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
One of the last times Scott Elarton and Astros general manager
Gerry Hunsicker talked, Elarton left angry.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker left impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker had told Elarton after spring training that the
pitcher would start the season not in the big leagues but at Class
AAA New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I'm not happy about it,''' Elarton said. ``I
wasn't sure how he would take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hunsicker: ``I would have been disappointed if he hadn't
been angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton has a chance to impress the general manager again but
with more on the line. The righthander will make his major-league
debut when he starts today's 12:15 p.m. game against the Cincinnati
Reds at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton was called up Friday to start in place of Mike Hampton,
who is on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left groin.
Elarton thought he had a chance to step in and be a starter earlier
this year when three spots were up for grabs in spring training.
But Hunsicker said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty conservative when it comes to young pitchers,''
Hunsicker said. ``I told the (coaching) staff before spring
training this year, `I don't care what kind of spring training this
guy has. He needs to start this year in Triple-A.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker calls Elarton (6-7, 240 pounds) one of the top
pitching prospects the Astros have. But the GM didn't want to rush
him into anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are right or wrong answers when it comes
to deciding whether a kid is ready or not for the big leagues,''
Hunsicker said. ``It is a feel thing. But based on what he had done
in his career and experience he had _ he had just had a month to
six weeks in Triple-A at the end of last year _ I just wasn't
comfortable starting the season in the big leagues with him. It's
much like we did with Billy Wagner a couple of years ago. We
started him in the minors, he got on a roll down there, we brought
him up, and he's never gone back. Hopefully, that will be the same
thing with Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   In 14 starts at New Orleans this season, Elarton was 9-4 with a
4.01 ERA and 100 strikeouts in 92 innings. He has a fastball, a
curve and a changeup and is working on a cutter, said Astros
manager Larry Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not an extremely hard thrower for a guy that size, but he
is only 22,'' Dierker said. ``I think he is going to throw a little
harder in the coming years.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hunsicker became the Astros' general manager in 1996, he
questioned how Elarton _ the Astros' first-round draft pick in 1994
and 26th pick overall _ could be pitching with less velocity in the
minors than he did in high school at Lamar, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a No. 1 pick with a high profile and a lot of hype,''
Hunsicker said. ``Then, the guy is throwing 88-89 mph, which to me
is a little suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton now throws his fastball in the 90-91 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's thrown a little harder every year since I have been
here,'' Hunsicker said, ``and I wouldn't be surprised where he got
to a point where he was pitching 93-95.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton said his fastball slowed down because he was learning
how to pitch instead of just throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't throwing as hard my first couple of years in pro ball
as I did in high school,'' he said. ``Then suddenly, one day my
velocity jumped up, and I'm hitting around the 90s now.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has a chance to impress. But even if he does, he could
end up back in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan right now is that he'll take Hampton's spot for two
starts, and when Hampton comes back, Scott will go back,''
Hunsicker said. ``But the door is always open, and obviously,
performance is what the major leagues is all about. If he is doing
a good job, we will have to reassess things.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Casey Martin felt that making the cut at the
U.S. Open made a strong statement about his golf game.
</P>
<P>
   As the first player to compete at the Open using a golf cart,
Martin has drawn attention ever since he arrived at The Olympic
Club this week. Martin, who suffers from a rare circulatory disease
in his right leg, successfully sued the PGA Tour for the right to
use a cart earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Martin made news on the golf course, shooting an
impressive 1-over-par 71, leaving him 5-over at 145 for the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have proved something about myself, because I know I am not
playing as well as I am capable of, yet I made the cut at the U.S.
Open,'' said Martin, who is playing on the Nike Tour this year.
``That gives me confidence, knowing I am supposed to be here. If I
just keep playing well and improving, I can be out here and really
be a steady fixture.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe his first two days, Martin said, ``The crowd
support, just playing in the U.S. Open period, it's a blast.''

FOUR EXECUTIVES CONVICTED FOR EVADING FUEL TAXES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Four fuel company executives were convicted
Friday for their roles in a scheme that cheated the federal and
state governments out of more than $140 million in fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The case centered on a fuel company based in Brooklyn that
prosecutors said was owned by Russian organized crime figures, and
it revealed the growing reach of the Russian mob throughout the
metropolitan region.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law-enforcement officials praised the verdict by a jury
in U.S. District Court in Camden, N.J., and called the fraud case
the largest involving oil taxes. Federal prosecutors are committed
to ``bringing to justice those who rip off state and federal taxing
authorities,'' said Robert Cleary, the first assistant U.S.
attorney for the district of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy hinged on a tax code provision under which oil is
sold tax free as home heating oil but is taxed when sold as diesel
fuel for other uses. According to the evidence presented by the
prosecutors, the Brooklyn company, Kings Motor Oils Inc., purchased
666 million gallons of home heating oil tax free, and the oil was
later resold as diesel fuel. Customers buying the diesel fuel were
charged the heavy taxes, the prosecutors said, and the conspirators
pocketed the money instead of turning it over to the state and
federal governments.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel was passed through a series of middle companies,
creating a trail of invoices and other paperwork that falsely
indicated that the taxes had been properly paid, the prosecutors
said. Ultimately, the oil was sold to Petroplus Petroleum a
family-owned business in Deptford, N.J., which reaped huge profits
both by keeping part of the diverted tax money and reselling the
oil to customers at reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Petroplus, Daniel Enright of Mullica Hill,
N.J., was one of the four executives convicted Friday after a
nine-month trial before Judge Joseph Irenas. Enright was convicted
of 38 charges, including tax evasion, money laundering, wire fraud
and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stahl, a special assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted
the case, said that Enright and his company had received more than
$50 million in the scheme, the largest single share of the diverted
taxes. Enright, like the other suspects, was indicted in 1995 after
a long undercover investigation by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enright was one of the largest people in this bootleg fuel
business,'' Stahl said. Petroplus reduced its prices so much that
it was able to woo customers from the major oil companies and
attract buyers up and down the East Coast, Stahl said.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Kings Motor Oils, Igor Erlikh of Brooklyn and
Aaron Misulovin of East Hills, N.Y., both Russian immigrants, are
fugitives. The federal authorities are seeking them, but believe
they have fled the country. One of their partners, Demetrios
Karamanos, a Greek citizen who lived in Norwood, N.J., was
convicted Friday on tax evasion, fraud, laundering and conspiracy
charges. Investigators said Karamanos was an expert on the fuel
industry who helped mastermind the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also convicted Mary Ingram of Woodbridge, N.J., the
president of American Minority Petroleum, a wholesale oil
distributor in Woodbridge, of tax evasion, wire fraud, laundering
and conspiracy charges. Richard Pedroni of Clermont, N.J., who was
president of Pedroni Fuel Company in Vineland, N.J., was convicted
of conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The various charges carry potential maximum sentences ranging
from five to 10 years and fines of as much as $250,000 on each
count. The federal government is also seeking $2.6 million from the
executives based on the money-laundering and tax evasion charges.
</P>
<P>
   The jury acquitted John Ruocco of Jackson, N.J., who was an
employee of American Minority, and Michael Lipkin of Manhattan, who
had worked for Kings Motor Oils.

LEGISLATURE OK`S BILL TO OVERHAUL SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In its rush to adjourn for the year, the state
Legislature passed a bill that would overhaul school board
elections in New York City, replacing paper ballots with voting
machines and simplifying a system of weighted voting.
</P>
<P>
   Both steps would speed up the notoriously slow process of
tallying results in school elections. But the Legislature did not
follow a recommendation from government-reform groups to switch
school board elections from May to November to coincide with the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   While the groups said such a move would improve voter turnout
for school elections, which are nonpartisan, many Republican
legislators worried that a higher turnout would work against their
party in the partisan races because New York City has far more
registered Democrats than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old system, the Board of Elections spent weeks
counting paper ballots, keeping the results a mystery for as long
as a month after an election. To give candidates with small
constituencies a better chance to win seats, the votes were tallied
under a complicated system of proportional representation. During
the tally, as one candidate reached the minimum number of votes to
win, his surplus votes were transferred to the second-choice
candidate on the ballot, and so on down the line until nine winners
were picked.
</P>
<P>
   That system will be replaced by one in which each voter will
simply vote for four candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people didn't understand how the system worked, and that
undermined confidence in the system,'' said Assemblyman Steven
Sanders, D-Manhattan, who sponsored the legislation, which was
passed late Wednesday. ``Hopefully, this will end single-digit
turnouts.''
</P>
<P>
   As the legislative session staggered to a close Friday, the
Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-led Assembly also
adopted measures that would require trucks to be inspected for
excessive emissions and speed the creation of a riverside park on
Manhattan's West Side.
</P>
<P>
   In other last-minute action, the lawmakers set aside $87 million
to help Yonkers meet a federal court order to desegregate its
schools and agreed to set a stricter cap on property tax increases
for New York City homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   And they passed a bill aimed at funneling $100 million more
toward New York City's public hospitals to help pay for the rapidly
growing number of uninsured people. The bill lifted a cap
legislators had imposed on the city's Health and Hospitals Corp.,
which prevented it from applying for its full share of federal
Medicaid money for hospitals that treat very sick and uninsured
people. The bill could translate into $50 million more from
Washington, to be matched by $50 million already pledged by the
Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers went home Friday with no agreement on several
pieces of legislation that Gov. George Pataki had considered
crucial, including a bill that would end discretionary parole for
violent felons.
</P>
<P>
   After the Senate last month passed the bill, known as ``Jenna's
Law,'' the Assembly introduced its own version. But the Assembly
bill included provisions that Pataki opposed, like one that would
allow low-level offenders to attend drug treatment programs instead
of being sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan,
declined to drop the drug treatment provision despite intense
pressure in recent days from the parents of Jenna Grieshaber, the
women for whom the proposal was named. Ms. Grieshaber was killed in
Albany last year by a felon who was on parole, police say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly should have passed Jenna's Law,'' Pataki said at
an afternoon news conference. ``It's just tragic that there will be
literally thousands of crimes that will be committed by people who
otherwise would not have been out on the streets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Senate and the Assembly also failed to agree on legislation
that would have streamlined the state's multilayered court system.
And despite a well-financed lobbying effort, the Assembly rejected
a bill that would have allowed mutual insurance companies, which
are owned by policy-holders, to sell $40 billion in stock while
turning over a relatively small amount of money to policy-holders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, legislative leaders said they deserved credit for
wrapping up business significantly earlier than last year, when a
battle over rent control and budget negotiations kept lawmakers in
Albany until August. Silver and the Senate president, Joseph Bruno,
a Republican from Rensselaer County, both said they were proud of
the new open budget process, in which rank-and-file lawmakers
helped hammer out a budget for the first time in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had a very productive year,'' Bruno said at a news
conference. ``We got an almost-on-time budget and we did it with
the involvement of almost every legislator in an open and public
forum. That is big.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental advocates were divided over the legislation
creating Hudson River Park, which will stretch along the water from
the Battery to 59th Street. The measure designates most of the
waterfront as park land and creates an agency jointly run by the
city and the state to plan, build and operate the park. It also
requires the park to be paid for, in part, by revenue from existing
commercial development in the area, such as Chelsea Piers.
</P>
<P>
   But some environmentalists fear the legislation will not
adequately protect the park from commercial development. Gene
Russianoff, a lawyer for New York Public Interest Research Group,
said the park should be supervised not by a new public agency but
by existing state and city park agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very troubled about turning over a precious stretch of
the Hudson River to a public authority,'' Russianoff said. ``The
bill gives incentives to develop, because the premise of
legislation is that you need to raise money from commercial uses to
pay for the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the measure say Russianoff's fears are unfounded
because the legislation sets strict limits on commercial
development. The state expects to begin construction of the
Greenwich Village part of the park this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The measure creating the park and the measure requiring
emissions tests for trucks were the most significant pieces of
environmental legislation passed by the Legislature this year.
Under the new emissions law, diesel-powered trucks weighing more
than 8,500 pounds will have to pass an annual emissions test if
they are registered in New York City, on Long Island or in Rockland
or Westchester Counties.
</P>
<P>
   The trucking industry supported the New York measure, in part,
because New Jersey and Connecticut already have similar laws. The
state will increase truck registration fees by 2.6 percent to pay
for the new inspection program, which will take effect next June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most trucks will meet the standard, but we've all seen a truck
belching black smoke and wondered why that's allowed to happen,''
said Richard Kassel, a senior lawyer for the National Resources
Defense Council. ``This program identifies the gross polluters and
requires their cleanup.''

Martin starting 
to fit right in
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ It was Mark Twain who once described the game of
golf as a good walk spoiled.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson and some of the
other traditionalists, it is Casey Martin who is taking that
pleasant stroll further down the road to ruination with his
reliance on that contraption known as the golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   So you take yourself out onto the ticklish Lake Course at the
Olympic Club to get a look at the infernal devil machine, expecting
to see something that resembles the Batmobile or, at the very
least, a low-rider Chevy with twin exhaust pipes being driven by a
creature with a tail and a cackle as he cuts wide skid marks into
the manicured fairways.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there is a polite, somewhat shy 26-year-old behind the
wheel of a forest-green E-Z-Cart with beige upholstery because he
has a congenital circulatory ailment in his right leg that is
extremely painful and causes him to walk with a pronounced limp.
</P>
<P>
   Martin drives the cart down the fairways and hobbles to each
shot. When he arrives at the green, a USGA marshal takes the cart
ahead to the next tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way to go, Casey!'' comes one shout from the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep it up, Casey!'' shrieks a teen-age girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give 'em hell, kid!'' yells an old man.
</P>
<P>
   He never asked for this, to be the poster boy for every man,
woman or child with a handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here to make history,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   No, he came to make birdies, which he did three times, along
with four bogeys in Friday's second round to finish at 1 over par
on the day and stand 5-over halfway through the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first tee shot was struck here, who would have taken
the bet that among Stanford graduates Martin not only would manage
to survive the cut but would have a one-shot lead on Tiger Woods?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate, because I got some good lies in the rough on
a couple of occasions, and I didn't hit very many fairways,''
Martin said. ``But I made some putts and I saved some pars. I think
the support I got from the gallery really helped.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a smaller crowd of both fans and media that followed him
than the throng that dogged his first round Thursday, which
finished up in the gloaming and the swirling fog that is San
Francisco's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   There was always a voice to congratulate him for a good shot or
to pick up Martin when things didn't go right. His playing partners
_ Larry Fryatt and David Eger _ never appeared bothered by the
added attention, and the one extra security guard who tailed their
threesome remained in the shadows and unobtrusive.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely the way Martin always wanted to be until the
stiff collars on the PGA Tour forced him to take to court in order
to be permitted to ride his cart in professional tournaments.
Earlier in the week, USGA officials did relent on a plan to make
him use a smaller, less-mobile, one-rider electric cart.
</P>
<P>
   So Martin took to the undulating hills of the Olympic Club in
the traditional two-seater, and quite frankly it was difficult to
see the advantage he is supposed to have over his non-handicapped
competitors. See him struggle to get up out of a crouch after
lining up a putt. Watch him limp from a green to the next tee
before uncoiling another booming tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   If the staunch traditionalists had bothered to look, they would
have seen the course lined with dozens of handicapped fans in
wheelchairs and their own electric carts, pumping their fists and
shouting encouragement as he passed.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, his former college teammate, opened the door for
minorities to embrace the game. Would it be so horrible if Martin
did the same for people with handicaps? After all, it is called the
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome is the name of the disorder
that prevents Martin from walking the course and may someday claim
his right leg. It is the thing that has made him a household name
in the way that none of us should envy or dare to suggest gives him
an easier way to play this game.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was like so many of the other golfers who teed it up
here, struggling to keep the ball in the fairway, wrestling to keep
control of his emotions and his sanity when he didn't. He hit only
six fairways on the day. But he kept himself alive by using only 29
putts to get through 18 holes.
</P>
<P>
   The leader board says that Payne Stewart is at the top, but it
would be wrong to put anyone's accomplishments ahead of Martin's at
this point. He is in front of names like Woods, Nicklaus, Watson,
Faldo, Irwin and others with cachet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in a way I have proved something to myself,'' he said.
``Because I know I'm not playing as well as I am capable, and yet I
made the cut at the U.S. Open. So that gives me confidence knowing
that I'm supposed to be here. And I think if I just keep playing
well and keep improving, I can be out here and really be a steady
fixture. It is a way off. But it is definitely realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   For Casey Martin, may the ride be long.

STEWART HALFWAY, BUT PUTTS ARE CAUSING HIM GRIEF
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Payne Stewart escaped the U.S. Open Friday still
in the lead, but he did not escape the Olympic Club's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart may have nightmares Friday night about the putt he
missed for birdie on No. 18, a putt that would have put him in the
clubhouse with a three-stroke lead. It was a 7-footer that broke to
the left, but the hole sat on a downhill slope that was ready to
kidnap any putt that strayed even inches left of the target.
Stewart's putt barely missed the hole, turning about 3 inches short
of the hole and almost coming to a complete stop.
</P>
<P>
   But then his ball caught the slope, and it rolled slowly, slowly
down the hill. The crowd groaned with every agonizing turn it took,
while Stewart became angrier as he watched. Instead of a tap-in for
par, Stewart faced a 20-foot uphill putt when the ball finally
stopped rolling. He missed it, finishing with a bogey on No. 18
that followed a bogey on No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of starting the weekend at 5 under par, Stewart
stood at 3-under 137 through 36 holes after Friday's round of
1-over 71.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who had finished Thursday's round with three birdies
and started Friday's round with three more, led all day, though Lee
Janzen caught him at 3 under after birdies at the 15th and 16th
holes. But Janzen double-bogeyed No. 17 to fall back to one under,
where he finished the day after a 66. Until that misfortune, he had
seven birdies and just one bogey in his round.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Maggert, who shot a 69 Friday, and Bob Tway, who shot a 70,
were tied for second at 2-under-par 139.
</P>
<P>
   While Stewart used a masterful short game, a steady putter and
terrific recovery shots to avoid the double bogeys and triple
bogeys that plagued so many others, he was upset leaving the 18th
green. The U.S. Golf Association has achieved its wish, setting up
the Olympic Club as a severe test of golf. But Stewart felt the pin
placement at 18 was uncalled for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that pin's unfair,'' he said. ``That green's
bordering on ridiculous, where they have that pin. I wasn't really
pleased with that. I didn't expect to walk away from that green
with a five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had four good rounds of putting, but I've had two
good rounds so far. If I can have two more good rounds of putting,
maybe I'll hold that trophy again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is difficult to lead the U.S. Open from start to finish, but
Stewart is the last first-round leader to win, accomplishing it in
1991 at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   While Stewart held the lead throughout the day, there were many
other developments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Matt Kuchar, the 1997 U.S. amateur champion, was in contention
at 1 under par for the tournament after Friday's round of 69. And
three unheralded players, Chris DiMarco, Lee Porter and Mark
Carnevale, remained in contention. Porter was one under after a
round of 3-under 67, Carnevale was at even par despite a 73 Friday,
and DiMarco was 2 under after a 71.
</P>
<P>
   _ Casey Martin, the first player to compete in the U.S. Open
using a golf cart, made the cut after shooting a 71 Friday, leaving
him 5 over par for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several prominent players were in danger of missing the cut
when the round was completed later Friday night, including the 1996
U.S. Open champion, Steve Jones (149), and the three-time Masters
winner Nick Faldo (149).
</P>
<P>
   _ Some of Thursday's contenders struggled Friday, including Tom
Lehman, whose 75 dropped him to 3 over par for the tournament, and
Jose Maria Olazabal, who shot a 75 Friday, also falling to 5 over
par for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart played efficiently in a round that included four
birdies and five bogeys. His course management has been superb.
When faced with trouble, he has often manufactured an escape. He
has taken advantage of several fortunate bounces.
</P>
<P>
   And though he stumbled on the back nine, Stewart started the day
with the three consecutive birdies, giving himself margin for error
when the inevitable bogeys came. His blistering beginning was
almost as shocking as his finish on Thursday. The string of six
consecutive birdies tied the U.S. Open record, set by George Burns
(1982) and equaled by Andy Dillard (1992), both at Pebble Beach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After three holes, Stewart was at 7 under par for the
tournament, and he held a five-stroke lead. But comfort like that
does not last at the U.S. Open, especially on a course set up as
difficult as Olympic is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tougher today than it was yesterday because there's more
wind out there, there's not as much fog, so the greens are
tougher,'' Stewart said. ``Everything about it is going to get
tougher each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart still had a four-stroke lead at 6 under par when he
reached the par-4 No. 14, but he bogeyed that hole, then made
another bogey at No. 17, drawing the rest of the field even closer.
Stewart's approach shot at No. 17 landed in deep rough left of the
green, and though he hit an excellent chip shot to within eight
feet of the hole, he missed the putt for par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I can play under par on this golf course,'' Stewart
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what it's going to take? I don't know. I can answer
that question Sunday night.''

EMILY WHALEY, 87, CHARLESTON GARDENER AND WRITER
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Emily Whaley, a South Carolina woman with a green
thumb and such an eye for color that she helped show flowering
Charleston there was bloom beyond azaleas and camellias and turned
her backyard into one of the nation's most acclaimed private
gardens, died Monday at her summer home in Flat Rock, N.C. She was
87 and had become something of celebrity since the publication of a
memoir, ``Mrs. Whaley and her Charleston Garden,'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   Her family said the cause was a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   No one would mistake Mrs. Whaley's garden for, say, Longwood
Gardens, but as home gardens go, the one she maintained for more
than 50 years on a 30-foot by 100-foot plot behind her narrow 1754
white clapboard house at 58 Church St., a block from the harbor in
Charleston's historic district, has been a perennial eye-popper.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things it has been featured in books by Rosemary
Vaerey and other garden writers and has been a fixture on the
Historic Charleston Foundation's annual garden tours.
</P>
<P>
   The garden has been considered special partly because it was
laid out in 1941 by a renowned landscape architect, Loutrell
Briggs, who took full advantage of a brick carriage house, a couple
of mighty oaks and a magnolia tree on neighboring properties as
backdrops of opportunity for a design that included five distinct
gardens, or ``rooms,'' as Mrs. Whaley called them.
</P>
<P>
   But mainly it was because Mrs. Whaley filled the Briggs design
with repeated flair, adding a statue here, ripping out a bed of
plants there and forever experimenting with new plants in varied
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   That was not, to be sure, because she hadn't gotten it right the
first time, but because her tastes changed every few years.
</P>
<P>
   Until her book, billed as ``a conversation with William
Baldwin,'' a South Carolina novelist, was published by Algonquin
Books last year, Mrs. Whaley's fame had been largely local, but
well established.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first local gardeners to dare to plant for year-round
blooms in a city whose signature azaleas and camellias lose their
blossoms in the torrid Charleston summers, Mrs. Whaley helped
establish a trend of planting perennials like roses, gerbera
daisies and hydrangeas, in front of the towering azalea and
camellia shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   She was also one of the first to open her garden to the public
to raise money for charities, a practice that attracted some 3,000
paying visitors a year and led some to call her garden the most
visited private garden in the country.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Whaley, an accomplished pianist and ballroom dancer who
helped start the Cotillion, a dancing school that has become a
Charleston social fixture, and once taught chess, gardening came
more than naturally. It was, she liked to say, in her genes.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a country doctor, Mrs. Whaley was born Emily
Kershaw in Pinopolis, a village about 40 miles west of Charleston,
and spent part of her childhood at her mother's family's Belvidere
Plantation, helping her mother tend a 13-acre garden even as her
mother had helped her mother garden.
</P>
<P>
   After attending the University of Georgia she married Ben Scott
Whaley, who became a prominent Charleston lawyer, served a term in
the state legislature, was U.S. attorney for Charleston in the
Truman administration and played a crucial role in creating his
wife's garden.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife confined to bed during a difficult pregnancy in
the summer of 1941, he asked if there was some special present she
would like. She said yes, a garden designed by Loutrell Briggs.
</P>
<P>
   It took a few years for Mrs. Whaley to turn the Briggs blueprint
into an actual garden, but once she got it growing, she did not
neglect it.
</P>
<P>
   Working for several hours a day with her longtime assistant,
Junior Robinson, she was a demon for pruning, a necessity in such a
small garden with narrow brick walks.
</P>
<P>
   For all her love of flowers, Mrs. Whaley was not sentimental
about her previous plantings. Let a row of Italian cypresses grow
too tall for her tastes and whack, they would be gone.
</P>
<P>
   A woman so attuned to the subtleties of nature that she was
forever commenting on the weather and could become ecstatic over
the feel of a gentle breeze on the back of her neck, Mrs. Whaley,
if her book can be trusted, seemed comfortable speaking in
epigrams.
</P>
<P>
   A secluded garden bench, for example, was ``a place to invite
your soul for a visit.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her love of gardening, it was hardly her only love or
her only talent. She also, its seems, had a way with the stove.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Algonquin is bringing out a second Whaley
collaboration with Baldwin, a book of recipes and family stories,
``Mrs. Whaley Entertains.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whaley, whose husband died in 1987, is survived by three
daughters, Emily Whipple, Anne Le Clercq and Martha Adams, all of
Charleston, and seven grandchildren.

KUCHAR, 19, PLAYING LIKE A SEASONED PRO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Inertia blanketed the area around the 18th green
of the Olympic Club's Lake Course. The caffeine buzz that carried
the cafe latte crowd through the morning was gone. Sleepiness was
settling in.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve golfers staggered through Friday's second round of the
U.S. Open, bearing names like Clough and Morin and Mast and
boasting scores as high as +23. It was so quiet, you could hear a
pine needle drop.
</P>
<P>
   What the fans clearly needed was a sugar fix.
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Matt Kuchar's gangly form strolled into view. Out
in the fairway he was flashing a smile so dazzling, people in the
bleachers some 100 yards away couldn't stop blinking.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the fans ringing the green were sitting upright and alert,
their gazes trained on the 19-year-old Kuchar as he stood stooped
over a par putt. When it dropped to leave him at 1-under-par for
the day and the week, the crowd's roar was loud enough to wake the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open had been revived.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to be captivated by Kuchar, who just completed his
sophomore year at Georgia Tech. If he were any sweeter, he'd give
you cavities; if he were any more gracious, Miss Manners would be
out of a job. And if he were any better around the tees and greens,
well, frankly, Ernie Els would rather not even contemplate that
one.
</P>
<P>
   Els, the reigning U.S. Open champion, was paired with Kuchar the
first two rounds. On Friday, he said he told Kuchar, ``You might as
well turn pro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hitting the shots. He's doing all the right things,''
explained Els, who finds himself five shots behind Kuchar after
following an opening 75 with an even-par 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been beaten by an amateur in a long time,'' Els
said, chuckling. ``All the credit to him.''
</P>
<P>
   To Kuchar's credit, he seems impervious to fame's and fortune's
joint advances, though he does admit to having given each a subtle
once-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money looks real good,'' he said. ``But turning pro, I don't
know when that will happen. It'd be so easy to chuck school because
Georgia Tech is so hard. But I am really enjoying school. I don't
know if money can persuade me to leave or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar's record suggests he probably could foot the bill for
correspondence courses if the PGA Tour won out over college. He has
played in four Tour events this year and made the cut in three,
finishing in a tie for 21st at the Masters and in a tie for 36th at
the BellSouth Classic in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar sits tied for fourth with 36 holes to play here, but he
isn't getting ahead of himself. You won't find him invoking the
name of John Goodman, who was the last amateur to win the U.S.
Open, in 1933, at any time these next two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in the junior tournaments, I would be playing in
the last group on the last day and I'd think, `All right, what am I
going to say when I get the trophy?''' Kuchar said. ``And I never
won a single junior event.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed heartily at his own expense, then added, ``So I have
kind of learned to just take one shot at a time and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of good things happened in his first 12 holes Friday.
Kuchar opened with six straight pars (which are treasured
commodities on this course) and birdied Nos. 7 and 8 to go to
2-under par for the week.
</P>
<P>
   He bogeyed No. 9 after missing the fairway with his first shot,
but got the stroke back with a 20-foot birdie putt on the par-4
12th. It looked like his bullet train to the top of the leaderboard
was about to jump the tracks when he carded a double bogey on the
par-4 14th and missed the green with his tee shot on the par-3
15th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like the wheels were coming off,'' agreed Kuchar,
who fixed everything in one swift and silken motion, holing his
30-foot chip shot to leave an incredulous Els laughing in the
background and Kuchar's father (and caddy) Peter prancing in the
foreground.
</P>
<P>
   Reigning British Open champion Justin Leonard, the third member
of the group, was having a humorless kind of day. In his agitated
state, Peter Kuchar's exuberance clearly struck Leonard as a little
over the top. That he answered Kuchar's chip-in with a 4-putt for a
double bogey merely magnified his pique.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the round if Peter Kuchar's displays of emotion had
been a distraction, the normally gracious Leonard tersely said,
``Next question.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar looked stricken when it was suggested to him that not
everybody was charmed by his dad's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other players have time to calm down themselves and let
the crowd (noise) subside,'' Kuchar said. ``I think Dad (has) very
good golf etiquette.''
</P>
<P>
   Imbedded in the mini-controversy like a golf ball in the Lake
Course's rough was a cold, hard truth of the PGA Tour: When
mortgages and endorsement contracts and all manner of things come
into play, it's not all fun and gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   If college golf is a fraternity, professional golf is a
boardroom, replete with power plays and fragile egos and petty
jealousies. It's enough to wipe the smile right off a person's face
_ or has it escaped your notice how few golfers seem as happy to
ply their craft as Kuchar?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many things pulling at you at the same time out
here, from autograph seekers to the media,'' Kuchar acknowledged.
``You could see how a guy could become angry at something
insignificant. It's a big juggling act.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope here is that Kuchar remembers that long after his last
putt this weekend has dropped. &QL;

MARTIN ERRATIC, BUT MAKES CUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite hitting just four of 14 fairways,
disabled golfer Casey Martin scrambled to a second-round 71 and
survived the cut in his first U.S. Open appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the first player in Open history to compete while using
a cart, stands at 5-over par through 36 holes after a three-birdie,
four-bogey second round that saw him find six greens in regulation
after drives into the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I've proved to anybody else, but I've proved
something to myself,'' said Martin, a Nike Tour competitor making
his debut in a PGA Tour event. ``I know I'm not playing as well as
I'm capable, but I made the cut at the U.S. Open. That shows me I
can be out there ... and be a fixture out there.''
Brooks in, Randolph out
Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks collected a birdie and six pars
over the final seven holes of his second round to survive the cut,
at 6-over. Brooks' second-round 71 (three birdies, four bogeys)
clinched his first weekend tee time at one of golf's major
championships since 1996, when he won the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Randolph, also a Fort Worth resident, was not as fortunate.
Although his three-birdie, three-bogey effort (70) marked a
10-stroke turnaround from an opening 80, Randolph missed the cut at
10-over.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly Graham Marsh, reigning U.S. Senior Open champ, hit Ben
Crenshaw's ball by mistake on the first hole yesterday and was
assessed a two-stroke penalty. The gaffe turned a birdie into a
bogey for Marsh, who missed the cut at 12-over.
</P>
<P>
   Two reigning major champions four-putted during the second
round: British Open champ Justin Leonard at No. 15 and Masters
champ Mark O'Meara at No. 7. Tiger Woods, 1997 Masters champ, had
his second four-putt of the tournament yesterday. Woods four-putted
the sixth green after four-putting at No. 9 in the opening round.

SPORTS COLUMN: RAY MARTIN COMES HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long Island University became the final New York City
program to name a head basketball coach Friday. In the elegant
Great Hall of the former Paramount theater on the school's Brooklyn
campus, LIU introduced Ray Martin as the successor to Ray Haskins.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a former Notre Dame player and a highly regarded career
assistant, stood before 75 people and spoke of aspirations,
philosophy and gratitude. The battle for the basketball soul of New
York has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, St. John's ended a public, nationwide search when it
named the smooth and sophisticated Mike Jarvis as its coach. A
month earlier, Iona named the rugged Jeff Ruland. Seton Hall hired
the Duke-bred Tommy Amaker last season. In each instance, the new
coach vowed to go after the city's nationally renowned talent. The
43-year-old Martin repeated that theme Friday. ``There's a lot of
players in New York City,'' he said. ``They all can't go to one or
two particular schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was raised in the Queensbridge Houses complex in Long
Island City. He played summers at the Rucker tournament in Harlem
and also in the Bronx and Brooklyn. His appointment at LIU was the
culmination of an arduous 18-year quest to secure a head coaching
job. He began at Harvard as the coach of the freshman team, then
made stops at North Carolina State, Southern Methodist, Tennessee,
Division II Shaw in North Carolina, Florida Atlantic and Miami of
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bounced around a little bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin takes over a program that is at a philosophical
crossroads. Under Haskins, LIU experienced quick success. It won
the Northeast Conference regular-season championship the last two
seasons; both times it advanced to the postseason. Haskins abruptly
resigned two months ago amid conflicts arising _ on the surface _
from the university's refusal to offer him a long-term contract.
The school gives one-year contracts to its employees and refused to
make an exception for the basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   There are subtle indications that LIU was not entirely
comfortable with its rapid basketball success as well as Haskins'
style, his Brooklyn-based following and his ambitions to take the
Blackbirds to an even higher level.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Parker, a skillful player who was given a second chance
by Haskins and LIU when so many other colleges turned their backs
on him in the aftermath of an assault charge, said Friday that he
would miss his former coach. ``Personally, I wish we still had him,
but I guess he had to move on,'' Parker said of Haskins. ``I just
hope that Ray Martin will come in, replace him and continue where
he left off.''
</P>
<P>
   The school's vision is still clouded with the residue of good
times from the last two seasons. John Suarez, the first-year
athletic director, wants to win but is realistic. LIU lost two
potential NBA players in Charles Jones and Mike Campbell. They also
lost Haskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough job,'' Suarez said, referring to
Martin. ``He took over for a guy who rebuilt this program:
back-to-back 21-win seasons, two postseason appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Suarez wants to nurture local rivalries but also understands the
need to hit the road for revenue and national exposure. ``I want to
go out and I want to travel and I want these kids to experience
other parts of the country,'' he said, ``and obviously there is
some guaranteed money out there for us. So we have to play some
games to bring some money to the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Next season, LIU will play at Florida, at Georgia and at South
Florida. Gale Stevens Haynes, the school's provost, said this
Blackbird road show began to trouble her as LIU went from the
doldrums to a program with national aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I say I had trouble this year, it is that we traveled
thousands and thousands of miles,'' she said. ``There were times
when I thought our kids should have been home with us in their
rooms studying and preparing for tests and instead they were on yet
another road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality for LIU is that St. John's and Seton Hall are the
only schools in this area with the infrastructure to sustain a race
for the national championship. That leaves LIU, Iona and Fordham to
compete at their respective levels and occasionally come together
with the other schools to battle for local bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, after 18 years as an assistant, is content to have the
opportunity to play the Paramount. He is older than Amaker and
Ruland, younger than Jarvis, but with considerably more mileage as
an assistant. With four children, ages 6 to 16, Martin is ready to
do battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is that I'm back home,'' he said. ``I'm home.''

DECISION TIME COMING FOR MARTINEZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Ramon Martinez avoided surgery last year when he
suffered a partially torn right rotator cuff in his right shoulder
and returned to pitch again. This time might not be so simple.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is expected to decide within the next 36 hours to have
surgery to repair another tear in the rotator cuff plus cartilage
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a difficult decision and I have to give it a lot of
thought,'' Martinez said. ``They say the recovery time from surgery
is six to seven months. That is why I am giving myself some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers executive vice president Fred Claire, who told Martinez
to get as many opinions as necessary, has hinted that he thinks
surgery is the best option. There is a good chance Martinez would
not pitch again this season even without the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've done is lay out the information and give him the time
to think about it,'' Claire said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a financial decision to consider as well. Martinez is
in the last year of his contract, but the club holds an option for
1999 at $5.6 million. If the Dodgers decline to pick up the option,
there is a $600,000 buyout. The Dodgers could then re-sign him for
a lower figure.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers physical therapist Pat Screnar said no timetable for
recovery can be determined until surgeons go into the shoulder.
Martinez has the same cartilage tear that has forced outfielder
Todd Hollandsworth to miss the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also could opt for the same rehabilitation program that
last year put him back on the mound in two months. He returned and
went 2-0 with a 1.64 ERA in August, but faltered in September,
going 2-2 with a 5.14 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he was 7-3 with a 2.83 ERA in 15 starts before
breaking down last Sunday. He was placed on the 15-day disabled
list. Triple-A catcher Paul LoDuca joined the team to take
Martinez's spot on the roster and back up Tom Prince while starter
Charles Johnson spends time in Florida to attend his grandmother's
funeral. Johnson will be back Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca arrives: The Dodgers needed a catcher for a couple of
days, but LoDuca will stick around for a while after Johnson
returns. LoDuca impressed Dodgers management during spring training
and continued to hit well at Albuquerque (.306, 4 HR, 25 RBI).
</P>
<P>
   The Dukes were in Calgary when LoDuca received the call. He
called his family in Arizona and the response was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father couldn't stop crying,'' he said. ``My brother were
really pumped. Getting to the big leagues is everybody's dream. I
don't care how long you are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: OF/1B Matt Luke, picked up by the Cleveland Indians
two weeks ago after being designated for assignment by the Dodgers,
will return to the Dodgers today.

<P>
   The Indians released Luke on Friday after he went 0 for 2 as a
pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers liked Luke but didn't see him getting playing time
after Jim Eisenreich was acquired May 15 from the Florida Marlins.
Luke batted .286 with seven doubles, three homers and 11 RBI before
being designated....
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers agreed to terms Friday with outfielder Bubba Crosby,
the club's first selection and 23rd overall pick in the June
free-agent draft. Crosby, who attended Rice University in Houston,
will report today to the Dodgers' Single-A affiliate in San
Bernardino.

<P>
   Commissioners list &QL; 
a mix for the ages
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
GEE, we thought we were being cute when we referred to Bud Selig as
baseball's Interim Commissioner for Life. Now, it turns out that we
may have been prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   It is a near certainty now that his fellow owners will elect
Selig within the next few weeks as their permanent boss and
servant, almost six years after he accepted the job on a part-time
basis. The idea, at the time, was to move with caution in filling
the emptiness left by the firing of Fay Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   So more than three-quarters of a century after the job was
created, the lords of the game are on the brink of defining what
they want in a fearless leader. In a nutshell, they want someone
like them. On the surface, it is a give-up decision. It tells us
the owners want calm. They've had excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone noticed what a hellish losing streak baseball has
endured in matters related to this office? The problems began about
the time they buried Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Had to, you
know. He was dead.
</P>
<P>
   The owners replaced him in 1945 with a commissioner named Happy,
and then embarked on a lifelong search for Dopey, Sleepy, Grumpy,
Sneezy, Bashful and Arsenio.
</P>
<P>
   No disrespect is intended, you can be sure. We are simply trying
to point out the diverse range of intellects chosen to fill this
sacred position. The list of eight includes a jurist, a politician,
a former sportswriter, a retired general, an entrepreneur, two
lawyers and a scholar. Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, will
be the first to start out as a company man.
</P>
<P>
   Law-and-order leadoff man
</P>
<P>
   Landis, the game's original czar, was brought in to clean up the
stench left by the Black Sox scandal in 1919. A gambler named
Arnold Rothstein wished to make a wager on the World Series, and to
protect his investment he took out an insurance policy by
purchasing the services of several members of the Chicago White
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   So in a moment of desperation, baseball hired Landis to restore
law and order. He did it with unyielding discipline and the help of
a fellow named Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Chandler, a former governor of Kentucky, accepted the job
under the impression that he had the power to actually make
decisions. As soon as he made a teeny-weeny one _ he approved the
breaking of the color line _ the owners sent him back to his old
Kentucky home.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Frick had moved into management after a career as a
sportswriter, raising the office to intellectual heights never to
be seen again. Frick survived in the job by discovering a magic
phrase. When any problem arose, he announced that it was ``a league
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement, the owners turned to the military, hoping
to be prepared in case war broke out. Gen. William D. ``Spike''
Eckert was quickly dubbed ``The Unknown Soldier.'' He stood off to
one side and didn't make waves, unless you count the time he shook
hands with Roger Maris and congratulated him on winning 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   And Bud would make nine
</P>
<P>
   Next up was Bowie Kuhn, who had been the National League lawyer
during a period of labor unrest. His other qualification was his
youthful stint as a batboy for the Washington Senators. Those were
fun years in the Cuckoo's Nest. Oakland owner Charles O. Finley had
to issue a public apology after he called the commissioner ``a
village idiot.'' Humbly, Finley declared, ``I apologize to all the
villages of America. He's the nation's idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years, the owners pried Kuhn's cold fingers from the
legs of his desk and moved in the dynamic Peter Ueberroth, the man
who had organized the 1984 Olympics and turned a profit. Gads, the
owners were dazzled by that credential.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism didn't faze Ubie. ``I've been vilified in 20
languages,'' he said, adding that he understood the mixed reaction
of the media. ``They've just gotten to where they can spell
Yastrzemski,'' he said, ``and now I come along.'' Peter was, in
fact, a fine choice, an activist, but he was too smart for the job.
He tried to put a lid on skyrocketing salaries. Instead, the owners
had to pay megamillions in antitrust damages. After five years,
they wished Ueberroth well in his next endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   His successor seemed the perfect candidate. A. Bartlett Giamatti
had been the president of Yale, a passionate baseball fan and a
poet. But Giamatti, who had a several-packs-a-day cigarette habit,
died of a heart attack one year after he was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly surprising to students of the pastime that after
experimenting with people named Happy, Ford, Spike, Bowie and Bart,
the owners would hire a guy named Fay.
</P>
<P>
   Given this history, Selig makes sense. A benign and decent man,
he knows the hardships of a small market. The owners are aware that
he balanced a difficult act as well as anyone could. Clearly, this
Bud's for them.

JETER RETURNS BUT YANKEES LOSE TO INDIANS, 7-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Derek Jeter rejoined the Yankees' lineup Friday,
after 15 days on the disabled list with a strained abdominal
muscle, and in the fine tradition of baseball, he received nothing
but grief from his teammates, who jeered and teased him. Underneath
the verbal jabbing, they were thrilled to have him back, of course.
</P>
<P>
   He will probably get some more ribbing Saturday, for the Yankees
lost to Cleveland, 7-4, in Jeter's first game back, and David Cone
lost for the first time since April 4.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing erratically, Cone (9-2) allowed eight hits, three
walks, three wild pitches and five runs in five and one-third
innings, and his nine-game winning streak came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter played for Class AAA Columbus on Thursday night, hitting a
couple of doubles, running and throwing and showing once and for
all that he is ready to play once more, information that Stump
Merrill, the Clippers' manager, dutifully reported to Joe Torre,
the Yankee manager.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter awoke early Friday morning in Durham, N.C., and boarded a
commuter flight for Cleveland. By Jeter's rough count, the plane
had about 20 passengers and almost as many propellers, offering
scant resistance to turbulence as it leap-frogged a line of storms.
``I almost pulled a rib cage on the flight,'' Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of one free fall, Jeter remembered his insistence
that he play Friday. Why didn't I wait till Sunday, he thought,
sincerely wondering whether he would land safely.
</P>
<P>
   With great enthusiasm, then, Jeter strolled into the Yankees'
clubhouse about four hours before Friday night's game, carrying a
bag of equipment and a smile the size of Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   A rectangular white box had been left in front of his locker,
the inscription on the box: WELCOME BACK WIMP. Cookies inside, all
kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez, Tim Raines and others, lounging in the clubhouse
and watching television, all called greetings to him, Jeter
answering with a sheepish grin. ``It's been a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were 9-3 in his absence, but he was missed, his
production, his speed, his enthusiasm, according to Luis Sojo, the
veteran who filled in capably at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need that guy if we're going to win a championship,'' Sojo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen nothing but batting-practice fastballs, and a lot of
breaking balls in his one minor league appearance Thursday, Jeter
naturally appeared to be out of sync early in Friday night's game,
grounding into a double play in his first at-bat, grounding out
again in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had pitched exceptionally in his two starts before Friday
night, benefiting from seven days of rest before the first and six
before the second. He made the start with his usual four days of
rest; whether this contributed to his performance or not, Cone
struggled, particularly with command of his breaking pitches. When
Cone is at his best, he dominates with his slider and his
curveball, and he did not really have control of either against the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He lasted five and one-third innings, but only because of
Cleveland's inefficiency. The first six Indians to bat in the
fourth inning reached base _ and generated just one run. A
base-running mistake by Jim Thome cost them an out and with two out
and the bases loaded, Cone had a chance to get out of the inning
trailing only 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone appeared to constantly overthrow his slider, the ball
bending into the dirt in the left-handed batter's box, and
Cleveland scored its third run when Cone unleashed the second of
his three wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Thome more than atoned for his mistake, hammering two home runs,
one off Cone and the other off Graeme Lloyd, his 18th and 19th of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 3-1, the Yankees charged back to take the lead in the
fifth against Jaret Wright (6-4). Chad Curtis singled and Ricky
Ledee lined a double down the left field line, Curtis stopping at
second. Then Scott Brosius, who had homered for the Yankees' first
run, lined a single through the middle to score both runners.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius eventually scored the run that gave the Yankees' a 4-3
lead in the inning, on a fielder's choice grounder by Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone could not contain the Indians. David Bell singled to
start the bottom of the fifth, and Kenny Lofton turned on a low
slider and launched it into the right field stands. Indians 5,
Yankees 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had runners at first and second and two out in the
seventh, but could not score. Cleveland finished off the Yankees in
the bottom of that inning: David Justice reached when Chuck
Knoblauch fumbled his ground ball to second, and Thome blasted his
second home run of the game, the first runs allowed by Lloyd since
April 18. (Incredibly, it was the first time since April 28 that an
unearned run scored against a Yankee reliever).
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the Cleveland Indians are honoring the 1948
Indians, who won the World Series from the Boston Braves 50 years
ago. The former Indians outfielder Larry Doby was among the players
from that team honored on the field before Friday night's game.
Doby will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame July 26. Bob
Lemon, one of the pitchers on the Indians staff that season and
later a pennant-winning Yankee manager, will have his number 21
retired by Cleveland on Saturday ... To make room for Derek Jeter
on the 25-man roster, the Yankees sent the outfielder Shane Spencer
to Class AAA Columbus.

ACTRESS STREEP SAYS `100 BEST' NEGLECTS WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``e'' entertainment news file.) 
BY BETH BARRETT AND BARBARA DeWITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Superstar Meryl Streep has stirred a tempest in
Tinseltown by attacking balloting for the ``100 Best American
Films'' _ already a touchstone for just about everything right and
wrong with Hollywood _ as discriminatory against women.
</P>
<P>
   Streep used the ``Crystal Awards'' celebrating women's
contributions to film as her forum Friday to suggest that the
American Film Institute's selection process was, like the industry
itself, men-heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many women in the audience got to vote? Just put your head
down and raise your arm if you voted?'' she told the Who's Who of
women film luminaries who filled a banquet hall at the Century
Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single hand shot up.
</P>
<P>
   Just maybe, she continued as the audience warmed with chuckles
and whispered comments of assent, that's why only four of the top
centennial picks featured women protagonists _ and one of those,
``Snow White,'' was a cartoon, no less.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it was ``whining,'' she said, glaring over her
shoulder at Jack Nicholson seated behind her, a star who's symbolic
of a Hollywood that still lets its aging debonairs get the young
femme fatals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But somebody has to.''
</P>
<P>
   Streep, who has given the gap between Hollywood's treatment of
male and female workers much of its current high profile leading to
gains for women in many key areas of film production, brought the
1,000-person crowd to its feet with a rousing conclusion worthy of
the theater itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe next century women will get to vote!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It struck a deep vein among many gathered to celebrate Women In
Film's 25th anniversary and to honor the likes of producer Gale
Anne Hurd, Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group Vice Chairman
Lucy Fisher, Women In Film founder Tichi Wilkerson Kassel _ and
Streep herself.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing to her side, actress Gena Davis, the mistress of
ceremonies gushed, ``You are my hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Only trouble was, a chagrined American Film Institute claimed
that at least this time Streep got her lines wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Picker Firstenberg, AFI's director and CEO, said the
organization ``hand delivered'' a ballot to Streep's agent, Kevin
Huvane. Why Streep didn't get the ballot is a mystery, she said.
Huvane did not return phone calls Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While AFI agrees there should be more women at all levels of
film production, the group did not forget nor neglect them when the
1,500 ballots were sent to prominent Americans in the industry, she
said. President Clinton and Vice President Gore got ballots as
nonindustry exceptions under the reasoning that a leading export is
Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women were well represented in the community of people asked
to participate,'' Firstenberg said. ``Hundreds of women in that
room received ballots. I know because I know them.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the women directors, producers, stars and others were
reluctant to put their heads down in their salad plates for the
straw vote?
</P>
<P>
   Or as Firstenberg, who attended the awards, suggested, maybe
they understood Streep to be asking a rhetorical question intended
to underscore the seriousness of women's underrepresentation in the
industry _ and didn't (italics) really (end italics) intend for
hands to go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she used the list as a way to say women need to get
stronger roles, where the women are the protagonists, the creative
spine of the film,'' Firstenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest way to settle whether the composition of the list
included far more men, and consequently may have played a role in
the list's tilt toward male roles, would be for the AFI either to
release the entire roll or to characterize it in terms of the
number of men vs. women queried.
</P>
<P>
   But that said Firstenberg will remain strictly L.A.
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Firstenberg said Streep failed to count as many as 14 films on
the list where a female star carried the drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you could count `Tootsie,' too,'' Firstenberg said. That's
``Tootsie'' starring Dustin Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he does dress up and act as a woman, Firstenberg said.
Indeed, Hoffman plays a New York actor who can only land roles by
cross-dressing as an actress.
</P>
<P>
   OK, make that 19 films with women protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those attending the ceremony agree that women still are
overshadowed in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Lauzen, a communications professor at San Diego State
University, said her team ``counted'' credits on the 100 top films
of 1987, 1992 and 1997 and found that men outnumbered women 8-to-1
behind the scenes, even as women-produced films earned about the
same as those made by men.
</P>
<P>
   No women cinematographers worked on any of the top 100 films,
while women directed only 5 percent of the top 100 films of 1997.
Twenty-two percent of the associate producers on the top films in
1997 were female.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line, and the paradox, is that women remain
underrepresented behind the scenes, even though their films earn as
much as men's. And I find this interesting because it just doesn't
make good business sense,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Firstenberg said the 100 best American films list
did exactly what was hoped by getting people to talk about the
contest, the list and ultimately the films themselves. Streep just
punctuates that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this demonstrates is that people love movies. They love
them because they reach them. In their finest form, they're art, an
art that has a passionate hold on us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is Hollywood.

 &HT;    Millwood stumbles as Braves fall 14-1
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Good thing they removed the Olympic Stadium roof last
month. Otherwise, the Expos would've blown the Kevlar roof _ all 65
tons of it _ off the Big O Friday night and injured the crowd. All
10,364 of them.
</P>
<P>
   There was one casualty: Kevin Millwood, whose briefest
big-league outing lasted just 1 1/3 innings and became an unsightly
14-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly,'' Bobby Cox said of Atlanta's worst defeat of the
season. It was punctuated by four Montreal homers (two by Chris
Widger), seven strong innings by Expos journeyman Shawn Boskie
(just called up from Class AAA), two Atlanta errors and the most
runs the Braves have allowed since Sept. 12, 1996, a 16-8 defeat at
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   At least that could be blamed on Coors Field's thin air. This
one? Millwood's fat fastballs, just five days after he'd stifled
Montreal with a four-hit complete game. ``Nothing worked,'' said
Millwood, 9-3 after allowing seven earned runs on seven hits and
raising his ERA to 4.43. ``I'd throw a bad pitch, tried something
new, couldn't get any strikes there.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 batters Millwood faced, nine reached base. Shane
Andrews followed Widger's second-inning solo homer with one of his
own in the Expos' six-run second. ``My location was bad,'' said
Millwood. ``All the pitches I threw were bad. It was just a bad
day.''
</P>
<P>
   And seemingly no way to start tuning up for the Yankees. And yet
...
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, I'd rather get beat that way and get the bullpen
some work than lose a tough one,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much one of those games that's over early,'' Walt Weiss
said of a night in which Atlanta trailed 8-1 after two innings,
11-1 after four. ``Not that you don't go out there and play nine
innings. But when they jump on you like that... On the other hand,
those games are sometimes easier to bounce back from than a tough
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth time this year he's made consecutive starts
against the same club. The first back-to-backer was beneficial. He
beat Pittsburgh April 9 for his first win, then one-hit the Pirates
five days later. But in subsequent encores after beating Colorado,
Chicago and Montreal, he's lost all three while allowing 20 earned
runs in seven total innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to go out and change anything,'' Millwood said.
``I just want to get them out again. If they're making adjustments,
I have to make adjustments. Just seems every time I face 'em again,
the stuff isn't there. Maybe I'm trying too hard.

 &HT;    Stewart clings to lead
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Payne Stewart's lead in the U.S. Open nearly
rolled away on the 18th green Friday at the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the 10-footer for birdie that turned into a
25-footer for par _ courtesy of a sadistic USGA pin placement and
hardening greens _ did not completely self-destruct the man in the
plaid knickers.
</P>
<P>
   After Stewart's birdie try slid two inches below the hole and
then caught the slope, the ball kept rolling and rolling, finally
stopping far from its original spot. Stewart two-putted from there
for bogey to complete a 71 for a 36-hole total of 3-under-par 137.
</P>
<P>
   With players still out on the course, Stewart, 41, held a
one-shot lead over Jeff Maggert (69-69) and Bob Tway (68-70) and
two shots over Georgia Tech's amazing 19-year-old U.S. Amateur
champion, Matt Kuchar (70-69), and PGA Tour qualifying school
graduate Lee Porter (72-67) of Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually thought it (the ball) would finish about 3 or 4
feet below the hole and all of a sudden it's 20,'' said Stewart.
``I told the official walking with us that that green is unfair.
That green's bordering on ridiculous where they have that pin.''
</P>
<P>
   After birdieing the last three holes yesterday to cap a 66 and
opening with three straight birdies Friday, Stewart bogeyed three
of his last five. The slide only pushed Kuchar closer to the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just having a great time,'' said Kuchar, who will turn 20
Sunday on Father's Day, with his father, Peter, on his bag. ``It's
exciting when you get that twinge in your stomach. That's really
what golf is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin, the first player to use a golf cart in the U.S.
Open, apparently made the cut with a second-round 71, standing at
5-over 145 for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Tway made five bogeys and five birdies. His round ended with
wedge to within a foot of the hole at the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert, who finished fourth at last year's U.S. Open when his
putting game collapsed down the stretch, shot a second straight 69
to join Tway at 138. A year ago he double-bogeyed the last two
holes, using seven putts, but has kept the ordeal in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have time to reflect on everything, there's a lot
worse things that can happen to you in life than having a chance to
win the Open and blowing it. There are millions of people that have
dreamed about being in that position, and I'm not going to hold my
head down because I failed.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Open rookie Joe Durant and Mark Carnevale, who surprised
people by their first-day presence on the leaderboard, are still
hanging around after 3-over 73s. Carnevale is at even-par 140,
Durant a stroke higher, tied with Zimbabwe's Nick Price (68).
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Ernie Els rebounded with a 70 Friday to make
the cut at 145, extending his weekend through a back nine 32 that
started with an eagle at the 10th. He holed out an 8-iron of about
160 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, playing in his 42nd Open, birdied the 18th to
apparently make the cut.

 &HT;    Wilkens is second double honoree
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- One spot in the Hall of Fame isn't enough for Lenny
Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens, coach of the Atlanta Hawks, will become the Naismith
Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame's second double honoree on
Tuesday, when he is selected as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1989 for his
performance as a college and NBA player. He joins former UCLA coach
John Wooden as the only other double honoree.
</P>
<P>
   The winningest coach in NBA history, Wilkens' second selection
will be announced at a press conference at the Omni Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens has a record of 1,120-908 as coach in Seattle, Portland,
Cleveland and Atlanta. He not only coached the four franchises, he
also played for three of them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wilkens surpassed the Boston Celtics' Red Auerbach in
victories with his No. 939 on Jan. 6, 1995, he had to wait until he
had completed 25 years of coaching before becoming eligible for
election. He is 201-159 in five seasons as coach of the Hawks. His
contract has been extended four years.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens played at Providence College before signing with the St.
Louis Hawks. He averaged 20.5 points during 13 seasons with the
Hawks, Sonics and Cavaliers. He was player-coach in Seattle for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden was a three-time All-American as a guard at Purdue before
going onto an illustrious coaching career. He won nine national
championships at UCLA.

ACTRESS STREEP SAYS `100 BEST' NEGLECTS WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``a'' national news file.) 
BY BETH BARRETT AND BARBARA DeWITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Superstar Meryl Streep has stirred a tempest in
Tinseltown by attacking balloting for the ``100 Best American
Films'' _ already a touchstone for just about everything right and
wrong with Hollywood _ as discriminatory against women.
</P>
<P>
   Streep used the ``Crystal Awards'' celebrating women's
contributions to film as her forum Friday to suggest that the
American Film Institute's selection process was, like the industry
itself, men-heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many women in the audience got to vote? Just put your head
down and raise your arm if you voted?'' she told the Who's Who of
women film luminaries who filled a banquet hall at the Century
Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single hand shot up.
</P>
<P>
   Just maybe, she continued as the audience warmed with chuckles
and whispered comments of assent, that's why only four of the top
centennial picks featured women protagonists _ and one of those,
``Snow White,'' was a cartoon, no less.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it was ``whining,'' she said, glaring over her
shoulder at Jack Nicholson seated behind her, a star who's symbolic
of a Hollywood that still lets its aging debonairs get the young
femme fatals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But somebody has to.''
</P>
<P>
   Streep, who has given the gap between Hollywood's treatment of
male and female workers much of its current high profile leading to
gains for women in many key areas of film production, brought the
1,000-person crowd to its feet with a rousing conclusion worthy of
the theater itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe next century women will get to vote!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It struck a deep vein among many gathered to celebrate Women In
Film's 25th anniversary and to honor the likes of producer Gale
Anne Hurd, Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group Vice Chairman
Lucy Fisher, Women In Film founder Tichi Wilkerson Kassel _ and
Streep herself.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing to her side, actress Gena Davis, the mistress of
ceremonies gushed, ``You are my hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Only trouble was, a chagrined American Film Institute claimed
that at least this time Streep got her lines wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Picker Firstenberg, AFI's director and CEO, said the
organization ``hand delivered'' a ballot to Streep's agent, Kevin
Huvane. Why Streep didn't get the ballot is a mystery, she said.
Huvane did not return phone calls Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While AFI agrees there should be more women at all levels of
film production, the group did not forget nor neglect them when the
1,500 ballots were sent to prominent Americans in the industry, she
said. President Clinton and Vice President Gore got ballots as
nonindustry exceptions under the reasoning that a leading export is
Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women were well represented in the community of people asked
to participate,'' Firstenberg said. ``Hundreds of women in that
room received ballots. I know because I know them.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the women directors, producers, stars and others were
reluctant to put their heads down in their salad plates for the
straw vote?
</P>
<P>
   Or as Firstenberg, who attended the awards, suggested, maybe
they understood Streep to be asking a rhetorical question intended
to underscore the seriousness of women's underrepresentation in the
industry _ and didn't (italics) really (end italics) intend for
hands to go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she used the list as a way to say women need to get
stronger roles, where the women are the protagonists, the creative
spine of the film,'' Firstenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest way to settle whether the composition of the list
included far more men, and consequently may have played a role in
the list's tilt toward male roles, would be for the AFI either to
release the entire roll or to characterize it in terms of the
number of men vs. women queried.
</P>
<P>
   But that said Firstenberg will remain strictly L.A.
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Firstenberg said Streep failed to count as many as 14 films on
the list where a female star carried the drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you could count `Tootsie,' too,'' Firstenberg said. That's
``Tootsie'' starring Dustin Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he does dress up and act as a woman, Firstenberg said.
Indeed, Hoffman plays a New York actor who can only land roles by
cross-dressing as an actress.
</P>
<P>
   OK, make that 19 films with women protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those attending the ceremony agree that women still are
overshadowed in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Lauzen, a communications professor at San Diego State
University, said her team ``counted'' credits on the 100 top films
of 1987, 1992 and 1997 and found that men outnumbered women 8-to-1
behind the scenes, even as women-produced films earned about the
same as those made by men.
</P>
<P>
   No women cinematographers worked on any of the top 100 films,
while women directed only 5 percent of the top 100 films of 1997.
Twenty-two percent of the associate producers on the top films in
1997 were female.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line, and the paradox, is that women remain
underrepresented behind the scenes, even though their films earn as
much as men's. And I find this interesting because it just doesn't
make good business sense,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Firstenberg said the 100 best American films list
did exactly what was hoped by getting people to talk about the
contest, the list and ultimately the films themselves. Streep just
punctuates that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this demonstrates is that people love movies. They love
them because they reach them. In their finest form, they're art, an
art that has a passionate hold on us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is Hollywood.

 &HT;    Wohlers' search for strike zone begins
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The resurrection of Mark Wohlers begins in earnest.
The deposed closer requested an optional minor-league assignment
and will start working out today at the Braves' spring training
complex in Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   The assignment, which will last a minimum of 10 days, will begin
with Wohlers throwing several simulated games in Orlando. Because
he had more than two years of minor-league service, Wohlers can't
pitch in any Gulf Coast Rookie League games. He'll then be optioned
to Richmond and the Braves hope he'll return to the club in two to
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll dictate the timetable,'' said assistant general manager
Dean Taylor, here for a weekend series with the Expos. ``When he's
ready to move out and pitch in game situations, we anticipate him
going to Richmond. Our anticipation is that within a two to three
week period, this thing will be resolved. It's our hope that at
that point, he'd be ready to pitch in the major leagues again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers' 25-man roster spot goes to John Smoltz, who'll be
activated from the disabled list today and start tonight. Wohlers
could be called back up after 10 days if a Brave were injured. For
now, he's trying to rediscover the strike zone in a manner he
requested after Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   He's ba-a-a-a-ck ... again
</P>
<P>
   After his second stint on the DL and subsequent rehab
assignment, Smoltz will test his pitching elbow tonight. He'll be
on a 90-pitch limit in his first Braves' start since lasting two
innings against Chicago May 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may struggle. I may not,'' Smoltz said. ``My intentions are
to ... pitch a damn good ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I'm pitching is because physically, I know I can.
Now, it's a matter of getting back in a groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz (4-1) won his first four decisions but pitched in pain
his last two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Earth
</P>
<P>
   Since homering in consecutive at-bats last Saturday (each time
following a Javy Lopez two-run job), Andruw Jones has gone into a
slump. Again. After each of his five two-homer games in his career,
he has skidded badly.
</P>
<P>
   After last Saturday (his third two-homer game of the season),
Jones went 1-for-13 the rest of the homestand to lower his average
to .262. He was 0-for-15 after hitting two on April 20 and 3-for-20
after two more on May 11. After his two July 22 last year, Jones
went 1-for-22. And after his two on Aug. 22, 1996, he went
9-for-50.
</P>
<P>
   Total two-homer futility: 14-for-120, .116.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I go like that,'' said Jones, who ended that
skid Friday with a second-inning, RBI single.

 COX &HT;    On Deck: Montreal Expos
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS, 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP John Smoltz (4-1, 3.94; 10-6,
2.56 lifetime vs. Expos) vs. LHP Carlos Perez (6-5, 3.64; 2-3,
2.98).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Smoltz returns to the rotation tonight after his second
stint on the disabled list and second rehab assignment. After
arthroscopic surgery Dec. 13 to remove bone chips and calcium
deposits from his right elbow, Smoltz came along slowly and
carefully during spring training and began the year on the DL. He
was activated April 15 after an encouraging rehab assignment, and
then won his first four decisions. But after losing 8-1 in Houston
May 17, allowing 10 hits and eight earned runs in just four
innings, Smoltz's next start put him back on the DL with pain in
the elbow. In two-plus innings against the Cubs, he gave up six
hits and two runs. This time, Smoltz made two rehab starts. He went
four innings with Class AA Greenville against Knoxville on June 10,
allowing three hits, including a homer, and two earned runs. On
Sunday with Class A Macon against Capital City, Smoltz worked six
innings, allowing seven hits and four earned runs while throwing 82
pitches and fanning seven.Now he returns. He faces Perez, who
staked himself to an early 1-0 lead in Atlanta last Sunday with a
third-inning homer off Kevin Millwood. But then the Braves pounded
him for seven hits and five runs in the third and fourth innings of
a 5-1 Atlanta win. It was the second loss in a row for Perez after
a personal six-game winning streak. Still, Perez is the only Expos
starter with a winning record, has two of Montreal's three complete
games and averages 7-plus innings per outing, 108 1/3 total in 15
starts.

 &HT;    Falcons' signing adds experience at DE
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Servic
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Antonio Edwards, a five-year veteran from Moultrie,
signed a one-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons on Friday, as
the team tried to address its shortage of experienced defensive
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 6-feet-3, 271 pounds, was drafted in the eighth round
by Seattle in 1993 after playing at Valdosta State. The 28-year-old
played in 50 games for the Seahawks before being waived after one
game last season. Then he played in three games for the New York
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has played right and left end, with 24 starts in 53
games. He has 87 tackles, 14 sacks and two safeties. His best year
was in 1995 when he had 6.5 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards logged a few snaps with the first team on Friday because
starting right end Chuck Smith was not present. The team has worked
six days of a 10-day voluntary passing camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had just three veteran defensive ends under
contract: Starters Smith and Lester Archambeau and backup John
Burrough. Anthony Pleasant played in 11 games last year as a
reserve but was waived after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie free agent defensive ends on the roster include Shawn
Swayda (Arizona State), Barry Mitchell (Idaho) and Richard Freeman
(Valdosta State), but Freeman has been working at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a little depth at the end spot,'' said Edwards, who
played for coach Jim Hughes at Colquitt County High. ``It's great.
I used to come home twice a year, but now my brother (Howard, a
running back on Georgia Tech's 1990 national championship team) is
a little more than an hour away (in Macon), and my family is just
three hours away.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity basketball
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Terance Mathis is staging a celebrity basketball
game today at Morris Brown to raise money for the Terance Loves
Children Foundation (TLC). Tickets for the 4 p.m. game are $10.
Proceeds benefit TLC, which works to heighten awareness of how
drugs can ruin young lives. ... Backup quarterback Mark Rypien,
signed to a two-year deal earlier this spring, was a no-show again
as he continues to deal with personal issues. It is unclear if he
will be in Suwanee next week, when passing camp ends. Rypien
commuted for six weeks this spring from his Idaho home to begin
learning the Falcons' playbook. ... Rookie free-agent linebacker
Jody Littleton had to go home to Brighton, Colo., because his
brother was involved in a motorcycle accident. ... Coach Dan Reeves
was in a golf tournament, and assistant head coach/defensive
coordinator Rich Brooks ran the 80-minute practice. Cornerback
Randy Fuller (groin), receiver Keith Crawford (high calf strain)
and right guard Gene Williams (throat infection) missed practice.
Several players had excused absences, including Smith and receivers
Todd Kinchen and Tony Martin, cornerback Ray Buchanan. . . .
Running back Jamal Anderson took all rookies to nearby Jeffrey's
sports bar on Friday afternoon for dinner and beverages.

 &HT;    Steele picking up where he left off
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   POCONO, Pa. _ Three-time ARCA champion Tim Steele makes his
return today in the ARCA Mountain Dew 400, after injuries suffered
at Atlanta Motor Speedway in November.
</P>
<P>
   Steele qualified second-fastest, 162.655 mph, at Pocono Raceway
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great, like I haven't missed a lick,'' Steele said.
``You don't know how good it feels to be back. It's like going
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele, a five-time ARCA winner at Pocono, suffered head
injuries when he lost control and slammed into the wall between
turns one and two at AMS. He's the all-time ARCA superspeedway
winner with 17 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ciochetti starts on the pole with a track-record 163.845
mph. Bobby Hamilton Jr. makes his debut, qualifying third-fastest.
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot too slow
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Buckshot Jones made his debut at Pocono Raceway Friday
and was a bit awed. ``We tested her in early June and felt
comfortable. But I have never competed on anything like this
track,'' he said of the 2.5-mile track with its two long straights
and short chute.
</P>
<P>
   Jones qualified with a speed of 163.651 mph, but it wasn't good
enough to make the top 25. ``We have enough to make the field. We
just need to make some adjustments and get it up to speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fined
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. was fined $5,000, his crew chief Tony Eury
Sr. $2,500 and Bryant Frazier, crew chief for Tony Stewart, $1,000
after last Saturday's Busch Grand National event at Pikes Peak.
Earnhardt's fine resulted from fighting Stewart. The two crew
chiefs were cited for actions detrimental to auto racing. None of
the parties would comment, but the incidents started on the track
with a bumping duel and ended in the garage with a shoving match
between the two crew chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Robby's return
</P>
<P>
   Robby Gordon is expected to be car-owner Buz McCall's designated
driver of the week in next week's Savemart/Kragen 350 at Sears
Point. McCall released David Green two weeks ago and put Kevin
Lepage in the car for the Pontiac Excitement 400 at Richmond and
picked Hut Stricklin for Michigan and this week's Pocono 500.

 &HT;    Gordon hits wall, still wins pole
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   POCONO, Pa. _ Even when Jeff Gordon bounces off walls, things
seem to go his way. They did Friday, and he won the pole with a
speed of 168.042 mph for Sunday's Pocono 500.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's flirtation with disaster came as he entered the third
turn, drifted up the track and smacked the wall with his right-rear
quarter panel. Then without another bobble, he had his Monte Carlo
on a straight line to his fourth pole in the last six races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there and made a real hard, aggressive lap and
hoped that it would stick,'' Gordon said. ``It stuck pretty much
all the way until I came off the last turn and brushed that wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Crew chief) Ray (Evernham) is always telling me that to get
the car right, it needs to be a little loose coming off that last
turn. Well, it sure was after we got through with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace was second-fastest without the drama of Gordon's
run. Wallace put his Taurus on a rail-like lap, hitting the
checkered flag with a speed of 167.436 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with that lap, I just hope we can do something like
it Sunday,'' Wallace said. ``I know one thing, I'd rather be
starting on the inside (where Gordon is) than the outside, but we
got what we got.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield, Wallace's teammate, ran third-fastest and will
line up behind Gordon in the second row with Ken Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's surprise came from the No. 3 Monte Carlo of Dale
Earnhardt, who qualified 11th, his best non-restrictor-plate effort
of the year. His previous best was 25th, last week at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning a little different and seeing some different
things with the crew-chief switch,'' Earnhardt said. ``It's a plus
as far as everybody taking a look at everything. These cars are
going to keep getting better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip, who had to accept provisionals in three of the
last four races, qualified 18th.

 &HT;    Stewart challenges Open's jinx on its first-round leaders
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Like the old saying, ``You can't tell a book by
its cover,'' you can't judge a U.S. Open by who leads the first
round, usually. Beware that guy out of the minitours in Florida,
with the tattered old bag, ``Bullfrog Acres GC'' lettered on the
side, and the cap that says, ``Sam's Pawn Shop.'' He's the guy you
better watch out for for the first 18 holes, until he comes to his
senses. Top of the leaderboard Thursday, riding economy class out
of town Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It happens. A guy named Lee Mackey, who was out of work, shot a
64 and set the Open record at Merion in 1950. The next day, he shot
81. First-round leaders have had names like Labron Harris Jr., Pat
Fitzsimons, Bob Brue, Bob Gadja and one like a school principal,
Clarence Clark. It's not that Nicklaus and Palmer and Hogan haven't
led the first round, but first-round leaders usually disappear like
a morning fog.
</P>
<P>
   Since the American championship was started in 1896, only 12
times has the champion led or tied for the lead after the first
round. Only four times has the champion had the lead to himself
wire to wire, Walter Hagen in 1914, Jim Barnes in 1921, Ben Hogan
in 1953 and the last foreign winner, Tony Jacklin, in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some who led after four rounds that were pretty
much a shock. Andy North, not once but twice. He won only one other
tournament in his career. Lou Graham, Steve Jones and Scott Simpson
came to mind here. Lee Trevino, too, at Rochester in 1968, before
any of us suspected what a diet of tortillas and beans could do for
one's game.
</P>
<P>
   When all the scores were in and Payne Stewart's name was at top
of the board at The Olympic Club Thursday, the subject reared its
shaggy head again. Master Stewart is known more for his clubby
garments, his knee pants, his exposed stockings and his flat caps,
than for his game. It is easily forgotten that he has won two
majors, a PGA Championship and the U.S. Open of 1991, with which we
deal here.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last Open in which the champion led from the first
round to the last, after which he still had to win a playoff from
Scott Simpson. That was at Hazeltine, the course outside
Minneapolis, where in 1970 Jacklin had been the last winner to go
the distance on the lead. Also where lightning had struck and
killed a spectator Stewart's year, setting off a wave of
weather-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a more mature player than I was in 1991,'' Stewart said,
when somebody asked him. ``I feel I'm a more complete player, you
know, older and wiser.''
</P>
<P>
   The way he had finished Thursday would indicate his luck has
improved as well, a wedge to the pin on the 609-yard 16th, a
45-foot putt on the 17th and a downhill sidewise putt that dropped
on the treacherous 18th green, all for birdies, would seem to bear
that out. Those are the three toughest birdies at Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   Back out in plaid knickers, white hose that look like the
sanitary stockings baseball players wear, and a flaming red cap
Friday, he backed those up, ran his streak of birdies to six
through the first three holes. This was no fly-by-night first-round
leader. He was as serious about winning a matching bookend Open as
he is about his self-imposed wardrobe. He would bogey the 6th, get
the stroke back on the 7th and rock along until he came to the
16th, where his streak began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers on the leaderboard were shrinking and the gap between
him and his pursuers was widening. He flirted with trouble on the
15th, but saved par with a twisting 7-foot putt. He now was three
strokes up on Jeff Maggert and Bob Tway, and the one-round leader
was now about to stretch it to two.
</P>
<P>
   He was way ahead of his score at Olympic 11 years ago. He wasn't
coasting along, but he was having his way with it. The ``more
mature, older, wiser'' Stewart was beginning to show through. But,
in the words of that youthful philosopher, Matt Kuchar, ``This is
only the first two days.''

 &HT;    Martin's confidence bolstered by 71
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco -- Casey Martin has come a long way this week
since his now-abandoned, one-seater cart was doing wheelies on the
Olympic Club's slopes Monday. When the U.S. Golf Association
finally settled on a practical mode of transportation for Martin _
the conventional golf cart he first rode on the Nike Tour _ the
26-year-old with the circulatory disease in his right leg could
concentrate on his golf game.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fairly smooth transition. Overwhelmed by the gallery
support, Martin shot a second-round 71 Friday for a total of
5-over-par 145 to make the cut. Not bad for his first event with
the PGA Tour players. Not bad for his first major. Very good for
all the hoopla that accompanied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in a way I have proved something to myself,'' Martin
said, ``because I know I'm not playing as well as I'm capable of
and yet I made the cut at the U.S. Open. So that gives me
confidence knowing that I'm supposed to be here. I think if I just
keep playing well and keep improving, I can be out here and really
be a steady fixture.''
</P>
<P>
   His finish on both days would suggest a reasonable amount of
fatigue. The cart notwithstanding, Martin still must walk a
significant amount and deal with Olympic's ever-present slopes. On
both days he has bogeyed the final two holes.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting to a higher goal than making the cut but not revealing
what it is, Martin said, ``I'd love to be known more as a golfer
than a person with a disability. But, at the same time, I know that
I am probably not going to lose that label.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking it out on someone
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, who has either shared or held the 54-hole lead of
the U.S. Open the last three years _ for two thirds and a second _
lost some ground Friday with a 75 and is at 3-over 143. Long before
leader Payne Stewart helplessly watched his ball trickle down the
slope from the green's upper level, Lehman found similar
frustration. Fuming as he entered the locker room after a
double-bogey at the 18th _ he four-putted from 50 feet _ Lehman
slammed the door and said, ``Whoever set up this course is full of
(expletive). That 18th green is as hard as a rock.'' ... Sick of
watching his ball rolling away, Kirk Triplett stopped it with the
head of his putter, absorbing a two-shot penalty, and then putted
again. He was about to miss the cut, anyway, but ended with
73-79-152. ... Sea Island's Davis Love III also watched his ball
roll away, along with his week. With his back hurting, Love shot
78-75 for 13-over par 153.
</P>
<P>
   Nobilo scorches front nine
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's Frank Nobilo, the two-time Sarazen World Open
champion, shot a 5-under-par 30 on Olympic's front nine Friday on
the way to a 67, rebounding from an opening 76.

 &HT;    Kuchar's 'A' game keeps him in hunt
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- The chants came from around the 18th green,
echoing through the elegant eucalyptus trees of the Olympic Club.
Not for Ernie Els, the U.S Open champion. Not for Justin Leonard,
the British Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kooch! ... Kooch!''
</P>
<P>
   Who does Matt Kuchar think he is, Bobby Jones? What's going on
here? Does a kid from Georgia Tech one day from turning 20 _ even
if he is the U.S. Amateur champion _ actually think he can win the
U.S. Open?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Kuchar said. ``I'm just going to take it
one shot at a time. But who knows? Maybe I will be in contention.''
</P>
<P>
   He already is. Kuchar fashioned a 1-under-par 69 Friday in the
second round of the U.S. Open, while some of the game's biggest
stars were being swallowed up by nasty rough and tricky greens. He
positioned himself at 1-under 139 for the tournament (two shots off
the lead), easily qualified for weekend play in his second straight
major championship and assumed an illogical spot on the leader
board.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the magic of Augusta has carried over to the
West Coast. Kuchar hasn't received the results of his sophomore
exams yet, but his grades at the U.S. Open are perfect. While some
fellow players and caddies think Kuchar's father, Peter, gets
carried away to the point of distraction as his bag toter, the
son's emotions are as steady as the Pacific Ocean breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my 'A' game there (at the Masters), and I think I
brought my 'A' game here as well,'' said the son, who tied for 21st
in Augusta in April. ``It's very cool stuff. It's way cool to be
inside the ropes and play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Els, the defending champion, would agree. Except he's been
watching Kuchar do it while struggling with his own game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been beaten by an amateur in a long time,'' said
Els, who needed a 70 Friday to stay within six shots of Kuchar,
``but the tournament isn't over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second, Kuchar held together when he easily could have
come unglued. He double-bogeyed the 14th, misclubbing his approach
to the bunker and then coming up short of the green. Reversing the
trend, Kuchar chipped in from 30 feet for birdie at the 15th,
sending a roar across the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar made a par save at the 16th, sinking a 10-footer after a
slick pitch from the rough; nearly birdied the rugged 17th after a
radar-like approach; and then came up short with a birdie putt at
the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot more of a grind than Augusta was,'' Kuchar said.
``You have to concentrate on every show, every hole. If you let
down an inch, this course will grab you.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar is being asked daily about the chances he will remain in
school for four years. While conceding that ``it was tough to see
that $40,000 go to waste'' at the Masters, Kuchar seems content.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money looks real good, but I am really enjoying school,''
he said. ``I had a great year this year at Georgia Tech. It was a
lot of fun. We have a great team, a great coach. ... I doubt myself
turning professional before school ends.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: MACHISMO GIVES GOOD NEW LAWS A BLACK EYE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In March, Daniel Ortega's 30-year-old stepdaughter, Zoilamerica
Narvaez, stunned Nicaragua with her charges that the former
president had been sexually abusing her since she was a child. Her
detailed and anguished story, which Ortega denies, has dominated
Nicaragua's news and gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega will probably not face trial, as a judge ruled this week
that he has parliamentary immunity. But more surprising, the
charges have sparked no broader discussion on sexual abuse. In May,
Ortega was re-elected, nearly unanimously, as head of the
Sandinista Front, in a convention where the charges were never
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Since their beginnings in the 1970s, Latin American women's
groups have won some important protections for women from domestic
and sexual violence. Laws have vastly improved in the last five
years, in part due to an inter-American convention on the subject.
Police and courts sometimes even enforce them.
</P>
<P>
   But machismo still reigns. Sexual and physical abuse is common
among all social classes in Latin America. It is less and less
acceptable to say so publicly, but many people, including many
women, still view women as men's property. They see sexual violence
as besmirching the honor of a woman and, if she is married, the
honor of the husband to whom she belongs.
</P>
<P>
   This view is still found in the law. In at least 10 countries, a
rapist can escape punishment by marrying his victim. Her family
often pressures her into agreeing, to restore her honor and assure
a husband for a woman considered tainted. In Brazil, juries still
acquit men who killed wives they suspected were straying, on
grounds that they were defending their honor. In many countries,
courts will not convict respected men for beating their wives _ in
the unlikely event a woman presses charges.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most successful and creative ideas for preventing
violence against women bears replicating worldwide. Brazil has
police stations with all-female staffs, specializing in violence
against women. When the first one opened in 1985, 500 women were
waiting in line, many with broken arms or black eyes.
</P>
<P>
   There are now close to 200 such stations in Brazil, most of them
in the relatively wealthy state of Sao Paulo. Because of them,
women's advocates say, even male officers now take domestic
violence more seriously. The women's stations have also helped
educate the public that it is not a man's right to beat his wife.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to a station in Sao Paulo a few years ago was a lesson
in how little women expect. The police chief told me of a woman who
had come in the week before. She was 70. Her husband began to beat
her six months into their 39-year marriage. She finally brought him
to the police because he broke her arm with a pressure cooker.
</P>
<P>
   The husband told the chief it was normal to slap your wife when
she didn't obey. As the officer explained the law to him, however,
he seemed to realize this was wrong. Later that day, the wife came
back to tell the chief that her husband was taking her out to
dinner for the first time in her life. ``We're going out for
pizza,'' she said, her eyes filled with tears.

EDITORIAL: EXPAND THE JAVITS CENTER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in editorial on Saturday, June 20:
</P>
<P>
   New York City's attraction as a site for trade shows and
conventions has been one of the key elements in its economic
growth. That makes it hard to understand why Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
seems so indifferent to the fact that the Jacob Javits Convention
Center is too small to accommodate the nation's largest trade
shows, and growing less competitive every year.
</P>
<P>
   New York has long since fallen out of the top 10 when it comes
to available exhibition space. It will drop further as other cities
expand their facilities.
</P>
<P>
   New York state, which runs the Javits Center, has been promoting
a plan that would double its 760,000 square feet of exhibition
space by creating a vast complex stretching all the way to 42nd
Street from the center's present site on the western end of 38th
Street. Tying the center to 42nd Street would pull the booming
development of the Times Square area all the way to the Hudson
River, while connecting the convention business to the city's
entertainment hub.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Silverstein, a developer who owns part of the property the
state would need, was apparently willing to swap the land for the
right to build a hotel or apartment tower over the Javits
expansion. But Silverstein recently said he was tired of waiting
for the city to commit, and was going ahead with other plans for
the property.
</P>
<P>
   It would be amazing if Giuliani swallowed the state proposal
whole. It would cost an estimated $700 million, and the state wants
the city to pick up part of the tab. But rather than demanding
changes or proposing alternatives, the city seems simply to be
turning away _ as if the convention center were a state project for
Syracuse rather than Manhattan. There have been no public comments,
no objections and apparently no private negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's critics contend that the mayor does not want any
other West Side program to compete with possible plans for a new
Yankee Stadium, although the two structures would be on different
sites. If so, Giuliani's strategy is all wrong. New York City must
both keep the Yankees and pursue the economic development projects
it needs to keep the economy growing. To suggest that both things
are not possible would hurt, rather than help, the mayor's cause.
</P>
<P>
   Building a world-class convention center would create jobs and
assure the city's ability to attract major trade shows and
exhibitions into the next century. The mayor must cooperate with
the state in reaching that goal.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 20:
</P>
<P>
   International financial officials are meeting in Tokyo with a
sense of urgency that has been lacking for most of this decade as
Japan refused to deal with its banking crisis. Now Japan has
promised prompt action, and has earmarked money to do the job. What
is unclear is whether the Japanese authorities are able to act
decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Action is essential because Japan is in the midst of a severe
credit crunch as shaky banks try to avoid new losses by avoiding
almost all loans. That has put a stranglehold on the economy,
deepening Japan's recession and making the bad-loan problem even
more severe.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine a worse time for Japan to be in recession.
The problems of developing countries in Asia remain severe, and are
hurting others. Asian countries, unable to afford things, have
slashed their imports, and U.S. exports are falling. The developing
countries, confronted with their own weak banks and debt-ridden
companies, will have a hard enough time recovering even if Japan
does get moving and resume buying their products. Without a
Japanese recovery, it is easy to understand why World Bank
officials are now talking of an Asian depression.
</P>
<P>
   Intervention by Tokyo and Washington to support the yen set off
rallies in financial markets around the world this week, but they
quickly faded as investors looked for action, not words. Japan
needs to determine which banks are insolvent and close them, while
protecting depositors. At the same time, it needs to bail out the
remaining institutions that can make it with help. Then those banks
can start lending again and, with the help of an aggressive package
of government spending and tax cuts, Japan's economy can recover.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, work on sorting out which banks should be saved
seems to have not yet begun. It is up to the foreign officials
gathered in Tokyo to persuade Japanese officials to live up to
their pledge, and to offer them all the assistance they need. There
is no guarantee that the rest of Asia will recover soon even if
Japan starts growing again and keeps its currency from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   But the chances of that happening will be far greater if Japan
deals with its problems decisively and quickly.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 20:
</P>
<P>
   New York's state Legislature has done an excellent job of
reducing expectations. When the lawmakers closed up shop and went
home Friday, relief that they had done so few things that were
terrible overcame some of the disappointment over their failure to
do much that was good.
</P>
<P>
   It was good news that the Legislature failed to pass a parole
bill that was more election-year pandering than serious reform of
the state's sometimes irrational sentencing system. In another
accomplishment of sorts, the Assembly killed a boondoggle for
mutual insurance companies sought by Gov. George Pataki and the
Republican Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Any time the Legislature resists the temptation to meddle with
city interests on behalf of its special constituencies is cause for
some rejoicing, so the state Senate deserves commendation for
killing a bill that would give the final say on city police union
contract disputes to a state arbitration board.
</P>
<P>
   But the Legislature passed another bill that meddled with the
New York City Police Department's ability to decide its own
promotion policies, and blithely approved new retirement benefits
for city workers that will cost $154 million a year, without
volunteering to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the energy of the Legislature's last days was devoted to
passage of a bill requiring the state to track people infected with
the AIDS virus by name and to notify their sexual partners. The
Assembly leadership's concerns over privacy issues was
understandable, but the experience of other states with similar
programs suggests it was exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators passed some other good bills on health care for
poor children and consumer rights for health-care insurance policy
holders. The ridiculous system for New York City school board
elections got some improvements. The lawmakers also set up a
state-city structure to run the proposed Hudson River Park in
Manhattan below 59th Street, bringing the park's creation closer to
reality.
</P>
<P>
   But they ducked their responsibility to take a serious stand on
other important issues. Campaign finance reform was ignored, as
were the pleas from New York City's schools chancellor to end state
requirements that all public-school principals be given tenure. The
state Senate killed bills on gun control and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most disappointing was the Legislature's failure to
approve a court reorganization bill proposed by Chief Judge Judith
Kaye. Assembly Democrats appear to prefer the present inefficient
and hopelessly complicated court system to the potential loss of
patronage that reform would entail.

FOR REED AND METS, GREAT START, BAD FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the second time in 12 days, Rick Reed, a
replacement player during the labor unrest of 1995 who is now
auditioning for a spot on the 1998 National League all-star team,
seemed on the verge of accomplishing what no other pitcher has been
able to do in the 37 seasons of Mets baseball: pitch a no-hit game,
perhaps even a perfect one.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night against the Florida Marlins at Shea Stadium, Reed
took a perfect game into the seventh inning, a circumstance eerily
familiar to his performance at Shea on June 8, when he retired the
first 20 batters in a game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Wade Boggs broke up that perfect-game bid with a
two-out seventh-inning double. Friday night, it was Florida's Edgar
Renteria who singled with one out in the seventh inning against
Reed.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next few minutes, what had been Reed's perfect game
became something else familiar this month: a Mets loss, their third
in a row, and their fifth in the last week to the Marlins and
Montreal Expos, two doormat teams in the National League. Reed
would not even finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   Following his single, Renteria was caught stealing, but two
Marlins hits ensued. Then, Florida's Cliff Floyd hit Reed's first
pitch for a towering three-run home run to right field that gave
the Marlins a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   No perfect game for Reed (8-4), and perhaps a setback on his
road to an all-star game appearance _ although Florida manager Jim
Leyland, who will manage the NL squad and choose the pitching
staff, said before the game that he had Reed highly rated in a
statistical chart he keeps on all league pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' hitters, meanwhile, could not rescue Reed from his
meltdown. They scratched out two early runs off Marlins starter
Brian Meadows, but wilted thereafter. In the eighth inning, with
Carlos Baerga at third base with one out, neither Brian McRae nor
the Mets' pinch-hitter Luis Lopez got the ball out of the infield,
stranding Baerga at third.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning, the rookie Benny Agbayani and Matt Franco
each drew one-out walks. Mike Piazza hit a ground ball that forced
Franco at second base and put runners on first and third. The
Florida reliever Matt Mantei struck out John Olerud for his first
save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who pitched for the Mets' top minor league team in 1996
and was a surprising success with a 13-9 record last season,
breezed through the Marlins' lineup for six innings. He retired
Todd Dunwoody, Florida's leadoff hitter, at the start of the
seventh inning on a ground ball to Olerud at first base.
</P>
<P>
   But on a 3-1 pitch, Renteria _ the only .300 hitter in the
Marlins' starting lineup _ slapped a sharply hit ground ball
between Baerga and second base for a crisp single.
</P>
<P>
   Most in the crowd of 32,738 rose to their feet in an ovation for
Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Renteria was thrown out attempting to steal second base, but
Florida's Mark Kotsay followed with an infield single. Todd Zeile
laced a single to left field, and Floyd hit Reed's first pitch deep
into the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who minutes ago was eight outs from a historic pitching
performance, stood in front of the mound with his hands on his
knees, staring at the grass beside his feet.
</P>
<P>
   He would leave the game after two Marlins hits and two outs in
the ninth inning, yielding six hits with no walks and eight
strikeouts. John Franco came on in relief of Reed, making his 402nd
appearance as a Met, a team record previously held by Tom Seaver.
</P>
<P>
   While Reed was masterful throughout the early parts of the game,
the Marlins nearly reached base several times. After Reed struck
out Dunwoody and Renteria to start the game, Kotsay lined a pitch
that Olerud snagged with a leaping grab.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows also slapped a pitch up the middle in the third inning
that Reed deftly fielded and threw to first for the out.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez made a
difficult play look easy, charging a high-bouncing ground ball off
the bat of Renteria, catching it between bounces and then hastily
firing to first base to retire Renteria by two steps. And in the
fifth, the right-handed-hitting Zeile pulled a Reed delivery
sharply toward third base. Mets third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo
stretched to his left for the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Craig Counsell was a few feet from ending the perfect
game and the shutout with one out in the sixth inning. Counsell
sent a 2-2 Reed pitch deep down the right-field line. The ball
curved just foul. Three pitches later, Counsell popped out meekly
to Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored quickly against Meadows (5-6), who came into the
game 0-2 against the Mets. In his third game as a Met, Agbayani
singled up the middle to open the Mets' first inning. It was
Agbayani's first major league hit. A walk to Matt Franco, a ground
ball by Piazza and Olerud's sacrifice fly produced a run.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga led off the fourth inning with a double into the
right-field corner, which Alfonzo followed with a ground ball
single to left field. With runners on first and third base, Meadows
balked, allowing Baerga to score the Mets' second run. But it
wasn't enough on a night when Reed saw perfection turn into
frustration in a manner of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   An American League executive said the Mets had talked to the
Anaheim Angels about acquiring standout outfielder Jim Edmonds for
Mets pitchers Bobby Jones and Bill Pulsipher. Asked whether the
Mets had expressed interest in Edmonds, general manager Steve
Phillips said he would not comment on what players he was
interested in nor reveal what teams he had talked to ... Outfielder
Bernard Gilkey, who has not played since he was hit by a pitch
above his left eye last Friday, was examined by team doctors and
will not play until he is re-examined ... Butch Huskey sat out
Friday night's game following a magnetic resonance imaging test on
his right knee. ``They drained it and gave me some cortisone,''
Huskey said. ``It's nothing major, but after the season, I'll have
to have surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and the Chase Manhattan Bank announced that they had
donated 70,000 tickets to area children, 10,000 of whom are in
foster care. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, accepting the gift at a
ceremony at Shea Stadium, said many youngsters ``will get a chance
to see their major league heroes for the first time.'' The tickets
have been distributed to schools in low-income communities and to
youth groups in the metropolitan area, said the office of the
mayor. After announcing the program, ``Baseball Is for Kids,''
manager Bobby Valentine and pitchers John Franco and Al Leiter held
a baseball clinic for 70 children. &QL;

ACHING GODINA STILL EXPECTS OOMPH IN HIS THROW 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Just think how far John Godina would propel the
shot and the discus if he were healthy.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the 26-year-old UCLA graduate is a two-time world
champion in the shot-put and the world leader this year in the shot
and the discus throw. In the U.S. outdoor track and field
championships he took aim at both titles _ the men's discus throw
(he was the defending champion) Friday night and the shot-put
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   And never mind the torn cartilage in his right shoulder. He says
he does not even think about it, except that he is more tired than
a 6-foot-4-inch, 285-pound muscleman figures to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been throwing with a lot of fatigue from lifting
weights,'' he said. ``I took time off for this meet. I haven't
competed in the shot for three weeks and the discus for two.''
</P>
<P>
   Godina has also cut back on his lifts. He would like to do the
standard two-part lift, which consists of cleaning the weight
(lifting it to the chest) and then jerking it overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do just cleans,'' he said, ``almost 400 pounds. But I can't
do overhead lifts because of the torn cartilage in my shoulder.
I've had it two years, but I don't want surgery on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why lift so much with an aching shoulder?
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps my mind from wandering,'' Godina said. ``My goal this
year was to get the shot-put record indoors and outdoors, but I
didn't get the indoor record and the outdoor record is way out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The world outdoor records are 75 feet 10\ inches in 1990 by
Randy Barnes, an American shot-putter, and 243-0 in 1986 by Jurgen
Schult, an East German discus thrower. Godina entered this meet
with the year's best shot-put (71-5{) and discus throw (229-4). It
was on May 19 that he reached 71-5{ and then added a 218-1,
history's second-best shot-discus one-day double behind Ben
Plucknett's 67-6 3/4 and then-world-record 233-7 in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Godina's climb to glory has not been easy. In the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics, he struggled early in the shot-put, then took the lead on
the fifth of his six attempts with 68-2{. Just as it seemed Godina
would win the gold medal, Barnes, on his last attempt, sent the
shot flying 70-11\, and Godina's gold medal turned to silver.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes jabbed both arms over his head in triumph. Godina just
stared in disbelief and disappointment. Three days later, there was
more disappointment for Godina when he fell 13 inches short of
reaching the discus final.
</P>
<P>
   Things are better now. In paying tribute to Godina's
athleticism, Art Venegas, who coached him in college and still
coaches him, calls him ``the most explosive guy I've ever been
around.'' And Godina sees no reason why he should not keep
improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm as close to being as good as I can get,'' he
said. ``If I thought I couldn't get better, it would be boring. If
I can throw 250 and 78 feet, that sounds great. It depends how
everything happens, if my progression continues. I'm not going to
put my limits at 74 and 245. There's no reason to do that.''

PROSECUTION RESTS IN TRIAL OF FORMER OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The government rested its case Friday in the trial of
Francis Livoti, the former New York City police officer accused in
the 1994 choking death of Anthony Baez.
</P>
<P>
   It did so without calling a single police officer to the stand,
despite the presence of several officers at the scene that night in
the Bronx when, prosecutors contend, Livoti used an illegal choke
hold to subdue Baez during an arrest, and caused his death.
</P>
<P>
   There have long been questions about whether a code of silence
among fellow officers has operated to protect Livoti in the
investigation of Baez's death. In 1996, a state Supreme Court
justice acquitted Livoti of charges of criminally negligent
homicide but said that he was concerned about a ``nest of perjury''
among officers. The acquittal ignited street protests in the Bronx
and made the Baez death a bitter symbol in the debate over police
brutality in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, in a Police Department disciplinary proceeding
that led to Livoti's dismissal from the force, the hearing officer
said that some police testimony seemed to be ``suspiciously
tailored'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a federal prosecutor, Mark Pomerantz, told the jury
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan that some police testimony in
the federal trial, in which Livoti faces a charge of violating
Baez's civil rights, ``may be truthful, some of it may not be
truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it may come to you from police officers who either did
not see what happened,'' Pomerantz said, ``or who covered up what
happened on Cameron Place on Dec. 22 in order to protect a fellow
officer and in order to protect themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Livoti's lawyer, Stuart London, opened his defense case
by calling Sgt. William Monahan, who rode with Livoti in the patrol
car the night Baez died.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant testified that he did not see Livoti grab Baez, or
choke him, as prosecutors have contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Officer Livoti have his arms around Anthony Baez's neck?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Monahan replied.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan also testified that Baez, a 29-year-old Florida resident
who was visiting his family in the Bronx, was resisting arrest that
night.
</P>
<P>
   In his questioning of witnesses through the trial, London has
sought to discredit the government's contention that Baez's death
was caused by a choke hold, or that family members even saw the
former officer grab Baez around the neck. The defense contends that
Baez died of a severe asthma attack, and that any force used
against Baez was accidental and inadvertent.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in the day, the government's final witness, Charles
Hirsch, chief medical examiner of New York City, testified that the
primary cause of death was ``asphyxia, due to compression of his
neck and chest,'' and that asthma was only a contributing, lesser
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the internal injuries to Baez's neck, Hirsch said, ``It
is my opinion that Baez's injuries resulted from a choke hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, London suggested in cross-examination that it was not
possible to determine from the autopsy whether Baez's injuries were
intentionally inflicted or not.
</P>
<P>
   But Hirsch disagreed. ``It is my opinion that Anthony Baez was
placed in a choke hold and his neck was squeezed,'' he said.
``That's an intentional act.''
</P>
<P>
   London refused to comment after court, except to say that he
believed that there had been a rush to judgment about his client.
``It's more newsworthy to bash Livoti than to give him a fair
trial, which is all we're looking for,'' London said.

HMOs DECLARE VIAGRA SUPPORT 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Perhaps it's empathy for their members, or
recognition of the role sexuality plays in the Southern California
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the impetus, a majority of local HMOs say they already
do, or soon plan to include the anti-impotence drug Viagra in their
coverage. That's in sharp contrast to Friday's announcement by
Oakland-based Kaiser Permanente Group that it will not pay for the
pill.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, which with 9.1 million members is the nation's largest
HMO, said that at $10 a dose Viagra is just too expensive. Kaiser
is also the biggest health plan in Southern California, with more
than 1 million members in greater Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement, Kaiser said it will exclude coverage of
Viagra and other drugs for sexual dysfunction when it renews
benefit contracts with employer groups. The nonprofit health
organization lost $270 million last year and in addition to raising
rates, is looking for ways to cuts costs.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser said it will stock Viagra in all of its pharmacies and
will allow doctors to prescribe the medicine. But patients with
impotence must pay for the pills themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Aetna U.S. Healthcare similarly announced it
would not pay for Viagra, saying the drug was not a medical
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook is decidedly different at Los Angeles-based
WellPoint Health Networks. WellPoint, which operates the Blue Cross
of California HMO and preferred provider organization, has not only
covered Viagra since its April launch by drug maker Pfizer Inc.,
but also pays for suppositories and several other drugs on the
market to treat impotence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rationale for coverage is simple: We've always covered
impotence,'' said WellPoint spokesman Peter O'Neill. In general,
WellPoint stipulates that the impotence must be caused by an
underlying condition such as diabetes or prostate problems, but it
will also cover dysfunction resulting from certain
anti-depressants.
</P>
<P>
   There is a limit to the group's generosity: Because of Viagra's
cost, patients are limited to six doses per month, after which they
must pony up for the pills themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we decided to cover one pill a month, our members would be
pretty dissatisfied with that. But 30 pills would be
cost-prohibitive,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based CareAmerica Health Plans similarly pays for
six Viagra pills a month for its MediCare members and commercial
members whose plans normally include drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills-based Foundation Health Systems, which operates
the Health Net HMO, does not cover Viagra yet, but will, ``Sooner,
rather than later,'' said spokesman Ron Yukelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual function is an important part of both mental and
physical health,'' Yukelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential HealthCare said it has just completed a study on
Viagra and will announce a policy within a few weeks. A Prudential
spokesman said in general the company is sympathetic to coverage of
sexual dysfunction and already pays for surgery, vacuum devices to
help attain an erection and other drugs besides Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Care, the nonprofit HMO created to care for Los Angeles
County's Medi-Cal population, does not formally cover the drug, but
spokesman Keith Malone said some physicians are informally
prescribing the medicine on the government tab. Roughly half of
state-run Medicaid programs pay for Viagra and the Clinton
administration has proposed making coverage mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Since its introduction in early April, Viagra has become one of
the best-selling U.S. drugs in history, with 1.1 million
prescriptions filled in May alone. Consumer advocates say a health
plan's decision on whether or not to cover the drug raises larger
issues about how HMOs accept new technology and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yellow flag that's being raised is how will new treatments
be covered in the future if it's clear they're medically
necessary?'' said Peter Lee, head of consumer protection at the Los
Angeles-based Center for Health Care Rights. If new treatments like
Viagra are dismissed by health plans out of hand, ``It means you're
being insured for what works today, not what's discovered tomorrow.
And that's not what insurance should be about.''

prescribing the medicine on the government tab. Roughly half of
state-run Medicaid programs pay for Viagra and the Clinton
administration has proposed making coverage mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Since its introduction in early April, Viagra has become one of
the best-selling U.S. drugs in history, with 1.1 million
prescriptions filled in May alone. Consumer advocates say a health
plan's decision on whether or not to cover the drug raises larger
issues about how HMOs accept new technology and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yellow flag that's being raised is how will new treatments
be covered in the future if it's clear they're medically
necessary?'' said Peter Lee, head of consumer protection at the Los
Angeles-based Center for Health Care Rights. If new treatments like
Viagra are dismissed by health plans out of hand, ``It means you're
being insured for what works today, not what's discovered tomorrow.
And that's not what insurance should be about.''

REPORT DRAWS HARROWING PICTURE OF BOY'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ An 11-year-old boy who died at a psychiatric
hospital while being restrained had suffered his entire life, both
because of a mother who verbally and physically abused him and
because of a state agency that did not take him away soon enough,
according to a report issued Friday by a state oversight panel.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew McClain, whose death in March from suffocation is still
under criminal investigation, visited a hospital many times because
of injuries his family could not adequately explain, including a
series of eye injuries that made him blind in his left eye by age
3, according to Friday's report from the Child Fatality Review
Panel. The report also said that hospital workers witnessed him
being whipped with a belt by his mother and that she and his
grandmother were seen eating his food while he was staying in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Yet workers for the state Department of Children and Families
did not take steps to remove Andrew from his home, despite urgent
pleas by doctors at the hospital where he was being treated, the
report said. One agency worker said then that the department was
``not in the business of breaking up families,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Linda Pearce Prestley, the state's child advocate and
leader of the Child Fatality Review Panel, said the case should be
studied by caseworkers, lawyers and judges on how not to treat a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew M. suffered more in his brief eleven years of life than
most people suffer in a lifetime,'' Ms. Prestley said. ``There is
no question that numerous opportunities to protect Andrew in his
early years were missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in foster care, Andrew spent a year in a home not
appropriate for him, and his mental health worsened, the report
said. When he died, the state was still working toward placing
Andrew back with his mother _ an ``unrealistic and dangerous
plan,'' the report reads.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's criticism comes three years after Gov. John Rowland
promised to clean up the state's child welfare system in part by
focusing on child safety. That move was made after three children
died from abuse while under state care in one month in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The review panel said that Andrew's early encounters with the
system came before new policies were instituted following the 1995
deaths, but that even afterward, some of those policies _ including
that child protection be the primary goal of the agency _ were
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Ragaglia, commissioner of the Department of Children
and Families, said Friday that the agency in the 1980s took what
was then considered appropriate action in keeping Andrew with his
mother. And she said the state is beginning intense reviews of all
its child welfare cases every six months to make sure a child is
getting the best care he can.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew died March 22 after two mental health workers at the
Elmcrest Psychiatric Hospital in Portland suffocated him while
physically restraining him by holding him to the ground while one
worker lay on him _ a method the child review panel later said did
not follow standards. The state found one of the mental health
workers to be abusive, and two other hospital workers to be
negligent. The hospital agreed to pay $100,000 in lieu of fines.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's 45-page report drew a harrowing picture of the boy's
life. Born to a 13-year-old mother, he had, by the age of 3, been
treated in the emergency room for a perforated ear drum, a small
burn on his shoulder, a cut on his finger that later became
infected because his mother did not take him for treatment, and
three eye injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In his 11 years, he attended six schools, stayed in four foster
homes, had two lawyers, was treated by four social workers, and had
six in-patient stays at mental-health facilities.
</P>
<P>
   As Andrew, who was described as mildly retarded, grew older, his
behavioral problems escalated. It is no surprise, Ms. Prestley said
Friday, that he ended up in a psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew stayed with his mother or grandmother until January 1996,
when his mother was arrested for allegedly selling drugs in her
home when her children were present.
</P>
<P>
   Janette Getz, a lawyer for Lucinda McClain, said that the
mother's alleged abuse is not relevant to the suit she plans on
filing against the state and Elmcrest Hospital. ``Her child was not
killed while he was in her custody,'' Ms. Getz said. ``He was
placed in a system that was designed to safeguard this child. And
it is that system that ultimately failed.''
</P>
<P>
   The report makes a number of wide-ranging recommendations,
including that any case with more than three neglect or abuse
referrals in a year be reviewed by a multidisciplinary team; that
the state increase the number of foster homes and
residential-treatment facilities it has available; and that the
state's Judicial Department develop mandatory classes for lawyers
who want to represent children and a system to monitor their
performance.

ACTRESS STREEP SAYS `100 BEST' NEGLECTS WOMEN

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Superstar Meryl Streep stirred a tempest in
Tinseltown on Friday by attacking balloting for the 100 best
American films _ already a touchstone for just about everything
right and wrong with Hollywood _ as discriminatory against women.
</P>
<P>
   Streep used the Crystal Awards, which celebrate women's
contributions to film, as her forum to suggest that the American
Film Institute's selection process was, like the industry itself,
men-heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many women in the audience got to vote? Just put your head
down and raise your arm if you voted,'' she told the Who's Who of
women film luminaries who filled a banquet hall at the Century
Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Streep noted no raised hands.
</P>
<P>
   Just maybe, she continued as the audience warmed with chuckles
and whispered comments of assent, that's why only four of the top
centennial picks featured women protagonists _ and one of those,
``Snow White,'' was a cartoon, no less.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it was ``whining,'' she said, glaring over her
shoulder at Jack Nicholson seated behind her, a star who's symbolic
of a Hollywood that still casts its aging lions with young female
leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``But somebody has to.''
</P>
<P>
   Streep, who has given the gap between Hollywood's treatment of
male and female workers much of the high profile that has lead to
gains for women in many key areas of film production, brought the
1,000-person crowd to its feet with a rousing conclusion worthy of
the theater itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe next century women will get to vote!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It struck a deep vein among many gathered to celebrate Women In
Film's 25th anniversary and to honor the likes of producer Gale
Anne Hurd, Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group Vice Chairwoman
Lucy Fisher, Women In Film founder Tichi Wilkerson Kassel _ and
Streep herself.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing to her side, actress Geena Davis, the mistress of
ceremonies gushed, ``You are my hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Only trouble was, a chagrined American Film Institute claimed
that this time Streep got her lines wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Picker Firstenberg, AFI's director and CEO, said the
organization ``hand-delivered'' a ballot to Streep's agent, Kevin
Huvane. Why Streep didn't get the ballot is a mystery, she said.
Huvane did not return phone calls Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While AFI agrees there should be more women at all levels of
film production, the group did not forget nor neglect them when the
1,500 ballots were sent to prominent Americans in the industry, she
said. President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore got the ballots
as non-industry exceptions under the reasoning that a leading
export is Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women were well-represented in the community of people asked
to participate,'' Firstenberg said. ``Hundreds of women in that
room received ballots. I know because I know them.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the women directors, producers, stars and others were
reluctant to put their heads down in their salad plates for the
straw vote?
</P>
<P>
   Or as Firstenberg, who attended the awards, suggested, maybe
they understood Streep to be asking a rhetorical question intended
to underscore the seriousness of women's underrepresentation in the
industry _ and didn't (italics) really (end italics) intend for
hands to go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she used the list as a way to say women need to get
stronger roles, where the women are the protagonists, the creative
spine of the film,'' Firstenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest way to settle whether the composition of the list
included far more men, and consequently may have played a role in
the list's tilt toward male roles, would be for the AFI either to
release the entire voting result or to characterize it in terms of
the number of men vs. women queried.
</P>
<P>
   But that, said Firstenberg, will remain strictly L.A.
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Firstenberg said Streep failed to count as many as 14 films on
the list in which a female star carried the drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you could count `Tootsie,' too,'' Firstenberg said. That's
``Tootsie'' starring Dustin Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he does dress up and act as a woman, Firstenberg said.
Indeed, Hoffman plays a New York actor who can only land roles by
cross-dressing as an actress.
</P>
<P>
   OK, make that 19 films with women protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those attending the ceremony agree that women still are
overshadowed in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Lauzen, a communications professor at San Diego State
University, said her team ``counted'' credit on the 100 top films
of 1987, 1992 and 1997, finding that men outnumber women 8-1 behind
the scenes, even as women-produced films earn the same as those
made by men.
</P>
<P>
   No women cinematographers worked on any of the top 100 films,
while women directed only 5 percent of the top 100 films of 1997.
Twenty-two percent of the associate producers on the top films in
1997 were female.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line, and the paradox, is that women remain
underrepresented behind the scenes, even though their films earn as
much as men's. And I find this interesting because it just doesn't
make good business sense,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Firstenberg said the 100 best American films list
did exactly what was hoped, by getting people to talk about the
contest, the list and, ultimately, the films themselves. Streep
just punctuates that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this demonstrates is that people love movies. They love
them because they reach them. In their finest form, they're art, an
art that has a passionate hold on us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is Hollywood.
