NORTHRIDGE TAUGHT A LESSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ School has been out at Cal State Northridge since
the week before Christmas, but since you can learn something every
day, Mississippi State's women's basketball team gave a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge has talked about taking its game to the next level.
The 21st-ranked Bulldogs _ the first nationally ranked team to play
here in Northridge's Division I era _ gave a glimpse of that level
in a 98-64 nonconference victory before a crowd of 165 Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It ended CSUN's 16-game home win streak.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Matadors learned from the Bulldogs (10-0) remains to
be seen. The Big Sky Conference season begins Thursday at Northern
Arizona, but the Matadors don't believe they'll face anyone of this
caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conference isn't that strong,'' Edneisha Curry admitted,
``so we have to play hard and play with the type of desire and
heart night in and night out, so we can play with Mississippi State
and all the other ranked teams.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, they have completed the most difficult portion of the
schedule with two losses to nationally ranked teams in Illinois and
Mississippi State and a win over an NCAA Tournament team in
Dartmouth. It leaves them 6-4, the same record they had at this
time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they weren't talking about elevating their game at
this time last year. Since the Matadors have reached the NCAA
Tournament and are hungry for more, Mississippi State provided
clues to what they need to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's the basics: shoot a high percentage, rebound well and
commit fewer turnovers and fouls. Shooting 36.7 percent, taking
just 28 boards and committing 17 turnovers might be enough to win
the Big Sky, but it won't get you past Mississippi State, which
shot 50.7 percent and took 51 rebounds. Although the Bulldogs
turned over the ball the same number of times, they also committed
six fewer fouls.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps to have a player like freshman LaToya Thomas, who
can deliver points in bunches when needed. Thomas scored 33,
including 18 in the first half, but was most valuable in the second
half when she scored eight points in a 10-0 run that ended any hope
of a Northridge comeback. CSUN had cut a 50-25 halftime deficit to
59-45 with 12:21 to play and had some momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal in the second half was to cut it to 10 by the
10-minute mark,'' CSUN coach Frozena Jerro said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Northridge has a Thomas-like player in Curry, who
scored 21 points. But she made 9 of 23 field-goal attempts, far
below Thomas' 11 of 18.
</P>
<P>
   The other time Northridge was close was when it scored eight
straight points and trailed 13-12 with 12:46 to play in the first
half. Mississippi State responded with a 25-7 run in 9:10 to put
the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're getting a lot of experience,'' Bulldogs
coach Sharon Faning said. ``They need to work on footwork, defense,
rebounding _ same as us.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other Mississippi State players scored in double figures:
Jennifer Fambrough (22), Cynthia Hall (11) and Meadow Overstreet
(11). Northridge got 14 from Lynda Amari and 13 from LaShaunda
Fowler.

A CORRECTION: WELCOME TO 51,254 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For those who believe that in the good old days _
before calculators, before computers _ people were better at mental
arithmetic, The New York Times offers a sobering New Year's
message: Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 6, 1898, it seems, someone preparing the next day's
front page tried to add 1 to the issue number in the upper left
corner (14,499) and came up with 15,000. Apparently no one noticed,
because the 500-issue error persisted until Friday (No. 51,753).
Saturday The Times turns back the clock to correct the sequence:
this issue is No. 51,254.
</P>
<P>
   Thus an article on March 14, 1995, celebrating the arrival of
No. 50,000 was 500 days premature. It should have appeared on July
26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The error came to light recently when Aaron Donovan, a news
assistant, became curious about the numbering, which he updates
nightly when working at the news desk. He wondered about the
potential for self-perpetuating error. Using a spreadsheet program,
he calculated the number of days since The Times' founding, on
Sept. 18, 1851.
</P>
<P>
   Through the newspaper's archives, he learned that in its first
500 weeks, The Times published no Sunday issue. Then, for 2,296
weeks from April 1861 to April 1905, the Sunday issue was treated
as an extension of the Saturday paper, bearing its number. In the
early days, the paper skipped publication on a few holidays. No
issues were published for 88 days during a strike in 1978. (During
five earlier labor disputes, unpublished issues were assigned
numbers, sometimes because catch-up editions were later produced
for the archives.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, by scanning books of historic front pages and reels of
microfilm, Donovan zeroed in on the date of the 500-issue gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something that appeals to me about the way the issue
number marks the passage of time across decades and centuries,''
said a memo from Donovan, who is 24. ``It has been steadily
climbing for longer than anyone who has ever glanced at it has been
alive. The 19th-century newsboy hawking papers in a snowy Union
Square is in some minute way bound by the issue number to the
Seattle advertising executive reading the paper with her feet
propped up on the desk.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the other number on the front page _ the volume, in Roman
numerals _ it remains CXLIX. It will change to CL on Sept. 18, when
The Times enters its 150th year.

 BC- Y2K-MALL-2NDLD-COX &HT;    MASSIVE CROWD WATCHES CLINTON IGNITE FIREWORKS SPECTACULAR TO
GREET 2000
 &HT;    EDS: New top and updates throughout.
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clear skies and a string of flawless midnight New
Year's rollovers around the globe enticed a massive crowd to the
National Mall for a fireworks spectacular ignited by President
Clinton to greet the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when Clinton called on America to make its ``dreams
stronger than its memories,'' 2000 arrived in the nation's capital
in a shower of light over the Washington Monument that left
thousands of spectators cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with
the Great Emancipator peering over his should, said ``Americans
must not fear change. Instead,'' he said, ``let us welcome it,
embrace it, and create it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although daytime activities in Washington drew modest crowds,
throngs streamed in by nightfall to find grassy seats on the
heavily-secured patch of the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   They choked into long thick lines through a handful of security
checkpoints where revelers submitted to searches. At one point,
crowds on 17th Street waiting to pass through security entrances
pushed over barriers and rushed past police who were helpless to
stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Since last week, officials had been scaling back the size of the
crowd they expected from an original estimate of 500,000. But as
midnight closed in, the streets teemed with people and there seemed
to be little left of the anxiety over terrorist attacks that
prompted the mayor of Seattle last week to cancel a major outdoor
celebration around the city's famed Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's three-hour show, with a pricetag of $12 million,
competed on television with the customary Times Square celebration.
While New York's gala featured the traditional ball of light
descending in the seconds before midnight, Washington's had a white
light of fireworks cascading up the 555-foot Washington Monument,
sparked by a fuse racing along the reflecting pool from the Lincoln
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Tresca and her husband, Sal, of Rhode Island, left the
friends they were visiting in a Maryland suburb to come down to the
Mall where the gala at the Lincoln Memorial also was shown on large
screen TVs set up on the grass. Their friends wouldn't leave their
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're too busy holding onto their bottled water,'' Diane
Tresca said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she wasn't concerned about terrorism. ``No,'' she said,
``I'm more concerned about not being able to see the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks at events throughout the day, Clinton made no mention
of the unease that had settled on Washington in the weeks leading
up to Friday night. Fear of terrorism pegged to year-end
celebrations focused on Washington, New York and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we celebrate did not begin today, and it will not end
tomorrow,'' Clinton said to a crowd at the Mall earlier in the day.
``There is no better opportunity to open a new chapter of progress
and possibility for all people ... no better time to be a truly
good neighbor to the people of the world who share this smaller and
smaller planet of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked God ``for this wonderful weather, so we all feel
good being out here. . . The sun is still rising on America.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sunlight faded on the day, the Siegel family of Richmond
played the card game Uno while sitting on the curb waiting, with a
few hundred others, to be let into a fenced off section of the Mall
nearest the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Actor and musician Will Smith hosted the three-hour stage show
called ``America's Millennium Gala.'' Clinton and other
dignitaries, including former Sen. John Glenn, watched from a
heated booth at the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Among the performers were actors Robert Duvall and Jack
Nicholson, actress Diane Keaton, and musicians Don McLean, Bobby
McFerrin, Kenny Rogers, Luther Vandross, Kathy Mattea, Trisha
Yearwood, and the 25-member company of the Broadway production
``Stomp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Siegels weren't worried about the dangers of either Y2K
chaos or terrorism. In fact, they joked about the festivities being
hosted by Smith, who has played the hero in a pair of futuristic
space-themed films, ``Men in Black'' and ``Independence Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought since Will Smith is the host and he's killed aliens
and space bugs, you couldn't be in a better-protected zone,'' joked
Dan Siegel, 46, who was there with his wife, Peggy, and children
Julia, 16, and Tommy, 14.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential for danger made it possible to get a hotel
room within walking distance of the Mall just last week. And, in
their one concession to the Y2K bug, the Siegels settled on
Washington as their New Year's celebration destination because they
could make the trip from Richmond and back on a single tank of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in case there's a problem and we can't get any more,''
said Peggy Siegel, also 46.
</P>
<P>
   For Benjamin McKenzie, 29, the trip to the Mall was just a walk.
He lives on Capitol Hill and brought his 15-year-old brother, who's
visiting from upstate New York, down for the fireworks. But he
couldn't get his friends to join in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said 'No way!''' McKenzie said. ``We know security is a
concern, but it's not overwhelming. It feels like a normal day.''

FEAR OF COMPUTER GLITCH GROUNDS THOUSANDS OF AIR TRAVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (UPDATES 2nd graf with midnight arriving; ADDS graf 4 grafs from
end of story about glitch) (kd) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Airports around the world, ordinarily quiet on New Year's Eve,
were unusually so Friday as thousands of potential travelers stayed
put while the world's air traffic system rolled over to the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite such fears and recent concerns about terrorism,
commercial aviation entered the new year without incident as
midnight arrived around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The major test for commercial aviation came at midnight in
London when the global air traffic control system, which observes
Greenwich Mean Time, crossed over into the new year without
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, about 1,350 commercial jets were in the air at the
time, according to the Air Transport Association, the airline
industry's trade group. That was less than half the number of
planes that flew last New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines around the world canceled thousands of flights because
of low demand.
</P>
<P>
   Eurocontrol, the organization that coordinates air traffic over
Europe, estimated that about 50 jets were in the air at midnight, 5
percent of the peak traffic on a typical winter day.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines and American Airlines, the world's two largest
carriers, said they had canceled about one-third of their flights
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, airports across the United States appeared
desolate. The three New York airports _ Kennedy International,
LaGuardia and Newark _ were expecting to handle only 270,000
passengers Friday, compared with 430,000 on the same day last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many airline executives and aviation officials around the world
had hoped to reassure the public by being passengers themselves on
New Year's Eve. Jane Garvey, chief of the Federal Aviation
Administration, booked herself on several flights that were
subsequently canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, flanked by the head of the FAA's Year 2000
effort, two public affairs officers, Sen. Slade Gorton of
Washington and a score of journalists, she boarded an American
Airlines flight from Washington to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   With 100 empty seats available on the jetliner, the only
passenger not directly connected to Ms. Garvey's efforts appeared
to be Janet S. Rhodes of Long Beach, Calif., who said she came to
Washington on Friday so that she could greet the new millennium
aloft and tell her grandchildren about it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhodes said she had told her four sons, ``Just follow Jane
Garvey's progress on television and you'll know where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's airlines and air traffic control centers spent an
estimated $2.5 billion to assure that their computers could read
the year 2000 correctly. But experts did not consider air safety to
be particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The only glitch reported Fridayoccurred when printers in Alaska,
California and Long Island that are used to relay information to
control- lers from airplanes flying over the ocean all went on the
blink at mid- night Greenwich time. The failure lasted only about
30 minutes and had no operational effect, the FAA said, adding that
it was not even clear that the problem was caused by the date
change.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co., the world's largest producer of commercial
airliners, said it surveyed thousands of airborne systems on its
planes and found only three that were date sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many passengers said they were not taking any
chances by being in the air at the witching hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will probably be OK, but I'm trying to get home
before midnight,'' said Del Turner, who was waiting for a flight at
Los Angeles International Airport. ``Something will happen. They
haven't fixed everything.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Hubbard, a television producer and broadcasting executive
and a pioneer in the medium, died on Dec. 27 in Kenwood, Calif. He
was 75 and had been suffering from Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard was vice president for programming and production at
Post-Newsweek Stations in Washington, the broadcast group of The
Washington Post, from 1969 to 1976. Before that he was the national
programming manager and executive producer of public affairs for
Group W, the Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. in New York, where he
helped to develop the Steve Allen, Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin and
Regis Philbin shows and ``P.M. East'' with Mike Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   At Westinghouse, Hubbard was responsible for programs including
``Discovery,'' a 13-part series on contemporary art produced with
the San Francisco Museum of Art; ``Black Culture,'' 65 half-hour
programs created with Morgan State University in Baltimore; and
``Children's Spectaculars,'' a series of hourlong dramatic shows
featuring Zero Mostel, Boris Karloff, Claire Bloom and others. He
also produced a variety of specials, including the Benny Goodman
show at the American pavilion at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels,
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   An advocate of educational children's fare, Hubbard worked with
local school systems and hired writers to create study guides, one
of the earliest examples of the interactive use of television in
learning. He was responsible for ``Harambee,'' the first daily
scheduled black culture-oriented program on American television,
and ``Everywoman,'' the first prime-time women's program.
</P>
<P>
   Upon retiring from Post-Newsweek, Hubbard produced ``Special
Delivery,'' five half-hour programs for children about living with
disabilities. He then established Unicorn Projects Inc., a
nonprofit production company.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard was the recipient of major broadcasting awards including
the Emmy, Dupont and George Foster Peabody Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Los Angeles, he graduated from the California College of
Arts and Crafts in Oakland in 1942 and earned a master's degree in
theater and communications from Stanford University in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marion; three sons, Bruce and
Stephen, of Pasadena, Calif., and Gregory of Wells, Maine; and two
grandchildren.

 &HT;    THIRD MILLENNIUM CELEBRATIONS CAST LIGHT ON TWO MEXICOS
 &HT;    By FRANC CONTRERAS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Special to the Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAXACA CITY, Mexico _ While most of Mexico welcomed the Third
Millennium with fireworks, concerts and long-standing traditions,
the celebration was muted in rural areas by fear of rebel attacks
and the so-called Y2K bug's negative impact on tourism.
</P>
<P>
   All across Mexico and here, in this well-known colonial city,
families joined together for traditional New Year's Eve supper and
counted down to mid-night wearing red underwear, which they believe
brings them good luck in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to three different stores today looking for red
underwear,'' said Marta Ramales. ``But all the stores were out and
I couldn't find it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   She opted for a red blouse and toasted the new millennium with
glass of strong mescal, Oaxaca's answer to tequila.
</P>
<P>
   After the toast, each of her 20 family members ate 12 grapes
each, one for every month. The tradition comes from Spain, where
the fruit is eaten also to bring good luck in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the celebrations, small business owners said Y2K began
with a drop off in tourism among international travelers,
especially from the United States. Many blamed it on fears of
possible Y2K computer troubles. For example, Mexico City airport
officials said 40 percent of flights on Dec. 31 were cancelled due
to ``mostly last-minute cancellations'' over Y2K concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, young Mexican boys here in Oaxaca City celebrated the new
millennium as they do any New Year's Eve, by tossing firecrackers
in the fiesta-filled streets. And the city planned massive
fireworks display that would take place over the colonial-era
cathedral in the city center.
</P>
<P>
   An even more festive atmosphere prevailed in streets of the
capital Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The historic Paseo de la Reforma, the city's main boulevard, was
filled with tens of thousands of revelers, coming to see parades
and live concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral bells rang in the main square, called the Zocalo,
where 300,000 people turned out for shows by Mexico's famous singer
Juan Gabriel and to hear 200 mariachis sing Las Golondrinas, a
traditional song that says good-bye to the old year.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the millennium fervor, President Ernesto Zedillo, in a
video-taped address, said, ``We are a country that does not measure
our history in months or years, but in
</P>
<P>
   millenniums.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Mexican capital, there was little talk of Y2K computer
glitches following months of claims by government officials that
Mexico is among the most Y2K-compliant nations in the hemisphere.
It has installed computer programs to prevent banking errors, and
to keep the national stock market _ the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores _
from crashing on the new year's first day of business.
</P>
<P>
   A larger concern for the government is the threat of armed
guerillas of the Popular Revolutionary Army, or EPR, in the
mountain villages of the Sierra Madre del Sur in southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed soldiers could be seen watching over villages near
Oaxaca City, thought to be rebel strongholds and stopping vehicles
at military checkpoints on the highways outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the government is bringing troops to indigenous
villages to stop the rebels,'' said Pedro Nava Rodriguez, director
of the Organization of Towns and Neighborhoods in Guerrero. ``But
they are violating the human rights of innocent people who have
nothing to do with guerilla struggles.''

   Two thousand years after Christ's obscure birth in a dusty town
in Judea, the world's 6 billion people _ most of them non-Christian
and many of them preoccupied with terrorism, computers, diets, bank
accounts, politics and the perils of the future _ rode their
turning blue planet across time's invisible line Friday and, by
common consent, looked into the dawn of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   What they saw first was a party. It was garish, glittering and
global, and millions, setting religious considerations and personal
concerns aside, joined in the festivities to celebrate the
conjunction of a new year, a new century and a new thousand-year
cycle of history. They also put aside the inconvenient fact that
the millennium, technically, is still a year off.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly mattered. In New York's Times Square and across the
United States, in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, in cities and
towns all over the world, bells pealed, crowds shrieked and surged,
skyrockets soared into the night, fireworks burst into supernovas,
``Auld Lang Syne'' rang out, lights pulsed, loved ones and friends
embraced, and the music and Champagne flowed.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when moods ran the spectrum from tensions and prayers
to euphoria and irresistible hyperbole, what most were calling
Christianity's Third Millennium arrived in 24 stages as the earth
revolved through the time zones and midnight elapsed again and
again in an around-the-clock, around-the-world series of golden
moments that began at the International Dateline in the Pacific and
raced westward across Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a vast crowd of revelers _ the guesses ran as high
2 million _ packed Times Square and much of Midtown Manhattan for
the biggest public event ever held in the city _ a 26-hour, $7
million marathon of music, fireworks, confetti and deafening voices
culminating as a 1,070-pound crystal ball descended at midnight,
while the police sweated out an enormous potential for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And there were lavish celebrations in Washington, London, Paris,
Rome, Berlin, Jerusalem, Moscow, Cape Town, New Delhi, Shanghai,
Beijing, Tokyo, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires and
hundreds of other cities. There were parties, concerts, dances,
torchlight parades and televised extravaganzas that brought the
worldwide show to billions more at home and to the crowds in Times
Square over giant video screens _ a case of celebrators watching
celebrators.

   To a Martian earthwatcher (tuning in with delicate ear and
Cycloptic eye), it might have appeared that the inhabitants of the
third world from the Sun had suddenly lost their senses or gone to
war again. But it was only humanity on the threshold of a new age,
exercising its primal urge to celebrate.

   There had been an avalanche of happy millennial overkill in
recent days _ claims of the last-game, last-meal, first-baby kind _
and Friday it was the turn of world leaders in government,
religion, science and other fields, who spoke of the millennium's
meaning in more serious tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we celebrate more than the changing of the calendar,''
President Clinton, extending millennium greetings to the world,
said in an address to diplomats and children from 100 nations. ``We
celebrate the opportunity we have to make this a true changing of
the times, a gateway to greater peace and freedom, to prosperity
and harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Boris Yeltsin, who has been plagued with heart and
other problems for most of his eight years as Russia's president,
unexpectedly announced his resignation. ``Russia must enter the new
millennium with new politicians, new faces, new intelligent, strong
and energetic people,'' he said. ``And we who have been in power
for many years must go.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II, fulfilling his dream to lead
the Roman Catholic Church across the threshold of 2000, gave his
blessing to a vast crowd in St. Peter's Square, reiterated his
calls for an end to war and poverty, and thanked God for ``the
events of this year, this century and this millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   There were millions around the world who had no reason to be
festive, people like Tom Nganga, 40, who lives in Kangemi, a vast
slum of Nairobi, Kenya. ``We as Kenyans and people of Kangemi are
very, very angry as we celebrate this millennium,'' he said.
``People are very poor. People have nothing to eat. We have nothing
to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   While the millennium celebrations drew millions, there were
relatively few casualties. In the Philippines, two people were
killed by stray gunfire and a 5-year-old boy died after a
firecracker exploded in his face. At least 200 other Filipinos were
injured by fireworks. In Paris, 70 people were hurt in crowds.
</P>
<P>
   After years of concern over Y2K computer problems that had cost
billions of dollars to fix, there were no immediate reports of
computer-related disasters anywhere in the world _ no plane
crashes, major power failures, nuclear plant shutdowns or collapses
of banking, business, government or health care systems.
</P>
<P>
   But elevators, intercity trains and subways in many American
cities and in other countries as well were halted briefly over the
witching hour, and some airlines canceled flights for the day, just
to be safe. Many airports were all but deserted, with wary
travelers staying put. Experts said it might take days for some
computer problems to develop, in part because many businesses and
government agencies were closed for the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There had also been fears that terrorists, publicity seekers or
the insane might set off explosions or mount chemical or biological
attacks as millions gathered to celebrate, while vast audiences
watched on television. No specific threats had been reported,
although some suspects had been seized recently. Still, there were
no immediate reports of trouble, and law enforcement authorities
seemed ready for almost anything.

<P>
   The millennium, an idea with overtones ranging from Biblical to
commercial, had swelled recently into a coercive miniculture as the
countdown ticked away and a flood of books, articles, television
specials and studied commentaries by academic, political and
religious leaders reflected upon the last thousand years of human
achievements and missteps, and speculated on the next thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Purists still insist that the millennium will not start until
Jan. 1, 2001, and they are no doubt right. The calendar, at best,
is arbitrary. There were problems from ancient times based on
inaccuracies in measuring the year's duration and its uneven
division into days, weeks and months. By 1582, the spring equinox
was 10 days early, and the days were dropped when the Gregorian
Calendar replaced the old Julian version. While Pope Gregory's
calendar uses the birth of Christ in 1 B.C., as a starting date,
many scholars now suggest that the year was probably closer to 4
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, as Voltaire noted, history is the lie that
historians agree upon, and the tide of popular opinion has swept
nearly everyone along. And with the climax of celebrations, and
especially when the nines rolled into zeros at midnight and
humanity went ballistic, purists' talk of technicalities was the
last thing anyone wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   For doomsayers who had prophecied conflagrations, earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions and other end-of-the-world scenarios (and kept a
weather eye out for UFO rescue ships), the new millennium was
something of a nonevent, although the anxiety prompted by all the
wild predictions of chaos was real enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Book of Revelations, Chapter 20, speaks of a resurrection of
the dead and a judgment day, of sinners cast into a lake of fire
and Christ reigning for a thousand years. But if it was not the
Second Coming of Jesus as foretold in the Bible, there was still a
year to go, or this was the wrong millennium.
</P>
<P>
   And if, as some said, even the idea of a Third Christian
Millennium was a Western conceit in a world where Christians are a
minority, and one that overlooked other calendars calling this 1420
(Muslim) or 5760 (Jewish), it was also true that the world had long
ago come by economic and social necessity to agree upon the Western
calendar for trade, travel and other common purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium, if nothing else, was a celebration of history,
marking human survival after a deadly century of wars, genocide and
revolution that saw the end of colonialism, fascism and communism,
as well as the achievements of the past thousand years _ printing
and widespread literacy; the exploration of the last frontiers on
earth; the first ventures into outer space, the inner mind and the
microscopic universe, and the flowering of democratic government,
and of art, literature, science, technology and communications into
undreamed eminences.
</P>
<P>
   The world on this Millennium Day was still beset with terrible
problems _ with grinding poverty that afflicted a third of its 6
billion inhabitants, with ethnic and national strife, with the
continuing curse of racial and religious bigotries, and with the
exclusion of countless millions from adequate health care,
education, jobs and even such basic needs as shelter and clean
water, not to mention freedoms of speech and political association.
</P>
<P>
   But with a few exceptions _ notably threats of terrorism and
limited wars in the Balkans, Chechnya and other regions _ it was a
world largely at peace, with the apocalyptic threat of nuclear
annihilation receding and new understandings growing between old
enemies in the Middle East, Ireland, South Africa and other
long-troubled areas.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a world on the threshold of a new era _ one that
offered visions of astounding strides in science and technology and
seemed to hold out anew the ancient promises of universal peace and
prosperity, although the only certainty seemed to be that the world
a thousand years from now would be unrecognizable.

   As Dec. 31, 1999, gave way to Jan. 1, 2000, in each time zone at
midnight, with atomic clocks marking it to a millisecond,
celebrants went ecstatic. It began in Fiji and the Kiribati and
Marshall Islands in the Western Pacific (it was 7 a.m., EST Friday)
and moved westward, hour by hour, as the earth turned and 23 more
midnights fell across Australia, Asia, Europe, Africa, the Americas
and back across the Pacific, ending in Samoa at 6 a.m., EST
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders in Kiribati welcomed the millennium with the mournful
sounds of a conch shell and with traditional chants and dancing on
the beach of a normally uninhabited coral atoll, dubbed Millennium
Island.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, which has absorbed many of the trappings of the
Western world while preserving its own cultural and religious
traditions, bells tolled in a Buddhist ritual to dispel evils as
thousands flocked to temples and shrines. In Tokyo, the first of
the world's major cities to mark the new year, people went to
parties and crowds swarmed to bayside events, including rock
concerts and lavish fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   In China, torchbearers in Imperial-era costumes lighted signal
fires on the watch towers of the Great Wall, which snakes 3,000
miles from the Gobi Desert to the North China Sea, and President
Jiang Zemin lighted an eternal flame to greet the new millennium
and pledged a ``great rejuvenation'' by reuniting with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Over Hong Kong Harbor there were brilliant fireworks displays,
and parties abounded, a prelude to the Chinese new year, the Year
of the Dragon, which starts Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The festivities for most of India's 1 billion people were muted
by comparison with those in wealthier nations, but hundreds of
thousands danced, drank and ate at open-air stalls in New Delhi and
partygoers were out in force in other major cities, celebrating the
peaceful end of an eight-day hostage crisis aboard an Indian
Airlines hours before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Iran and its Persian Gulf neighbors largely ignored the new
millennium, which fell during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a
time for prayer and reflection.
</P>
<P>
   With religious bans on celebrations that might desecrate holy
days, the celebrations in Israel were relatively subdued. In
Palestinian-governed Bethlehem, the town revered by Christians as
the birthplace of Jesus, 2,000 doves were released at midnight on
Manger Square, and in secular Tel Aviv thousands just went to the
beach to watch the sun set over the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Security was heavy in Israel as three religions and some
doomsday cultists marked the occasion, each in its own way. It was
especially tight on Jerusalem's Mount of Olives, where Christian
fundamentalists had camped to witness the end of the world, and at
the Old City's Temple Mount, with sites sacred to Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   On the last New Year's Eve of the Christian millennium,
observant Jews ushered in the sabbath, as they do every Friday, and
many went to pray at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site,
while 400,000 Muslims flocked to the al-Aqsa Mosque on Temple Mount
to mark the last Friday of prayer and fasting in the holy month of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, with new lighting on buildings, boulevards and bridges
over the Seine twinkling like the bonfires of a great Medieval
encampment, people packed the Champs-Elysees from the Tuileries to
the Arc de Triomphe as a digital clock at the Eiffel Tower counted
down _ overcoming an old-fashioned glitch that shut it down five
hours before midnight _ and announced the millennium in a burst of
20,000 electronic flashes.
</P>
<P>
   In London, 2 million people lined the Thames for a spectacular
fireworks show, as Queen Elizabeth, Prime Minister Tony Blair and
other dignitaries gathered under the 20-acre Millennium Dome, a
flying-saucer-like colossus at Longitude Zero in Greenwich, to mark
the transition while the bells of St. Paul's and Westminster and
churches across Britain pealed. Huge street parties were held in
hundreds of Britain's cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, floodlights, lasers and fireworks illuminated the
ancient pyramids at Giza and electronic music reverberated over the
desert as 50,000 people wined and dined in luxury tents and watched
a sparkling millennium show under the watchful eyes of police
officers on camels.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, there were torchlight parades in the streets of
Stockholm; fireworks and singing by massed choirs in Reykjavik,
Iceland; concerts and a ball at the opera house in Tallinn,
Estonia; and a Millennium Ball at the Catherine Palace in St.
Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Atlantic, in Rio de Janeiro, 3 million Brazilians,
many of them dressed in festive white, jammed the three-mile
Copacabana beach to hear lively samba bands and toss white flowers
and perfume into the waves as gifts for Yemanja, the Yoruba goddess
of the sea. Police estimated that a record 5 million people
converged on Rio de Janeiro's coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's easternmost province of Newfoundland entered the New
Year an hour and a half ahead of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, huge festivities were held on the
Washington Mall, and in New Orleans, Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles,
Boston, San Francisco and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the millennial crowds, countless people marked the
occasion quietly by attending concerts or dances or by going to
restaurants or private dinner parties, while millions more watched
on television safely at home with friends and families, taking in
the shows around the world in live planetary tableaux that might
have been imagined a century ago only by Jules Verne dreamers.
</P>
<P>
   Some people paid small fortunes to ring in the millennium in
exotic places _ on the summit of Mt. Everest, at the base of the
Great Pyramid at Giza in Egypt, aboard a cruise ship in the South
Seas, or on an around-the-world supersonic flight chasing midnight
through the time zones.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, it was a day to remember. The centerpiece was the
spectacle billed as ``Times Square 2000: the Global Celebration at
the Crossroads of the World.'' Worried authorities had closed 50
blocks of midtown to traffic, banned alcohol in open containers and
flooded the area with 8,000 officers just in case. All vehicles
were towed away as a precaution against car bombs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Throughout the city, all 37,000 police officers were on duty,
and there was plenty for them to do. The Times Square celebration
was only one of 329 public events in the city, the biggest of them
at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn, at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration in Times Square went off as planned with
all-day, all-night pulsing music and cacophonous entertainments by
1,000 musicians, actors, dancers, puppeteers and other performers
working from a stage on Seventh Avenue between 45th and 46th
Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway, curving like a dancer's leg, was packed from 42rd
Street to Central Park, along with most of the sidestreets between
the Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue. The old wickedness of
Times Square was missing, but for most in the crowd it was an
adventure just to be caught, shoulder to shoulder, jostling for
happiness at the intersection of past and future.
</P>
<P>
   The party ran all day and all night, from 6 a.m. Friday to 8
a.m. Saturday, and thousands showed up early to stake claims near
ground zero. By the time the sun went down, the crowds were already
gigantic. They came in shoals from the suburbs, from across the
nation and from countless places abroad, and they swept into the
vast clogged carnival, determined to experience the exotic and
illusory evening.
</P>
<P>
   They were in a euphoric mood, capped and scarved and padded like
armadillos against the cold. They watched twilight print the sky
with darkness, and the blue night city come to life, glittering
like a tiara. By midevening, much of midtown was seized up in human
gridlock. Laser lights slid up the skyscrapers and washed over the
writhing mass of Lilliputian figures below.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds were squeezed into police-barrier pens to create
lanes for emergency vehicles, and many had to watch events on giant
video screens. The closer to One Times Square, where the ball
descended, the more bleary the crowd looked, many having stood
their ground for a day and a half. A stench arose from a layer of
garbage underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of celebrants watching others celebrate was
continued on a global scale. Live video feeds from festivities
around the world were pumped into Times Square, and the scenes
there were beamed by 45 networks out to a worldwide audience of 1
billion people or more.
</P>
<P>
   It was all perfect for television _ the images clear and
colorful, reducing everything, even the millennium, to
entertainment. There were no distracting speeches by dignitaries
striking the just-right crystal phrases; indeed, the program _
including an international pageant that, hour by hour, reflected
the countries where midnight was then occurring _ was deliberately
languageless.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, was perfect for this crowd, which seemed preoccupied
with itself: people taking pictures of each other, fussing with
food, gawking at the neon forest, looking for Peter Jennings, and
paying little attention to the pageant of Japanese yogi-bushi
umbrellas, Sri Lankan monk chants, Russian ballerinas, Kenyan war
dancers, Argentine rainforest butterfly puppets and Lakota Sioux in
face paint.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd got into the spirit of things, screaming numbers
as the final seconds of the failing millennium were counted down.
The tensions that had been building for weeks reached a climax, and
there was an inescapable sense of a great public moment at hand,
one that most generations could never experience.
</P>
<P>
   On center stage, the buckram face of Mayor Giuliani, proud as a
drum major, stood at the controls of the descending ball with Dr.
Mary Ann Hopkins, 36, who was being honored for her work in
war-torn countries as a volunteer in Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   And when midnight struck, the roar was deafening: a din of
horns, amplified music and countless voices shrieking at the edge
of madness. In the chaos, lasers zoomed, flashbulbs sparkled, a
blizzard of confetti and streamers and balloons filled the air, and
in the distance a blinding dazzle of fireworks exploded.
</P>
<P>
   They sang, ``Auld Lang Syne,'' and the joyous screams and
congratulatory embraces went on and on. The fireworks, too, went on
and on _ over the East River off South Street Seaport, in Central
Park, in Brooklyn's Prospect Park _ the biggest pyrotechnic display
in history _ a booming, sparkling, scintillating barrage of rockets
and sunbursts that bathed the awed faces in eerie light and echoed
off the facades of a city that seemed to exist only in the
imagination.

PARADE CAMPERS UNDETERRED

<P>
   PASADENA _ Rain and chilly weather didn't keep thousands of
paradegoers from camping out Friday night for the 111th Tournament
of Roses.
</P>
<P>
   Spirits were high among the street party crowd as they set up
for curbside seats for today's parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to party all night,'' said Tyne Gaudielle, 15, of
Glendale, who spent the last night of the year along Colorado
Boulevard with a group of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they came for the partying or the parade, campers were
in for a long night. Rain continued into the evening and
temperatures were expected to dip down into the low 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain can't stop you from having fun,'' said Terry Teague, 29,
of Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   The parade will begin at 8 a.m. and includes 54 floats, 25
marching bands, 26 equestrian units and three dignitary units.
</P>
<P>
   By today, meteorologists said the sun would be out with high
temperatures in the mid 60s. History was on the side of a dry
parade as it hasn't rained on the parade in 45 years and only nine
times in 111 years.
</P>
<P>
   Paradegoers took refuge in any way they could. Some set up
tents. Others crammed in doorways and under awnings. Many pulled
their tarps over their sleeping bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is uncomfortable but it's not unbearable,'' said Ron
Pangrac, 40, of San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Belmonte took refuge from the rain in a shop doorway
with her family. The clan has spent New Year's Eve on Colorado
Boulevard for the past seven years. Belmonte, 23, of Montebello
enjoys the parade and the rowdiness the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may sleep an hour or two but that's it,'' she said.
``There are too many distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   Most paradegoers said they don't mind missing the sleep. That's
what New Year's Day is for, some said. They prefer to people watch,
make friends, play board games and chat with family members.
</P>
<P>
   Many who said they usually stayed home New Year's Eve decided to
spend the night on the street in an effort to make the last night
of the millennium a memorable one.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Angelucci of Westwood hadn't camped out for the Rose Parade
since he was a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a must because of the millennium. It's 2000,'' said
Angelucci, 31. ``I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Rodney A. Hilpert has traveled to Pasadena from
Northern California with a youth group from his church for the past
15 years. Hilpert brings dozens of young people to help decorate
floats and spend the night along the parade route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else would you like to gather with 3 million of your
closest friends?'' said Hilpert, 53, of Placerville, Calif. ``I
wouldn't want to be anywhere else on New Year's Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Carol Hernandez brought her family from
Temecula, Calif., to camp out and watch the parade. Because of the
cold and rain, the family camped in shifts Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the millennium,'' said Hernandez, 39. ``We didn't want to
say when people asked us, where did you celebrate the millennium?,
that we were at home. We wanted to do something special.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although it had seen many huge crowds over the
years, for inaugurations, Fourth of July fireworks, protests and
parades, never in memory had the Mall in the nation's capital drawn
multitudes for New Year's. But on this mild winter night with a
lovely sunset, &UR;  &LR; hundreds of thousands of people here thronged to
the Mall for a long-planned celebration on the last New Year's Eve
of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very friendly crowd,'' Sgt. Frank R. Onolfi of the
U.S.Park Police said as afternoon turned to evening. But by shortly
after 10 p.m., there were so many people trying to get close to the
Lin- coln Memorial, the focal point of the observ- ances where
President Clinton was about to speak, that sections of temporary
fencing were pushed down along Constitution Ave- nue. Multitudes
stormed through the gaps instead of being funneled through several
security points, where the police had been checking for alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers saw that the throngs could not be repulsed
without the risk of serious injury or disorder, so they let the
people come through. Another line of fences stopped them close to
the reflecting pool, and the police said order was soon restored.
No serious injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the evening, it was clear that the crowd was befitting
of a cosmopolitan city and a changing America. The celebration drew
people of different languages and ac- cents, from other countries,
from all over the United States and from Washington it- self.
People who live in the District tend to be blase about motorcades
and potentates and ceremonies, but many Washingtonians thought
Friday night's event was something they could not miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally stay home on New Year's, but we had to see the
millennium celebration,'' Thea Anderson said. She and her husband,
Clarence, who have lived in the District for 27 years, were at
first a little nervous about venturing out, given the talk of
danger, however remote. But in the end, they took the Metro
downtown and were glad they did.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick and Jane Wilson of Greenville, S.C., arrived Friday
morning, early enough to get close to President Clinton at an event
before midday. Mrs. Wilson was delighted to get pictures of the
president, and the couple were pleased with the crowd-control
measures, which they found efficient without being oppressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is so laid-back,'' Mrs. Wilson said. ``There's no
pushing or shoving.''
</P>
<P>
   The events of Friday made the Wilsons feel at home again, in a
sense. They were out of the country for several years _ she travels
a lot for business _ and their return has not been altogether
pleasant. They said they had noticed heightened suspicions at
airports and other gathering places, and she has had to explain why
she has been to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Many people at the Mall Friday night wore party hats. One
merchandise tent offered ``millennium celebration'' certificates.
An entrepreneur hawked T-shirts labeled, ``I survived Y2K.'' The
going rate was $5.
</P>
<P>
   For a relative few, the evening called for tuxedos and formal
gowns _ proper attire for the White House Millennium Dinner, where
the first family greeted guests before leaving for fireworks
festivities on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Joggers threaded their way nonchalantly through the Mall
celebrators. There was lots of room, the Mall being one of the
jewels that make this a pedestrian-friendly city.
</P>
<P>
   For all the anticipation, some people were just not getting it.
Connie Liang brought her children _ one 18-months-old, the other
3-years-old. ``My children are too young to remember this,'' she
said, ``but at least they will be able to say they were here.''

HOW MANY COULD THEORETICALLY FIT IN TIMES SQUARE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Half a million? A million? A zillion? The world will
never know how many humans squeezed their way into the Designated
Watching Zones around Times Square to see the ball drop, but it is
not impossible to estimate how many people could have been there.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, this calculation includes only the areas from
Times Square north _ where people at least theoretically could see
the top of  &QC; 1 Times Square _ and does not include those watching
from skyscraper windows or peering at video screens along side
streets. Or simply partying somewhere in the vicinity of
mid-Manhattan. In the enthusiastic run-up to the celebration,
overall estimates were running as high as 2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here's the math:
</P>
<P>
   According to practitioners of the inexact science of crowd size
estimation, an average standing person will fit in a square about
17 inches on each side, or about 2 square feet. According to the
official plan, the city was only allowing spectators into pens that
took up about half of the pavement area along each block of
Broadway and Seventh Avenue, between 42nd Street and 59th Street.
</P>
<P>
   But to take the most-crowded-case scenario, assume that every
inch of pavement along Broadway and Seventh, as well as a few feet
of each side street, was filled with people.
</P>
<P>
   A typical block of Seventh Avenue around Times Square is 265
feet long and 60 feet wide, for a total of about 15,900 square feet
_ enough room for 7,950 people. A typical block of Broadway is a
bit longer _ about 275 feet, enough space for 8,250 people.
</P>
<P>
   Adding up all the blocks of Broadway and Seventh Avenue between
42nd Street and Central Park South, including the trapezoid where
Broadway and Seventh intersect, and figuring 20 feet or so of
cushion on each side street, the total capacity of the viewing area
is, approximately, 300,538.5 people.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the happiest aspects of the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater winter season, which ends Sunday, has been
the performing.
</P>
<P>
   Burnished to a glow by Judith Jamison and Masazumi Chaya,
longtime former Ailey dancers who are now, respectively, the
troupe's artistic director and associate artistic director, the
performers' high technical level and individuality were seen to
their best advantage in Hans van Manen's ``Polish Pieces'' on
Wednesday afternoon at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, choreographed in 1995 and set to a driving score by
Gorecki, has 12 dancers crossing and recrossing the stage in
staggered lines and layered small groups. Three brief duets are
embedded in the flow of the dance, which ends with odd abruptness.
Kevin E. Boseman and Stephanie Powell were the playful,
space-gobbling young lovers of the first duet. The two that
followed were much more emotionally charged.
</P>
<P>
   Bahiyah Sayyed and Glenn A. Sims seemed to burn the air around
them as the lovers of the second duet, she desperate,
crooked-limbed and clinging to his resolutely passive body. There
is a hint of resolution in the nobler third duet, danced with just
the right clarity and heroism by Uri Sands and Linda Caceres.
</P>
<P>
   Staged by Mea Venana, ``Polish Pieces'' was greatly enhanced by
Keso Dekker's jewel-colored unitards and Joop Caboort's strong but
unobtrusive lighting. The elegant cast was completed by Asha
Thomas, Troy O'Neil Powell, Cheryl Ann Rowley, Amos J. Machanic
Jr., Briana Reed and Askia Swift.
</P>
<P>
   Ulysses Dove's ``Episodes'' might have looked better had it not
followed Powell's bittersweet ``Ascension,'' a subtler jazz dance
to similarly propulsive music. Nine faceless dancers stride, dash
and slide across a variety of white-lighted diagonals on the dark
stage, the women tossing their long hair and pausing to slug the
men or leap into their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it all comes to seem like a postmodernist version of
Jerome Robbins' ``Cage,'' a ballet about male-killing females. That
impression was heightened by the chill evil projected by Lynn
Barre, in a hard-dancing cast completed by Ms. Caceres, Ms. Thomas,
Sims, Benoit-Swan Pouffer, Kristofer Storey, Jeffrey Gerodias and
Swift.
</P>
<P>
   The program was completed by Ailey's ``Revelations.''

IN HONG KONG, MANY MARK THE MILLENNIUM AT THE RACE TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (UPDATES 3rd graf with information on purse; CORRECTS 4th graf with
Floral Joy not being one of the favorites) 
(bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ How do you mark the passage of 1,000 years of human
history? Simple, in this city of chronic gamblers and cold-eyed
oddsmakers: You head for the track.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:45 a.m., as the last wisps of smoke from New Year's Eve
fireworks drifted away from the Happy Valley Racecourse, the crack
of a starter's gun set off the Millennium Cup. The Hong Kong Jockey
Club billed it as the first horse race of the 2000s, though rumors
swirled that it may have been edged out for first-in-the-world
status by post-midnight races in New Zealand and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Floral Joy won $110,000 from a total purse worth $200,000. It
was a good prize, but not extraordinary for a jockey club that
gener- ates more than $10 billion a season in bet- ting.
</P>
<P>
   Such details did not dampen the spirits of more than 50,000
people who cheered wildly as Floral Joy streaked across the line
several lengths ahead of the next horse.
</P>
<P>
   If a horse-race seems an offhand way to celebrate the ultimate
New Year's Eve, remember that strictly speaking, the new year does
not even arrive here until February 5, when Hong Kong and the rest
of the Chinese-speaking world will welcome the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Hong Kong was celebrating someone else's
holiday, it threw quite a party. The city mounted a splashy
fireworks display at Happy Valley. At the stroke of midnight,
fireballs placed at 175-foot intervals around the track erupted
into a fountain of flames. An enormous illuminated dragon, which
the organizers described as the largest-ever, held court in the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   For some Hong Kong residents, gambling seemed the only way to
celebrate the millennium. ``This is the perfect atmosphere for
racing,'' said Wilson Chan, a local businessman who lost money on
the first seven races of the evening, but was sure he would win it
all back on the main event.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Cheng, a popular local radio-show host, said horse racing
symbolized stability in this former British colony, which reverted
to Chinese rule two years ago. ``Deng Xiaoping promised us that the
dancing would go on and the races would go on after the handover,''
Cheng said, paraphrasing a now-legendary remark by the Chinese
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Cup capped an evening of festivities that also
featured performances by several of Hong Kong's biggest film and
pop stars, including Jackie Chan, Chow Yun Fat, and Michelle Yeoh.
Chan served as the clown prince of the evening _ singing, dancing,
and mugging with all the cheerful exuberance he brings to roughing
up bad guys in films like ``Rumble in the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Of less interest to the star-crazed audience, Hong Kong Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa led a countdown of the final seconds of
1999. Tung then slipped away for the Hong Kong Convention Center,
where he caught a New Year's Eve concert by Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Houston performed at one of the evening's hot tickets _ a
dusk-to-dawn millennium party hosted by Richard Li, the son of Hong
Kong billionaire, Li Ka-shing. The younger Li only decided to throw
the bash a month ago, and his organizers had worked frantically
around-the-clock to book marquee performers and ready a dinner for
1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Across Victoria Harbor, the Regent Hotel vied for the status of
gaudiest party. At midnight, nearly 3,000 guests gazed out of the
hotel's floor-to-ceiling windows toward Hong Kong island, where the
already dramatic skyline had been transformed in a dizzying light
show. Brilliant hundred-foot, lighted dragons wrapped themselves
around buildings, while the numerals 2,000 flashed on several
skyscrapers.

'00 COMPUTER GLITCHES ARE MOSTLY A NO-SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (UPDATES 2nd and 3rd graf with details of minor problems) 
 (nk) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a few sputters and glitches, the world's computers
appear to have survived the Year 2000 rollover without major
problems _ and with humanity's faith in technology intact, at least
for another day.
</P>
<P>
   As clocks passed midnight around the world, there were a flurry
of reports of apparently minor prob- lems: a timing device at a
electric plant in Wisconsin jumped ahead 35 days, but it was
quickly reset; a monitoring system at a Japanese nuclear plant
malfunctioned, but it did not affect the operation of the reactor;
in Australia, ticketing ma- chines on some buses jammed.
</P>
<P>
   The technology failures with L greater impact were a result of
crowding _ circuits jammed when too many people tried to make
cellu- lar phone calls in Japan, New Zea- land and elsewhere _
instead of computer software that could not fathom the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the day arrived without the kind of catastrophic problems
once feared, like widespread power failures or planes crashing. The
computers of the U.S. power grid and air-traffic control system
rolled over to the New Year just past 7 p.m. Eastern time, which is
midnight Greenwich Mean Time, and things went without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt there was any significant chance the United
States would have any problem in its infrastructure,'' said John A.
Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion. But he cautioned against complacency in the United
States and around the world. ``There are likely to be some glitches
along the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The real test, experts say, will come in the days and weeks
ahead as people return to work, as factories, offices and stores
begin normal operations. ``To look at midnight as the main event
would be a mistake,'' said David Cassano, general manager of IBM's
Year 2000 program. ``We'll really start to find out where we stand
in the first weeks of January as businesses run their systems for
the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, expectations about the severity of the Year 2000 problem
have been scaled back sharply in recent months. The prospect of
computer failures cascading destructively across the world economy
was taken as a serious threat not long ago. But most analysts now
regard such warnings as exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, computer specialists are now watching mainly for a rash
of small, but fixable, glitches in computer programs related to the
Year 2000 problem. These problems, most analysts say, should amount
to an economic headache, not a serious illness _ though there are a
few analysts who say that a recession early this year is still
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet around the world, fears about Y2K, as the computer problem
is known, were the exception. As he withdrew a few hundred dollars
from an automated teller machine in Rome on Friday, Federico
Pacifici, 44, said: ``I have faith in technology. I don't think
normal people will have any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the reaction was not quite so relaxed, but there was
no evidence of Year 2000 panic. Strolling through Tokyo's Ginza
district last night, Masao Ito, 66, observed, ``I was a bit worried
about Y2K, but I didn't think it would be a lasting problem, so I
wasn't terribly concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese are accustomed to stockpiling basic goods as a
precaution against earthquakes, and the government had recommended
that citizens have extra goods on hand in case of Year 2000
breakdowns. Masato Takahashi, a student, said he had put away
enough water and food for a week. ``I'm not expecting anything
major,'' he said. ``I just thought there might be some problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the isolated cases of panicky reactions, the explanation
seemed more cultural than technological. In rural Thailand, for
example, the government said farmers and villagers had been
withdrawing cash from banks and clearing out food markets because
of Year 2000 fears. ``It doesn't make sense,'' said Kitti
Patpongpaibul, deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand. ``Almost
none of these people own credit cards or computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Astrologers in the Thai countryside have apparently been
spreading dire Year 2000 predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, the more common sentiment seemed to be that of
Spaniards. Surveys have found that Spaniards are largely
unconcerned by the computer problem, known as ``Effecto 2000'' in
Spain, and 90 percent said they had made no special preparations.
``There's been no panic buying here,'' said Carlos Lizana, the
manager of a Supersol supermarket in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   If the economic fallout is minimal from the Year 2000 problem,
it will be largely because many governments and corporations
eventually listened to the dire warnings of Year 2000 readiness
advocates. And they invested more than $250 billion worldwide in
finding and fixing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government alone spent $8.4 billion to fix the glitches
in the computers that handle everything from sending out Social
Security checks to tracking airplanes with the Federal Aviation
Administration's air-traffic control system. The government's
efforts accelerated sharply after Koskinen became the head of the
administration's Year 2000 program in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Companies may have been slow to start _ an estimated 90 percent
of corporate fix-it spending has occurred since 1997 _ but once
they began they invested heavily to tackle their Year 2000
problems. Citigroup, for example, spent roughly $950 million to get
its banks, securities trading desks and insurance operations ready
for the Year 2000 rollover.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been massive investments made to address the Y2K
issue and those investments will mean that the most severe problems
should be avoided,'' said Lou Marcoccio, the Year 2000 research
director for the Gartner Group, a computer consulting and market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem has proved so costly to try to fix because
it has been a painstaking task for thousands of people worldwide,
searching through billions of lines of programming code, much of it
decades old. The problem dates back to before the 1960s. Back then,
storage space on disks was scarce and costly, so programmers
routinely omitted the first two digits in year dates. The danger is
that computers will fail to interpret the ``00'' date as 2000, and
shut off or malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-Y2K-ROUNDUP-2NDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
UNDATED: or malfunction. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, the Year 2000 rollover has meant that much of
the computer industry is on around-the-clock duty, watching for
problems and ready to fix ones that do crop up. It was a quiet
watch Friday.
</P>
<P>
   From her desk in Hewlett-Packard's Year 2000 center in Palo
Alto, Calif., Kathy Hahn filed her first status report at 3:45 a.m.
Like the reports she filed afterward, it was a green light: The
company's field office in Auckland, New Zealand, reported that
there were no apparent problems plaguing the company's computer
systems at night.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Hahn, director of Hewlett-Packard's Year 2000 planning,
Friday's lack of problems were a rewarding finish to nearly three
years of hard work in preparation. ``It feels like I've been
pregnant for two and a half years,'' she said. ``I'm feeling a
great sense of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, a leading Wall Street economist, said it was
much too early to relax about the Year 2000 problem. Yet even he is
revising his earlier dark warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, Yardeni warned that the computer problem
could be the catalyst for a recession as severe as the 1974-75
downturn in the aftermath of the first oil shock. But he has done
some rethinking recently. ``It's certainly not going to be as bad
as I thought it would be,'' said Yardeni, chief economist of
Deutsche Bank Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni still thinks it is likely there will be a recession in
the first half of 2000 but says it will be a brief, shallow
economic dip.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts do not go that far, but they caution against
being too encouraged by the first-day reports. ``The real test is
coming in the days and weeks ahead, and I think there is a good
chance the world's going to have a digital hangover for the three
to six months,'' said Gary Beach, publisher of CIO Magazine, who
has testified before Congress on the Year 2000 issue.

 `SURVIVALISTS LITE' READY FOR POTENTIAL POST-Y2K WOES  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Don't call Jim and Susan Smith survivalists.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you don't even have to call them Jim and Susan _ those
aren't their real names.
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, they don't want their real names used. They have a
good thing _ a secure thing _ going, and they'd just as soon not
publicize it.
</P>
<P>
   They're not digging bomb shelters and running around in
camouflage. The whole idea of locked-and-loaded Uzis and concertina
wire festooned around the perimeter and hundreds of cases of pork
and beans in the bunker gives them the creeps.
</P>
<P>
   But they do intend to survive, should things get ugly in the
aftermath of Y2K. Call them, perhaps, Survivalists Lite.
</P>
<P>
   They'd prefer another term: subsistence farmers. After all, they
live in a wholly self-sufficient manner on a remote west Marin
County ridgetop, not far from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The steep, narrow road to their 60-acre farm is protected by a
locked gate. They grow all their own food, and their water is piped
from a spring and two wells. They heat with wood harvested from
trees grown on their property.
</P>
<P>
   They've also just completed a photovoltaic and wind system that
will keep their farm supplied with electricity, even if the
national power grid collapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got it finished just in time, and it works beautifully,''
said Susan Friday afternoon. ``We're having a glass of champagne
with our solar engineer to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if the oil refineries shut down, they'll still be able
to farm their three acres of hillside cropland. They keep two big
draft horses on their spread, and they own a variety of horse-drawn
plows and cultivators.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths farm for both the home larder and the market _ and it
isn't easy. When they bought their hillside holding 20 years ago,
the soil was thin and poor. They have spent the intervening years
assiduously building it up with compost and ``green manures'' _
plowed-under legumes and grasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken a lot of work,'' sighed Susan as she watched her
husband turn over ground for a raspberry patch with a walking
tractor, a kind of ultrapowerful diesel rototiller. ``And it's
still a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths also raise sheep, chickens and turkeys. All their
produce is grown organically. For the marketplace, they concentrate
on garlic and raspberries, crops that provide a fairly high yield
and generally decent price for their labor. Their vegetables come
from a large garden that's still providing some tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unusual even for this part of Marin,'' she said. ``The
temperatures are generally higher up on the ridgetops than in the
valleys during the winter, but things are even warmer than usual
this year. From a farmer's point of view, it's kind of scary. If
our raspberries don't go dormant, they won't produce any fruit next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths take Y2K seriously and haven't been at all assured by
government and corporate assurances that everything's going to be
hunky-dory, a few minor glitches notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people realize the food security in this country
is nil,'' said Susan. ``If Y2K doesn't cause shortages, I'm still
convinced we'll see them within 10 years. We've given over our food
supply to the industrial model, and we've lost our control, our
health and our connection to the land as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths planned to spend New Year's Eve entertaining some
friends with drinks and a homegrown dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have between 12 and 20 people here, depending on who
floats through,'' said Susan.
</P>
<P>
   From their ridgetop perspective, it seemed unlikely that the new
millennium will shape up much differently than the old one. As
midnight approached, the wind still soughed through the trees, and
the owls still hooted.
</P>
<P>
   There was no talk of manning the ramparts in preparation for the
coming chaos. Armed defense wasn't in the game plan. They don't own
an arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of shotguns, and that's about it,'' observed Jim.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly enough to deter ravening hordes from the city. But
they think _ hope, at least _ their isolation and self-sufficiency
will give them all the protection they need.
</P>
<P>
   While the Smiths felt ready for Y2K, they're not at all sure
about the rest of us. Particularly those of us who work with big,
potentially dangerous chunks of industrial infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the 460 nuclear reactors in the world aren't Y2K
compliant,'' Susan said, ``and simply taking them offline may not
be enough. A plant still needs power to keep coolant over the core
to prevent radiation release. We really don't know the state of
their backup generator systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths have focused most of their Y2K preparations on their
farm, but that isn't necessarily how they would have preferred it.
</P>
<P>
   Susan served on a community committee that was convened to
devise local strategies for dealing with Y2K. She was disheartened
by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, no one showed up at the meetings,'' she said. ``We
tried to get funding to store grain at the local fire station, but
that didn't come through. And then we tried to plant a field to
grain, but the tractor we were able to get didn't work with the
seed drill we had. There just wasn't enough community interest to
get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their concerns, the Smiths approached Y2K with more
festivity than foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   Their preparations for the final countdown were upbeat, though
with a decidedly rural twist some urbanites might have found a
little too real for comfort _ such as slaughtering the turkey that
was a star feature of the repast.
</P>
<P>
   After quickly decapitating the bird, Susan scalded and plucked
the carcass with the help of a couple of friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to smoke him in a pit,'' she said as she expertly
pulled some pinfeathers from the plump breast. ``He'll be
delicious. People who have never eaten a turkey that grew up
running around, eating greens and insects, don't really know how
good they taste.''

 CHRISTIANS MARK NEW YEAR WITH MIDNIGHT PRAYERS IN THE HOLY CITY  &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ While much of the world partied and played, the
people of Jerusalem prayed their way into the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, hundreds of hymn-singing and arm-waving Christians
gathered in the Garden Tomb, one of two Jerusalem shrines that
claim to be the site of Jesus Christ's tomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hanging out in a graveyard, while others hang out in
Times Square,'' said the Rev. Wayne Hilsden, pastor of the King of
Kings Assembly, an evangelical congregation in Jerusalem. ``They'll
wake up with a hangover. We'll wake up redeemed in the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   As firecrackers and louder explosives crackled and flashed at
nearby Damascus Gate, the outdoor congregation sang spirited
choruses of ``this year in Jerusalem, may your spirit descend.''
</P>
<P>
   While the messianic spirit may have descended, there were no
immediate sightings of the actual Messiah atop the Mount of Olives,
where many Christians predict Jesus will someday return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Messiah would have returned, it would have been neat to
see him go through the Golden Gate,'' said Jim Peters, a
candlemaker from Wausau, Wis., referring to the now-blocked portal
through which some believe Christ will approach the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Peters, who said he spent $2,500 just to be on the Mount of
Olives at midnight, comforted himself with this thought: ``Jesus
needs to come through the heart,'' he said, ``not the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 pilgrims and local Catholics attended a Roman
Catholic service at the Church of All Nations in the Garden of
Gethsemane, followed by a candlelight procession up the Mount of
Olives.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary set of calendrical coincidences, Friday was
the last day of the Christian 1900s, the final Friday of the
Islamic month of Ramadan and the beginning of the weekly Jewish
Sabbath, which shuts down the Holy City like nowhere else on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem is famous for its amazing juxtaposition of faiths and
feelings. Islamic women covered in traditional dress rub shoulders
with American tourists in shorts and Hassidic Jews wearing the same
black hats and long coats that their grandfathers donned in the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as hundreds of thousands of Muslims chanted and bowed
around the Dome of the Rock, everyday life went on in the Jewish
Quarter, just a stone's throw below.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a rooftop cafe overlooking the packed Islamic shrine, a
violinist played a mournful version of the Frank Sinatra hit song
``My Way.'' And if that wasn't enough, noontime church bells began
ringing in the year 2000 of the Christian calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Jacobson, a tourist from Rohnert Park, sat dumbfounded in
the cafe, wondering whether to believe his eyes and ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like this in my life,'' said
Jacobson, an associate professor in environmental studies at Sonoma
State University. ``This morning, I was at the Lion's Gate watching
this sea of humanity walk up to the Dome of the Rock. It was
mesmerizing. It just flowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand in the narrow streets of the walled city were
thousands of heavily armed Israeli soldiers, police and special
security forces. About 7,000 officers and 5,000 police volunteers
were on the New Year's Eve night shift _ more than four times the
usual number.
</P>
<P>
   Security was especially tight at checkpoints into the prosperous
Jewish Quarter and the Western Wall, or Wailing Wall, where Jews
gather for prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The eve of the year 2000 was not a particularly big deal in this
town of three calendars and three major faiths, with Christianity
the smallest of the three.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians, Friday was December 31, 1999. For Muslims, it
was Ramadan 23, 1420. For Jews, it was Tevet 22, 5760.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very used to counting the years,'' said Amnon Lipkin
Shachak, the Israel minister of tourism. ``We are in our sixth
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, New Year's Eve fell in the middle of
Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, which runs from sundown Friday to
sundown Saturday, and the Orthodox rabbis and religious political
parties who have enormous power in Jerusalem issued stern warnings
to observe the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   There were no big public events scheduled in Jerusalem last
night, and the city's Religious Council and Chief Rabbinate
threatened to withdraw the kashrut certificates from any major
hotels that had music or parties last night. Those certificates
verify that a hotel's food and kitchens are kosher, and are
essential for doing business in the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   The low-key celebration was due in part to stringent Israeli
efforts to keep believers in apocalyptic endings at bay. In recent
weeks, Israel deported evangelical Christians who it feared could
cause trouble, and Friday, it tightened security around its
national park at Megiddo, just off the highway that connects the
ancient Roman city of Caesarea to the southern tip of the Sea of
Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   Megiddo is the site mentioned in the apocalyptic Book of
Revelation for the Biblical doomsday battle of Armageddon, and it
is a growing source of fascination for evangelicals focused on
``end times'' theology.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no churches at the site, approximately
170,000 Christian pilgrims visit the hill of Megiddo each year, and
authorities were afraid that Christian extremist groups might
target the area, or that a suicide cult might go there to usher in
the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from Megiddo, Angelita Galvan-Freeman, a Roman Catholic
pilgrim from Southern California, planned a New Year's Eve sail on
the Sea of Galilee, on a wooden boat not unlike one Jesus would
have used 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Her New Year's prayer is that Christians, Muslims and Jews will
find common ground in the millennium ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started as one people,'' she said, ``and we have to get
back to that root from which we all came.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ _ In a rainbow blizzard of confetti and a symphony of
neon and fire- works, a mighty crush of New Year's merrymakers
welcomed the year 2000 in Times Square, the world's most famous
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by fears of terrorism or Y2K havoc, the Times Square
crowd showed every sign of being the biggest and noisiest ever,
bent on watching history happen, watching themselves on huge video
screens and hoping that friends and relatives were watching them on
television at home.
</P>
<P>
   After the ball atop 1 Times Square dropped at midnight, a
jubilant May- or Rudolph Giuliani admitted that he had been nervous
about the threat of terrorism or Y2K upheaval ``right until the
last minute.'' But the day's festivities had gone without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so proud of all the people of New York City,'' he said.
``I am so proud of the most diverse city in the world. We can have
a great celebra- tion and we can do it peacefully and decently.''
</P>
<P>
   As the revelers whooped and hol- lered, hugged and kissed, one
couple made the ultimate hopeful statement about the new
millennium. At the stroke of midnight, Alex Buxton asked Sicely
Schiffgen to marry him, with what looked like a four-carat diamond
and platinum ring.
</P>
<P>
   The most die-hard of the revelers arrived a day ahead of
schedule, camping overnight in soggy cardboard huts and sleeping
bags, unmolested by battalions of police officers, in order to
stake out prime viewing spots for the party to end all parties.
</P>
<P>
   They won the bragging rights for being in Times Square at 7 in
the morning, when the year 2000 arrived in the islands of the South
Pacific, 17 time zones away. At that moment, as sani- tation
workers tried to haul away remains of the soggy campsites, the
83,000-watt Waterford crystal ball was hoisted to the top of its
tower to the strains of Copland's ``Fanfare for the Common Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamar Stratyevskaya, 23, could have used a hot shower by then.
She had spent the night in a makeshift village of cardboard
lean-tos, just the sort of encampment mayors from coast to coast
have been trying to dismantle. She had brought soda, cookies,
noisemakers, a bottle of contraband Champagne and a quilt. When the
rain started, she moved under a movie marquee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I know thought I was crazy,'' said Ms. Stratyevskaya,
a resident of Washington Heights in upper Manhattan. ``But
actually, it's kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Other less compulsive celebrants came in waves throughout the
day: families who wanted a taste of the excitement before
nightfall, when Times Square can become a rowdy place; immigrants
eager to ring in the New Year twice, once along with their homeland
and once in their new home; and tourists and New Yorkers alike who
wedged themselves into spectator pens set up by the police to await
the midnight saturnalia.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the college crowd, do- ing a cold-weather imitation
of spring break in Fort Lauderdale, grew wild and crazy _ or wilder
and crazier _ as the witching hour ap- proached. Mugging for the
television cameras, throwing each other in the air as if in a mosh
pit, smelling suspiciously like contraband alcohol and marijuana,
they tirelessly wel- comed another year of hijinks.
</P>
<P>
   Kamran Syed, a 19-year-old stu- dent at the University of
Southern California film school, had flown from Los Angeles by
himself to see the ball drop. ``Hoo wah!,'' he shout- ed, noting
that he had just downed three Bombay Sapphire martinis and had been
awake for 31 hours. I'm
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Reina, another solo travel- er, who drove all the way
from north- ern Mexico, also had had too much to drink, too little
to eat and not enough sleep. ``I hope I die here,'' he said,
swilling beer. `I'm so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all the party animals were men. Three United Airlines
stewar-H desses were as close to the ball as a spectator could get,
near the Armed Forces recruiting station on the nar- row traffic
island at 43rd Street sepa- rating Seventh Avenue and Broad- way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cute, that's all you need to know,'' said Nancy Lewis, 25,
of San Diego.``I flirted my way past the police. That's how I got
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the rowdy count- down to midnight was the soul of
the Times Square celebration. But for the year 2000 celebration,
led by the Times Square Business Improve- ment District, and
consonant with the transformation of this once- squalid triangle, a
family-friendly daylong celebration was planned.
</P>
<P>
   Two years in the making, with all the special effects of a
Disney movie and the bravura of a Broadway play, Times Square 2000,
as it was called, was an hour-by-hour, time zone-by- time zone
evocation of the cultures of each region of the world.
</P>
<P>
   That made it possible for people who would never venture to
Times Square on New Year's Eve to sample the historic party.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Rogers and Troy Blakely, sweethearts living in New York for
less than a year, ventured forth from their East Side apartment
shortly before noon, the New Year in Indonesia, for a quick peek.
``We came to see it before it got crazy,'' said Ms. Rogers, a
special education teacher. ``It was a fun feeling. And someday we
can tell people we were there at 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Another New Yorker with an appetite only for a glimpse was Diane
Keller, a social worker, who had a simple game plan. She would stay
long enough to shoot one roll of film, for posterity, and then head
for the sales at Lord &AMP; Taylor. ``I wouldn't be here at night, no
way,'' Ms. Keller said. ``I'll be home in front of my fireplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosalia Aragon, with her 10-year-old son and several colleagues
from work, zipped in and out of Times Square in under two hours,
watching the New Year arrive in Southeast Asia. Then they all took
the train back to New Jersey for quiet celebrations at home.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Aragon kept the trip a secret from her mother, who thought
it was dangerous. One of her co-workers, Ed Czekaj, came despite
the objections of his wife, who hates crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this way we got both worlds,'' Czekaj said. ``Boom, boom,
just to say we were here, and then back to our families.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Aragon would have liked to see her home country, Mexico,
usher in the New Year, but that would not come until after
midnight. Kazutaka Noma and his family were luckier _ they were
able to celebrate at 10 a.m., just as his parents were popping
champagne in Japan. A hail of pink confetti, meant to resemble
cherry blossoms, rained down on Noma, a graduate student, his wife
and their 10-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Janet Mouradian, a surgical pathologist at Cornell Medical
Center and a most unlikely denizen of Times Square on this
particular night, kept herself busy editing an Armenian play,
written by her New Year's companion, Herand Markarian. Dr.
Mouradian, an Armenian immigrant, had braved this scene once
before, in 1964, her first year in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do what I enjoy in life and there's only one millennium,''
Dr. Mouradian said, undaunted by the crowded spectators' pen and
the hours of waiting, which had given her time to make new, young
friends. ``He's from Oregon,'' she said, her voice full of marvel.
``And he's from Alaska. And that one, next door, he's from Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking down on the square at intervals through the day and
evening was Peter Jennings, the anchorman for ABC-TV's 24-hour
broadcast. He would stand pressed to the bulletproof windows of the
studio, staring at the mobs below. They, in turn, would wave to
him, seeking the perfect position in front of an ABC camera so they
could simultaneously wave to the folks back home.
</P>
<P>
   The pantomime was a perfect metaphor. New Year's Eve here,
despite the extravagant performance _ dancers, puppets, souvenirs,
sound-and-light shows, commissioned by the Times Square Business
Improvement District _ is all about seeing and being seen. Thus the
run on camcorders at the electronics stores along Broadway. And the
posters (Mom, We Made It Fine, Trust Jesus, Sammy Loves Christine)
raised high to any camera nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Yury Verduga, a salesman at an electronics store, repeated a
conversation he had had dozens of times. ``Camcorder? $199? Let me
see it! OK.'' Also a fast seller, Verduga said, were disposable
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Many people came prepared with supplies to keep them
comfortable, occupied and fed: beach chairs and blankets, chess
sets and mystery novels, and munchies of all kinds. One family
turned a carton upside down to make an ad hoc picnic table, then
unpacked a loaf of bread, jars of peanut butter and jelly and a
half gallon of milk.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd for the most part was jolly. But not Shelley Brown,
from Maryland, who sat sniffling and hacking in a lawn chair,
wrapped head to toe in scarves and blankets. At her feet was an
overnight bag, stuffed with tissues and cough syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brown had come down with the flu at the most inopportune of
times. But she didn't want to disappoint her husband, Ryan. ``I've
been talking about this for the last seven years,'' he said. ``I
grew up watching Dick Clark on television and thought it would be
so cool. We had to be here.''

THOUSANDS GREET SUNRISE DOWN UNDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CHUCK SQUATRIGLIA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  GISBORNE, New Zealand _ Tens of thousands of jubilant revelers
gathered here Friday to witness the first sunrise of the new
millennium, and even the blanket of clouds that covered the world's
easternmost city could not dampen their enthusiasm.
<P>
   Only a few rays of early-morning sunshine reached the aquamarine
water of Gisborne's waterfront along Poverty Bay. But that was
enough for the ecstatic celebrants who came from around the world
to usher in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was impossible to resist the idea that this would be one of
the first places to see the sun rise,'' said Chris O'Dowd of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The sunrise _ whether visible or not _ was a big deal Down
Under, where locals maintain that the new year begins not at
midnight, but at dawn. Several islands of the South Pacific
jockeyed heatedly to be considered the first to see the new century
arrive. New Zealand emerged as the apparent winner, and it fell to
Gisborne, which is the most easterly city on the country's North
Island, to show the world that this nation was worthy of the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the first to see the light,'' said lifelong Gisborne
resident Annabell Gibbons, quoting a slogan that appeared on
everything from sidewalk cobblestones to souvenir T-shirts.
``Whether or not we actually see it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all visitors to New Zealand sought out the crowds. At dawn
Friday, Michael Callan sat on Tokomaru Bay, 40 miles north of the
party in Gisborne, and looked east toward home.
</P>
<P>
   Callan, a Dubliner who left Ireland in June to travel the world,
raised a beer and toasted 2000 as waves crashed ashore. ``I'm not
into huge crowds,'' he said. ``I wanted to be alone with my
thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gisborne, at any rate, was determined to make the most of
its good fortune. The city spent three years and $2 million
spit-shining itself and planning festivities that included a street
party, ceremonial dances by the native Maori people, a concert by
opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, and an air show by the nation's
air force.
</P>
<P>
   The party drew far fewer than the 70,000 people city leaders
expected, but an official tally was not readily available. Still,
New Zealand is a small place _ just 3 million people live on the
nation's two largest islands _ and New Year's Eve 1999 was the
biggest event this city of 35,000 has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen this many people in Gisborne in all my life,''
said Gwendoleine Taare, who lived here for 30 years before moving
to Auckland, the nation's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of so many people _ a good number of them very drunk
_ had city leaders planning for the worst. They brought in 200
police officers from the capital city of Wellington to augment
Gisborne's 40 cops. A refrigerator truck was ordered up to handle
any overflow in the morgue, which has room for just three corpses.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gisborne steeled itself for potential disaster _ someone
thought it necessary to have 200 caskets on hand _ the entire
country prepared for Y2K problems. Being the first to see 1999
become 2000 also meant being the first to see any computer
meltdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world is watching us'' read a front-page banner
headline on Friday's edition of the New Zealand Herald. But in the
end, nothing happened when the clock at the center of Gisborne,
which for the past 1000 days had been counting down the days, hours
and minutes until 2000 _ struck 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to call back home to Canada to tell them that there
aren't any Y2K problems yet,'' said Richard Cloutier, a talk-show
host from Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   After the clock struck 12 and the smoke from the fireworks
wafted away from downtown, the crowd gathered along Gisborne's main
street migrated toward the sea to drink, dance and party some more
while awaiting the first sunbeams.

GIULIANI'S DAY; GETTING PEOPLE READY; IN FRONT OF THE TUBE; LEFT
OUT OF THE CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who gave himself the job of
ubiquitous master of ceremonies of the city's New Year celebration,
said he began his last day of the 1900s at 5:30 a.m. having trouble
getting his lights on. ``I was convinced that it was Y2K,'' the
mayor said, but ``actually I was sleepy.''
</P>
<P>
   This perhaps explains an interesting mishap that occurred later.
``Now we're going to go to Carl in Richmond Hill,'' Giuliani said
shortly after 11 a.m. Friday during his weekly radio call-in show.
``Hello?'' said Carl. ``Hillary?'' responded the mayor, causing
listeners to think for a brief moment that perhaps the first lady
was on the line and that there would be fireworks well before the
ones scheduled at midnight. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton are to run
against each other for U.S. Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello?'' said Carl again, confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' said the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Carl,'' said Carl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said the mayor. ``Wrong call. Hi, Carl. Go ahead,
Carl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, you confuse me,'' said Carl, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confused,'' the mayor said, ``because I was looking at the
wrong part of the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, explained later that the
mayor had been looking at a computer screen displaying the next
caller's name and the subject of the call, which was evidently
Hillary Clinton. Ms. Mindel said the mayor, who was to help flip
the switch that would drop the ball in Times Square at midnight,
had not had a nap, did not plan to have a nap and ``has all the
sleep that he needs to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, Giuliani had excoriated Mrs. Clinton for being
part of the ``Clinton machine,'' the ``Arkansas kind of approach to
things.'' He concluded that ``the best thing for me to do is to do
my job the way I've always done it, and then to try to point out to
people why, if they agree with me, I would be a more effective
senator.'' Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, said
that if the mayor wanted ``an Academy Award nomination for his role
as the victim, he's going to be very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spent much of his day in front of cameras. He started
at 6:40 a.m. with a news conference at the All-Star Cafe in Times
Square, then had interviews from 7 to 8 a.m. with NBC, ABC, CBS and
Fox News. He also had two news conferences at the Office of
Emergency Management's Command Center at the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   Besides assuring citizens that all was under control, he said
three things: New York City is the capital of the globe, American
ideology is ``basically just taking over the entire world'' and
``New Year's in Auckland went really well, so we expect New Year's
in Brooklyn will go just as well.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   GETTING THEM READY FOR THE BIG EVENT
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Friday afternoon, Margaret Mullen, a 29-year-old
hairdresser at the Jean-Claude Biguine hair salon on 45th Street
and Avenue of the Americas, stared out at the thousands of people
crowded around the plate-glass windows of the salon and the conga
line of young women waiting for Ms. Mullen's tonsorial skills at
the front desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these people need our help,'' Ms. Mullen said wearily.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mullen was just one of thousands of people plying the beauty
trade Friday in New York City, just a dutiful handmaiden doing the
coifing, manicuring, waxing and what not for the rest of womanhood.
But rather than playing a dour Cinderella, Ms. Mullen was happy to
be working. Her job is paid on commission, so the more hair styles
she plows through in a day, the more money she makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, it was empty,'' she said. ``Everyone was away. This
week, I get to make everyone else in the world beautiful for their
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariah Baker, 7, and Catalina Baker, 10, ate salami sandwiches
while they waited for their mother, Quita Mullan, to have her hair
washed and blown out by Ms. Mullen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go to Times Square,'' Mariah Baker said. ``But
Daddy won't let us.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said, ``I've tried to convince them that she and the rest
of humanity will be there.'' He looked beseechingly at his younger
daughter, and said: ``Honey, you could get squished by all those
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The room buzzed with talk of plans. Jennifer Kazawic, an
advertising executive with the Odyssey Channel, said she had
wrangled tickets to a party at MTV headquarters. Rada Tyutyunikova,
a colorist at the salon, said she wanted to go home and sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mullen, who lives with her boyfriend, a professional
dogwalker, and her 4-year-old daughter in the Manhattan
neighborhood of Yorkville, said that her plans for tonight were
simple: she was going home to have dinner with her mother, her
boyfriend and her daughter, Kayla.
</P>
<P>
   _ ALEX KUCZYNSKI
</P>
<P>
   PRIMED FOR A SEAT IN FRONT OF THE TUBE
</P>
<P>
   HOBOKEN, N.J. _ He was wearing a plastic, cobalt-colored top hat
advertising ``Millennium 2000.'' She was donning a pair of plastic,
glow-in-the-dark glasses proclaiming ``2000.'' And together, Jeff
and Stacy Vitale looked as if they were primed for a party for the
ages Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Their destination? Not Times Square, since they had worked all
day in Midtown Manhattan, buying the millennial gear along the way.
Not Hoboken's noted bar scene.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were heading to one of the most crowded spots
Friday night in this hip city: Blockbuster Video.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to rent `Mickey Blue Eyes,''' said Mrs. Vitale, a
30-year-old accountant. ``Then he's making dinner, and we're going
to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vitales were far from lone wolves. Throughout Hoboken a
surprisingly large number of people said that they would celebrate
what was supposed to be the grandest New Year's Eve of all time in
regular, couch-potato fashion.
</P>
<P>
   All day Friday, and into the early evening hours, people were
behaving as if this night were no different than any other weekend
night: picking up groceries, grabbing some beer and wine, ordering
take-out food.
</P>
<P>
   So many simply planned to have dinner with family or friends,
uncork a good bottle of wine or port, pop in a video and then,
comforted that Chicken Little was nowhere to be found, turn in for
a good night's sleep before the start of the real weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Some people even said that they were making a statement, of
sorts, by refusing to fall for what has been a nonstop blitz of
hype and inflated prices about millennium this, millennium that.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, some people, like Cybele Emanuelle, a 28-year-old Web
designer, had to work or be on call in case something really did go
awry. So Ms. Emanuelle said it was no big deal that her evening's
agenda included ``The Blair Witch Project,'' some goat cheese and
crackers, some take-out food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Blockbuster night,'' shrugged Ms. Emanuelle, who was
eying a bottle of Champagne at Sparrow Wine &AMP; Liquor on Washington
Street. But Saturday, she added, will be a different story: she'll
be going to a party.
</P>
<P>
   _ DAVID W. CHEN
</P>
<P>
   THEIR HOPES AND FEARS KNOW NO SEASON
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could erase this year and do it over, I would,'' said
Anthony Boyce, a heroin addict who wanted to check into a
detoxification program and celebrate the dawn of the New Year by
sleeping through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to clear my head and not think about what to do next,''
said Boyce, 47. ``When you're carrying a load on your shoulders 24
hours a day, it gets to where you can't think of a way out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Positive Health Project, a walk-up sanctuary at 305 W.
37th St., some of the homeless and destitute shared their modest
hopes and considerable fears as a few blocks away Times Square was
being readied for the biggest New Year's Eve show in its history.
The project dispenses more than 13,000 clean syringes and 36,000
condoms a month, along with advice about staying healthy on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Dolores Serina, 35, said that she had to move into a women's
shelter after her husband went to prison for selling drugs and city
officials declared their basement room an illegal dwelling.
Although she said she was in a methadone program to battle her
craving for heroin, Ms. Serina had to leave her 4-month-old son
with her mother-in-law until she can scrape up money for an
apartment. ``Going into the New Year, I'm scared,'' Ms. Serina
said, as she huddled against her companion, Rolando Morales, 25,
whose drug-injecting left him HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people haven't slept last night,'' Ms. Serina
said. ``They depend on this place for safety.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the project's executive director closed the
needle exchange and other services this New Year's Eve for fear
that his drug users would get swept up by the officers patrolling
the celebration at Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Serina said, ``I look around and I see people spending
money on all these little gizmo-gadgets and I say, `My God, if they
only gave me a dollar, I'd be all right.'''

NEW YORK CITY POLICE OUT IN FULL STRENGTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK &UR;  &LR; _ Saddling up all its horses, putting all its
helicopters in the air and sending nearly all its officers out on
the street in uniform, the New York City Police Department on
Friday mounted one of the biggest security operations in its
history in hopes of keeping the New Year's Eve celebrations safe.
</P>
<P>
   Some 8,000 police officers _ a force larger than that of most of
the country's municipal police departments _ blanketed Times Square
alone for the most famous and symbolic gathering, but the police
also had to cover 328 other officially scheduled celebrations.
Major events were scheduled in all five boroughs, including a
gathering of tens of thousands of people at Grand Army Plaza in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 37,000 police officers were to be on duty over New
Year's Eve and into the morning of Jan. 1. Days off had been
canceled, and detectives and others who normally work in plain
clothes were put back onto the street in uniforms. All six police
helicopters circled over the city, and all 102 horses in the
mounted unit were saddled up.
</P>
<P>
   The police were planning for a crowd in Times Square at least
twice the size of the million people who gathered there the year
before. As tens of thousands of early arrivals poured into the area
in midafternoon, the police were constantly adjusting their
barricades, creating a series of frozen zones from 43rd Street
north along the legs of Broadway and Seventh Avenue as far as 59th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd swelled, the plan was to seal off additional areas
south of 42nd Street, where there was a good view of the crystal
ball whose fall would ring in 2000, and areas along the Avenue of
the Americas and Eighth Avenue where it could be seen on giant
television screens.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 undercover officers mingled with the crowd, on the
lookout for troublemakers or possible terrorists. Bomb-sniffing
dogs were also in the area to search for explosives. As in past
years, the police were under strict orders to confiscate any
alcoholic beverages, a measure that officials say has cut
disorderly conduct during the once-rowdy celebration to negligible
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the concern in recent days had been over the possibility
of a terrorist attack. In the Times Square area, manholes were
welded shut, steel trash cans removed and mailboxes locked. Cars
entering garages in the area over the last few days were searched
as a condition of parking. There were also spot searches of
motorists entering the city through the tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over terrorism mounted sharply on Thursday with the
arrest in Brooklyn of a 31-year-old Algerian, Abdel Ghani, who the
FBI charged was an accomplice of Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian charged
with trying to smuggle powerful explosives and four sophisticated
timing devices across the border near Seattle on Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a black-clad anti-terrorist task force stormed the
shabby Brooklyn apartment block where it had tracked Ghani by a
scrap of paper with his phone number found on Ressam, federal
agents in a half-dozen other cities questioned, and in some cases
detained, people they believed had some connection to Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Police Commissioner Howard Safir and
FBI officials here and in Washington said they had no specific
knowledge of any terrorist plot aimed at New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department plan, code-named Archangel, was three
years in the making. It put the department on its highest alert and
included detailed methods for responding to and investigating
terrorist acts, including biological and chemical assaults.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the threat of terrorism, the police also prepared
for power failures or other problems that might be caused by
computer failures associated with the Year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   Special emergency teams were stationed in each borough with
trucks equipped with banks of lights, generators and special tools
for freeing people trapped in elevators in the event of a power
failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department purchased large amounts of equipment to
prepare for New Year's Eve, including extra lighting trucks for
working in the dark, and some $65,000 worth of interlocking metal
barricades for crowd control. Each precinct was equipped with a
supply of portable electric generators. An extra three-month supply
of flashlights and batteries were stashed away, and individual
officers were even issued chemical illumination sticks that light
up when twisted.

   GM-PRECEPT (Detroit) _ With hundreds of millions of dollars of

   NEW-JARGON (Undated) _ Trying to keep abreast of high-tech
terminology might seem, to use Silicon Valley lingo, to be WOMBAT
duty _ a waste of money, brains and time. But those who have never
heard of HTML are probably condemned to spend their lives offline,
and investors who don't understand EBITDAM might think profits

   The century's turn has been a time of retrospectives: what was
the most important event, who was the most influential thinker? The
Times decided to look ahead at what some of today's researchers are
working on. From the most raked-over field, like the history of the
ancient world, to the latest medical technology, scholars are
coming up with fresh insights. Some ideas may turn into
breakthroughs, and others may turn out to be dead ends, but the
journey is rarely boring. Here is a handful of works in progress.:
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION-DEFICIT (Undated) _ Is Attention Deficit Disorder a
cultural rather than medical condition? By Laurence Zuckerman.

traditional interpretation. By Edward Rothstein.
</P>
<P>

saying they'd have ugly children. Then she started making fun of
his social Darwinist ideas in her novels. By Barbara Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   CALENDAR-1000 (Undated) _ A calendar from the year 1000 shows
what life was like then. By Joyce Jensen.

&HT;     NIGHT OF STARS FOR WASHINGTON MILLENNIUM CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDs: Updates with Mall celebration; new quotes.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stars rained over the nation's capital on New
Year's eve as President Clinton ushered in the new year by lighting
a fuse that sent a thundering shower of brilliant white stars
cascading down the sides of the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, the torch passed to a new century of young
Americans,'' Clinton told the more than 200,000 people gathered on
the National Mall to ring in the Year 2000. ``Tonight, we celebrate
the change of centuries and the dawning of a new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid tight security, the crowd enjoyed relatively balmy weather
_ the temperature was in the higher 30s _ and seemed unconcerned
about any terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crowd had gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial
hours earlier to get good seats for the splashy, 3-hour ``America's
Millennium Gala,'' a live television program hosted by rapper Will
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The show included performances by singers Bono from the Irish
pop band U2, Tom Jones, Don McLean, opera singer Kathleen Battle,
country singers Kenny Rogers, Kathy Mattea and Trisha Yearwood,
``Ragtime'' star Brian Stokes Mitchell, and the cast from
Broadway's 25-member ``Stomp.''But the evening's most captivating
production began in the final half-hour of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the midnight hour, Steven Spielberg presented his
18-minute film, ``Unfinished Journey,'' which was shown on three
55-foot high projection screens erected beside the reflecting pool.
As scenes of America's past were shown on the screens, U.S. poet
laureate Robert Pinsky, former laureate Rita Dove and author-poet
Maya Angelou read poems written for the film. An original musical
score by composer John Williams who conducted his own orchestration
accompanied the readings.
</P>
<P>
   Following the film, the president addressed the crowd and the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with just 20 seconds left before midnight, a group of
children standing at the west end of the Reflecting Pool in front
of the Lincoln Memorial lit the fuse that burned its way along the
length of the pool, ending at the base of the Washington Monument,
now surrounded by an elaborate scaffold because of refurbishing
work.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 11:59:50 p.m., 10 successive bursts of brilliant white
rained down the sides of the monument, each 55 feet above the one
before it, as the Mall revelers counted down the seconds to
midnight. At that moment, the entire monument exploded with a
stunning waterfall of white stars.
</P>
<P>
   But the show wasn't over yet. After the final blast of stars, a
giant Ferris wheel rose 175 feet into the air behind the Lincoln
Memorial. With more than 500 stage lights, the circle of beams
formed a sun to blaze in the New Year. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, the president and First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton hosted a glitzy White House dinner to honor
America's artists, inventors, scientists and scholars.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 guests descended upon the White House for the
``Creator's Dinner,'' including such famous faces as Muhammad Ali,
Elizabeth Taylor and Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the guests, the president toasted the crowd and
praised America's ``endless capacity to express freedom and
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the guests were seated outside in a heated tent in the
Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Only a select 320 people held invitations to sit with the
president and first lady in the East Room and State Dining Room
inside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Among those chosen to sit down with the Clintons were Ali,
Taylor, De Niro, opera divas Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle,
historian Arthur Schlesinger, concert violinist Itzhak Perlman,
playwright Neil Simon, and actors Jack Nicholson and Mary Tyler
Moore. The tables, draped with velvet tablecloths, were set with
white china with a silver band. In the middle of each table was a
solid silver bowl filled with white Phalenopsis orchids, white
roses, white sparkle holly and crystal balls. Adorning each silver
bowl was a silver candlestick with white tapers.
</P>
<P>
   Waited on by 160 butlers, diners feasted on beluga caviar,
lobster, foie gras and oyster velout, served with Sterling
Chardonnay, before moving on to the main course of truffle
marinated rack of lamb, roasted artichoke and pepper rogo't and
crispy garlic polenta served with Dehlinger Pinot Noir. The dinner
ended with a chocolate and champagne delight, served with Iron
Horse Brut champagne.
</P>
<P>
   After the dinner, the Clintons and their guests traveled via
shuttle vans to the Lincoln Memorial for gala. After the show, the
first couple returned to the White House for another party with
about 1,000 guests that was expected to last until around 4 a.m.For
those revelers who make it, the White House party was scheduled to
end with breakfast ``a little before dawn,'' according to Toby
Graff, spokeswoman for the first lady.

&HT;     WORLD ROLLS SMOOTHLY INTO NEW YEAR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The eastern half of the United States smoothly
followed the rest of the world into the new century early Saturday
with only a smattering of minor Y2K glitches reported.
</P>
<P>
   Slot machines in Delaware went bonkers and clocks at a Wisconsin
electricity plant went haywire, as if to highlight the lack of
serious problems in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen no indications of any significant Y2K problems,''
said John Koskinen, chief of the White House's Y2K command center,
based on reports from the Eastern and Central time zones.
</P>
<P>
   He reported some congestion on telephone networks on the East
Coast as the clock moved past midnight. ``Some people have received
messages that all circuits are busy,'' he said, referring to the
`Mother's Day effect'' of heavy telephone use.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Koskinen reported that about 150 slot machines
at three Delaware race tracks temporarily shut down Thursday night
after the slots' time-based computer chips _ programmed to read
three days ahead _ became confused when they rolled over to 2000.
The slots were quickly repaired. In Wisconsin the clocks _ which
went down Friday at 7 p.m. EST _ were quickly reset and no one lost
power.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen and a host of other top government officials gave
upbeat reports all day Friday and early Saturday as the new year
swept across most of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Asia, Russia and Europe preceded the United States
into the new century. Countries such as China, Russia and Ukraine
rolled into Jan. 1 without problems in their nuclear power plants
and other key systems that U.S. officials had feared might shut
down as a result of a Y2K computer glitch. Officials cautioned,
however, that problems could still crop up in coming days. Monday
was cited as a crucial milestone because it will be the first day
of normal business operations following the long holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reported Y2K problem overseas was with a Japanese
nuclear plant. The Shika Nuclear Power Station about 170 miles
northwest of Tokyo, lost its radiation alarm system shortly after
midnight there. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson described the
system as a backup system and said it did not affect plant safety.
</P>
<P>
   The United States experienced its first Y2K tests at 7 p.m. EST
Friday, when computers that control airline traffic, about
one-third of the nation's power grid and military operations
appeared to roll over into the new year without incident. The
computers are based on Greenwich Mean Time, which is five hours
ahead of the Eastern Standard Time zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's airspace system is up and running safely,''
Federal Aviation Administration chief Jane Garvey said. She was
aboard a jet traveling from Washington, D.C., to Dallas when air
traffic computers passed midnight GMT.
</P>
<P>
   Even before parts of the U.S. crossed into the new millenium,
Koskinen predicted the country would easily weather the transition
into the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never felt that there was any significant chance that
the United States would have would have a major problem in the
infrastructure, either nationally or regionally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the fact that virtually all of the world moved
into the new year without any problems should not lead to anyone to
`underestimate the nature of the problem that was originally
there.''
</P>
<P>
   `Had the effort not been made, had the money not been spent, we
would be in a very different situation than we find ourselves in
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department estimates that some $100 billion was
spent in the United States over the past five years to fix the Y2K
problem _ which would occur if computers interpreted the digits
``00'' as 1900 rather than 2000. Worldwide is it estimated that
governments and private industry spent close to $400 billion fixing
its computers.
</P>
<P>
   Early good news came to the White House center as New Year's eve
slipped past midnight in Western Pacific time zones first. For
example, New Zealand celebrated the arrival of the New Year 18
hours before Washington, D.C. As Japan, Australia and other nations
joined the '00 honor roll, optimism grew at the White House Y2K
coordination center that years of preparedness were paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Pickering, the No. 2 person at the State Department,
reported that all 29 of Russia's nuclear power plants passed into
the new year without incident, a reassuring note because of concern
about Russia's attention to the Y2K issue and its aging nuclear
reactors.

   MILLENNIUM-TIME (Undated) _ On the eve of a new millennium _ or

second that will mark the first Y2K moment, Jan. 1, 2000.

   Outside of cyberspace, however, our millennial celebrations will

L.A.'S PARTIES FAIL TO DRAW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles' city parties and concerts on New Year's Eve were a
dud of millennial proportions Friday, drawing far smaller crowds of
revelers than expected.
</P>
<P>
   A rare rainstorm coupled with Y2K boredom and uncertainty kept
much of Los Angeles home from the five city parties, and even The
Eagles concert failed to fill the Staples Center and left scalpers
eating high-priced tickets.
</P>
<P>
   At the city's icon, the Hollywood sign, the laser light show and
fireworks displays were nixed. Officials gave contradictory
explanations for why they were canceled and why officials continued
to promote the events until the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a very dry season,'' said Deputy Mayor Noelia
Rodriguez, explaining the fireworks cancellations. ``The fire
hazards certainly played into it. The last thing we need is to
torch the Hollywood sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration told the city two weeks ago
it could not stage a laser light show, according to Riordan
spokeswoman Jessica Copen. But other officials said it was because
the lasers didn't work well on TV and film.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan and Jay Leno were scheduled to throw the switch to light
the signs before a worldwide television audience.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the rain cut short several party performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly what we wanted, because of the rain,'' said
Al Nodal, the city cultural affairs director, as he dodged puddles
at the city's downtown festival. ``It's just sort of spotty.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, many partygoers were undaunted, enjoying the line
dancing, skydivers, gospel singers and an array of activities.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said attendance could have reached about 400,000
at the five venues. There was capacity for 15,000 people at any one
time at the Van Nuys Airport, where a daylong crowd of 45,000 was
expected but only a few hundred showed up at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   Parties also were thrown in Crenshaw, Grand Avenue downtown, San
Pedro and the Alameda district.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Pedro has been building slowly all day. The Crenshaw is
rolling right now. Alameda has been going full-blast
</P>
<P>
   they're real troupers,'' Nodal said.
</P>
<P>
   At the ``San Fernando Valley Spectacular'' at the Van Nuys
Airport, several hundred people got a jump on New Year's
festivities at the family themed outing featuring mass line
dancing, kids' crafts, carnival rides and music.
</P>
<P>
   About 900 people were in attendance by early evening, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really great that this was pulled off for the people of
the city,'' said Carol Brotman, 44, of Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   From noon on, the free city-sponsored event drew a steady stream
of partygoers bundled in ski jackets, scarves and gloves.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected wet weather kept musicians from taking the stage
and quashed a planned BMX bike jump demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's in a real party spirit,'' said Mary Passantino of
Canyon Country, one of the 500 or so line dancers to mark the
millennium to Dwight Yoakam's ``Fast As You'' in an old National
Guard hanger. ``It's a real nice way for people to get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Levy, who grew up in Encino and now lives in San Jose,
brought his mother, his wife, Judy, and their three children to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite thing is the dancing, said 8-year-old Rachel.
</P>
<P>
   Her brothers, 10-year-old Eric and 8-year-old Aaron were busy
slugging it out with long, padded poles in an inflatable gladiator
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' Levy said. ``I think the kids will last until
midnight. It's a big enough event.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, 10-year-old Christian McDonald and the 40-member
choir from the Church on the Way in Van Nuys were eager to perform.
They were to join choirs at the four other L.A. millennial venues
in singing a prophetic 1899 hymn, ``A Hundred Years From Now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real exciting,'' said Christian of Valencia. ``I think
the future is going to change a lot. Pollution is going to stop,
and I think the world is just going to be a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Airwolf'' TV star Jan-Michael Vincent, grand marshal of the
Valley spectacular, joined the dancers for a few steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much of a line dancer, but I sure can do the country
swing,'' Vincent said.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 volunteers joined 85 private security guards and more
than 100 Los Angeles police officers in keeping the event running
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Tustin resident Bob Shea drove his wife and four children to the
airport spectacular as a prelude to the Rose Parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you can do on the millennium New Year's Eve is
geared to adults _ dancing, nightclubs _ but this was the best
thing for families,'' said Shea, a former Los Angeles resident.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers had said they wanted to use the sky above Los Angeles
to unify the city and link the five festivals, but the gray and
cloudy weather interfered.
</P>
<P>
   A skywriter wrote ``LA 2000'' over the San Pedro festival about
noon, but gathering clouds covered it. Nodal said the rest of the
``air promenade'' continued as planned, with planes, blimps and
skydivers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thousands ventured to the Staples Center to wind down the 1900s
with The Eagles, Linda Ronstadt and Jackson Browne, in a concert
featuring pillars of the L.A. music scene.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Staples Center, ticketholders for the Eagles seemed
to be in good spirits even as they waited in the chilly drizzle.
The clothing ran the gamut, from jeans to business suits to ...
Star Wars outfits, as they came for one reason: to indulge in a bit
of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to do something I've never done before to ring out
the New Year,'' said Andrew Milinkevich, a Thousand Oaks attorney
dressed in a Darth Maul costume.
</P>
<P>
   Scalpers offered $750 tickets for $500 with no takers, while
others couldn't get rid of even $50 tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Doors were supposed to open at 6 p.m., but stayed closed until
after 7 p.m. Concertgoers faced metal-detector wands, and guards
checked cell phones to see if they were working models.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the audience missed the opening act, Ronstadt, who
performed for only 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Gould of Woodland Hills said: ``A lot of people around me
are angry. My friends and I paid $750 for our tickets and feel that
we missed a third of the concert.''
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't deter Richard Benavides, who waited to get in
with his wife, 12-year-old son and 10-year-old twins. The family
drove from College Station, Texas, with the concert being the
highlight of their L.A. visit. It was the first rock concert for
his children. ``My wife and I didn't want to leave them home. ...
This is a real special occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight at Universal City, where three events were
going on at the CityWalk, a swing dance party starting at 9 p.m. at
Universal Studios and the Jimmy Buffett concert at the Universal
Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the Buffett nine-hour event went for $500 to $1,500.
He was to begin performing at 10 p.m. The party was to continue
until 4 a.m. Lines stretched blocks long to get into the
amphitheater.

<P>
   When Boris Yeltsin unveiled his millennium surprise on New
Year's Eve, he used the word ``power'' five times in his brief
retirement speech.
</P>
<P>
   When Lenin issued his famous call to revolution on Oct. 24,
1917, he also used the word ``power'' five times. Lenin was getting
ready to seize it. Yeltsin, who will go down in history as the man
who toppled the totalitarian system Lenin wrought, said he was
relinquishing it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet power, and the thirst for it, is the connection between two
Russian leaders who only a few years ago symbolized opposite
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   As was clear from the moment he mentioned his anointed
successor, Vladimir Putin (``I have no doubt what choice you will
make at the end of March 2000'' ), Yeltsin left office not to
protect the fragile democracy that brought about his election in
1992 but to preserve the power that his administration came to
revere above all else.
</P>
<P>
   As political theater, it was a classic Yeltsin move _
unpredictable but shrewd. Yeltsin no doubt realized that Putin's
surge in popularity, based on public support for a military
crackdown in Chechnya, might not last until June, when elections
were supposed to take place. By then, enough soldiers will have
come home in body bags to contradict the promise of a clean, easy
victory _ as they did the last time Yeltsin tried to impose Russian
might on the rebel republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hold on to power for another six months?'' Yeltsin said,
with a straight face. ``No, this is not me, this is not in my
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding on to power, against all odds, has been the one steady
feature of Yeltsin's remarkably inconsistent tenure as president.
And that too is not all that surprising. Power has been the driving
force of Russian politics since the time of the czars, through the
Soviet Union and beyond. For all the mistakes and misjudgments that
Yeltsin conceded and regretted, he never lost sight of what matters
in Russia. Russians have been so broken for so long that they have
learned to respond only to an iron fist, and Yeltsin played to that
instinct again and again, taking on the role of the autocrat as
nimbly as he had turned himself into a democrat when the Soviet
Empire began to topple.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the West has mainly seen Yeltsin
through the prism of news clips, embarrassing shots of him toppling
over at official ceremonies, frugging at a rock concert or
recovering from heart surgery in a government dacha. Russians have
also seen him act out rituals that date to the czars, shaking his
finger at quaking local bureaucrats, ordering them to raise wages
that Moscow had already cut back.
</P>
<P>
   He came to public notice in the late 1980s as a populist who
rode public buses and hectored party officials, but he seamlessly
recast himself as an age-old Kremlin ruler, surrounded by
sycophants and bodyguards, allowing corruption to flourish at the
highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   During the coup of 1991, when Yeltsin stood on a tank to defy
the old Soviet guard into history, he created one of the most
electrifying moments in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   But when he took over, he ruled by contradiction. He fired
scores of advisers, rehired many and fired them again _ and again.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Chubais, a former deputy prime minister who is viewed by
the West as the last guarantor of free-market rules, was kicked in
and out of power. So was Boris Berezovsky, the crafty tycoon who
symbolizes the entrenched business interests that want to impose
their own rule on the Russian market. Yeltsin deserves credit for
seeking to introduce real economic freedom in a country that never
experienced it, but he will also be remembered as the ruler who
oversaw the birth of Russia's plutocracy.
</P>
<P>
   He will get credit for leaving the Kremlin voluntarily,
something no one in Russian history had ever done, except Mikhail
Gorbachev _ at a time when Yeltsin had the upper hand and had left
him no choice.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not like a broken Lyndon Johnson refusing to run
for a second term. Yeltsin wants to be succeeded by someone whose
loyalty will last and will not hound him in retirement with
criminal charges, financial restraints or just lese majeste. Putin
remains unproven as a leader. For now, he mainly represents
Yeltsin's desire to keep his grip on Russia's future _ and preserve
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Lenin put it in 1917, ``the seizure of power is the
business of the uprising; its political purpose will become clear
after the seizure.''

<P>
   When Boris Yeltsin unveiled his millennium surprise on New
Year's Eve, he used the word ``power'' five times in his brief
retirement speech.
</P>
<P>
   When Lenin issued his famous call to revolution on Oct. 24,
1917, he also used the word ``power'' five times. Lenin was getting
ready to seize it. Yeltsin, who will go down in history as the man
who toppled the totalitarian system Lenin wrought, said he was
relinquishing it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet power, and the thirst for it, is the connection between two
Russian leaders who only a few years ago symbolized opposite
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   As was clear from the moment he mentioned his anointed
successor, Vladimir Putin (``I have no doubt what choice you will
make at the end of March 2000'' ), Yeltsin left office not to
protect the fragile democracy that brought about his election in
1992 but to preserve the power that his administration came to
revere above all else.
</P>
<P>
   As political theater, it was a classic Yeltsin move _
unpredictable but shrewd. Yeltsin no doubt realized that Putin's
surge in popularity, based on public support for a military
crackdown in Chechnya, might not last until June, when elections
were supposed to take place. By then, enough soldiers will have
come home in body bags to contradict the promise of a clean, easy
victory _ as they did the last time Yeltsin tried to impose Russian
might on the rebel republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hold on to power for another six months?'' Yeltsin said,
with a straight face. ``No, this is not me, this is not in my
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding on to power, against all odds, has been the one steady
feature of Yeltsin's remarkably inconsistent tenure as president.
And that too is not all that surprising. Power has been the driving
force of Russian politics since the time of the czars, through the
Soviet Union and beyond. For all the mistakes and misjudgments that
Yeltsin conceded and regretted, he never lost sight of what matters
in Russia. Russians have been so broken for so long that they have
learned to respond only to an iron fist, and Yeltsin played to that
instinct again and again, taking on the role of the autocrat as
nimbly as he had turned himself into a democrat when the Soviet
Empire began to topple.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the West has mainly seen Yeltsin
through the prism of news clips, embarrassing shots of him toppling
over at official ceremonies, frugging at a rock concert or
recovering from heart surgery in a government dacha. Russians have
also seen him act out rituals that date to the czars, shaking his
finger at quaking local bureaucrats, ordering them to raise wages
that Moscow had already cut back.
</P>
<P>
   He came to public notice in the late 1980s as a populist who
rode public buses and hectored party officials, but he seamlessly
recast himself as an age-old Kremlin ruler, surrounded by
sycophants and bodyguards, allowing corruption to flourish at the
highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   During the coup of 1991, when Yeltsin stood on a tank to defy
the old Soviet guard into history, he created one of the most
electrifying moments in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   But when he took over, he ruled by contradiction. He fired
scores of advisers, rehired many and fired them again _ and again.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Chubais, a former deputy prime minister who is viewed by
the West as the last guarantor of free-market rules, was kicked in
and out of power. So was Boris Berezovsky, the crafty tycoon who
symbolizes the entrenched business interests that want to impose
their own rule on the Russian market. Yeltsin deserves credit for
seeking to introduce real economic freedom in a country that never
experienced it, but he will also be remembered as the ruler who
oversaw the birth of Russia's plutocracy.
</P>
<P>
   He will get credit for leaving the Kremlin voluntarily,
something no one in Russian history had ever done, except Mikhail
Gorbachev _ at a time when Yeltsin had the upper hand and had left
him no choice.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not like a broken Lyndon Johnson refusing to run
for a second term. Yeltsin wants to be succeeded by someone whose
loyalty will last and will not hound him in retirement with
criminal charges, financial restraints or just lese majeste. Putin
remains unproven as a leader. For now, he mainly represents
Yeltsin's desire to keep his grip on Russia's future _ and preserve
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Lenin put it in 1917, ``the seizure of power is the
business of the uprising; its political purpose will become clear
after the seizure.''

   A Rough Night on the Town
</P>
<P>
   Sean ``Puffy'' Combs has the indisputable ability to attract
attention. The rap impresario throws lavish parties, drapes himself
in furs and jewelry, dates movie star Jennifer Lopez and all but
begs people to look his way. Some say this is a job requirement for
a hip-hop star; others find it a tad excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Combs, 30, attracted more attention _ the unwanted
kind _ when he was arrested after an early-morning shootout in a
Manhattan nightclub. The arrest led to inevitable newspaper
photographs depicting Combs skulking away from a police station.
</P>
<P>
   Police say a club patron taunted Combs by throwing a wad of
money at the multimillionaire. Combs and a young protege pulled out
guns, they say, but only the protege pulled his trigger. Three
bystanders were shot and wounded in the confusion that ensued,
while Combs and Ms. Lopez fled in a sports-utility vehicle that ran
11 red lights before being pulled over.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they found a gun in the car that had not been fired,
but it was loaded _ and stolen. Combs, his driver and his bodyguard
were charged with criminal possession of a weapon, while his
protege was charged with attempted murder. Combs later held a news
conference to strongly deny having anything to do with the shootout
or with guns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the episode resurrected doubts about the rap star's
judgment. In April, for example, Combs and two associates beat up a
record executive who had angered him; he later pleaded guilty to a
violation. The arrest also comes at a time when record sales for
his Bad Boy Entertainment empire have slipped.
</P>
<P>
   As for questions about Combs' performance as a role model, his
friend and business colleague, Andre Harrell, said, ``When you
judge Sean against his peers, he's not doing such a bad job.''

   A Cold War Relic Signs Off
</P>
<P>
   For schoolchildren in the 1950s or '60s, there were few sounds
more terrifying than the wail of an air raid siren. No matter that
it was only a test: The sound will forever conjure up visions of
Soviet jets and mushroom clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But 50 years after cities from coast to coast installed the
early warning systems, the sirens have become little more than
annoying relics of the Cold War. This year, Baltimore will become
the latest city to abandon the system and its tests of 122 sirens
that blared from speakers around town each Monday at 1 p.m. A new
network of radio-controlled sirens, which do not require routine
testing, will be installed to alert people to impending natural
disasters or terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities have put the old systems to similar use.
Tornado-prone Omaha tests its system once a month, and San
Francisco, which is prone to earthquakes, runs a test every Tuesday
at noon. But why anyone would need a siren to tell them that there
had been an earthquake is an open question.

   China Sentences 4 Members Of Spiritual Group
</P>
<P>
   Sending a harsh message to followers of the Falun Gong spiritual
movement, Chinese authorities gave prison sentences ranging from 7
to 18 years to three men and a woman who were said to be top
organizers. Last summer the government declared the group an ``evil
cult'' after 10,000 members mounted an illegal demonstration in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the sentences _ 18 years for one defendant and 16 years
for another _ were stiffer than those meted out to democracy
advocates in the last several years, a sign of how frightened the
government is of a movement that has attracted millions of
citizens.

</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain and former Sen. Bill Bradley, the surging
presidential challengers, reported surprisingly strong fund-raising
totals for the final three months of the year, matching their
climbing poll ratings in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain took in $6.1 million and Bradley received $8 million,
compared to only $4 million for Vice President Al Gore. Texas Gov.
George Bush continued his dominance of the money chase, collecting
$10 million in the fourth quarter of 1999 and entering the 2000
primary season with $31.4 million in the bank.

   Inquiry Into Kohl Funds
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have started a criminal investigation into secret
bank accounts used by former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to
collect and distribute at least $1 million in allegedly illegal
political contributions during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation marks a low point for Kohl, who was chancellor
from 1982 until 1998 and who engineered the reunification of
Germany. If found guilty of embezzlement or fraud, Kohl could
theoretically face a prison term of up to five years.

   Anyone who was once a Beatle, even the ``quiet'' one, can never
fade away and live a simple life _ no matter how big the mansion,

decades ago.
</P>

   An intruder _ obsessed with the Beatles to the point of
believing they were witches _ broke into Harrison's home outside
London and stabbed him in the chest, also slightly injuring his
wife, Olivia. Harrison should recover from the resulting lung
injury, his surgeon said, in a matter of weeks.

   A cottage industry of plain-language consultants has sprung up
in recent years. They aim to wage war on the business buzzwords,
governmental verbosity and turgid legalese that make many public
documents impossible to understand.
</P>
<P>
   These experts also seek to instill some of the basics of good
writing, like the importance of short, direct sentences. Much of
their work has come in the mutual fund industry, which for the past
two years has been under an order by the Securities and Exchange
Commission to simplify documents.

other business parts into a synergistic whole, which is bigger than
the sum of its parts.

<P>
   After: To do marketing well, we'll have to draw on the ideas and
experiences from the field and other departments, determine how
these might help us, then integrate them into our marketing plans
and practices in a way that increases their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sounds easy, right? But simplifying a document often requires
a whole new approach, not just slicing and dicing. Contrast the
first sentence of a letter that Texaco's chief executive, Peter I.
Bijur, wrote to shareholders in 1996 and the start to his letter in
1998, when the company began using simpler language:

Executive Officer of Texaco, I am privileged to review along with

our greater ambitions and plan for 1997 and beyond, and discuss our
philosophy for sustaining long-term growth for our company.

RECONSIDERING CANNIBALISM: IF YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT ...

<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you eat human flesh?
</P>
<P>
   No, it is not a very polite question. But perhaps the horror it
arouses reflects a guilty desire, some dark instinct buried in the
atavistic limbo of the mind, to crush one's enemy, savor his flesh
and absorb his qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Cannibalism has been in the news as rival experts try to get
this bizarre but revealing topic into focus. The issue is whether
cannibalism was once a routine part of human social behavior or is
merely a myth designed to justify advanced nations' domination over
primitive and allegedly anthropophagous peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the survivors of desperate expeditions will sometimes
resort to eating their companions if no other food is available.
The companions, one hopes, died of natural causes, though this
cannot always be assumed. ``Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold, And
the mate of the Nancy brig, And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,
And the crew of the captain's gig,'' the sole survivor laments of
his consumed shipmates in W.S. Gilbert's ``Yarn of the Nancy
Bell.''
</P>
<P>
   This consumption in extremis is known as survival cannibalism, a
practice that is not in doubt. The debate concerns the practice of
ritual cannibalism, like the headhunting of enemies, the Aztecs'
sacrifice of war captives or the eating of dead relatives as part
of beliefs about recycling and regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   Human myth and folklore are shot through with man-eating ogres
and cyclopes. The central sacrament of Christianity is the symbolic
eating of transubstantiated flesh and blood. It is hard not to
suspect a lot of anthropophagy in the closet of the human past. But
the modern reporting of cannibalism has been beset by a bout of
extreme revisionism.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1979 book, ``The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and
Anthropophagy,'' Dr. William Arens of the State University of New
York at Stony Brook dismissed as circumstantial and unconvincing
all reports of ritual cannibalism. Arens even challenged the widely
accepted finding that kuru, a human form of mad cow disease seen
among the Fore people of Papua New Guinea, was spread by the eating
of human brains.
</P>
<P>
   Arens' position has influenced anthropologists who believe
primitive peoples were often maligned by missionaries and others
intent upon their moral improvement. ``There is no reliable
evidence to support the claim that Australian Aboriginal societies
engaged in institutionalized cannibalism,'' writes Michael
Pickering, of the Museum of Victoria in Australia, in ``The
Anthropology of Cannibalism'' (Bergin &AMP; Garvey, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   This tide of skepticism doubtless washed away many fanciful
accounts but has been dismaying for archaeologists who found their
evidence for cannibal feasts summarily dismissed. Cracked and
burned human bones have been turned up for decades in Anasazi ruins
in the American Southwest. Despite suggestions first made a century
ago that these might represent cannibalism or ritual sacrifice, the
remains were delicately referred to as ``mass burials.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading advocate of Anasazi cannibalism is Dr. Christy
Turner of Arizona State University. He met only disbelief when he
proposed in 1970 that the cut, burned and defleshed bones of 30
American Indians in Polacca Wash in Arizona were the remains of an
ancient cannibal repast. ``In the 1960s, the new paradigm about
Indians was that they were all peaceful and happy. So, to find
something like this was the antithesis of the new way we were
supposed to be thinking about Indians,'' Turner told Science
magazine in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Critics attributed the cuts on the grisly remains like these to
animal scavengers, funerary practices, the roof falling in _
anything but anthropophagy. After 30 years of work and the study of
15,000 skeletons, Turner is now convinced that cannibalism was
practiced by the Anasazi as a method of social control. The
cannibals' base of operations seems to have been the great house in
Chaco Canyon, N.M., from which they terrorized people within a
100-mile radius between 900 and 1700 AD.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's findings have been supported by a paleoanthropologist,
Dr. Tim White of the University of California at Berkeley, who from
human bones at an Anasazi site dated to 1150 A.D. noted the macabre
phenomenon of ``pot polish.'' The tips of the bones had shiny
patches, as if rubbed smooth against the walls of a cooking pot.
White showed that deer bones cooked in an Anasazi pot acquired the
same polish marks.
</P>
<P>
   Cannibalism is sometimes said to be a phenomenon of the
agricultural revolution of 10,000 years ago, after which human
populations first became quite numerous. But a clear case of
cannibalism was reported last October among Neanderthals who lived
100,000 years ago by the Rhone river in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   From a cave, French archaeologists recovered 78 pieces of bone
that seemed to belong to about six people. Cuts on the skulls show
the chewing muscles were stripped off and, in one case, the tongue
cut out. The leg bones were broken to remove the marrow. As no
other human species inhabited Europe at the time, this is the
strongest evidence that the Neanderthals, close human relatives who
became extinct 30,000 years ago, practiced cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, this horrid propensity for human flesh lies not so
deep beneath the surface. After World War II, a Japanese nurse was
found guilty of having participated in eating the liver of a U.S.
airman executed at Kyushu University, writes historian John Dower
in his new book ``Embracing Defeat.'' Emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa I
of the Central African Republic possessed an oversized refrigerator
and oven, which his accusers said were used for the culinary
preparation of his countrymen. And Americans have Jeffrey Dahmer.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Western Europe, that cradle of civilization, consider
the strange use of food names for former adversaries. The French,
for example, call the English les bifteks (beefsteaks), while the
English sometimes refer to the French as frogs (for frog legs) and
the Germans as krauts (cabbage). These jocular epithets are
doubtless anthropophagous echoes of a forbidden taste from our
Paleolithic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Do you eat human flesh? Of course not. But not so long ago, your
ancestors did.

among the Fore people of Papua New Guinea, was spread by the eating
of human brains.
</P>
<P>
   Arens' position has influenced anthropologists who believe
primitive peoples were often maligned by missionaries and others
intent upon their moral improvement. ``There is no reliable
evidence to support the claim that Australian Aboriginal societies
engaged in institutionalized cannibalism,'' writes Michael
Pickering, of the Museum of Victoria in Australia, in ``The
Anthropology of Cannibalism'' (Bergin &AMP; Garvey, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   This tide of skepticism doubtless washed away many fanciful
accounts but has been dismaying for archaeologists who found their
evidence for cannibal feasts summarily dismissed. Cracked and
burned human bones have been turned up for decades in Anasazi ruins
in the American Southwest. Despite suggestions first made a century
ago that these might represent cannibalism or ritual sacrifice, the
remains were delicately referred to as ``mass burials.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading advocate of Anasazi cannibalism is Dr. Christy
Turner of Arizona State University. He met only disbelief when he
proposed in 1970 that the cut, burned and defleshed bones of 30
American Indians in Polacca Wash in Arizona were the remains of an
ancient cannibal repast. ``In the 1960s, the new paradigm about
Indians was that they were all peaceful and happy. So, to find
something like this was the antithesis of the new way we were
supposed to be thinking about Indians,'' Turner told Science
magazine in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Critics attributed the cuts on the grisly remains like these to
animal scavengers, funerary practices, the roof falling in _
anything but anthropophagy. After 30 years of work and the study of
15,000 skeletons, Turner is now convinced that cannibalism was
practiced by the Anasazi as a method of social control. The
cannibals' base of operations seems to have been the great house in
Chaco Canyon, N.M., from which they terrorized people within a
100-mile radius between 900 and 1700 AD.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's findings have been supported by a paleoanthropologist,
Dr. Tim White of the University of California at Berkeley, who from
human bones at an Anasazi site dated to 1150 A.D. noted the macabre
phenomenon of ``pot polish.'' The tips of the bones had shiny
patches, as if rubbed smooth against the walls of a cooking pot.
White showed that deer bones cooked in an Anasazi pot acquired the
same polish marks.
</P>
<P>
   Cannibalism is sometimes said to be a phenomenon of the
agricultural revolution of 10,000 years ago, after which human
populations first became quite numerous. But a clear case of
cannibalism was reported last October among Neanderthals who lived
100,000 years ago by the Rhone river in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   From a cave, French archaeologists recovered 78 pieces of bone
that seemed to belong to about six people. Cuts on the skulls show
the chewing muscles were stripped off and, in one case, the tongue
cut out. The leg bones were broken to remove the marrow. As no
other human species inhabited Europe at the time, this is the
strongest evidence that the Neanderthals, close human relatives who
became extinct 30,000 years ago, practiced cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, this horrid propensity for human flesh lies not so
deep beneath the surface. After World War II, a Japanese nurse was
found guilty of having participated in eating the liver of a U.S.
airman executed at Kyushu University, writes historian John Dower
in his new book ``Embracing Defeat.'' Emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa I
of the Central African Republic possessed an oversized refrigerator
and oven, which his accusers said were used for the culinary
preparation of his countrymen. And Americans have Jeffrey Dahmer.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Western Europe, that cradle of civilization, consider
the strange use of food names for former adversaries. The French,
for example, call the English les bifteks (beefsteaks), while the
English sometimes refer to the French as frogs (for frog legs) and
the Germans as krauts (cabbage). These jocular epithets are
doubtless anthropophagous echoes of a forbidden taste from our
Paleolithic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Do you eat human flesh? Of course not. But not so long ago, your
ancestors did.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Europeans, it often seems, spent the last
decade building resentments of American fast food, pop culture,
corporate callousness and an unchallenged military machine _ when
they weren't importing or trying to emulate them. They ended the
century thinking they had staked out the parameters of
Americanization and could now concentrate on erecting barricades
around their traditional larders, languages and societies. But some
demographers have a big surprise in store.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new millennium is a few decades old, these
demographers say, Europe will be face to face with an
American-style phenomenon more profoundly unsettling to many of
them than any superficial cultural symbol or business intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, these experts say, is this: To survive
economically and socially, Europe may have to lower its bars to
immigration and change its racial and ethnic face through mass
migration of labor from around the world. In other words, it may
find itself debating moves toward a social structure that looks
more like America.
</P>
<P>
   It has often been said that however much they share in
democratic values, Europeans and Americans still differ on one
fundamental: In America, the whole idea of citizenship is that
anyone from anywhere can become naturalized. In Europe, on the
other hand, the idea of citizenship in most places is still linked
to ethnic heritage, or at least to language and culture. True,
Americans have restricted immigration and Europeans have invited
foreign workers to take jobs in their economies. But large-scale
immigration and naturalization is still an American ideal, while
Europeans cling to a linguistic and racial basis for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming decades, U.N. experts say, demographics indicate
that many European countries (and Japan) will have more older
people and fewer babies than ever before. This seems to foretell
severely shrunken labor forces and swollen ranks of pensioners. If
Europeans want to keep their economies and social services running,
they will be tempted to look far afield for qualified workers of
all kinds _ not just the semi-skilled or unskilled workers who have
traditionally been invited to fill gaps in their work forces.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Chamie, the director of the U.N. population division,
says there is a logical response: what he calls replacement
migration. ``These countries in Europe will face the wall,'' he
said. ``They either bring in migrants, or they are going to decline
in size. The model that the United States has _ and Canada and
Australia _ is increasingly becoming attractive to some of the
thinkers in those countries.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. experts now preparing a report to be published this year
say that their early projections show that Italy would have to add
about 9 million immigrants by 2025 _ about 300,000 a year _ to keep
its population at 1995 levels, Germany would need to import 14
million people _ 500,000 a year _ France 2 million and the European
Union as a whole about 35 million. If the Europeans wanted to keep
their ratio of older people to active workers at the 1995 levels,
the union would need 135 million immigrants by 2025.
</P>
<P>
   Surplus labor, some of it very highly skilled, is waiting in the
third world, and the pressure for migration out of overpopulated
countries will be growing as the European societies shrink. A group
of developing countries is calling for a U.N. conference that would
have the freer movement of labor on its agenda. India, for example,
has a labor force larger than that of the European Union. A lot of
its computer geniuses are already sought by Silicon Valley. Will
Europe soon have to compete for them? And will it let them migrate?
</P>
<P>
   If migration is the answer, and the numbers are large enough,
Europe may well find itself under a challenge to make these and
other immigrants full citizens in every sense. Today, Germany
tolerates Turkish ``guest workers,'' as France allows Algerian
migrants, but in both cases these minorities have become lightning
rods for nationalist resentments.
</P>
<P>
   As always when projections are made, there are dissenting
voices. Michael Teitelbaum, program director of the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation in New York and the co-author with Jay Winter of ``A
Question of Numbers: High Migration, Low Fertility and the Politics
of National Identity'' (Hill and Wang, 1998), points out that some
European countries are already quite culturally and racially
diverse. That aside, he says, he does not believe that large-scale
migration is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anything inevitable about anything when
it comes to demography, and I am a demographer,'' he said. And, he
said, European nations may not see the American example as worth
emulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what your goals are,'' he said. ``If your goals
are to maximize your gross domestic product then you probably don't
want a labor force that is slowly declining in numbers, even if
their productivity is rising fast. If your goal is not GDP but GDP
per capita or the equitable distribution of GDP and a kind of
equilibrium, a kind of agreeable quality of life in your society,
then you may not care as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum is saying, in effect, that the challenge may be what
Chamie predicts, but that Europeans may decide the cost of meeting
it is too high. He points to European feelings about American-style
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many Europeans who hear Americans say how triumphant
the American economy is and how wonderful and prosperous it is and
they look at it and say, `Gee, we don't want to be like that,'''
Teitelbaum said. ```It's really two societies with the kind of
underclass that's getting worse and worse off, more and more
marginalized.'''

   Also, he said, not everybody has the same definition of
multiculturalism. ``The French think that what they call the
Anglo-Saxon model is a multicultural model of integration in which
everybody speaks their own language and doesn't necessarily learn
the common language _ and they don't really become British or
Canadian or American. They simply live in those countries and the
political system sort of stitches together compromises between
these groups.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The French image is quite different, but not xenophobic at
all,'' he said, recalling the numbers of Poles, Russians and others
who have settled over the century. Their model, he said, is ``that
anybody of any race, national origin or whatever can become French,
but they've got to really become French _ French defined in French
terms.'' Germany, with an ethnically based view of citizenship, has
had a different debate about immigration, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Policies and programs to overcome hurdles like language barriers
are scant in much of Europe because cultural homogeneity has been
deeply valued, citizenship has often been defined ethnically or
linguistically, and the naturalization process that has made
Americans out of millions of foreigners does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while Britain may now be the most racially diverse
and integrated nation in Europe, restrictions on immigrants from
outside the European Union remain. Skinhead violence against
non-Europeans has erupted from Scandinavia into Central and Eastern
Europe. In Denmark, a right-wing nationalist leader proposed
recently that all Muslims should be rounded up and put in camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have European governments that continue to deploy the most
sophisticated forms of immigration control,'' said Arthur C.
Helton, an international lawyer who is now a senior fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations. ``Yet European societies thirst ever
more for new blood and labor, which will come from outside of
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   How to manage that? Helton said the example of the United States
is instructive. Immigration there ``has not only inspired but
enforced a set of ways to manage conflict that Europeans are going
to have to either borrow or invent,'' he said. ``There is a
profound recognition by most Americans that this a country more
about change than about status. Europeans had better get ready for
change.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, protection of minorities is often seen as enough.
``But people don't want to be beneficiaries of minority rights
arrangements,'' Helton said. ``So there is a dilemma. Immigrants
want to preserve their language and culture but do not wish to be
stigmatized as second-class citizens. That's a delicate balance
that often is missed, and it leads to intolerance, discrimination,
backlash, race riots and the lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum says that this is where political leadership comes
in, and that is as difficult to predict as anything else. With the
combination of low fertility and high immigration, he said, ``you
can have everything from prosperous peace and comity to disastrous,
disintegrative civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot,'' he said, ``depends on the actions of political
leaderships, to either exploit fears or to try to deal with them.''

<P>
   Five years ago, responding to an increase in serious juvenile
crime, the state of Maryland initiated one of the nation's largest
boot camp programs for teen-age criminals. The program, called the
Leadership Challenge, quickly became the model for other states.
But last week, after reviewing a task force report that documented
instances of physical abuse at their camps, Maryland officials
appeared on the verge of conceding that the current initiative was
a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland experience, together with problems in other states,
has already led some states to close their boot camps and even to
rethink how their penal laws treat young offenders. All in all, it
is a remarkable turn of events for an idea that was once greeted as
a breakthrough in the fight against juvenile crime
</P>
<P>
   There is increasing evidence that boot-camps never worked. A
national study last year by the Koch Crime Institute, a public
policy group in Topeka, Kan., showed that recidivism among boot
camp attendees ranged from 64 percent to 75 percent, slightly
higher than for youths sentenced to adult prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Wells, a senior research associate at the Koch Institute,
said of the report, ``The shocking parts are the allegations of
abuse, but the more alarming parts are the failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Research has also shown, according to Wells and other penal
justice experts, that these camps were grounded in a false and
unexamined assumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought boot camps shaped up a lot of servicemen during
three wars,'' Wells added. ``But just because you place someone in
a highly structured environment with discipline, does not mean once
they get home, and are out of that, they will be model citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Boot camps have their roots in the 1970s, with the advent of
large, well-organized and extremely violent street gangs. In
response to these groups, many states began to imprison more young
people.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1990s, as the number of repeat juvenile offenders rose to
record levels, it became clear that prison sentences were not
working. In 1994, nearly 10,000 juveniles were charged with
criminal offenses, an all-time high. More than 2,300 of them were
charged with murder, compared with fewer than 1,000 in 1980,
according to the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention. On any given day, about 105,000
children were in custody on criminal charges in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this atmosphere that Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend began exploring the potential of boot camps.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after being elected with Gov. Parris Glendening in 1994,
Ms. Townsend, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the
Clinton administration, said she considered boot camps ``a
cost-effective, intermediate punishment'' and included them among
her priorities.

<P>
   Ms. Townsend has said the idea came from visiting a juvenile
boot camp in Ohio. By then, a handful of states, including Georgia,
Louisiana, West Virginia and Ohio, had begun well-publicized,
promising experiments with juvenile camps.
</P>
<P>
   The camps, modeled after similar programs that popped up in
England in the 1970s, were designed for juveniles who had committed
moderately serious crimes, such as auto theft, with the goal of
interceding before they moved to more serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, more than 27,000 teen-agers were passing through 54
camps in 23 states annually.
</P>
<P>
   The people who ran the real boot camps, were quite skeptical.
``The key reason we are successful is that we have a clientele down
here that chose to be here on their own,'' said Sgt. Maj. Ford
Kinsley, who oversees drill instructors at U.S. Marine Corps'
recruitment base in Parris Island, S.C. ``They are not here because
a judge said you should go here. Our population comes with a lot
more positive attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that when ``a kid graduates from Parris Island, he is
just beginning a four- or five-year enlistment in the Marine Corps.
It is not like they spend 11 months here and we just throw them out
onto the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, the Marines traditionally chooses the best of its
noncommissioned officers as boot camp instructors. By contrast,
state standards vary widely.

<P>
   Rumors began to surface of beatings at Maryland's boot camps
last August, and Ms. Townsend ordered an end to all inappropriate
physical contact. But news reports in December suggesting such
violations had continued led Ms. Townsend and Glendening to launch
an investigatory task force chaired by former Baltimore Police
Commissioner Bishop Robinson, who also spent 10 years in charge of
the state's prison system.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, the task force released a report that accused guards
of routine and brutal beatings of inmates, and Glendening and Ms.
Townsend suspended the state's camps and dismissed the top five
juvenile justice officials.

<P>
   Five years ago, responding to an increase in serious juvenile
crime, the state of Maryland initiated one of the nation's largest
boot camp programs for teen-age criminals. The program, called the
Leadership Challenge, quickly became the model for other states.
But last week, after reviewing a task force report that documented
instances of physical abuse at their camps, Maryland officials
appeared on the verge of conceding that the current initiative was
a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland experience, together with problems in other states,
has already led some states to close their boot camps and even to
rethink how their penal laws treat young offenders. All in all, it
is a remarkable turn of events for an idea that was once greeted as
a breakthrough in the fight against juvenile crime
</P>
<P>
   There is increasing evidence that boot-camps never worked. A
national study last year by the Koch Crime Institute, a public
policy group in Topeka, Kan., showed that recidivism among boot
camp attendees ranged from 64 percent to 75 percent, slightly
higher than for youths sentenced to adult prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Wells, a senior research associate at the Koch Institute,
said of the report, ``The shocking parts are the allegations of
abuse, but the more alarming parts are the failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Research has also shown, according to Wells and other penal
justice experts, that these camps were grounded in a false and
unexamined assumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought boot camps shaped up a lot of servicemen during
three wars,'' Wells added. ``But just because you place someone in
a highly structured environment with discipline, does not mean once
they get home, and are out of that, they will be model citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Boot camps have their roots in the 1970s, with the advent of
large, well-organized and extremely violent street gangs. In
response to these groups, many states began to imprison more young
people.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1990s, as the number of repeat juvenile offenders rose to
record levels, it became clear that prison sentences were not
working. In 1994, nearly 10,000 juveniles were charged with
criminal offenses, an all-time high. More than 2,300 of them were
charged with murder, compared with fewer than 1,000 in 1980,
according to the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention. On any given day, about 105,000
children were in custody on criminal charges in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this atmosphere that Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend began exploring the potential of boot camps.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after being elected with Gov. Parris Glendening in 1994,
Ms. Townsend, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the
Clinton administration, said she considered boot camps ``a
cost-effective, intermediate punishment'' and included them among
her priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Townsend has said the idea came from visiting a juvenile
boot camp in Ohio. By then, a handful of states, including Georgia,
Louisiana, West Virginia and Ohio, had begun well-publicized,
promising experiments with juvenile camps.
</P>
<P>
   The camps, modeled after similar programs that popped up in
England in the 1970s, were designed for juveniles who had committed
moderately serious crimes, such as auto theft, with the goal of
interceding before they moved to more serious crimes.

</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, the task force released a report that accused guards
of routine and brutal beatings of inmates, and Glendening and Ms.
Townsend suspended the state's camps and dismissed the top five
juvenile justice officials.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similar accusations have led state and local officials in
Colorado, North Dakota, and Arizona to drop their programs, while
Florida and California are scaling back theirs. In Georgia,
officials revamped their program after a Justice Department
investigation concluded that the state's ``paramilitary boot camp
model is not only ineffective, but harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts regard the entire boot camp experiment as a cynical
political maneuver. ``Boot camps were just another knee-jerk
reaction, a way to get tough with juveniles that resonated with the
public and became a political answer,'' said Dr. David Altschuler,
a juvenile justice expert at the Institute for Policy Studies at
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some believe the programs, in some form, can be useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are tough kids, with tough problems, they need good
education and drug treatment and they also need to learn respect,
self-respect, discipline and a new way of conducting themselves in
society,'' Ms. Townsend said. ``Facilities that provide structure
and discipline can be run effectively and have a role in our fight
after juvenile crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts disagree, citing the expense of running such
programs properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a budget issue,'' said Doris Mackenzie, a University of
Maryland criminology professor. ``They are popular in the public,
people feel we should treat these kids tough, and everyone can get
onto the bandwagon,'' she said. ``But when it comes to this extra
expense of doing the follow-up, we find, the money is not there.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, juvenile crime has been falling since 1994, after
an overall drop in the nation's juvenile population. This will make
it highly unlikely, say political observers, that voters will agree
to pay for individualized rehabilitation. Much more likely, they
say, is that the 27,000 young people who once went to boot camp
each year will instead be sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   As bad as boot camps have proven to be, Wells added, ``once you
start incarcerating kids, you have lost. But unfortunately, that is
where we seem headed.''

<P>
   High above the sparkling blue sweep of the Bay of Algiers, with
panoramic views over whitewashed colonial palaces and palm-treed
gardens that still make the city one of the jewels of the
Mediterranean, there is a magnificent hostelry.
</P>
<P>
   Once a palace, it became, at the height of France's 130 years of
colonial rule in Algeria, the St. George's Hotel. On an upper
floor, with a balcony scented in the springtime with mimosa
blossoms, there is a suite with a brass plaque at the door
recording the fact that General Dwight D. Eisenhower occupied the
suite for several months in 1942 and 1943, when U.S. and allied
troops were pushing German forces eastward along the north African
coast during World War II. Everyone knew, in that dark winter, the
strategic importance of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   But that moment, during the climactic war of the 20th century,
may have been the last time the American public really focused its
attention on Algeria. Today, amid fears of a new kind of warfare _
far less intense but nonetheless frightening _ Algeria is once
again thrusting itself onto America's consciousness, now that
figures linked to its Islamic underground have been arrested while
seemingly intent on bringing their terrorist war into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, an utterly different Algeria. Today, the St.
George's is the El-Djazair Hotel, state-owned like much else in
independent Algeria, its lobby re-done in the over-marbled,
socialist-modern style familiar from visits to communist Eastern
Europe. The armchairs by the front door are occupied 24 hours a day
by the slim-hipped, chain-smoking watchdogs of the Algerian
security police, without whose guardianship no trip outside the
hotel by foreigners is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Americans hardly ever come. They have been warned off by nearly
40 years of military-dominated government since independence, by
socialist economic policies that have all but wrecked the economy,
and above all by an eight-year civil war. The conflict has been one
of the most savage anywhere since Algeria's previous conflict, the
one from 1954 to 1962 in which the French colonial army fought
fruitlessly to stave off independence. About a million people died
in that earlier fighting, and so far about 100,000 have died in the
current carnage. Many of the new victims have died at the hands of
a shadowy guerrilla movement known, by its French initials, as the
GIA _ the Armed Islamic Group.
</P>
<P>
   If a visitor wants to know something about the GIA, or about the
wider conflict in which it has been fighting for an extreme form of
Islamic rule, there are few better places to venture than up the
hill from the El-Djazair, to one of the grandest U.S. embassies
anywhere, set in breathtakingly lovely grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Here, amid graceful inner courtyards and arches, U.S. diplomats
have a command of the political and economic miseries beyond the
embassy's high walls. The view is all the more impressive for the
fact that the Algerian security police, and the State Department's
own rules, make venturing out of the compound about as easy as
heading out from a cavalry fort in Indian country. The current
ambassador, Cameron Hume, a man of formidable charm and intellect,
has defied the security rules to travel about more than most
ambassadors, but even he would not exactly claim to be a denizen of
the place.
</P>
<P>
   All of which may go some way to explain why, two weeks ago, many
Americans were puzzled to learn that an Algerian man had been
arrested while driving off a car ferry from Canada at Port Angeles,
Wash., with, U.S. customs officials allege, enough bomb-making
material in the trunk of his car to blow up almost any building.
Suddenly there were headlines across America about Ahmed Ressam and
the wider terrorist threat he has been thought to represent. But
what of the country he hails from, and why might he have wanted to
bomb a target in the United States? Above all, what is it that
Americans must now begin to understand about Algeria?
</P>
<P>
   The plain fact is that Algeria, however distant it has grown to
Americans since it made headlines for them during World War II,
remains of enormous strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it the largest country on the African continent, in
terms of area; it also has vast oil and gas reserves that have kept
American oilmen barracked at remote sites in the Sahara desert for
30 years or more. Today, they are in fact the most numerous
Americans in Algeria, even if for the most part they pass swiftly
through Algiers and the other major cities, and have little contact
with the larger society.

</P>
<P>
   As significant as its resources, Algeria fills a long stretch of
the southern Mediterranean, and thus is of compelling military and
political significance. And what happens is Algeria is of profound
significance to many of America's key allies in Western Europe.
Algiers is only an overnight ferry journey from Marseilles and even
closer to Spain, allowing Algeria's enfeebled economy to send at
least 3 million Algerians to Europe as immigrant workers in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the war, and how it may have led to Ressam
driving off that ferry in Washington state. In this, perhaps more
than anything else, Algeria matters to Americans these days.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of modern Islamic radicalism, two countries have
played pivotal roles _ Iran toward one end of the so-called
``crescent'' of Muslim nations that reaches from Morocco and
Mauritania in the west to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east, and
Algeria toward the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago Iran mesmerized the world with its mullahs'
revolution, with its seizure of U.S. diplomats and their embassy in
Tehran and, later, with the religious decree that urged the killing
of the novelist Salman Rushdie. Algeria, in 1992, lit fires of
equal intensity among Islamic radicals when its secular government
called parliamentary elections, the first more-or-less free ones in
the country's history, but canceled them at the last minute when an
Islamic party, the Islamic Salvation Front, was on the verge of
victory. The army generals had thought canceling the elections was
a good idea; their reward was the rise of the G.I.A., a breakaway
from the Islamic Salvation Front. Rather than try again for a
generally moderate form of Islamic government, this group espoused
worldwide holy war, going well beyond the Salvation Front
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict that resulted brought to Algeria a ghastliness that
has been stunning, even by the standards of a country that knew
extraordinary savagery, on both the French and the Algerian sides,
during the independence war. The GIA, propagating among its
fighters the belief that the triumph of Islam justifies the killing
of anybody who does not actively support them, has gone into
villages and towns and slaughtered hundreds of civilians at a time,
often by cutting throats.
</P>
<P>
   The army has responded in kind, setting up militias called
``Patriotes'' and other shadowy units; these are believed to have
taken a leaf from France's counter-insurgency tactics in the 1950s,
when ``rogue'' units set up to look like fighters of the
independence guerrillas went about massacring villagers. Several
thousand people have disappeared after being arrested by the army
and police, and cemeteries in Algiers and elsewhere are strewn with
gravestones carrying the sinister marking ``X Algerien,'' often
meaning that the person buried there was killed in custody and
buried anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   From this background have sprung faceless battalions of the GIA
in Europe, and from among them, investigators believe, came Ressam.
So if he is another kind of ``X Algerien'' to Americans, it may be
time to strip away that anonymity, to learn more about him and his
country and their tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Six decades ago, a U.S. general in Room 1101 at the St. George's
Hotel learned at first hand why Algeria mattered; it is a lesson
that it may be time to relearn.

 UNDATED: larger society.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As significant as its resources, Algeria fills a long stretch of
the southern Mediterranean, and thus is of compelling military and
political significance. And what happens is Algeria is of profound
significance to many of America's key allies in Western Europe.
Algiers is only an overnight ferry journey from Marseilles and even
closer to Spain, allowing Algeria's enfeebled economy to send at
least 3 million Algerians to Europe as immigrant workers in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the war, and how it may have led to Ressam
driving off that ferry in Washington state. In this, perhaps more
than anything else, Algeria matters to Americans these days.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of modern Islamic radicalism, two countries have
played pivotal roles _ Iran toward one end of the so-called
``crescent'' of Muslim nations that reaches from Morocco and
Mauritania in the west to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east, and
Algeria toward the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago Iran mesmerized the world with its mullahs'
revolution, with its seizure of U.S. diplomats and their embassy in
Tehran and, later, with the religious decree that urged the killing
of the novelist Salman Rushdie. Algeria, in 1992, lit fires of
equal intensity among Islamic radicals when its secular government
called parliamentary elections, the first more-or-less free ones in
the country's history, but canceled them at the last minute when an
Islamic party, the Islamic Salvation Front, was on the verge of
victory. The army generals had thought canceling the elections was
a good idea; their reward was the rise of the G.I.A., a breakaway
from the Islamic Salvation Front. Rather than try again for a
generally moderate form of Islamic government, this group espoused
worldwide holy war, going well beyond the Salvation Front
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict that resulted brought to Algeria a ghastliness that
has been stunning, even by the standards of a country that knew
extraordinary savagery, on both the French and the Algerian sides,
during the independence war. The GIA, propagating among its
fighters the belief that the triumph of Islam justifies the killing
of anybody who does not actively support them, has gone into
villages and towns and slaughtered hundreds of civilians at a time,
often by cutting throats.
</P>
<P>
   The army has responded in kind, setting up militias called
``Patriotes'' and other shadowy units; these are believed to have
taken a leaf from France's counter-insurgency tactics in the 1950s,
when ``rogue'' units set up to look like fighters of the
independence guerrillas went about massacring villagers. Several
thousand people have disappeared after being arrested by the army
and police, and cemeteries in Algiers and elsewhere are strewn with
gravestones carrying the sinister marking ``X Algerien,'' often
meaning that the person buried there was killed in custody and
buried anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   From this background have sprung faceless battalions of the GIA
in Europe, and from among them, investigators believe, came Ressam.
So if he is another kind of ``X Algerien'' to Americans, it may be
time to strip away that anonymity, to learn more about him and his
country and their tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Six decades ago, a U.S. general in Room 1101 at the St. George's
Hotel learned at first hand why Algeria mattered; it is a lesson
that it may be time to relearn.

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Distrust of ethnic strangers runs so deep in
Burundi that there is a special insult _ ``ikimenabanga'' _ for the
person within a group who says too much, the one who breaks the
secret. It is safer to stay quiet, to keep to one's own kind.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a great distance between that kind of simple
suspicion and the hatreds that seem to have exploded in the last
decade with relentless regularity in Burundi, Rwanda and eastern
Congo _ the Great Lakes area of Africa. Documented genocide
occurred there in 1994, when Hutu extremists in Rwanda meticulously
slaughtered at least half a million ethnic Tutsi. The fighting
continued in the form of a rebellion within Rwanda and spilled into
Congo _ then known as Zaire _ helping to shatter that country in
1997. Burundi has been rent by civil warfare that started in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hutu fighters who fled Rwanda in 1994 are preying there
again, in a war that has dragged in at least eight other nations.
And in Burundi, Rwanda's southern twin, the Tutsi elite who rule
the country have herded into hillside camps 350,000 people, most of
them Hutu farmers, to separate them from Hutu guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   All of this fighting makes Africa's Great Lakes region one of
the most grim and complicated places on earth, one where
well-intentioned outsiders periodically wonder whether, and how,
they might step in to halt the violence. Each time, the question
comes down to this: Are these spasms of killing the result of old
hatreds, or are they grotesque products of political manipulation?
</P>
<P>
   To many outsiders ``ancient tribal hatreds'' has been the
formula easiest to accept, since it lends a patina of logic to
indifference _ to saying that there is little that outsiders could
do, even if they were willing. That is a position that underlay the
outside world's inaction during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not what most experts on Africa say. The hatreds are
real, the experts say, but they are not ancient at all _ and are
not really different from ethnic conflicts anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   In broad outline, the conflicts in Africa are quite like those
in the Balkans: Ancient divisions, even animosities, exist, but it
takes a political elite to seize on them and transform them into
something far more violent as politicians seek power for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is not ancient ethnic or tribal hatred,'' said
Filip Reyntjens, a professor at the Universities of Antwerp and
Leuven and a leading scholar of the Great Lakes region. ``That is a
vision many Europeans and North Americans have because it is an
easy way to explain what happens in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars generally agree on the ethnic shape of the Great Lakes
before the colonists _ first Germans, then Belgians _ arrived in
the late 19th century. There were three distinct groups of people:
the Hutu, who tended to be farmers (more than 80 percent today);
the Tutsi, who arrived on the land later as nomads and tended to
raise cattle (about 15 percent); and the Twa, or pygmies (perhaps 1
percent). There were rivalries, even animosities, but none of the
episodes of ethnic killing that have scarred the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Twa _ who were truly discriminated against _ the
lines between Hutu and Tutsi were not always firm. The monarchies
in pre-colonial Rwanda and Burundi were led by Tutsi but high court
officials were often Hutu. Intermarriage was common, even if there
were tensions between ruler and ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Along came the European colonists, who imposed their own ideas
about race and superiority, and tended to put one group officially
in power over the others. They preferred the Tutsi, who were viewed
as taller, thinner, smarter (and thus more like the Europeans).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Batutsi were meant to reign,'' wrote one Belgian
administrator in the 1920's, according to the French author Gerard
Prunier in his authoritative book on the genocide, ``The Rwanda
Crisis''(Columbia University Press, 1995). ``Their fine presence is
in itself enough to give them a great prestige vis-a-vis the
inferior races which surround. It is not surprising that those good
Bahutu, less intelligent, more simple, more spontaneous, more
trusting, have let themselves be enslaved without ever daring to
revolt.''
</P>
<P>
   What the colonists did, said Alison Des Forges, a historian and
consultant for Human Rights Watch, ``was take this system that was
relatively fluid and turned it into something very rigid and
hierarchical.''
</P>
<P>
   B Y the time the Belgians were preparing to withdraw from Rwanda
and Burundi in the late 1950s, many experts argue, the lines
between Hutu and Tutsi were firmly drawn, and resentment among the
Hutu was strong.
</P>
<P>
   First, in Rwanda, Hutu clamoring for power killed many Tutsi in
1959; partly in response, the Tutsi elite in Burundi hardened their
control. (The Rwanda fighting also created a group of Tutsi exiles
whose children would become the guerrillas who took control in
1994.) In Burundi, a unifying figure, Prince Louis Rwagasore, arose
among the Tutsi but was assassinated in 1961.

<P>
   After independence came to both nations in 1962, the
polarization in both only increased with round after round of
ethnic slaughters. People were killed merely for belonging to one
ethnic group or the other, something that had never happened in
either country.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, that cycle came to a crisis under the presidency of
Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu whose administration demonized all
Tutsi as supporters of rebels fighting to oust him. His death in a
plane crash in April 1994, in which the Burundian president also
died, set off the 100 days of slaughter of Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   Now the problems continue with the war in Congo and the
seemingly intractable battles between the Hutu rebels and Tutsi
leadership in Burundi. There is not a great deal of hope among most
experts that the problems will be settled soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that we are now in a situation where fear has
become the most powerful spur to violence,'' Ms. Des Forges said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these experts believe there is room for the outside world
to become engaged. The ideal for beginning to rebuild trust, Ms.
Des Forges said, is that outside nations find a way to guarantee
that there will be no more ethnic slaughters in either country For
Rwanda, she added, the international community could show
evenhandedness not only by continuing to bring the Hutu killers to
justice but by not ignoring abuses committed by the Tutsi leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In Burundi, Jan van Eck, a consultant with the Center for
Conflict Resolution in Cape Town, said that each party must have a
place at the negotiating table _ an approach that seems to have
been adopted by the new mediator to the conflict, Nelson Mandela,
who has some experience as a uniting force in his own country,
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, van Eck pointed out, the amount of blood already spilled
may at this point become an argument for ending the violence. In
Burundi, for example, so many people have blood on their hands _
Hutu and Tutsi alike _ that their own mutually awful pasts may
offer an opening for starting anew. ``They always said: Hang all
the people who committed crimes, or shoot them,'' van Eck said.
``But now there is a realization that there might be too many.''

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Jan. 2, 2000:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Millennium and Y2K Package: &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-WHAT-PROBLEM? (Undated) _ Now that the year 2000 has arrived
around the world without significant disruptions of power,
transportation, commerce, and other activities dependent on
computers, the question arises: Was the problem overstated, or was
it all those hundreds of billions of dollars that were spent to fix
things that prevented a catastrophe? By Barnaby J. Feder and Andrew
C. Revkin.
</P>
<P>
   HYPE-MILLENNIUM (New York) _ Before the countdown, the
cork-popping, the confetti and the computer worries _ indeed, long
before most people had personal computers _ there was anticipation.
And no one did more anticipating than Edward L. Woodyard, a
screenwriter who made his reservations for New Year's Eve 1999 in
1984, when the hotel in Times Square where he finally did his
celebrating on Friday night was a half-finished skeleton of steel
and concrete. By James Barron
</P>
<P>
   WHITEHOUSE-MILLENNIUM (Washington) _ Despite the beluga and the
rack of lamb, Elizabeth Taylor in a pink boa and Lara Flynn Boyle
nuzzling Jack Nicholson at a table near the back of the East Room,
the White House Millennium supper seemed oddly like a business
dinner. As arriving guests _ some 360 artists, scientists and
fund-raisers, along with major donors, loyal senators and favorite
employees _ filed past reporters in the entryway of the White
House, more than a few took the opportunity to plug some project or
product. By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-MILLENNIUM (Undated) _ By the time midnight struck in
Maui, even the Internet's most dedicated harbingers of millennium
doom had to concede that things had turned out better than they had
expected. ``Does anyone still think TEOTWAWKI will happen??'' typed
one presumably sleep-deprived Y2K watcher, using the favorite chat
room shorthand for ``the end of the world as we know it.'' Her
virtual comrades on Timebomb2000.com were remarkably silent. By Amy
Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-KOSKINEN (Washington) _ It was three hours before midnight
on Friday and John A. Koskinen did not appear worried a bit. His
head was back. His eyes were closed. And a flight attendant aboard
the last Delta Shuttle flight of 1999 from New York to Washington
was urging him, to no avail, to put his seat back into the upright
position. It was three hours before midnight and the federal
government's Year 2000 coordinator, President Clinton's point man
on the potentially debilitating computer glitch, was fast asleep.
By Marc Lacey.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-MILLENIUM (London) _ The scene at Britain's millennial
dome as the New Year came in. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-MILLENNIUM (Teotihuacan, Mexico) _ What does the turning
of a millennium mean for a place that has had a continuous history
for thousands of years and where the calendar was invented? By
Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-FIDEL-ANNIVERSARY (Havana) _ For Cubans, Saturday is not
only the start of a new year and a new millennium, it is also the
anniversary of Fidel Castro's revolution. By David Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-MILLENNIUM (Rome) _ John Paul II blessed 35,000 runners who
participated in a marathon for peace Saturday morning after warming
them up with a New Year's Day message dedicated to that theme. By
Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-MEXICO-MILLENNIUM (Laredo, Texas) _ In a vivid reminder
that many people along the Texas-Mexico border regard the region as
one country instead of two, the mayors of Laredo and its Mexican
sister city, Nuevo Laredo, walked across one of the bridges above
the Rio Grande and celebrated the new millennium with an
international hug and a kiss. The meeting was freighted with
symbolism for this isolated border region where culture and
nationality seem as blurred and fluid as the Rio Grande itself. By
Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   MAINE-MILLENNIUM (Lubec, Maine) _ It feels a bit silly to report
that yes, indeed, the sun came up here today. But this was no
ordinary dawn. Set on the easternmost point in the continental
United States, the candy-cane-striped light house at West Quoddy
Head here attracted nearly 500 people so eager to greet the new
millennium Saturday morning that they wanted to be sure to catch
the very first rays of its first American day. It was not to be. By
Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   SMALLTOWN-MILLENNIUM (Sycamore, Ill.) _ In this small town on
the frozen Midwestern prairie, people marked the passing of the
1900s in gentle, personal ways. At midnight, children scampered to
front porches, shouting in high-pitched voices and banging pots and
pans in a noisy, homespun welcome of the new year. For many, the
promise of 2000 came like a glistening gift. ``It's a wonderful
time,'' said John Garman, 62. ``There is peace on earth.'' By Dirk
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-MILLENNIUM (Hollywood) _ With flashing strobe lights,
hovering helicopters, and a typically atomized approach, Los
Angeles said goodbye to the 20th century Saturday morning in a
celebration that fell short of its own aims, dampened by rain and
by Southern California's seeming inability to get too awfully
excited about anything. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   HAWAII-MILLENNIUM (Honolulu) _ All over the island,  &UR; noise. &LR;  The
fireworks were not supposed to start before 9 p.m. Yet by then, the
cacophony was such that conversations had to be shouted or mimed or
postponed. Tourists were flabbergasted. ``It sounds like an air
war,'' said Elizabeth Williams, who could not help holding her
fingers in her ears. ``A person could go deaf after this.'' By
Evelyn Nieves.

   RUSSIA-YELTSIN (Moscow) _ On his first full day as Russia's new
acting president, Vladimir Putin left before dawn to visit with
Russian troops fighting in Chechnya, handing out hunting knives as
presidential souvenirs. Besides offering the nation a new image of
an active, concerned leader, the visit reflected Putin's close
association with the Chechnya battle. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ASSESS (Moscow) _ If Vladimir Putin's visit last week to
the federal Railways Ministry is any indication, Russia may be in
for an interesting trip indeed. As the Moscow daily Kommersant
reported, Putin, in icy tone, asked why the railroads beseech the
Kremlin for money when certain customers got special shipping
discounts. The extraordinary scene suggests there is more than one
way to look at Putin's pledge to restore a strong central
government to Russia. By Michael Wines.

eating a home-cooked meal. By Barry Bearak.

order cat. So along with the spread of Cantonese-style restaurants
in Beijing in the last few years has come a new problem:
cat-nabbing, to supply meat for demanding customers. By Erik

   KYRGYZSTAN-EPIC (Osh, Kyrgystan) _ On most days, 11-year-old
Azamat Malikov spends at least an hour or two doing what comes
naturally to many people in Kyrgyzstan. He works at memorizing what
is said to be the world's longest epic poem _ a work that binds the
Kyrgyz people together, allowing them, many believe, to survive

   MAINE-MARIJUANA (Undated) _ When voters in Maine went to the
polls in November and endorsed the use of marijuana as a medicine,
it was more than a victory for cancer patients and others who say
marijuana will help relieve their pain. For a small coalition of
libertarians, liberals, humanitarians and hedonists, the vote was
another step forward in a low-profile but sophisticated crusade to
end the nation's criminal laws against marijuana and other
psychoactive drugs. By Christopher S. Wren.

the butt of demeaning ``Mr. Mom'' jokes, these men have ``come out

<P>
   For much of the American public, the 2000 election for the White
House starts at the beginning of January. The holidays have passed
and in a presidential election year that means that the country is
ready to attend to what the candidates are doing and saying.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, done and said. The truth is that most people are
tuning in rather late. In all likelihood, the Democratic and
Republican contests will be settled in just nine weeks, if not by
the first week of February.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, more and more states have inched their primaries
back to the starting line, competing to assure their influence over
the nominee. It has been a haphazard process, following no grand
plan of either party, if countenanced by some Republican and
Democratic leaders who believe that avoiding an intramural primary
struggle is the recipe for a strong general election nominee. The
result, though, is that nearly 75 percent of the delegates will be
chosen by the middle of March, even as the primaries continue
through June 6.
</P>
<P>
   But is that progress? As the primary season begins in earnest,
there seems to be a consensus among political leaders and academics
that it is not: that this constant tinkering with the political
calendar has produced the opposite of what had been intended.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a nominating process that engages voters, the
ever-shortening calendar is more apt to disenfranchise them, with
its early finish and narrow window within which to consider the
candidates. Instead of assuring big states a big voice in the final
nominee, the calendar dilutes their influence, since so many of
them have crowded their primaries onto the same two early Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   And, instead of producing formidable general election
standard-bearers, the process turns out nominees who might, come
the tumult of the fall campaign, wish they had devoted more time to
what is the political equivalent of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being rushed to judgment,'' said William Galvin,
the Massachusetts secretary of state and the chairman of the
Committee on Presidential Primaries of the National Association of
Secretaries of State. ``It's become a candidate death watch,
instead of an effort at finding out who these people are.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: well before January, a series of presumably
credible candidates for president _ among them, former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander and and former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole _ had already quit the race, largely because they
could not figure out how to surmount the political calendar. The
exhausting schedule of cross-country primaries that awaits the
field on March 7 and March 14 has put a premium on the
candidate-as-fund-raiser, in order to raise the money to finance
travel and multistate advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, that suffocates the long-shot candidate, like Paul
Tsongas in 1992 or Bruce Babbitt in 1988, who had once put
excitement into American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates are, of course, supposed to drop out if they do badly
in New Hampshire and Iowa. But not to even make it to the startling
line? ``This is the first year that I can remember where a whole
lot of candidates dropped out before a single vote was cast,'' said
William G. Mayer, a professor of political science at Northeast
University and co-author of ``The Modern Politics of Presidential
Selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowans and New Hampshirites, long used to being the first judges
of candidates' credentials and ideas, may be excused for feeling a
little rushed. As big states have shouldered to the front of the
primary line, New Hampshire and Iowa have edged back to protect
their historic first-in-the-nation status. The New Hampshire
primary is now Feb. 1, or 20 days earlier than it was in 1996, a
long time in retail politics.
</P>
<P>
   Political campaigns remain engaging and meaningful to many
Americans in part because voters are so unpredictable _ especially
in New Hampshire and Iowa. That said, most analysts believe the
nominees will be known by the close-of-polls on March 7, by which
time 43 percent of the elected Republican delegates and 37 percent
of the Democratic delegates will have been selected. And if not
then, certainly by the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like 75 percent of the delegates have been selected by
the middle of March, which is faster than last time,'' said Barbara
Norrander, professor of political science at the University of
Arizona. ``And last time it was faster than the time before.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is conceivable that the race could be over on Feb. 1,
especially on the Republican side. If Sen. John McCain fails to
defeat Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire, after waging a
spirited campaign there, his own supporters have trouble seeing how
he could survive.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a number of Democrats question how long former Sen.
Bill Bradley can continue if he does not make a strong showing
against Vice President Al Gore there (presumably a victory, though
a near-victory has done the trick for candidates in the past).
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley are both examples of the type of candidates
who have historically flourished in New Hampshire: slightly
insurgent and underfunded. But even if both should win there, the
calendar works against them pushing on to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Democratic primaries until March 7, but there are
16 contests on that day, from New York to California. It is worse
for McCain. Before March 7, he faces contests in South Carolina,
Arizona and Michigan. That schedule could not be more problematic
for an underfunded candidate running outside of the establishment.
Nor could it be more accommodating for Bush, who spent much of last
year raising money to prepare himself precisely for this moment.

   ``McCain and Bradley have had enormous breaks in this race _ and
it's still uphill for them,'' said Charles E. Cook Jr., the editor
of a Washington-based political report. ``They still have to thread
a needle.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the present primary system reduce the chance of an
outsider winning a nomination, it will likely force them out of the
race sooner, thus reducing the chance that they will help shape the
positions of their party or their nominee. This, in turn, may leave
their supporters feeling shut out of and disinterested in
participating in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional view among party professionals is that the
system produces a good result for the party: an early nominee.
`It's a bad thing to keep going: you'd rather get it out of the
way,'' said James Carville, the consultant to President Clinton.
``Find one fighter that likes to get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   As the primary season grows shorter each cycle, that
once-dominant view holds less and less sway. ``It's bad for the
candidate because you don't get the same feel for the country,''
said Paul Begala, who worked with Carville in running Clinton's
1992 campaign. ``I traveled with Bill Clinton to 48 states, by my
count. You learn a lot. You see a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Less time campaigning also means less examination of a
candidates' record, experience and past. And there are tactical
complications posed by becoming the candidate too early.
</P>
<P>
   How does a candidate fill the long months between winning the
nomination and the summer convention? How do they compete with the
Reform Party's likely candidates, notably Donald Trump, who may
have the stage largely to himself in the spring? How do the
campaigns hold on to the voters' attention, or do they at all?
Witness what happened with Bob Dole in 1996, as he struggled to
distance himself from congressional Republicans pushing policies
that played against his own campaign interests.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with few exceptions, no one is happy with the way the
system has evolved, and both the national Republican and Democratic
committees have set up commissions to examine how or if to change
it. ``If the front-loading does result in people believing they do
not play the role they would otherwise, we have to do something
about it,'' said Joe Andrew, the national Democratic chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bond, the former national Republican chairman, offered a
more fundamental concern about the process. ``I'm a gray-hair now,
and the gray-hairs of the Republican Party think it's better to
have a primary than not,'' Bond said. ``Because your guy gets
tested. A feverish contest that would resolve early enough is the
prescription for success.''

   ``We choose freedom because it gives us the power to live,
learn, and love,'' wrote students from Tanapag Elementary School in
the Northern Mariana Islands. Their essay, along with Ray Charles'
sunglasses, photos of Earth from space, a Twinkie, Corningware, a
computer chip, the Bill of Rights, a World War II helmet, a cell
phone and a piece of the Berlin Wall will be among the items sealed
this summer in the National Millennium Time Capsule until 2100.
</P>
<P>
   The time capsule prototype was unveiled Friday by President
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It is on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National
Museum of American History. The prototype stands 4 feet high, 6
feet long, 2 feet deep, carved out of wood in an American flag
motif.

   ``We developed 25 different designs, all shapes,'' said Jim

   The official chest will be fabricated in three metals. The white
strips will be formed in stainless steel, embodying America's
industrial past; the red strips will be formed in silicon bronze,
symbolizing communication, and blue stars will be crafted out of
titanium, a metal with space-age properties, representing America's
future.
</P>
<P>
   The items were solicited by the White House Millennium Council
from almost 400 congressional and presidential medalists and 56
recipients of the National Teacher of the Year award. James Watson,
director and president of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, submitted
a CD-ROM of the human genome project and said in his accompanying
written explanation that ``it will be biology's most important gift
ever to human society, being the instruction book for human
development and functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Louis Gates, director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute
for Afro-American Research and W.E.B. Du Bois Professor of the
Humanities at Harvard, sent in another CD-ROM, titled Encarta
Africana. ``At the beginning of the twentieth century,'' he
explained, ``W.E.B. Du Bois announced that the most effective way
to fight anti-black racism would be the publication of a
comprehensive encyclopedia of the black world. . . . Ninety years
later, some 400 scholars finally banded together to produce this
encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   The 85-letter Cherokee alphabet was submitted by Wilma
Mankiller, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, a winner of the
Medal of Freedom. She called it ``the language that has survived on
this land since time immemorial. It is hope for the future that the
Cherokee language will still be spoken 100 or even 500 years from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Playwright August Wilson suggested a recording by Bessie Smith
of ``Nobody in Town Can Bake a Sweet Jellyroll Like Mine'' because
the first time he heard the song, ``the universe stuttered and
everything fell to a new place. . . . It was a birth, a baptism, a
resurrection, and a redemption all rolled up into one. . . . The
ideas of self-determination, self-respect, and self-defense . . .
are still very much a part of my life as I sit down and write''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bell, executive director of Young Audiences, chose ``a
simple drawing or song created by a child. I believe this would
convey our commitment to future generations while at the same time
honoring the cultural legacy that sustains all Americans today.''
</P>
<P>
   The artistic director of the Steppenwolf Theatre Co. and Medal
of Arts winner Martha Lavey submitted ``Grapes of Wrath,'' saying:
``This novel captures a profound and constitutive experience in the
composition of the American psyche and culture. This is a nation
defined by the courage and fortitude of a citizenship seeking a
better, fairer, and more generous life.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Gregory Peck, among others, suggested ``a reel of a film
showing Neil Armstrong's landing on the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House Millennium Council plans to use all the objects
submitted. The submissions, or replicas of large items, will
ultimately be placed in smaller stainless steel capsules that can
fit in compartments, and essays will be placed in the lower
drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Gerald R. Ford wrote: ``Amidst all that is new,
however, may we never discard those ancient values _ courage and
compassion, integrity and reverence for things seen and unseen _
that have made America a historic refuge for the world's oppressed.
Our fondest hope for the new millennium is that we realize the
promise, older than the republic itself, of a land without limits,
as generous as it is inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 students taught by recipients of the national
teacher of the year award submitted individual and collective
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Preacher's fourth grade class in Oklahoma made an eagle out
of construction and origami paper, saying the eagle ``represents
our country and has many of the same traits of the U.S. It is
smart, brave, mighty and stands for freedom. . . . In America we
have rights that people do not have in other countries, and we
should be thankful.''
</P>
<P>
   The council has not received all contributions, and will
continue to accept submissions until the official capsule is
completed. Until then, the prototype will remain on display at the
Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. The
actual time capsule is expected to be completed by early summer.
That capsule will be on display in the rotunda at the National
Archives until the end of the year, then be relocated to a more
secure, climate-controlled area for future generations, to open in
100 years.

   ``We choose freedom because it gives us the power to live,
learn, and love,'' wrote students from Tanapag Elementary School in
the Northern Mariana Islands. Their essay, along with Ray Charles'
sunglasses, photos of Earth from space, a Twinkie, Corningware, a
computer chip, the Bill of Rights, a World War II helmet, a cell
phone and a piece of the Berlin Wall will be among the items sealed
this summer in the National Millennium Time Capsule until 2100.
</P>
<P>
   The time capsule prototype was unveiled Friday by President
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It is on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National
Museum of American History. The prototype stands 4 feet high, 6
feet long, 2 feet deep, carved out of wood in an American flag
motif.

   ``We developed 25 different designs, all shapes,'' said Jim
Biber, an architect from Pentagram who collaborated with Robert

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 2, 2,000, have moved.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the 2000 presidential primary
season begins, there seems to be a consensus among political
leaders and academics that the primary system as it has developed
has produced the opposite of what had been intended. Instead of a
process that engages voters, the ever-shortening calendar is more
apt to disenfranchise them, with its early finish and narrow window
within which to consider the candidates. Instead of assuring big
states a big voice in the final nominee, the calendar dilutes their
influence, since so many of them have crowded their primaries onto
the same two early Tuesdays. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-IMMIG-REVIEW (United Nations) _ In a few decades, say
demographers, Europe will face an American-style phenomenon more
unsettling than any superficial cultural symbol or business
intrusion. To survive economically and socially, Europe may have to
lower its bars to immigration and change its racial and ethnic face
through mass migration of labor from around the world. By Barbara
Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CANNIBALISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Cannibalism has been in the news
as rival experts try to get this bizarre but revealing topic into
focus. The issue is whether cannibalism was once a routine part of
human social behavior or is merely a myth designed to justify
advanced nations' domination over primitive and allegedly
anthropophagous peoples. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   BOOT-CAMPS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Boot camps for juvenile offenders
may be an idea whose time came and went. A number of states have
closed their boot camps and begun rethinking how their penal laws
treat young offenders. All in all, it is a remarkable turn of
events for an idea that was once greeted as a breakthrough in the
fight against juvenile crime. There is increasing evidence that
boot-camps never worked. By Jason Blair.
</P>
<P>
   PLAIN-LANGUAGE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A cottage industry of
plain-language consultants has sprung up in recent years. They aim
to wage war on the business buzzwords, governmental verbosity and
turgid legalese that make many public documents impossible to
understand. Some samples of the consultants' work.
</P>
<P>
   TIME-CAPSULE-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``We choose freedom because it
gives us the power to live, learn, and love,'' wrote students from
an elementary school in the Northern Mariana Islands. Their essay,
along with Ray Charles' sunglasses, photos of Earth from space, a
Twinkie, Corningware, a computer chip, the Bill of Rights, a World
War II helmet, a cell phone and a piece of the Berlin Wall will be
among the items sealed this summer in the National Millennium Time
Capsule until 2100. By Kari Haskell.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-YELTSIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ When Boris Yeltsin announced
his resignation on Dec. 31, 1999, he used the word ``power'' five
times. When Lenin issued his famous call to revolution on Oct. 24,
1917, he also used the word ``power'' five times. Lenin was about
to seize power and create the totalitarian system that Yeltsin
later toppled before relinquishing power. Yet power, and the thirst
for it, is the connection between two Russian leaders who only a
few years ago symbolized opposite extremes. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ALGERIA-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ During World War II, Americans
knew the strategic importance of Algeria. But that may have been
the last time they really focused their attention on it. Today,
amid fears of a new kind of warfare, Algeria is once again
thrusting itself onto America's consciousness, now that figures
linked to its Islamic underground have been accused of carrying
their terrorist war into the U.S. By John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-ATROCITIES-REVIEW (Nairobi) _ The violence in Africa's
Great Lakes region _ Burundi, Rwanda and eastern Congo _ makes it
one of the world's most grim and complicated places, one where
well-meaning outsiders periodically wonder whether, and how, they
might step in to halt the violence. The question comes down to
this: Are these spasms of killing the result of old hatreds, or are
they grotesque products of political manipulation? By Ian Fisher.

PAKISTANI SERIAL KILLER SAID HE STOPPED AT 100 VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan _ The mass murderer had spent much of the past
month hiding in a drainage culvert and later a cave. He looked
haggard. His clothes were dirty and wrinkled and wet. He was
holding two satchels, one filled with eggs, the other with apples.
</P>
<P>
   He introduced himself. ``I am Javed Iqbal, killer of 100 boys,''
he told the receptionist in the lobby of the newspaper office.
``Please tell someone in the reporting section that I have come to
surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist recalls being unsure what to do. Was this
pathetic-looking man really Pakistan's most notorious killer? Or
merely some bothersome fool?
</P>
<P>
   The hour was late, just after 9 p.m. Deadlines were pressing.
Ten minutes passed before a reporter was finally summoned, and he
was staggered at the scoop. He invited Iqbal, scourge of this
entire nation, upstairs for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   And that is how it came to an end Thursday, the frantic
month-long hunt for a vengeance-seeking confessed killer, a man who
enticed young teens _ most of them beggars and runaways _ to his
tiny apartment in historic Lahore. He fed them and entertained them
and asked their life stories and took their snapshots. Then he
suffocated them, later dissolving their bodies in large vats of
acid. He poured the residue in an alleyway sewer.
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal, 38, a wealthy, tormented man, kept an annotated list of
his deeds, with his victims' names and ages and the dates of their
deaths. He kept piles of clothing and shoes taken from his victims.
When, by his count, he had killed 100, he stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have killed 500, this was not a problem, money was not
a problem,'' he told reporters and editors in a small office as
they recorded his words. ``But the pledge I had taken was of 100
children, and I never wanted to violate this.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``pledge,'' he said, was an act of revenge against the
police. He repeated a story that he had written in an earlier
confessional, of how two young servants had beaten him up badly
last year, of how the police had ignored his complaints and instead
accused him of sodomy, something he had been charged with before.
</P>
<P>
   He decided that the killing of children would be his means of
retribution. ``In this way, I would take revenge from the world I
hated,'' he said of his 6-month homicidal binge. ``My mother cried
for me. I wanted 100 mothers to cry for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   He succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Early in December, as news of the crimes became public, parents
lined up by the thousands to rummage through huge piles of rumpled
clothes and old shoes that had been found in Iqbal's apartment.
Some found items that belonged to their missing sons. Others merely
saw their children's photos spread across wobbly wooden tables at
the police station. Or they read the morbid details in Iqbal's
diaries. Parental grief became a daily spectacle as more and more
people complained: ``Why can't the police find the killer?''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the police has been immense, with riots in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Iqbal actually turned himself in to a
policeman who ignored his confession as a fantasy. The murderer
then sent his incriminating diary and photos to The Jang newspaper,
whose reporters, on Dec. 2, were the first to search his apartment
and find evidence of the crimes. By then, Iqbal was a fugitive,
though notes he left behind indicated that he intended to drown
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He surrendered on Thursday at the three-story offices shared by
The Jang, an Urdu-language publication, and its sister paper, The
News, which is written in English.
</P>
<P>
   At Iqbal's request, the army was called to take him into custody
rather than the police. At the time, the police announcing that
they had arrested two men suspected of being Iqbal's accomplices.
The two, Muhammad Shahzad and Muhammad Nadeem, were caught trying
to cash a traveler's check in Iqbal's name. They admitted that they
were helping the killer hide out in the culvert and the cave,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal, who lived off the funds from the sale of a family
business, contends that he was helped in the slayings by various
confederates, including one who has already died in police custody.
Thursday, Iqbal said that many of the victims were made to inhale a
mixture of cyanide and acid as they slept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself wore a mask, and after about five breaths, the
sleeping victim would be dead,'' he said. ``Then my friends would
place the body in a container and later drain it away.''
</P>
<P>
   According to The Jang and The News, Iqbal was unrepentant as he
told his story. He was calm as he was led away. ``I am a relieved
man today,'' he said, even as he acknowledged that his fate is
likely to be the gallows.
</P>
<P>
   He reflected on his actions as heroic, something in the
long-term public interest. He remarked how easy it was to dispose
of the bodies of his victims in the large vats of acid. Such easily
abused chemicals are a great danger to society, Iqbal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if terrorists learned of these things,'' the mass
murderer fretted.

<P>
   Only 22 days until the first votes are cast in Iowa, the
chairmen of the Republican and Democratic parties say they are
bracing for a presidential primary season that is so competitive _
and unexpectedly so _ that they have to reach back 40 years to come
up with a comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the entire exercise may be over soon after the public begins
to pay attention. This will be the speediest _ critics say hastiest
_ dash to the nomination ever, because several states, seeking
greater political sway, elbowed their way in by moving up the dates
of their contests.
</P>
<P>
   The rejiggered calendar means the races will go off like a
string of firecrackers, beginning with the caucuses in Iowa on Jan.
24 and the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1, followed by primaries
in the electoral giants of California, New York and several other
states on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-week rush of voting _ less than half the National
Football League's regular season schedule _ the nominees to be the
leader of the free world may well be apparent.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last summer, advisers to the two front-runners,
Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, expressed
few qualms about the truncated schedule. They were so immersed in
constructing what they viewed as organizational juggernauts that
they did not seem particularly alert to threats from within their
ranks. And they anticipated wrapping up their nominations quickly
and tidily so they could turn to the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they now have no choice but to strategize over how the
outcome of one contest could affect the next one.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore are still the favorites; they may well face each
other in November 2000. But now, in an unaccustomed position for
the leading contenders, they are playing catch-up, at least in the
high-profile state of New Hampshire, where polls show that both
contests are too close to call. Gore must contend with an
unanticipated, and threatening, challenge from former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, and Bush faces one from Sen. John McCain of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore and Bush are comfortably ahead in national surveys,
their challengers hope that those campaigns become unglued in New
Hampshire _ and never recover. Adding to their credibility, and
political muscle, Bradley and McCain made striking gains in fund
raising near the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an unbelievable six weeks,'' said Ed Rendell,
general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``On our
side, you might see ups and downs and twists and turns in an
eight-day period. You will think one of the candidates has the
upper hand and _ bingo! _ he loses the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the presidential campaign of 1960, Rendell, who
retires Monday as mayor of Philadelphia, said, ``You've got to go
back to Kennedy and Johnson to find two co-equals who are really
battling head to head. And I don't recall the last primary campaign
when we've had two candidates who are so well known and so well
funded.'' But the truth is, Lyndon B. Johnson was never considered
as much a threat to John F. Kennedy as Bradley is now to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
also said this year's campaign reminded him of the high stakes on
both sides in 1960. Even so, Richard M. Nixon never came close to
losing the nomination to Nelson Rockefeller or other rivals, who
were not considered as potent as McCain is this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to include both parties in the calculus, this
might be the most competitive situation since 1960,'' Nicholson
said. ``There's a lot at stake and it's just going to get more
intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to handicap the Republican race, Nicholson, in unusually
candid comments for a party chairman, all but brushed off four
contenders. ``Bush is clearly the front-runner in terms of money,''
he said. ``But Senator McCain is a great candidate who has shown
real skill at retail campaigning in New Hampshire and is a very
authentic American hero. So anything can happen in this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson hastened to add that the potential of Steve Forbes,
with millions from his family fortune at his disposal, should not
be disregarded.
</P>
<P>
   After a prelude to 2000 that was hardly sedate _ candidates
piled up millions of dollars in donations and traded jabs
throughout the year _ the contenders are about to enter the most
frenzied, and possibly ferocious, stretch thus far. This week,
candidates will practically move to Iowa and New Hampshire. They
have accelerated their deluge of 30-second television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   And the schedule of successive debates might hearten even
advocates of good government: Democrats will face off in New
Hampshire on Wednesday, followed by Republicans there on Thursday,
Republicans in South Carolina on Friday, and Democrats in Iowa on
Saturday. That accounts for just this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stick their signs everywhere,'' said Ted Bailey,
describing how politicking _ and cold weather _ have overtaken
Chichester, N.H., where he is a selectman. ``But they're going to
find it hard sticking signs in now, because the ground's frozen.''
</P>
<P>
   The major contenders are also keeping an eye just off center
stage, where a drama is unfolding over who will carry the mantle of
Ross Perot and the Reform Party he founded.
</P>
<P>
   While Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator, and Donald
Trump, the real estate tycoon, are campaigning most aggressively
and organizing in several states, other possible contenders include
Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota. And few are counting out a
surprise re-emergence of Perot himself.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The significance of the 2000 campaign reaches far beyond the
White House. It is no exaggeration to say that all three branches
of government are at stake. Democrats need a net gain of only six
seats to retake control of the House. It is far less likely that
Republicans will lose the Senate, although Democrats could pick up
seats. And because of expected retirements, the next president may
well fill between three and five vacancies on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And the election of state legislators in November is critically
important. Nearly two dozen legislative chambers are so evenly
divided that either party could win control of them. But those
legislators, along with the governors, will use results of the 2000
census to redraw boundaries of districts of congressional
candidates in 2002 and the four subsequent elections. The process
could affect who controls the House of Representatives for years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the exception, perhaps, of the expected high-octane
match between Hillary Rodham Clinton and New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani for a Senate seat from New York, the presidential
competition is certain to command the most interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably in March of last year I thought, `I bet I don't get
very worked up about this,''' said Tom Brokaw, anchor of the NBC
Nightly News, who expects that his program will soon begin
broadcasting campaign stories every day. ``But people are slowly
awakening that there's a real race going on here. McCain and
Bradley have opened the door to a lot of public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one explanation for the allure of the McCain and
Bradley insurgencies is that some journalists, as well as ordinary
voters, seem charmed by them personally _ and have a hankering for
some drama.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ferment in New Hampshire, history is on the side of
Gore and Bush. Gore's advisers reel off their institutional
advantages _ from the power of the White House to committed
delegates to endorsements from labor groups to important elected
officials _ that have dragged their predecessors across the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, the mastermind of the Bush operation, recites the
history like a mantra. ``No Republican candidate who has led by
double digits in August of the Gallup Poll the year before the
election has failed to win the nomination,'' he explained. ``If
history is the guide, Bush stands a very good chance of being the
Republican nominee for president.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is no ordinary presidential year. No one knows how the
short-circuited season will alter the dynamic and, ultimately,
affect who comes out on top.
</P>
<P>
   Most strategists on both sides agree that Bradley has a better
chance of toppling Gore than McCain does of snatching the
nomination from Bush, because the Democrats are evenly matched
financially. In addition, while McCain is concentrating his
resources in New Hampshire, Bradley has assembled a national
organization.
</P>
<P>
   This much seems clear: The New Hampshire primary is a
make-or-break battle for McCain and Bradley. That is where they
have made the most impressive showings. And they are each counting
on wins there to energize their candidacies _ and to demonstrate
that Gore and Bush are not invincible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain wins there, I'm not sure he's very well poised to
convert that into a national campaign,'' said William Mayer, a
political scientist at Northeastern University in Boston.
``Bradley's better positioned to do that. He's managed to stay
pretty even with Gore in fund raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high expectations in the Granite State, Bradley
and McCain no longer have the luxury of sneaking up on the
front-runner _ as Gary Hart did against Walter Mondale in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   After their charmed campaigns in 1999, Bradley and McCain are
certain to face tougher scrutiny in coming weeks from their
opponents and from the news media. And a loss in New Hampshire
could be devastating to either politician, not only because of
expectations but because their opponents have established
``firewalls'' with potent organizations in several of the
subsequent primary states.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bradley and McCain camps contend that if they win New
Hampshire, the excitement and momentum after those triumphs would
allow them to trump the institutional advantages of Bush and Gore.
After New Hampshire, Republicans have showdowns in South Carolina
on Feb. 19 and Arizona and Michigan on Feb. 22 before the
multistate voting on March 7. But the Democrats will have a
five-week breather between New Hampshire and the March 7 contests.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., who backs McCain, said his
candidate and Bradley are poised to do well with independent voters
in his state. And victories there, he said, could make them
unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember when you had it on both sides like this,''
Rudman said. ``Bradley and McCain are both going to take huge
chunks of independent voters.'' Arguing that McCain has potential
for far more than prevailing in New Hampshire, he added, ``People
are whistling through the cemetery if they think that's going to be
the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The state of the race is far less settled than on the eve of the
primaries four years ago, when President Clinton faced no
opposition and Bob Dole towered over the field. Dole was bruised
and battered more than he expected, but still managed to crush his
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emergence of McCain, the most striking aspect of the
2000 campaign has been Bush's success. Though he was twice elected
governor of Texas, Bush had no national political seasoning and
popped up virtually out of nowhere to amass a staggering,
record-breaking war chest of over $67 million. He captured the
early support of far more Republican members of Congress, governors
and conservative leaders than Dole did at this point in the 1996
race.
</P>
<P>
   And his political might forced half the Republican field out of
the race, including former Vice President Dan Quayle, Elizabeth
Dole, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of
Tennessee. The only ones left standing are McCain; Forbes; Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah; Alan Keyes, a former State Department
official; and Gary Bauer, the former head of the Family Research
Council.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring for the Texas governor has offended some
Republicans who think it appears that he is being crowned. Craig
Grimes, a foreman for a power company in Youngstown, Ohio, who
responded to a New York Times/CBS News Poll, said he was taken
aback by how Rush Limbaugh and Republican luminaries defend Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a football game, and they're all running ahead and
clearing the way, running interference and blocking for Bush,''
said Grimes. ``They've poured the money into him. And it scares me
because he's going to owe big time whoever it is who is pushing
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, now, for Bush is to meet the high expectations he
helped create for himself by actually winning some elections. He
also needs to overcome an image from debates in December that he is
not as versed in the issues or as nimble on his feet as some
Republicans had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   And while Republicans enjoy a tradition of nominating their
front-runner, Bush has less national campaign experience than any
Republican nominee since Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was elected
president in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had a far rockier year than Bush. That was especially
apparent because he was confronted only by one rival and had
expected to glide to the nomination unimpeded. Instead, Bradley
showed such political potency last year that he forced the vice
president to practically reinvent his campaign and shed many
trappings of incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Gore not altered the terrain in September, he'd be gone by
now,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del. who has not endorsed either
candidate. ``He was on such a slide through the summer. But he's
righted the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats seem to agree on the leading issues _ health
care, education, Social Security and campaign finance reform _ but
they have argued vehemently over the details. The Republicans, by
contrast, have been wrangling over a different set of issues,
namely tax cuts, foreign policy and social issues like abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet perhaps because no single burning issue seems to have
grabbed the electorate, the candidates are devoting much time to
talking about themselves as human beings, from their upbringings to
their decisions to enter politics. They are also trying, perhaps,
to set themselves on a higher moral plane than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't name issues that excite the public, so we have to
create issues, like health care,'' said Gerald Gamm, chairman of
the political science department at the University of Rochester.
``When the economy is in the midst of its most robust economic
expansion in most of our lifetimes, when the nation, economically,
is on top of the world, voters aren't paying attention to issues.
So what is new now is that candidates are being aggressive in
marketing their private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest concern of the party chairmen is not the choice
of issues, but the amount of time candidates will have to discuss
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crazy way to determine the nominees of the parties,
because there's really no time for almost anyone to have a cogent
debate,'' said Rendell, the Democratic chairman. ``It just lends
itself to those god-awful 30-second ads.''

ELECTION YEAR REVEALS WHAT NEEDS FIXING IN U.S. POLITICAL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., N.H., Md.)  (mk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States enters its 54th presidential
election year in a period of remarkable calm and great economic
prosperity, with dozens of other nations struggling to adapt
American political forms. Yet the American people question their
political system on one front after another.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the challenges are overt. Former Sen. Bill Bradley, who
like Sen. John McCain has made condemning the campaign finance
system a major element of his presidential bid, says ``democracy is
a broken thermostat'' because of big contributions. Meanwhile, the
Reform Party squabbles but still stands as evidence that millions
of Americans reject the traditional structure.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling condemnation is passive. A majority (51
percent) of voting-age Americans chose not to vote in 1996, and 64
percent did not vote in 1998. Curtis Gans, an expert on voter
turnout, says that more than half the children in America live in
households where neither parent votes. Huge majorities tell
pollsters they are not paying attention to this year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, it is getting harder to recruit able candidates to
run for office at a time of insatiable news media scrutiny and
incessant demands of fund raising. And savvy veterans drop out at a
high rate, especially from the moderate centers of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   These more fundamental questions and concerns about the way the
system works are generally shelved, or used themselves as fodder to
appeal to voters, as politicians and the press focus on the
nomination contests and the chances of Republicans capturing the
presidency or Democrats taking the House. The issues have been
building for decades, but come into special focus in 2000, after
the first presidential election since 1924 when a majority did not
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles to participation have been thrown up by the
``system'' _ of politicians, consultants, interest groups and the
press _ just when legal barriers to registration and voting have
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the obstacles come from deliberate decisions. Some
television advertisements are really intended to drive down
turnout. Both parties have become highly skilled at drawing the
boundaries of congressional and legislative districts so that few
seats will be truly competitive. That preserves the careers of
incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   One way of looking at these trends was offered by Theda Skocpol,
professor of government and sociology at Harvard. Ms. Skocpol says
politicians use the information age to locate and ``compete over a
very narrow slice of swing voters.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, what she calls ``an oligarchy'' of interests
uses expertise, lobbyists and campaign contributions to achieve its
ends with government, ``rather than by mobilizing large numbers of
their fellow citizens into a competitive electoral force.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the old ways of involving citizens have died out, as
politicians get their messages out through television and direct
mail. Door-to-door canvassing does live on in Iowa and New
Hampshire, but almost as museum pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Wexler, an antiwar advocate in the 1960s and a Carter aide
in the '70s who runs a public relations firm here, observed that in
the nation's capital, where people do care about politics, neither
Bradley, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas nor Vice President Al Gore
has a headquarters where an interested citizen could volunteer to,
say, stuff envelopes. Writing a check is the only participation
welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   But even more serious may be the way the system is portrayed _
fairly and unfairly, by itself and by the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Any veteran observer of Congress, for example, would say that
the typical member today is better educated and harder-working than
whoever held the seat 35 years ago, and at the same time less
likely to be a drunk or a womanizer, or to take bribes. Yet
consumers of a press that rarely covered those weaknesses before
and covers them now as regular matters have an opposite set of
impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Gans, who heads the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, blames consultants for ``the conduct of campaigns,
especially at the end, in 30-second attack ads that vilify all the
candidates and create a miasma over the political system and invite
people not to vote for particular candidates and not to vote at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   John C. Danforth, who retired as a senator from Missouri after
18 years in 1994 to practice law in St. Louis, and insists he did
not ``go away mad,'' says he is struck by how much Congress now
seems to be wholly involved in ``partisan combat,'' not
legislating.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth speculated that an influx of Republicans who had been
``treated like dogs'' by House Democrats led to the change, as they
saw a chance to get even and scorned ``anyone who tried to do
anything on a bipartisan basis,'' like his late Republican
colleague, John H. Chafee of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter partisan tone in Washington not only discourages
potential congressional candidates who may be used to amiable state
legislatures, it turns off voters, too.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That effect was sketched by a knowledgeable ex-Washingtonian,
Nancy Sinnott Dwight. In the early 1980s, Mrs. Dwight ran the
National Republican Congressional Committee here. Then she married
and moved to Lyme, N.H., where every four years she gets a lot of
politics to watch.
</P>
<P>
   As she hears candidates, she is struck by this year's supply of
``terrific ideas.'' But she says that the atmosphere in Washington
leads voters to brush off these ideas because they think there is
``too much paralysis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The system can't seem to get things done,'' Mrs. Dwight said.
A voter can download a good idea off the Web, she said, but does
not believe a candidate can make it happen in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   No examination of the last session of Congress, for example,
would challenge those doubts.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Gans is not alone in his worry that the news media often
make things look worse than they are, either covering things
cynically or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   For four decades, after all, the political observers with the
biggest audiences _ first Johnny Carson and then Jay Leno and David
Letterman _ have offered uninterrupted cynical criticism of every
president and every member of Congress anyone ever heard of, from
Lyndon Johnson to Edward M. Kennedy to Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Silbey, professor of history at Cornell, said the
combination of news and talk had created ``a culture of criticism''
that portrayed government as a continual failure.
</P>
<P>
   Even the revered Walter Cronkite, Silbey said, played a role.
When Cronkite signed off news broadcasts by saying, for example,
``And that's the way it is, Friday, March 28, 1980 _ the 146th day
of captivity for the Americans in Iran,'' Silbey said the anchorman
was saying that on that day, again, the American government was
powerless.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Margolis, a retired Chicago Tribune political columnist,
said he thought the problem became severe in the mid-1980s, when
politics began to be covered by ``younger people who didn't like
politicians and did not like politics'' and were disappointed that
it was not entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The news media are often attacked, especially by academics, for
paying too much attention to who is ahead and too little to issues.
Nelson Polsby, professor of government at the University of
California at Berkeley, goes a step further. Polsby says the press
and television engage in ``the manufacture of a horse race.'' He
calls the news media just another interest group, ``attempting to
make their product interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of attention, he said, exaggerated the challenges to
Bob Dole in 1996 by implying that Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan
should be taken seriously as potential presidents ``and basically
made Bob Dole spend all his money,'' weakening him for the race
against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There are some modest hopes. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the
lieutenant governor of Maryland, said that from observing the way
her own children used the Internet and the way it was used in Jesse
Ventura's Reform Party victory in Minnesota, she believed it would
increase political involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's immediate,'' she said. ``It's not just television talking
at you, but you participate.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At another level, Mrs. Dwight said that in her part of New
Hampshire, people were actively involved in the problems that
mattered most to them, working hard as volunteers for their
churches and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Silbey said that in Ithaca many of the people most active in
urging policies on local government were nonvoters, preferring to
influence through confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Gans dismisses those impressions as idiosyncratic, insisting
that national polling data shows that ``if people don't vote, they
tend not to participate in any other societal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large,'' he said, ``they are disengaged from society.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody interviewed _ a group whose common threads are
knowledge of politics and little or no direct involvement in the
2000 elections _ was that bothered by nonvoting. Richard Norton
Smith, a biographer and former Republican speechwriter who heads
the Gerald R. Ford Library, said, ``I don't think you condemn the
system if people don't choose to involve themselves in it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the nation truly has only a 12-second attention span, he
said, that may be the fault not of the candidates or consultants,
but of whoever invented the television remote control _ and of the
people themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It is the American people, he said, ``who tell pollsters they
are offended by negative ads,'' and then elect the candidate who
uses them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no one to blame but ourselves,'' he said. ``In the
end, democracy is all about standing in front of the mirror.''

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Distrust of ethnic strangers runs so deep in
Burundi that there is a special insult _ ``ikimenabanga'' _ for the
person within a group who says too much, the one who breaks the
secret. It is safer to stay quiet, to keep to one's own kind.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a great distance between that kind of simple
suspicion and the hatreds that seem to have exploded in the last
decade with relentless regularity in Burundi, Rwanda and eastern
Congo _ the Great Lakes area of Africa. Documented genocide
occurred there in 1994, when Hutu extremists in Rwanda meticulously
slaughtered at least half a million ethnic Tutsi. The fighting
continued in the form of a rebellion within Rwanda and spilled into
Congo _ then known as Zaire _ helping to shatter that country in
1997. Burundi has been rent by civil warfare that started in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hutu fighters who fled Rwanda in 1994 are preying there
again, in a war that has dragged in at least eight other nations.
And in Burundi, Rwanda's southern twin, the Tutsi elite who rule
the country have herded into hillside camps 350,000 people, most of
them Hutu farmers, to separate them from Hutu guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   All of this fighting makes Africa's Great Lakes region one of
the most grim and complicated places on earth, one where
well-intentioned outsiders periodically wonder whether, and how,
they might step in to halt the violence. Each time, the question
comes down to this: Are these spasms of killing the result of old
hatreds, or are they grotesque products of political manipulation?
</P>
<P>
   To many outsiders ``ancient tribal hatreds'' has been the
formula easiest to accept, since it lends a patina of logic to
indifference _ to saying that there is little that outsiders could
do, even if they were willing. That is a position that underlay the
outside world's inaction during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not what most experts on Africa say. The hatreds are
real, the experts say, but they are not ancient at all _ and are
not really different from ethnic conflicts anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   In broad outline, the conflicts in Africa are quite like those
in the Balkans: Ancient divisions, even animosities, exist, but it
takes a political elite to seize on them and transform them into
something far more violent as politicians seek power for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is not ancient ethnic or tribal hatred,'' said
Filip Reyntjens, a professor at the Universities of Antwerp and
Leuven and a leading scholar of the Great Lakes region. ``That is a
vision many Europeans and North Americans have because it is an
easy way to explain what happens in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars generally agree on the ethnic shape of the Great Lakes
before the colonists _ first Germans, then Belgians _ arrived in
the late 19th century. There were three distinct groups of people:
the Hutu, who tended to be farmers (more than 80 percent today);
the Tutsi, who arrived on the land later as nomads and tended to
raise cattle (about 15 percent); and the Twa, or pygmies (perhaps 1
percent). There were rivalries, even animosities, but none of the
episodes of ethnic killing that have scarred the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Twa _ who were truly discriminated against _ the
lines between Hutu and Tutsi were not always firm. The monarchies
in pre-colonial Rwanda and Burundi were led by Tutsi but high court
officials were often Hutu. Intermarriage was common, even if there
were tensions between ruler and ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Along came the European colonists, who imposed their own ideas
about race and superiority, and tended to put one group officially
in power over the others. They preferred the Tutsi, who were viewed
as taller, thinner, smarter (and thus more like the Europeans).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Batutsi were meant to reign,'' wrote one Belgian
administrator in the 1920's, according to the French author Gerard
Prunier in his authoritative book on the genocide, ``The Rwanda
Crisis''(Columbia University Press, 1995). ``Their fine presence is
in itself enough to give them a great prestige vis-a-vis the
inferior races which surround. It is not surprising that those good
Bahutu, less intelligent, more simple, more spontaneous, more
trusting, have let themselves be enslaved without ever daring to
revolt.''
</P>
<P>
   What the colonists did, said Alison Des Forges, a historian and
consultant for Human Rights Watch, ``was take this system that was
relatively fluid and turned it into something very rigid and
hierarchical.''
</P>
<P>
   B Y the time the Belgians were preparing to withdraw from Rwanda
and Burundi in the late 1950s, many experts argue, the lines
between Hutu and Tutsi were firmly drawn, and resentment among the
Hutu was strong.
</P>
<P>
   First, in Rwanda, Hutu clamoring for power killed many Tutsi in
1959; partly in response, the Tutsi elite in Burundi hardened their
control. (The Rwanda fighting also created a group of Tutsi exiles
whose children would become the guerrillas who took control in
1994.) In Burundi, a unifying figure, Prince Louis Rwagasore, arose
among the Tutsi but was assassinated in 1961.

either country.
</P>

   In Rwanda, that cycle came to a crisis under the presidency of
Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu whose administration demonized all
Tutsi as supporters of rebels fighting to oust him. His death in a

died, set off the 100 days of slaughter of Tutsis.

Des Forges said, is that outside nations find a way to guarantee
that there will be no more ethnic slaughters in either country For
Rwanda, she added, the international community could show
evenhandedness not only by continuing to bring the Hutu killers to
justice but by not ignoring abuses committed by the Tutsi leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In Burundi, Jan van Eck, a consultant with the Center for

South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, van Eck pointed out, the amount of blood already spilled
may at this point become an argument for ending the violence. In
Burundi, for example, so many people have blood on their hands _
Hutu and Tutsi alike _ that their own mutually awful pasts may
offer an opening for starting anew. ``They always said: Hang all
the people who committed crimes, or shoot them,'' van Eck said.
``But now there is a realization that there might be too many.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ On his first full day as Russia's acting president,
Vladimir Putin left before dawn to visit with Russian troops
fighting in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   While his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, spent his first day of
retirement at a government country house outside Moscow, Putin and
his wife, Lyudmila _ he in a turtleneck sweater, she in pants and a
sheepskin coat _ spent what was left of the momentous New Year's
holiday greeting Russian soldiers and handing out hunting knives as
presidential souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering the nation a new image of an active, concerned
leader, the visit reflected Putin's close association with the
Chechnya battle. Since he was named prime minister in August as a
largely unknown KGB officer, his visibility and popularity have
soared with the conduct of the campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But now the war has apparently entered a far more difficult
phase as Russian troops seek to dislodge Chechen fighters from
Grozny, the capital. And Putin's success in presidential elections
now scheduled for March 26 could well hinge on the success of the
campaign, and the ability of the Russian commanders to hold down
their casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In Gudermes, the second-largest city in Chechnya, which is now
in Russian hands, Putin said: ``We are not going to liberate
anything quickly. We are going to do our best. The best means with
the least losses among our personnel, our military men among the
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin again said there was no deadline for concluding the war.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected trip, taken less than 24 hours after Yeltsin
resigned and handed his job to Putin, gave Russians a different
image of their leadership from the hesitant, breath-holding fumbles
and gaffes they had grown used to in the final years of the Yeltsin
era.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief time in office, Putin _ who retains the office of
prime minister _ has crammed in what previously would have been a
week's worth of presidential events, including the taping of a
televised New Year's message, a meeting with the Security Council,
another with his cabinet and two sessions with Yeltsin, including a
final meeting late Friday at the former president's residence.
</P>
<P>
   And at 6.30 p.m. Friday he signed a decree, one of his first as
acting president, which apparently held the key to the sudden but
smooth transfer of power. Besides granting Yeltsin and his family
an array of benefits and privileges, the decree gives him immunity
from criminal investigation, and protects his houses, cars, papers
and belongings from search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Yakushkin, Yeltsin's press secretary, on Saturday
disputed any suggestion that the president and his former prime
minister had bargained over the terms of the extraordinary transfer
of power Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no negotiations, said Yakushkin, who added that the
decree was most likely prepared in advance by Yeltsin's staff.
</P>
<P>
   The decree, described by Yakushkin as seven pages long,
describes in precise detail how much of a salary the former
president will get in the initial months after his resignation (75
percent of his salary), how much money he will have available to
spend on staff, what access he will have to government air and
train terminals, and other perks associated with the top Kremlin
job.
</P>
<P>
   But the immunity clause, limited to the president himself, was
the most striking, hinting at the kinds of concerns that Yeltsin _
whose administration has been scarred by reports of widespread
corruption _ had as he prepared secretly to leave office. Former
aides to Yeltsin have said in the past that the president and his
family would consider early resignation only if their physical
safety and economic security could be guaranteed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because Yeltsin was the first democratically elected president
in Russia, there were no precedents for such guarantees. Yeltsin,
who moved into the Kremlin after the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, gave its previous occupant, Mikhail Gorbachev, a generous
package of benefits and privileges and a rent-free office building
when he left office on Dec. 31, 1991. But as Gorbachev was to
discover, those benefits could also be taken away, depending on the
whim and mood of the man who granted them in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin's decree ostensibly gives the Yeltsin family the
guarantees it was seeking, the benefits and privileges are still
not fixed in law. Passing a law on the status of former presidents
was a proposal made last summer by former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, then a leading opposition candidate for the presidency,
as he tried publicly to assuage Yeltsin's anxiety about giving up
his Kremlin job.
</P>
<P>
   But by propelling the presidential elections forward by three
months, thus giving Putin _ his preferred successor and the current
political hero _ a considerable advantage, Yeltsin apparently could
not wait for legislation that would have to clear the Russian
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   According to Yakushkin, Yeltsin kept his decision to resign a
closely guarded secret until the last minute. Although Putin may
have known ahead of time, no official preparations for such a
hand-over of power were made by the Kremlin staff, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As press secretary, he got a call early in the morning, and
found Yeltsin in his Kremlin office at 8:30 a.m., ready to tape the
broadcast that went on the Russian government channel at noon
Friday. All day Friday, Yeltsin was very calm and friendly,
Yakushkin said. Yeltsin gave flowers to the television crew, drank
Champagne and said goodbye to many people with whom he had worked.
That was the mood of the day.

BEIJING CAT POACHERS STALK FAMILY PETS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Among the more persistent fables in the West is that
the pork in seedy Chinese restaurants may actually be the meat of
stray cats.
</P>
<P>
   But some Chinese pay good money to eat cat, in a Cantonese dish
called Dragon and Tiger Fight that combines the meat of snakes and
cats.
</P>
<P>
   In the homeland of Cantonese food, the southern province of
Guangdong _ where it is said that people will eat anything with
four legs except the table _cat is neither a major item on menus
nor a traditional favorite. But a small minority of diners like to
order it, and they carry their preferences with them.
</P>
<P>
   So along with the spread of Cantonese-style restaurants in
Beijing in the last few years has come a new problem: cat-nabbing,
to supply meat for demanding customers.
</P>
<P>
   Just since September, as many as 500 Beijing families have had
their pet cats stolen, said Lu Di, an elderly Beijing woman who is
a longtime campaigner for animal welfare, a rarity here. There is
no way to confirm her estimate, which she extrapolated from the
many complaints that her Association for the Protection of Small
Animals has heard from anguished cat owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must take concrete measures to stop this barbarian
behavior,'' said Ms. Lu, who is also a professor of classical
literature at People's University. Her expanding national
association _ which claims a membership of 5,000, including pet
lovers, veterinarians and scientists _ is demanding that the police
take stronger measures to combat the theft of cats and has issued
public warnings to pet owners to beware.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pity that our government hasn't taken any action to
stop this,'' she said in an interview. While theft of personal
property is a crime, the police have stood by, she said, as thieves
have grabbed cats and sold them for about $3 to wholesale markets.
There, they are sold to restaurants that often keep the cats and
other live animals in cages for inspection by diners.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has some stray cats, but house animals present an easier
mark. The thieves, who often operate at night, are said to use fish
and birds to lure wandering cats into their bags. Ms. Lu said that
some fearful cat owners have begun to tether their cats at night to
keep them from prowling the newly perilous alleys.
</P>
<P>
   Eating cat meat is of dubious benefit, said Lin Degui, a
veterinary professor at the Beijing Agriculture University.
Sometimes cats carry parasites dangerous to humans, he told The
Beijing Morning Post, and in Guangdong, several people have been
severely sickened by eating the meat of cats that had consumed rat
poison in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lu described a recent case in which six cats in one
northwestern section of Beijing were stolen the same day, as they
lay on their owners' roofs sunning. The distraught owners searched
nearby restaurants and found the animals in cages. But the local
police refused to help them, saying there was no specific law on
the theft of pets.
</P>
<P>
   The owners later called Ms. Lu's group, she said, and members
went to the restaurant _ only to find the cages already empty, and
six families in tears.

 &HT;    Hornets' Jones hoping for a quick comeback
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eddie Jones has rejoined the Charlotte Hornets and
reaffirmed his plans for a quick comeback from an elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   Jones met with Hornets team physician Glenn Perry and was given
a brace to wear until the torn ligament he suffered after being
fouled by the New York Knicks' Kurt Thomas Dec. 20 heals.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I don't want to wear it in the games,''
Jones said. ``But I might have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said as soon as the injury was diagnosed that he planned
on returning in three weeks, not the longest-range prospect of six
weeks. ``Like I told people, it wasn't going to be any longer than
three weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones will begin noncontact practice drills next week and be
with the team during a five-game road trip. He plans on making his
return Jan. 13 in a home against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Ilgauskas' return nearer
</P>
<P>
   Remember Zydrunas Ilgauskas? The Cleveland center hasn't played
since fracturing a bone in his left foot in the fifth game last
season. Now, the Cavs think it's possible that he could return to
practice on Jan. 24, after the Cavs return from a two-week West
Coast trip. Ilgauskas had a series of tests on Monday at the
Cleveland Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   No official word, but general manager Jim Paxson says he
anticipates Ilgauskas being able to resume rehab and light workouts
in an effort to return to practice at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Self-deprecating Gentry
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Gentry's alma mater, Appalachian State, is getting a new
arena, so he took some time to reminisce about the old barn he
played in back in the mid-1970s. ``I took my wife back there three
years ago,'' the Pistons coach said. ``I took her past my high
school (in Shelby, N.C.,) and told her, `That's where the legend
was born.' Then we went to my college gym, and I told her, `And
that's where the legend died.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's Olympic campaign
</P>
<P>
   Before Vince Carter scored 35 to lead Toronto past Houston,
Rockets and U.S. Olympic team coach Rudy Tomjanovich was asked
about the second-year player's chances of making the elite squad.
``The best thing Vince could do (to improve his chances) would be
to sit out,'' Tomjanovich said, prompting laughter.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Tomjanovich wasn't laughing. No dummy, Carter
went over to Tomjanovich to shake his hand. Rod Thorn and Russ
Granik of the NBA make the selections, but Tomjanovich has input.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey who?
</P>
<P>
   When the Bulls were blown out in New Jersey, Dickey Simpkins
came out wearing a jersey with the spelling of his name
``Smipkins.'' He said: ``At first, I thought I was from overseas. I
thought I was a foreign player.''... The Bulls had three assists in
that game for an all-time league low. They're not selfish; they
just can't make layups.... If center Jayson Williams can return and
play effectively after the broken leg he suffered last April in a
collision with Stephon Marbury, the Nets might have enough to make
a push for the eighth playoff spot. But coach Don Casey said
Williams hasn't practiced yet and might be better off if he
postponed his comeback attempt from January to February.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks' millennial woes
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks never are at a loss for distractions and controversy.
In the past week, forward John Wallace has been arrested and spent
a night in jail for driving with a suspended license, and power
forward Kurt Thomas has been suspended for two games and fined for
instigating a fight with the Pacers' Jalen Rose during a Christmas
Day game. Throw in injury problems that reduced their active roster
to nine men and a road loss, and you have a team that still is
struggling. ``It's Y2K,'' guard Chris Childs joked. ``That's what
it is.''

 &HT;    Success comes easily for Virginia Tech's Vick , who was third in
Heisman voting
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Just four months ago, only those living in the
small farming town tucked between the Blue Ridge Mountains and
Allegheny Mountains in Southwestern Virginia had any idea about
what the nation was about to witness.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the national championship game approaches, quarterback
Michael Vick, the steady, sturdy, leader of the second-ranked
Virginia Tech Hokies, is a household name in more locales than
Blacksburg.
</P>
<P>
   Vick needed one season to lead the Hokies to an unbeaten record
and a date with Florida State in Tuesday's Sugar Bowl. He did so by
showing poise far beyond his 19 years, and a style that has many
comparing him to Charlie Ward, the Seminoles' Heisman
Trophy-winning quarterback of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a culmination of a team that (coach) Frank (Beamer)
has built, that reached its peak and was lacking a quarterback and
the guy showed up,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said. ``The
guy that could make them a team showed up and now they're the real
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick's numbers aren't overwhelming. He completed just 90 passes,
on 152 attempts, for 1,840 yards and 12 touchdowns. He led the
nation with a 180.4 pass efficiency rating, but he attempted 80
fewer passes than Florida State's Chris Weinke completed. Vick's
total offense number of 2,420 yards isn't close to Weinke's 3,103
passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the intangibles that Vick brought the Hokies are
immeasurable, which is why he was third in the Heisman voting,
tying for the highest finish ever by a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Vick is just getting started,'' Clemson defensive
coordinator Reggie Herring said. ``The way they run the offense,
protect him with play-action, and got a running game to keep you
off balance ... he's headed for stardom.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick redshirted a year ago after listening to Beamer. The Hokies
prepared for Vick to take over by finishing 9-3 last season as Vick
was making a name for himself in practice, running around in the
backfield and throwing balls more than 60 yards.
</P>
<P>
   While Beamer had no doubts who his quarterback would be in 1999,
he still was not sure what to expect from an untested player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we didn't know, how good he will be in the games
themselves,'' Beamer said. ``It didn't take long to see how poised
he was going to be. I believe he likes the pressure situations. He
is very much unlike a redshirt freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick, who attended high school on Virginia's east coast, is
surprised by how easily he picked up the college game. Although he
was the No.5 quarterback prospect in the nation according to
SuperPrep magazine, and posted gaudy numbers at Newport News'
Warwick High (4,846 passing yards, 1,048 rushing yards), Vick
thought he would need at least a year to adjust to a faster game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of expected to go through a lot of growing pains this
season,'' he said. ``Things happened so fast, I came out there and
was relaxed and its been kind of easy.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for his high school coach, former World Football League
MVP and actor Tommy Reamon, Vick may have wound up following
Donovan McNabb at Syracuse. Reamon, who played running back Delma
Huddle in the 1970s movie ``North Dallas Forty,'' is not fond of
Syracuse coach Paul Pasqualoni. Reamon believes former Warwick
quarterback Aaron Brooks was unfairly held back at Syracuse for two
years before emerging as a starter his final two years. He saw Vick
falling into the same situation, especially after Syracuse
recruited quarterbacks Troy Nunes and Madei Williams two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept saying publicly they had (Vick) if it wasn't for the
high school coach,'' Reamon said. ``Don't play games with me. Don't
play business games with me and my children. Look at it now. Would
you want to put him in that situation? Two-quarterback system?
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it happening. Pasqualoni can talk all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick took an official visit to Syracuse where McNabb, the
quarterback to whom he was being compared at the time, was his
host. Vick said McNabb did not try to influence his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Vick, more diplomatic than his high school coach, cited two
reasons for choosing Virginia Tech _ staying in state where his
family could see him play and, ``I don't want to run the option. I
don't want to get hit a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Michael Vick is a big hit. The Hokies' history at
quarterback never will be confused with that of the University of
Miami's, but Vick should surpass them all, including two with South
Florida ties: former Dolphins quarterback Don Strock, and Jim
Druckenmiller, whom the Dolphins traded for in September.
</P>
<P>
   Strock, the director of football operations at Florida
International University, played in Blacksburg in 1971 and '72 and
still holds most of the Hokies' passing records.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous athlete and they use his skills very well,''
Strock said. ``They get him out of the pocket, he throws on the
run. When you have an athletic quarterback like Vick, it puts a lot
of stress on the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller led Virginia Tech to its two previous biggest bowl
dates, the 1995 Sugar against Texas and 1996 Orange against
Nebraska. He believes Vick and the Hokies have been overlooked. He
thought Vick should have finished ahead of Heisman runner-up Joe
Hamilton, and thinks the Hokies are taking a back seat to Florida
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't think Virginia Tech gets all the respect we
deserve,'' Druckenmiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vick should change that.

 &HT;    Pickens questions keeping Coslet
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bengals receiver Carl Pickens criticized owner and
general manager Mike Brown, who last week decided to keep coach
Bruce Coslet for at least one more season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand it,'' Pickens said. ``We're trying to win.
We're trying to turn this thing around out there. And they bring
him back. What can you do? Obviously, the players don't call the
shots around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickens later issued a statement retracting his comments, but
the damage seemed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a long time ago you can't please everybody,'' Coslet
said. ``I prefer to put my focus on all the players that have
supported me, not only publicly but individually and privately. I
think I have my team's support. I think that's never been a
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into today's game at Jacksonville, Cincinnati is 21-35 in
3 1/2 seasons under Coslet. The Bengals are 52-107 in the 1990s,
officially making them the worst team of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertain future in Buffalo
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers and Cowboys aren't the only NFL teams with an aging
core of stars. The Bills also face an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Reed, the team's all-time leading receiver, might play his
last game today at home against the Colts. Reed, 35, has a $2.375
million cap charge in 2000, including a $1.775 million base salary.
His role has diminished over the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Bruce Smith's cap figure will be $5.448 million
next season, and running back Thurman Thomas' about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills probably can't keep all three players and re-sign
guard Ruben Brown, receiver Eric Moulds, safety Kurt Schulz and
cornerback Thomas Smith, all of whom are eligible for free-agency
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a lot of things you have to look into,'' Thomas
said. ``I think that's going to be left up to (general manager)
John Butler and (owner) Ralph Wilson, whether they want us around
here or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland QB likes Warrick
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the expansion Browns will have the
No. 1 pick in April's draft. And Cleveland quarterback Tim Couch
already is lobbying general manager Dwight Clark to pick Florida
State receiver Peter Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, the top pick in 1999 from Kentucky, joked he might stroll
past Clark's office ``and just kind of yell the little Florida
State fight song.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Warrick) is a good player,'' Couch said. ``I think he
can help us out a lot and give us somebody to go along with Darrin
Chiaverini and Kevin Johnson and give us that good third receiver.
I think he'd fit in real well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Clark somewhat tipped his hand. Warrick and Penn State
linebacker Lavar Arrington and defensive end Courtney Brown are
considered the top three prospects for the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to get Tim Couch some weapons,'' Clark said.
``I think he's proven he can be a great quarterback in this league.
He's got a lot of development to go through yet, but he's shown
signs of brilliance, and I think he'll continue to get better. So,
we have to get him some weapons to go to, and we have to protect
him.''

 &HT;    A year of highs and lows in the NFL
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the NFL heads into its last regular-season games on
the first weekend of 2000, beat reporter Mark Schlabach takes a
look back at a surprising 1999 season:
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSIVE MVP
</P>
<P>
   1. Marshall Faulk, RB, Rams. Faulk should break the NFL record
for yards from scrimmage in a season.
</P>
<P>
   2. Peyton Manning, QB, Colts. Manning is the NFL's best
quarterback in only his second season.
</P>
<P>
   3. Edgerrin James, RB, Colts. No wonder Indianapolis drafted him
ahead of Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   4. Kurt Warner, QB, Rams. Warner should join Miami's Dan Marino
as the only NFL quarterbacks to throw 40 TD passes in a season.
</P>
<P>
   5. Stephen Davis, RB, Redskins. Davis' running set up the deep
pass for Brad Johnson and Michael Westbrook.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE MVP
</P>
<P>
   1. Warren Sapp, DT, Buccaneers. He might be the most dominant
player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   2. Kevin Carter, DE, Rams. Carter is as important to St. Louis
on defense as Warner and Faulk are on offense.
</P>
<P>
   3. Jevon Kearse, DE, Titans. How could 15 teams have passed up
this physical specimen?
</P>
<P>
   4. Ray Lewis, LB, Ravens. Lewis leads the league in tackles.
</P>
<P>
   5. Robert Porcher, DT, Lions. Porcher broke the team record for
sacks in a season, with 14 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   COACH OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   1. Bill Parcells, Jets. Just when it seemed the Jets would fold,
they stunned the Bills and Cowboys and the Dolphins twice.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jim Mora, Colts. Mora has regained respect after quitting in
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   3. Dick Vermeil, Rams. Would Vermeil be here if Trent Green had
not been injured in the preseason?
</P>
<P>
   4. Mike Shanahan, Broncos. Denver was competitive despite losing
John Elway, Terrell Davis and Shannon Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   5. Gunther Cunningham, Chiefs. The first-year coach has Kansas
City playing hard and with discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ROOKIE OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   1. Edgerrin James, RB, Colts. James earned nearly $15 million in
salary and incentives, which is what many thought Ricky Williams
would do this season.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jevon Kearse, DE, Titans. Kearse, a linebacker at Florida,
twice this season broke the NFL record for sacks by a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   3. Tim Couch, QB, Browns. Couch peformed well despite playing
behind the league's worst offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   4. Champ Bailey, CB, Redskins. The former Georgia star set
rookie record with three picks in one game but seemed to fade late
in the season.
</P>
<P>
   5. Damien Woody, C, Patriots. In a few years, the former Boston
College star will be the NFL's top center.
</P>
<P>
   COMEBACK PLAYER OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   1. Bryant Young, DT, 49ers. Young is back in the Pro Bowl only a
year after a horrific leg injury.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jeff George, QB, Vikings. The former Falcon rescued
Minnesota, his third team in six years.
</P>
<P>
   3. Tyrone Wheatley, RB, Raiders. Traded by the Giants and cut by
the Dolphins in the preseason, he was a star in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   4. Jeff Blake, QB, Bengals. Benched and injured in 1998, Blake
will get a big contract from someone in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   5. Alonzo Spellman, DT, Cowboys. The former Bear's comeback off
the field has been even more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ROOKIE STEALS
</P>
<P>
   These players were overlooked in the draft but outplayed several
high-profile rookies:
</P>
<P>
   1. Olandis Gary, RB, Broncos. The fourth-rounder should break
Bobby Humphrey's team record for rushing yards by a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   2. Terrence Wilkins, KR/WR, Colts. The undrafted rookie from
Virginia has scored three different ways and should be playing in
the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   3. Martin ramatica, K, Buccaneers. Gramatica was a
third-rounder, but the former Kansas State star has been
``automatica.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Mike McKenzie, CB, Packers. The last of three defensive backs
drafted by Green Bay, the former Memphis star played the best.
</P>
<P>
   5. Wali Rainer, LB, Browns. The fourth-rounder replaced retired
star Chris Spielman.
</P>
<P>
   COACHES ON THE HOT SEAT
</P>
<P>
   These coaches might get pink slips from their owners:
</P>
<P>
   1. Pete Carroll, Patriots. Carroll's team collapsed in the
second half; his agent already is making telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   2. Mike Ditka, Saints. Ditka says he's coming back, but others
aren't so convinced that owner Tom Benson won't clean house.
</P>
<P>
   3. Chan Gailey, Cowboys. The decision that Norv Turner will stay
in Washington might give the Americus native one more year in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bill Cowher, Steelers. How desperate is Cowher to leave
Pittsburgh? He confirmed rumors linking him to N.C. State.
</P>
<P>
   5. Ray Rhodes, Packers. Rhodes will have to shake up his staff,
at least, after a disappointing first season in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   These players are very close to being stars:
</P>
<P>
   1. Donnie Abraham, CB, Buccaneers. Abraham should be starting in
the Pro Bowl instead of Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   2. Barrett Robbins, C, Raiders. Robbins is a big reason why the
Raiders lead the league in rushing offense.
</P>
<P>
   3. Robert Hicks, OT, Bills. In his second season, the former
Douglass High star has outstanding feet and technique.
</P>
<P>
   4. Marcus Robinson, WR, Bears. The Fort Valley native probably
cost Curtis Conway his job.
</P>
<P>
   5. Stephen Alexander, TE, Redskins. The second-year pro can
block and has outstanding hands.
</P>
<P>
   UNSUNG HEROES
</P>
<P>
   These guys are some of the unsung heroes you probably never have
heard of:
</P>
<P>
   1. Norman Hand, DT, Chargers. The former Mississippi star is a
big reason why San Diego is so tough against the run.
</P>
<P>
   2. Patrick Jeffers, WR, Panthers. Jeffers is a big, fast
receiver with good hands -- just what the Falcons could have used.
</P>
<P>
   3. Aaron Beasley, CB, Jaguars. The former West Virginia star
inexplicably was snubbed in voting for the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   4. Jason Belser, SS, Colts. In his eighth season, Belser put
some bite into the Indianapolis secondary.
</P>
<P>
   5. London Fletcher, LB, Rams. The undrafted rookie from John
Carroll University is one of the league's fastest linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   CRYSTAL BALL
</P>
<P>
   Fearless predictions for the 2000 season:
</P>
<P>
   1. Quarterback Steve Young returns to the 49ers, but receiver
Jerry Rice doesn't, because San Francisco can't fit both players
under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   2. Receiver Michael Irvin retires because of a neck injury, and
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones replaces him with the Raiders' Tim Brown,
a native of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   3. Jets coach Bill Parcells returns for one more season, but
quarterback Vinny Testaverde doesn't win back his job from Ray
Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   4. Patriots coach Pete Carroll is fired by owner Robert Kraft,
who hires Jets assistant head coach Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   5. Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino and coach Jimmy Johnson
return to Miami and live happily ever after -- with running back
Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   TOP FIVE STORIES
</P>
<P>
   he top five news developments of the 1999 season:
</P>
<P>
   1. Walter Payton dies -- The Chicago Bears legend succumbed to
cancer after a long battle with liver disease and, as always,
``Sweetness'' handled it with class.
</P>
<P>
   2. Injuries: Injuries sidelined several of the league's top
players, including Jamal Anderson, Terrell Davis, Steve Young,
Vinny Testaverde and Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   3. Rae Carruth arrested -- Carolina receiver was charged with
murder in the shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   4. Houston awarded franchise -- Houston businessman Bob McNair
landed a team for the former home of Oilers; Los Angeles was passed
over again.
</P>
<P>
   5. Barry Sanders retires: Lions running back abruptly retired
before the season, but Detroit made the playoffs anyway.
</P>
<P>
   FALLING FAST
</P>
<P>
   These aging players are past their prime:
</P>
<P>
   1. Charles Haley, DE, 49ers. A big factor in the playoffs last
season, Haley wasn't even on the stat sheets this year.
</P>
<P>
   2. Ben Coates, TE, Patriots. Coates' attitude and mouth probably
have worn out their welcome in New England.
</P>
<P>
   3. Steve Atwater, FS, Jets. The Jets learned what Denver already
knew: Atwater is slow and no longer can cover receivers.
</P>
<P>
   4. Morten Andersen, K, Falcons. Once a weapon late in the game,
Andersen barely is getting chances at 39.
</P>
<P>
   5. Dan Marino, QB, Dolphins. His arm seems to get tired, and his
decisions aren't as sharp, either.
</P>
<P>
   TIRED ACTS
</P>
<P>
   These guys' antics and behavior have gotten very old:
</P>
<P>
   1. Ryan Leaf, QB, Chargers. The former Washington State star
owns this space.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jimmy Johnson, coach, Dolphins. Johnson should quit blaming
Dan Marino and look in the mirror. Johnson's the one who rested his
running game on troubled Cecil Collins' shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   3. Bill Romanowski, LB, Broncos. He will break the NFL records
for illegal hits and fines before he retires.
</P>
<P>
   4. Michael Westbrook, WR, Redskins. Even when he's playing well,
Westbrook can't keep his mouth shut. His charges of nepotism were
outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   5. Joey Galloway, WR, Seahawks. Is it just a coincidence that
the Seahawks collapsed after his return from a contract holdout?
</P>
<P>
   DIRECT DEPOSIT
</P>
<P>
   These players are laughing all the way to the bank after putting
up huge numbers in contract years:
</P>
<P>
   1. Simeon Rice, DE, Cardinals. Arizona already has too much
money invested in its defensive line, so Rice could end up in his
native Chicago in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   2. Corey Dillon, RB, Bengals. Cincinnati offered him
Duce-Staley-like money; Dillon will get a contract more like Jamal
Anderson's.
</P>
<P>
   3. Tony Brackens, DE, Jaguars. Another top pass rusher, but his
history of injuries still is a concern.
</P>
<P>
   4. Chuck Smith, DE, Falcons. The Falcons probably can't afford
him, but Green Bay or Jacksonville probably can.
</P>
<P>
   5. Jeff George, QB, Vikings. Minnesota might have too much money
invested in Randall Cunningham and Daunte Culpepper to re-sign
George.

 &HT;    Jeffers gets his wish to remain a Panther
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Carolina receiver Patrick Jeffers has been red-hot
lately, after battling injuries through the first half of the
season. In the past four games, he has 28 receptions for 552 yards
and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   His effort paid off Thursday in a new four-year contract with
the Panthers. The former Virginia star who spent two years in
Denver and one in Dallas had been scheduled to become an
unrestricted free agent on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers, in his first season with Carolina, had not wanted to
leave the Panthers, but he had worried that the team might not be
able to afford him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along this is where I want to be and if my agent
feels like the offer they make is a fair one, I'd be more than
happy to sign it,'' Jeffers had said before the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka has attitude adjustment
</P>
<P>
   After his team stunned the Cowboys on Christmas Eve, Saints
coach Mike Ditka seems to be friendlier and more confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I say that (I'll be back next year)? What a cocky guy,''
Ditka said. ``I just believe I'll be back. There's no revelation to
it. An angel of the Lord didn't come down and say, `You're going to
be back.' I just believe I'm going to be back. I want to be back.
And I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka said he hasn't met with owner Tom Benson to discuss the
future but did admit that he told his players last week that he'll
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't acted any different,'' Ditka said. ``Right now, I
resign myself to the fact that I really believe that I'll be back.
There might have even been a moment where it didn't bother me that
much one way or the other. But now it would bother me, because I
really want to make some people really mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my mom a long time ago I'd like to live to be 150. She
said, `Why?' I said I'd like to make the rest of the people mad
that I haven't made mad yet. I want to get a few in this town. So,
coming back would make a few of them mad, you've got to admit
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach lobbying for extension
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Vince Tobin issued an ultimatum of sorts, despite
the Cardinals' three-game losing streak that knocked them out of
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, who has one year left on his contract, is publicly
lobbying Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill for an extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals have to sit down and (decide), 'What direction
are we going?' '' Tobin said. ``Were the Cardinals moving in the
direction we want to go with me at the helm? If that's so, then
we'll work it out. If they think not, then I'm sure we'll work it
out the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin seemed to say he would rather be fired than become a
lame-duck coach in 2000. Tobin is 28-38 as a head coach after his
team slipped to 6-9 a year after the franchise's first playoff
berth in 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's hard to coach a football team going into the
last year of your contract,'' he said, ``for your own free agents,
for other people's free agents, your control over your football
team and just the speculation. There was speculation this year,
and, if we went into next year, there would be speculation every
day, every week, on good plays and bad plays, good decisions and
bad decisions. You need to have closure.''

 -NHLFEA02-COX &HT;    Detroit off to fast start after failure last season
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nobody is quite ready to do celebratory swan dives
into the Detroit River just yet. Regular-season victories in
Hockeytown do little except to affirm to fans that forward lines
are set for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But as the NHL season nears the midway point, the Detroit Red
Wings look closer to being a Stanley Cup team now than they did
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings have the best record in hockey, and they continued to
string together wins despite the absences of goalie Chris Osgood
and forward Slava Kozlov. After a narrow 3-2 overtime win over the
Thrashers that locals attributed to post-holiday blahs, Detroit
traveled to Buffalo the next night and waxed the Sabres 7-2. The
team's goals-against average (2.30) is in the top five in the
league, and forwards seemingly produce any time they have to _ or
are prodded into doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally started coming around in the third period of the
Atlanta game,'' assistant coach Dave Lewis said. ``But that's our
team. We have some veteran guys, who, if you watched practice,
you'd wonder how they're able to play in this league. They wait for
the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, they often waited for the games to matter, and then
it was too late. The Wings suffered from some expected post-Cup
blues last season, and it was reflected in their team defense. As a
result, general manager Ken Holland worked several trade-deadline
deals that imported veterans and exported draft picks. However, it
didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started slow last year, but our feeling was in the second
half of the season we would be more consistent,'' he said. ``We
felt we needed to do something to jump start the team. We went
something like 10-1 after the trades, and we won six consecutive
playoff games. But then we had some injuries and Colorado elevated
its game in the playoffs and...''
</P>
<P>
   And the Wings lost. After two consecutive Cups, the perception
was that Holland had mortgaged the future to squeeze one more title
out of the team and failed. Only defenseman Chris Chelios was kept
from last year's trades, and, Lewis said, ``He feels more
comfortable this year. Last season, it took awhile for him to get
adjusted with his family, to the jersey, everything. He almost
tried too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Chelios leads the NHL in plus-minus at plus-36. He
has been paired with Steve Duchense, whose career appeared dead
after he bombed out with three teams in the span of a year. He has
been rejuvenated in Motown. The other move that has paid off was
unrestricted free agent Pat Verbeek, a key piece to Dallas' Stanley
Cup team. Verbeek had 18 points in his first 23 games and was a
plus-21, second to Chelios on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas hasn't hit its stride yet. Many people think that
Colorado will be a second-half team because of its recent personnel
turnover, but for now it's a .500 club. St. Louis is strong but
can't match Detroit's depth. Phoenix needs to prove it can win a
playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings' path appears set through the Western Conference
playoffs to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early for that,'' Lewis said. ``Being in first place
and the stats and all that is nice, but we're measured by what we
do in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland said, ``We only have a certain amount of time with this
group.'' He said he still thinks that Dallas and Colorado will be
the Wings' primary competition in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But going into a Cup chase not as the defending champions has
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Dallas in the first 25 games this year,'' he said.
``It's tough when you play until the middle of June and then have
to get back on the ice for training camp. And then everybody is
judging their year on how they play against you. You're the
measuring stick. It's hard to get pumped up in October.''

   Primeau deal goes bust
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact Carolina's deal to send Keith Primeau, a
minor-league defenseman and two draft picks to Phoenix for Keith
Tkachuk fell through, it's more certain than ever Primeau will not
be back with the Hurricanes. When it was learned Primeau had
pre-approved a four-year, $16.9 million contract with the Coyotes,
which is not far off the offers Carolina had tendered, 'Canes
winger Gordie Roberts went ballistic. ``He has hung this entire
team out to dry,'' Roberts said. ``We're going out there on the ice
busting our butts every night, and he's been rejecting offers that
have been fair. I wouldn't be saying this if I didn't think the
team had made fair offers. Twenty million dollars. Twelve million
dollars. What's the difference between the Phoenix deal and what
he's been offered here? ... As a team, we've been taking the
approach that Primeau is like an injured player and he'll be coming
back. Now, we've got to stop thinking about him and just get on
with it.'' Primeau said Roberts' anger is ``misdirected,'' adding,
``Everything was all right (this season) when they were winning
games. All of a sudden, I'm responsible for them losing seven of
the last nine games?''
</P>
<P>
   A slow burn in Boston
</P>
<P>
   This is not an endorsement for Boston to fire coach Pat Burns,
but after going 2-7-4 in a span of 13 games, Burns has come to the
conclusion that his players have rejected his philosophies. ``I
just can't understand it,'' he said. ``Over the past two years,
this club has played a certain way. We've picked up 180-odd points
in two years, we've gone three rounds in the playoffs. All of a
sudden, it's not good enough anymore. Now, we have to pinch, we
have to take chances, be more offensive and try to copy other teams
and this is the result _ giving up two-on-ones. I watched New
Jersey-Buffalo and Buffalo gave up about 10 two-on-ones. If you're
going to play like that, you're not going to win too many hockey
games.'' Burns said when he asked one player how he wanted to play,
the player responded, ``Creatively.'' For structured coaches like
Burns, ``creativity'' is synonymous with poison.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, convinced Trevor Kidd's return this year is a long
shot, made a good move acquiring Mike Vernon from San Jose. Despite
his age, Vernon, 36, might have one good year left in him. The
Panthers also are on the hook for only the remaining $2.4 million
of his $4.38 million contract this year. But Vernon also has a
$3.25 million option kick in for next year if he plays 40 games (25
more). . . . It's becoming more likely that John McMullen will sell
the New Jersey Devils and become a minority owner of the New York
Jets. Expect the selling price to the YankeesNets group to come at
about $165 million _ a slight escalation over the $34 million
McMullen paid in 1992. . . . Alexei Yashin returned to the United
States to spend time with family members and girlfriend, Carol Alt,
but says he will be back in Switzerland this week working out with
a club team there. Nothing new on talks with Ottawa.

<P>
   FACEOFF: BRETT HULL
</P>
<P>
   Right winger, Dallas Stars
</P>
<P>
   Update: Entering the weekend looking for career goal No. 600, a
mark reached by only 11 other players. Second on the Stars this
year with 13 goals and 28 points in 37 games.
</P>
<P>
   On approaching the 610 goals scored by his father, Bobby: ``To
be able to have followed in his footsteps has been a thrill for me
more than anything, and to have been able to reach the level that
he played, being a Hall of Famer and voted the eighth-best player
in the Top 50 list that came out last year, I mean, it is a huge
thrill. I told someone this year I wish I could get to 610 and then
just quit counting or quit or something. But it will also be an
honor if I am able to pass him.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing styles with his father: ``He was so powerful and so
fast and strong. I don't know which one of the guys in the family
got it, but it wasn't me. I just lumbered around the ice. I kind of
developed a style, like a stealth mode, and just weave my way in
and out of holes.''
</P>
<P>
   On having dreams he'll never score again: ``The dream is coming
true here. I bet you I have had 50 shots in the last three games.
They're not going in like they used to. I tell the guys on the
bench, `That one used to go in off someone's foot.' I am still
creating lots of chances, and, if you keep doing that, they are
bound to go in. But every day I am scared to death I will never
score another one.''
</P>
<P>
   On how long he'll play: ``The game isn't a whole bunch of fun to
play anymore. But it is also a game that I love. I come to the rink
every day hoping that it is going to change back to the way it was.
And honestly, they pay such nice sums of money to us that you would
be crazy to retire until they kick you off the ice. ''

   Wile E. Coyotes
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's decision to dangle stars Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy
Roenick as trade bait could have ramifications on a team that has
been playing well under first-year coach Bobby Francis. The
Coyotes, who are losing an average of $10 million a season and will
continue to operate in the red for two years until they move into
their new arena, want to dump a contract. Roenick will make $5
million next season, then become an unrestricted free agent.
Tkachuk's deal balloons from $4.3 million to $8.3 million next
year. Carolina owner Peter Karmanos called it ``a stupid
contract.'' (amusing considering this is the guy who signed Sergei
Fedorov to a six-year, $38 million offer sheet). Now that Tkachuk
and Roenick know they're on the block, how will the team's two best
players perform? Tkachuk said, ``I want to play here. I want to
spend the rest of my life here. It's about the money. I'm not
worried about it. I'm sure they've thought about trading everybody.
I've been through this a lot. They haven't traded me yet. If they
do, my wife will be devastated. So will I.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharks take big risk
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's decision to deal veteran backup goalie Mike Vernon to
Florida leaves 24-year-old Evgeni Nabokov as the only safety net if
Steve Shields is injured. But the Sharks felt they needed to add
toughness. That's why they immediately moved Radek Dvorak (acquired
from the Panthers) to the New York Rangers for Todd Harvey. The
right winger has been injury prone and has only three goals in 31
games this year, but Sharks GM Dean Lombardi said, ``Harvey's the
type of guy I'd affectionately say is a jerk to play against. It's
something we felt we had to add to this group. Nobody is saying
he's a 40-goal scorer, but he does have the ability to chip in. He
plays with a lot of energy. He has shown the ability to be a
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly . . .
</P>
<P>
   The surprise wasn't that Joe Sakic finally tallied his 1,000th
career point; the surprise was he assisted on a goal by . . . Chris
Dingman? ``That'll be a trivia question: Who's the one that
scored?'' Dingman said. ``I don't know if too many people will know
the answer to that one.'' . . . Sakic becomes an unrestricted free
agent after the season but said he may agree to salary arbitration
and sign a one-year contract with the Avs. ``I'd like to sign a
long-term deal with a no-trade clause,'' he said. ``If I don't,
we'll just do arbitration. I did pretty well (testing the market)
last time, but I like it here and I want to stay here.'' . . .
Calgary defenseman Phil Housley signed a two-year (plus an option)
contract extension with the Flames and passed up unrestricted free
agency after realizing his preferred destination, the expansion
Minnesota Wild, probably wasn't going to sign him. . . . With
several Detroit teammates returning from injuries, rookie Jiri
Fischer lost his dressing stall at Joe Louis Arena and was given a
folding chair near the Gatorade table. ``Youngest player on the
team,'' the 19-year-old said. ``That's the way it goes.''

 &HT;    Hawks' center moves by tragic story
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Hawks' Lorenzen Wright nearly wept when he
learned about the tragic story of 9-year-old Travis Butler, alone
in a house with his dead mother in the Memphis projects,
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up where he was growing up,'' Wright said. ``I went to
the same school (South Park Elementary) he attended. The idea of
losing your only parent and being so afraid that you would be put
in a home that you don't tell anyone, I could relate to that and be
thankful I have both my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Wright joined fellow Memphis natives Penny Hardaway
and Elliott Perry in donating $3,000 each to a trust fund for
Perry. Todd Day kicked in another $1,000, bringing the trust fund
for young Butler to $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to reach out to him on a personal level,'' Wright
said. The Hawks center runs a summertime basketball camp in his
hometown and wants Travis to attend. ``I think something like that
would allow him to feel better about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Butler story hit newspapers a week after Thanksgiving. The
9-year-old's mother, Crystal Wells, 30, a pharmacy school student,
died of complications from a noncancerous carcinoid tumor on Nov.
3, but her body was not discovered by neighbors until Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful after hearing tales about foster care, young Butler went
to school each day as though nothing had happened. He did his own
grocery shopping from money in the house, prepared his own meals,
fixed pizza for his Thanksgiving meal. At the time Wells' body was
found, little Butler was preparing to pay household bills. He
already had written checks, his maternal grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
   Butler is now living in Carthage, Miss. with the grandmother,
Shirley Wilder, and the trust is being administered by the National
Bank of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   And while Wright and other NBA players from Memphis will get
credit for caring and giving, their involvement probably would not
have happened except for the reaction of the Hawks' vice president
for media relations, Arthur Triche, whose son, Brandon, is about
the same age as Travis Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Triche brought the story to Wright, then contacted Hardaway and
Day through the Phoenix Suns and Perry through the New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the saddest stories I've ever encountered,'' Triche
said the day it was published. ``I can't imagine this. We've just
got to find a way to do something for this child.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he learned that the four Memphis players were eager to
help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think once they heard the story they were as touched as I
was,'' Triche said. ``How could you not open your heart to the
plight of a young boy in that circumstance?''

 &HT;    NBA NOTES: Checkin' out the hair in Orlando
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ben Wallace's hairstyle has become one of the big
sports stories in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace likes corn rows because they are nice and neat, but a
poll of Magic fans show that 62 percent want him to keep the retro
big Afro he has worn lately. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   The Magic won seven of nine games after Wallace let his hair
free in early December. That they dropped two games last week by a
combined five points might indicate that the charm has gone.
</P>
<P>
   But does Wallace have the courage to change and perhaps ``doom''
his team to mediocrity? Orlando was 8-9 in corn-row games.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace wore the Afro in his finest game of the season, leading
the Magic to victory over Charlotte with 14 points, 15 rebounds and
six blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like Sampson _ the longer the hair, the more power he
has,'' coach Doc Rivers said. ``Now, we've just got to keep Delilah
away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're chanting for the 'fro, but they aren't the ones who
have to keep it combed. It's a lot of work when it's long,''
Wallace said. ``I'll probably just have it rolled back up (in corn
rows).''
</P>
<P>
   Not so darling kings
</P>
<P>
   They may be the darlings of the NBA, but the Sacramento Kings
appear far away from taking the step that would make them true
contenders in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Including Wednesday's victory over Seattle, the Kings are 8-10
since they started the season 9-2 and appeared to justify the faith
that Turner sports showed by scheduling them for TNT and TBS more
than any other team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the symptoms: Nick Anderson is back to where he was the
year before last in Orlando, hanging out on the 3-point line,
shooting 35 percent from the floor and fearing any trip to the foul
line, where he has severe problems. Jason Williams is shooting 36
percent, 28 percent on threes, which he often takes from a step or
two behind the line.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber says, ``We're nothing special. Darlings of the NBA,
Cinderellas, all that is thrown out the window, 'cause, if we're
all of that and we don't win, that means nothing. We'll be a bunch
of cute little kids, cute guys for the next five or six years and
it doesn't matter. We need to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard part, coach Rick Adelman, said, is that ``people talk
about that (NBA darling label), and I think for us to become a
better team and to be a good team, we have to defend better, and
we've got to rebound the ball better. And, really, a lot of times,
our decision-making _ if things are going good, you can be
creative, do a lot of things. When things aren't, you've got to be
a little bit more disciplined. We're struggling with that a little
bit right now, but I think it's going to come. This team's only
been together, the main guys, for 70 games. It's a very young team.
. . . With experience, they're going to get much better.''
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   Utah's retiring president Frank Layden, who got out while he
still had his health and his sense of humor. Thanks for all the fun
he provided for everyone around the NBA for nearly a quarter
century after starting as a Hawks assistant coach under Hubie
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Knicks tough guy Kurt Thomas grabbed Eddie Jones' left arm so
hard to stop a layup that Jones suffered a torn ligament in his
elbow, putting him out six week. Six days later, Thomas threw a
combination of punches at Jalen Rose of Indiana and was hit with a
two-game suspension, plus $10,000 in fines.

 &HT;    Motivated Grant Long returns
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Grant Long, whose loss to Vancouver left the Hawks
without a rudder, finally is playing after suffering a concussion
and a cartilage injury. In a 100-93 loss to Philadelphia, Long had
eight rebounds in 22 minutes. He talked about his excitement at
playing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you guys watch major league baseball a lot,''
Long said, ``but Sammy Sosa is one of my favorite players, and he
takes off from the dugout and he tears out to center field. He's
just happy to be out on the field playing major league baseball,
and that's my appreciation. When I'm out there on the floor, I'm
happy to be playing NBA basketball. I run out there. I'm smiling
because I'm enjoying myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies crowd gave Long a rousing hand. The 33-year-old
did not hold back. He took it hard to the rim against Todd
MacCulloch and George Lynch, drawing a foul and getting to the
line. He crashed with Billy Owens inside, drew a charge on Tyrone
Hill and yelled out the defensive calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was yeoman's work,'' Shareef Abdur-Rahim said. ``It's what
he brings to the team, just that blue-collar mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant goes his way
</P>
<P>
   The tug of war continues in Los Angeles: In the final seconds of
a tied game with Dallas, Phil Jackson drew a play for Kobe Bryant
to pass to Glen Rice. Bryant saw an opening he couldn't resist,
drove, got fouled and made the foul shots for the winning points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter. If I come off a screen and the guy gives me
the lane, I'm gone,'' Bryant said. On Phil Jackson's reaction: ``He
just kind of looked at me. Just did one of those'' _ the Lakers
guard mimicked Jackson's stare. ``It was like _ it went in. So,
whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Mavs rookie cans another agent
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in his brief, turmoil-filled NBA career,
Mavericks rookie Leon Smith has fired his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Muehlebach was notified of the change Tuesday in a letter
signed by Smith, the 19-year-old who was suspended without pay on
Dec. 6 after two arrests in a 24-hour span. Muehlebach replaced Dan
Fegan.Ostertag awakens
</P>
<P>
   In Utah's victory over Phoenix Tuesday, Greg Ostertag had five
points, two rebounds and two blocks in the fourth quarter. He had
not played in the first three. Jazz forward Karl Malone said, ``He
was as alive as any time I've seen him in the last four or five
years.''... One night later, Jerry Sloan became the third coach in
history to win 600 games with one franchise, when the Jazz beat the
Grizzlies 101-90. He is 600-281 in Utah. The other coaches with 600
wins with one team are Red Auerbach (795, Boston) and Red Holzman
(613, New York).
</P>
<P>
   LaFrentz returning to form
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Raef LaFrentz continues to play more confidently on
his repaired left knee. Over four games, he scored 81 points and
made 35 of 66 shots. He's shooting 30-for-70 on three-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The former Kansas star has been working a nearly unstoppable
baseline fadeaway jumper, lofting it over big centers Bryant Reeves
of Vancouver, and the Clippers' Michael Olowokandi and 7-foot-3
Keith Closs. ``That one's been with me since junior high,''
LaFrentz said.

 &HT;    Bradley's easygoing style wins rave reviews in presidential run
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Something about putting on shorts for years
and dribbling a ball before thousands changes the way a performer
reacts in front of crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The tension of stage fright _ common among those who act, play
the concert piano or, in most cases, run for public office _ is
missing. The muscles don't tighten in the same way and the face
assumes a loose, locker-room quality of disregard for the attention
being focused on it.
</P>
<P>
   As much as any of the traditional Democratic initiatives he
proposes in his platform, this low-key demeanor, epitomized by the
throat lozenge tumbling constantly in his mouth during his
speeches, distinguishes former Sen. Bill Bradley out on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley tells audiences the ``radical premise'' of his campaign
is that he can go out and simply tell people what he believes ``and
have a chance of winning.'' The style in which he outlines these
beliefs matters as well.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Bradley's steadfast refusal to hit rhetorical high
notes can be frustrating. In a room like the one filled with Jewish
voters at a recent conference in Atlanta, there's a sense of
listeners waiting for a resolving chord that doesn't sound.
</P>
<P>
   But when he connects, his manner gives him the freedom to do
things that draw a sharp contrast with Vice President Al Gore's
stiff reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' his face wrapped around the microphone in mock shock
when an Iowa voter mentions some new charge Gore has made.
Discussing the evils of political money, he wheels his 6-foot-5
frame around, pretending to kick a lobbyist in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Voters, especially liberal Democrats longing to hear their
ideals voiced again, frequently walk away saying things like ``one
of us,'' ``straightforward,'' ``has his feet on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Performer,'' by the way, is a word Bradley himself uses in
talking about what a politician does. But he makes a careful
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was doing out there was not a performance, it was a
dialogue,'' the Rhodes scholar, New York Knicks star and New Jersey
Democrat said last week after meeting with a group of voters at a
senior center in Des Moines. ``But when you have a debate or you go
on television, sure, it's a performance.''
</P>
<P>
   With their willingness to engage voters one-on-one, Bradley and
Republican Sen. John McCain have been the trend-setters of this
presidential campaign, prompting other candidates to take more
questions from audiences and affect a more relaxed approach. These
underdogs have also leapfrogged their parties' front-runners to
take the lead in recent polls in New Hampshire, where this style of
personal campaigning has the biggest impact. They moved decisively
ahead in New Hampshire the week the two met in a cross-party
photo-op to re-enact the Bill Clinton-Newt Gingrich handshake
agreement to do something about campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   With Christmas only days and a bitter cold front settled in,
Bradley was campaigning around Des Moines the following week,
hoping to put pressure on Gore in the other key early state. The
groups were larger than earlier in the campaign, so a staffer cut
off questions after a while at each meeting. But Bradley still got
in lots of dialogue in sessions at a suburban library, a children's
hospital, an Irish bar and several other stops.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is the only presidential candidate who has pointedly
refused to discuss his religion, and yet when he talks about his
desire to ``move our collective humanity a few feet forward'' and
realize ``a world of new possibilities guided by goodness,'' his
stump speech arcs toward a sort of civic mysticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I see somebody who can look beneath skin color or eye
shape and see the individual, I think all of us could be that
good,'' he tells voters. ``Whenever I see a neighbor give to
another neighbor, with no expectation of return, I think more of us
more often could be that good. ... Whenever someone has courage to
stand up against an evil ... that single action strengthens all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The cadence bears more than a little similarity to Tom Joad's
ringing words at the conclusion of John Steinbeck's ``Grapes of
Wrath.'' It's a broad, Rooseveltian language of Democratic ideals
that also punctuates Bradley's account of growing up on the
Mississippi in Crystal City, Mo., the only child of a doting
teacher and a bank officer with calcified arthritis who prided
himself that he never foreclosed on a family during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the best tradition of the Democratic Party, Bradley told
voters who turned out in subzero weather to see him at the Perry
library, to propose doing things ``in a timely enough manner and a
big enough way.'' The economic boom makes this the time, he
asserted, for the party and the country to ``think big.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy rings through in his discussion of almost every
issue.
</P>
<P>
   On health care: ``If you have a problem that size, you need a
big solution.'' Gun control: ``If you're serious about this, you
have to offer a strong proposal.'' Campaign finance reform: ``The
level of boldness and depth of commitment is the biggest difference
(between him and Gore).''
</P>
<P>
   At the children's hospital, Bradley acknowledged that his
proposals to broaden health care coverage are ``not cheap. It will
cost between $55 billion and $60 billion a year.'' He would fund
this and other spending on social needs by keeping defense spending
at a steady rate, rather than increasing spending as Gore and all
the Republicans have proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would get the programs through if the Republicans
hold on to a congressional majority, Bradley noted that ``some of
my best moments,'' including the 1986 tax reform legislation he
sponsored, were in a Republican-majority Senate. He also cited
Ronald Reagan as a case for swaying Congress by campaigning with a
clearly drawn platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being specific is the beginning of a legislative strategy,''
he said. Like Reagan, he envisions an administration of bold
colors, in which the president points the way but limits himself to
a few vital objectives.
</P>
<P>
   In Reagan's administration, everyone knew they had to be
anti-Communist and pro-defense to please the boss, Bradley told a
Democratic audience. In his administration, people would know that
if they want to please the boss, they'll have to promote racial
harmony.
</P>
<P>
   It was a speech on racial matters that spurred interest in
Bradley as a presidential candidate, and he talks about the
subject, as he points out, even in places such as Iowa, where the
crowds may be all white.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is that way over 50 percent of the white people in
America want to have a deeper level of racial harmony in this
country. If I'm wrong, I'm toast. If I'm right, we have to put
together the ingredients for a real transformation,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   The stump speech biography, which begins with small-town
Missouri, ends with an anecdote about tossing uncomfortably on a
motel bed one night earlier in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came to me,'' he tells voters, after describing the various
discomforts that kept him up, ``that I'd been on the road in
America for 30 years, as a basketball player, as a politician, as a
businessman. And in all those years there is one continuum, and
that is me going out and asking strangers to tell me their stories.
In the accumulation of all those stories, I think I have a pretty
good sense of who the American people are.''
</P>
<P>
   The words make an effective lead into the trademark
question-and-answer period. Whether Bradley can translate this
style into a broader medium when the race explodes into a
fast-paced competition for the big states will determine his
chances for the nomination. But for now his laid-back delivery and
unabashedly liberal message have Bradley's campaign on a hot
streak.

<P>
   The words make an effective lead into the trademark
question-and-answer period. Whether Bradley can translate this
style into a broader medium when the race explodes into a
fast-paced competition for the big states will determine his
chances for the nomination. But for now his laid-back delivery and
unabashedly liberal message have Bradley's campaign on a hot
streak.

 &HT;    Payment in stock a way of linking performance to future growth
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At Atlanta-based Red Hot Law Group of Ashley, every
one of the firm's 19 employees _ from receptionist to attorneys _
is poised to share future wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, which serves emerging high-tech firms through its
Technology Accelerator unit, collects 5 percent of its high-tech
clients' stock as part of its fee package and then distributes 15
percent of the total as stock options among Red Hot employees. If
one of the Accelerator clients hits it big one day, so will the
options holders at Red Hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be an amazingly lucrative event,'' explains Evelyn A.
Ashley, Red Hot managing partner. ``The upside is for the future.
In a way, we're placing ourselves in a position where we truly are
partners with the clients we accept.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm is also positioning itself in the middle of a growing
trend among employers across the United States who are using stock
options as performance incentive compensation, as well as a tool
for recruitment and retention. While employers are offering annual
salary increases in the 4 percent range on average, stock options
are an additional means for future financial payoff, a way of
linking employee performance to future business growth.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly an exclusive benefit for big-time executives, stock
option awards continue to migrate down the corporate ladder as more
and more companies expose a wider selection of employees to the
potential payoff in the record-setting bull market.
</P>
<P>
   Fully 62 percent of the companies polled by the American
Compensation Association's 1999-2000 Total Salary Increase Budget
Survey reported some form of stock-based compensation plan.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-area high-tech firms and their Silicon Valley brethren
are among the leading industries offering stock options as part of
employee compensation.
</P>
<P>
   However, many companies outside the technology marketplace are
using options to attract and retain workers in the current
low-unemployment, high-competition job market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing options going lower in the organization,'' says
David Leach, national director of the Compensation Consulting
Practice at New York-based Buck Consultants. ``More companies are
offering (stock) options to more and more employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock options are awards that permit an employee to purchase a
share of the company stock for less than market prices. For
example, Coca-Cola Chairman-to-be Douglas Daft recently spent
$1,152,800 to exercise options entitling him to purchase 120,000
shares of the soft drink maker's stock at $9.30 and $9.76 per
share. Coke shares were trading at $59 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The employee is often able to sell the stock at market prices,
netting a handsome profit.
</P>
<P>
   Companies use options to tie the employees' financial stake to
that of the shareholders. By increasing shareholder value, the
employees increase the amount of money they will net when their
options mature, typically over a 10-year time frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has done well for the last six years, so it's
almost a given that if people get stock options, they're going to
be making money,'' says Leach.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a big payoff is not guaranteed. Stock options are
best issued as long-term incentives and should not be viewed as
quick cash payouts.
</P>
<P>
   At Red Hot, only two companies have graduated from the
Technology Accelerator since it was launched in May. It could be
years before those options are liquidated, Ashley says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way lawyer compensation has been done traditionally, it's
very oriented to what I get today,'' she says. ``What we're trying
to do is to get lawyers in particular to think beyond today.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, options have made people rich. For start-up and
hot-growth companies, options are often used in lieu of cash at
companies that cannot pay big salaries. If these firms go public,
options holders often net huge cash windfalls or on-paper increases
when their options are converted for stock in public equity
markets.
</P>
<P>
   For larger, more established companies such as Coca-Cola, Home
Depot and others, stock options are used to lure and keep top
performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to attract and retain quality people to help them
run their businesses,'' explains Leach. ``For them to do that, they
have to have a competitive compensation package. That means
offering stock.''
</P>
<P>
   They also play a direct role in tying a manager's overall
compensation to that of the average shareholder. There is, however,
risk associated with these rewards. They only pay off if the stock
price rises above the option price. If the market price per share
slips below the option price, the options are deemed ``under
water,'' an event that could waterlog the employee morale the
incentive seeks to encourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the market goes down and all these people are sitting on
stocks that are worthless, it's going to be more negative than
having'' the options in the first place, reasons Leach. ``You
raised (employee) expectations when you granted them. Now they're
not worth anything. Their morale is going to be lower than if they
never got anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in today's seemingly unending bull market, employers are
betting on the upside, awarding stock options to employees who just
a few years ago were cut out of this form of compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is considered a reward,'' says Dotty Pritchett, managing
partner with Lucas Group, an Atlanta-based executive search firm.
``It's not just a benefit that you just have,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Take corporate attorneys. A few years ago, options awards for
in-house corporate lawyers were rare. Rarer still were stock
options used for incentive pay for paralegals, but that is changing
swiftly, Pritchett says. In the past year, she has noticed not only
more corporate attorneys negotiating stock options in their
compensation packages, but paralegals, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers, my clients, recognize how important (stock options)
are, and that it is of great interest to the job candidate,'' says
Pritchett.
</P>
<P>
   Should you be getting stock options? Talk with your immediate
supervisor, advises Leach. Find out the eligibility requirements.
``Sometimes, these could be personal performance issues, so one
wants to talk to individual managers about it,'' he says. ``Since
there's only so much stock to go around, the company wants to make
certain they're spending these in the right place to get the best
for their investments, (awarding them to) the best performers.''

   HYPE-MILLENNIUM (New York) _ Before the countdown, the

And no one did more anticipating than Edward L. Woodyard, a
screenwriter who made his reservations for New Year's Eve 1999 in
1984, when the hotel in Times Square where he finally did his
celebrating on Friday night was a half-finished skeleton of steel

   BRAZIL-MILITARY (Rio de Janeiro) _ Barely six months ago,
Brazil's government achieved a long-cherished objective with a
carefully negotiated merger of all three of its military forces
into a single ministry that is theoretically under civilian
control. But now, to the government's embarrassment, the air force,
the most nationalistic of Brazil's armed services, is very noisily
challenging that concept. The dispute has raised questions about
the proper role of the Brazilian military in politics and the
economy at a time when President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is
intent on reducing the size and reach of the state. By Larry
Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   COLUMBUS-ARCHITECTURE (Columbus, Ind.) _ In a matter of months,
this Midwestern small town of big-city architecture that is a who's
who of postwar design may boast yet another distinction: a group of
its buildings is likely to become the first in modern architecture
to win National Historic Landmark status, an honor more often
bestowed on the nation's earliest buildings. By Robyn Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   LEGALIZING-MARIJUANA (Undated) _ When voters in Maine went to
the polls in November and endorsed the use of marijuana as a
medicine, it was more than a victory for cancer patients and others
who say marijuana will help relieve their pain. For a small
coalition of libertarians, liberals, humanitarians and hedonists,
the vote was another step forward in a low-profile but
sophisticated crusade to end the nation's criminal laws against
marijuana and other psychoactive drugs. By Christopher S. Wren.

<P>
   Now that the Year 2000 has arrived around the world without
significant disruptions of power, transportation, commerce and
other activities dependent on computers, the question arises: Was
the threat of technology failure overstated, or was it all those
hundreds of billions of dollars that were spent to fix things that
prevented a catastrophe?
</P>
<P>
   Most computer experts insist that the problem was a widespread
and major threat before work began. ``There was puffery by vendors
and some money was wasted, but these were real problems,'' said
Leon Kappelman, a University of North Texas associate professor of
business and co-chairman of the Society for Information
Management's Year 2000 Working Group.
</P>
<P>
   Many also warned Saturday that significant problems could still
emerge in the months to come if less critical or less frequently
used computers, programs or microchips belatedly become confused.
And little of the world's vast array of financial and office
computing systems will face real-world Year 2000 conditions until
business resumes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably 10 percent of the world's computer systems had a
workout at the gym this weekend, but 90 percent did not,'' said
Howard Rubin, chairman of the department of computer science at
Hunter College in New York and an international expert on the Year
2000 computer problem. ``The statistics say there's still got to be
something out there that's wrong. It'll take weeks, perhaps a full
year, to understand the full impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some computer experts, like William Wattenburg, who
developed an automated program to deal with Year 2000 flaws, were
saying the quiet rollover was predictable and that the dangers had
been wildly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   And charges were flying Saturday from individuals who had
expected the worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did we fall for this hype?'' a correspondent in an
Internet discussion group devoted to Year 2000 issues wrote
Saturday. ``I feel cheated, betrayed, misused, abused, deceived and
everything else!'' The note was signed, ``Gullible.''
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 project managers looking ahead to the start of normal
business on Monday warned that it was far too soon to relax.
Thousands of workers spent the early hours of Saturday retesting
systems needed for office operations once the holiday weekend ends.
</P>
<P>
   The results constituted more good news. For instance, the
Securities Industry Association, a trade group, said Saturday that
the stock exchanges and support organizations had discovered and
quickly fixed glitches that caused ``1900'' to appear on some
printed forms.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall good news was not being interpreted as evidence
that the huge precautionary investments had been unnecessary. ``Had
we not fixed our code and done the level of testing and gone out
and gotten outside auditors, we would definitely have had
failures,'' said Gary Davis, the Year 2000 director for New York
state, which spent about $270 million on the problem. ``There's a
whole laundry list of silver linings.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, like most major computer users, New York ended up
doing a thorough inventory of the state's technological
underpinnings. ``Lots of our technology was 10 years old, some even
two decades old,'' Davis said. ``It all really needed upgrading and
now we're in a much better position to deliver better services to
New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   John A. Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year
2000 Conversion, added his voice at a 2 a.m. press conference
Saturday to those denying that the United States had been chasing a
mirage rather than a real threat _ even though other nations that
spent far less seemed to encounter no significant difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said that the United States, as the nation most
dependent on computers, needed to spend the most to avoid
disruptions. If the news remains good, he said, ``It will reflect
the success of a unique, massive cooperative effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts said the United States had benefited in
numerous ways from its heavy spending _ pegged at $100 billion by
the government and several times that amount by some private
analysts. One of the most important ways, some said, was a
recognition by business and government leaders that computers and
software must be more carefully managed.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin termed the rollover an ``extraordinary success'' after a
belated start working on Year 2000 programming flaws. But such slow
reactions may not be correctible in the future, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When computers are in your face _ when you have an Internet
refrigerator _ you won't be able to take that kind of chance,'' he
said. ``Soon, Earth will have an Internet skin. This skin will be a
critical thing. As everything becomes more responsive in real time,
the technological risks get higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the investment laid the groundwork for some
fascinating case studies in technology management. Companies like
Delta Airlines, which expects to spend up to $120 million,
according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
made Year 2000 investments part of a broader deployment of new
technology that could give the company a competitive advantage in
the future, according to Kappelman.
</P>
<P>
   Around the globe, government officials felt an obligation to
defend their spending as most computers and related systems
functioned well as the year changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain sense of wry anticlimax out there,'' said
Michael Granatt, a director of the British government's millennium
center, as he listed a few of the glitches that came to light as
2000 dawned, including temporary breakdowns in fare collection
systems on trams in Sydney and Adelaide, Australia, and the failure
of a tide gauge in Porstmouth, England.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was important to acknowledge that the lack of
truly disastrous computer failures was not a fluke. ``Things don't
go right by accident,'' he said. ``They go right through proper
planning.''

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The more than 150 hostages freed Friday from
a hijacked Indian Airlines jet savored the simple pleasures on
Saturday that had been denied them for the past week: taking a
shower, sleeping with their legs outstretched and eating a
home-cooked meal.
</P>
<P>
   As the hostages took their first steps back to normal life,
India's top diplomat took the offensive. Foreign Minister Jaswant
Singh defended the government's much-criticized decision to make a
deal with the hijackers _ winning the hostages' freedom by
releasing three jailed militants _ and hinted darkly that India's
archrival, Pakistan, was behind this latest terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
   Singh opened his wrap-up news conference on the hijacking by
listing a string of accusations that implicated Pakistan. The
hijackers were Pakistanis, he said. Most of the 36 militants they
wanted released were Pakistanis, he added.
</P>
<P>
   And the hijackers and three terror suspects whom India handed
over to them on the tarmac in Kandahar, Afghanistan _ where the
crisis ended _ had headed for Quetta, Pakistan, he said. To back up
that assertion, he cited remarks attributed to an official in the
Taliban, which rules most of Afghanistan, in a Pakistani newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked directly if he believed the government of
Pakistan had sponsored the terrorists, Singh said, ``I'll not
comment authoritatively on that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Singh did not make public any evidence to support his
charges, his remarks made it clear that the ill will between the
neighboring nuclear-armed nations is unabated since they clashed
this summer over Kashmir, the Himalayan territory that each seeks
for its own.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking has become one more episode to aggravate feelings
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The masked hijackers, who never revealed their names,
nationalities or faces, told the hostages that they were Muslims
who sought independence from Indian rule for predominantly Muslim
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the hostages, most of them Indians, are heading home,
attention has shifted to where they have really gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban gave them 10 hours to get out of Afghanistan after
the hijacking ended on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When they came down the ladder from the Airbus, they and the
three released militants got into a four-wheel-drive vehicle and
drove away. The drive to Pakistan from Kandahar is about five
hours, and it is 12 to 14 hours to the Iranian border.
</P>
<P>
   Singh said the men had headed to Pakistan, and he may well be
right. But the Pakistani government said it did not want them to
enter.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Rashid Qureshi, spokesman for the military government in
Pakistan, said Saturday that the Taliban had never sought
permission from Pakistan for the hijackers to go to Pakistan, nor
would it have been given.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you heard the statement yesterday from our minister of
foreign affairs, we have said that Pakistan is greatly relieved
that the hijacking has ended without bloodshed,'' he said, ``and he
emphasized that the punishment for hijackers here in Pakistan is
capital punishment. I do not expect that after such a statement had
been issued that the hijackers would risk coming to Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Pakistan had increased its border patrols in
recent months but has made no special provisions to stop the
hijackers. ``I don't expect it is very easy for the hijackers to
come across the border, but while I say this, I have to add that we
cannot patrol every inch of the border,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Singh pointed to the Taliban's information minister as
having said that the hijackers were headed to Quetta, Mullah
Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader, told the newspaper New
in Pakistan that they were likely to go to Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have refused them political asylum,'' he said. ``As they
claim to be Kashmiris, they could go back to Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the hijackers were masked and are unknown, they may be able
to disappear without being detected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the men may be difficult to trace. Border crossings
between Afghanistan and Pakistan are loosely patrolled, with a sea
of humanity crossing the rutted roads in both directions largely
unimpeded. The crossings are traffic jams of trucks, donkey carts
and men carrying huge loads on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone is bearded and wearing the traditional salwar
kameez pants and tunic and a turban. In the winter, as the winds
sweep in off the stark mountains, most men cover their heads and
faces with blankets and scarves, making the task of detecting
hijackers that much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Singh said that India was convinced that the hijackers are
headed to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if India would seek the men's extradition, Singh said,
``We will be taking it up with Pakistan in the appropriate fashion
and at the appropriate time.''

 AT-HOME FATHERS STEP OUT TO FIND THEY ARE NOT ALONE  (jw) 
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES PLAINES, Ill. _ In a gray lecture hall in the Oakton
Community College, a group of middle-aged men were shouting
affirmations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who ARE you?'' their cheerleader, Hogan Hilling, asked them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proud dads!'' they replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``What time is it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's DAD time!''
</P>
<P>
   To further raise the room's esteem, Hilling instructed the men
to raise one hand in the air, then bring it down into a clenched
fist with a rousing ``Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Yes!'' fist pump was the support-group chant of choice at
the recent At-Home Dads Convention in this Chicago suburb. A day of
seminars on topics like ``At-Home Daddying ... What Are Our
Issues?'' and ``The Anatomy of a Working Mom's Brain'' drew about
85 men from 20 states. Many of the attendees, a small group with a
broad constituency, run Web sites, newsletters and play groups that
cater to men whose wives bring home the reduced-fat bacon.
</P>
<P>
   No longer the butt of demeaning ``Mr. Mom'' jokes, these men
have become familiar figures at playgrounds and PTA meetings. They
have ``come out of the pantry,'' some of them like to say, with a
newly emboldened attitude, in a men's movement with a new idea of
masculinity. Ironing John. And conventions like this one and the
Internet have become their sweatlodge.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of virtual kaffeeklatsches have sprung up for men who by
choice or economic necessity find themselves on the daddytrack.
Among them are Daddyshome.com, MrMomz.com, Athomedad.com and the
Parent Soup section of America Online. On Slowlane.com, the
slickest and most complete of the sites, the slogan is, ``You are
not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, men who had known one another only by e-mail
met for the first time. Attendance has increased from 35 in the
group's first year but is down from 100 last year. Christopher
Coby, 35, said connecting with other fathers like him through the
Internet had pulled him out of his version of postpartum funk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two kids in diapers at once and I was fried,'' said
Coby, who lives in Wake Forest, N.C. ``I was online and I kind of
came out of lurk mode and got on a couple of lists.''
</P>
<P>
   That saved him, he said: ``I came here to meet the guys face to
face and just say thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Coby is 6-foot-2, weighs 215 pounds and is a former tank
commander in the Army reserves. He quit teaching elementary school
after his son was born because his wife, who works for a consulting
firm, had a higher salary and better benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He proudly wears an apron that his wife gave him last Father's
Day that says, ``Women want me, Martha Stewart fears me.''
</P>
<P>
   How many Chris Cobys are out there is unclear. The Census
Bureau's last survey on the subject, in 1993, reported that 1.9
million unemployed men were the primary caretakers of children up
to 14 years old, down from a recession high of more than 2 million
in 1991. A Bureau of Labor Statistics study released in September
showed that, from 1991 to 1996, unemployed men ages 25 to 54 who
chose not to look for work because of ``home responsibilities''
rose to 8.4 percent from 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That change is significant, experts say, because men have
traditionally been unwilling to admit household duties as the
reason for their unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   James Levine, director of the Fatherhood Project at the Families
and Work Institute in New York, said, ``The number of men at home
taking care of their kids is the best-kept secret in American child
care.'' Many of them, he said, are blue collar: ``cops and firemen
working night shifts while their wives work days.'' Such men are
not unemployed and may not consider themselves stay-at-home
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Levine believes there has been a ``quantum leap'' in the numbers
of stay-at-home fathers since he researched his book, ``Who Will
Raise the Children? New Options for Fathers and Mothers,'' 25 years
ago. ``They were really few and far between then,'' he said. ``It
was considered nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Still far from the norm, stay-at-home fathers are gaining
acceptance. Even approval. In his new book, ``Fatherneed'' (Free
Press), Dr. Kyle Pruett, a clinical professor of psychology at the
Yale Child Studies Center, found slightly above-average
intellectual, social and emotional development among a small group
of children reared by stay-at-home fathers. He followed the
families for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pop-cultural barometers of shifting breadwinner roles
is a pilot to be shot this month for a midseason sitcom called
``Daddio,'' produced by Disney for NBC, about one such man. Matt
Berry, an executive producer of the show, stayed home with his
children during his 15 years working nights as a stand-up comedian.
He said he and his writing partner had pitched the idea to networks
before, unsuccessfully because the reaction was always, ``but
people won't respect him as a man,'' he said. ``And we were like,
`Why is that a tainted concept? Why can't he be a man because he
decided to stay home full-time with his kids?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, men who stay home still face a problem well known
to women in the same position: isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Frank, a psychologist who has organized these
conventions for the last four years, conducted a study in 1996 of
371 fathers who identified themselves as their children's ``primary
caregivers.'' Of those, 63 percent said they felt isolated, versus
37 percent of mothers in the same position.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The isolation manifests itself in many ways. Loneliness,
depression, stir-craziness that some men described as ``bouncing
off the walls.'' And the familiar corollary of all these problems:
weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   In a small discussion group, Vince Gratton, a former prosecutor
from Pueblo, Colo., with three girls (one 9 and 3-year-old twins)
said he had started working out. ``I've been weight-training for
four months,'' he said. ``I can bench 265 and squat 400 and I'm
gonna crush the next guy who says, `What do you do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gratton, 56, said he had to go all the way to Chicago to find
another stay-at-home dad from his hometown. ``Now I got this big
guy here, who's sensitive and loving,'' Gratton said gruffly,
motioning to another burly man in an aviator jacket. But no one
else, he said. ``I live in a steel town where manly men do manly
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The tables in the classroom were pushed together to encourage
intimacy. Experiences of a so-called ``glass wall'' separating
mothers from fathers in parks and schoolyards echoed around the
room. Edward Howard, 54, said, ``I go to the playground with my son
and I'm tired of being looked at as some kind of sexual pervert.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally frustrating as feeling frozen out for these men is being
condescended to. Jim DiCenzo said the principal of his child's
school in San Diego told him, ``I think it's so cute that you stay
home with your kids.'' His reaction: ``I could have strangled
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of them said, better to drive to a distant Burger
King for a play date with another stay-at-home father than endure
the awkwardness or boredom of the company of women. One man, who
asked not to be named, said, ``I don't want to sit around and talk
for an hour about shopping or listening to them complain about
their husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasional retrograde comment aside, most of the
convention's attendees regard themselves as fully evolved males, in
touch with their nurturing sides.
</P>
<P>
   After screening his 22-minute documentary film ``Homedaddy,''
Kent Ayyildiz told his rapt audience, ``The gains women have made
in the workplace should be balanced by men making the same gains in
the house.'' As the closing credits rolled, the audience whooped
its approval and gave the ponytailed Ayyildiz a standing ovation.
They cheered again when he said he no longer identified himself as
a filmmaker who also happens to stay home with his child, but as a
``homedaddy'' who also happens to make films.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ayyildiz admitted to a certain ambivalence about
putting child rearing first. ``These are the growing years of my
career,'' he said. ``At the same time, I get one chance with my
son.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cooper, who has published a compendium of essays called
``The At-Home Dad Handbook,'' said he was working at Athlete's Foot
in Atlanta and his wife at UPS when they had their first child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to go the day care route and with her having
the better salary potential, we decided I'd quit work and stay
home,'' said Cooper, who now has two children, ages 6 and 5, and
lives in St. Paul, Minn. In 1997, he started a group called
Dad-to-Dad, which now has chapters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I can be home with the kids, I look at things
differently from when I was single or just married,'' he said.
``Then I was career-driven and work meant pretty much everything to

   The commitment to being a good parent outweighed other forms of
housework for many men at the convention. Peter Baylies, publisher
of the At-Home Dad newsletter and Web site, recalled that some
adjustment was required when he and his wife traded places.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a couple of months she said, `When are you gonna clean
the bathroom?' I was humiliated. I didn't care if the bathroom was
clean. It didn't make any difference to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hoh, husband of a nurse in St. Paul, Minn., expressed a
similar attitude toward what used to be called women's work.
``People say, `Your wife works. You stay home. Who cleans the
house?' And the answer, when people open the door, is clearly,
`Nobody!'''

   The cleaning issue came up in Joanne Massey's seminar, ``The
Anatomy of a Working Woman's Mom.'' Her husband, Jay Massey, runs
Slowlane.com and a Web site design company from their house in
Pensacola, Fla. That makes him a ``work-at-home dad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Massey, the only woman participating in the convention, told
the audience that her husband's workday begins when hers ends. As a
result, ``Mom has to clean up when I come home,'' she said. ``That
was hard to adjust to.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said when she had asked their 5-year-old son what he
wanted to be when he grows up, he said, ``I want to be an at-home
dad.'' That got a big, fist-pumping ``Yes!''

</P>
<P>
   In defense of their lifestyle choice, the at-home fathers often
point out that before the industrial revolution, children were
accustomed to having their fathers around, on the farm or in the
blacksmith shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, it was considered freakish,'' said Baylies,
looking around at the clusters of conventioneers gathered for a
lunch of pasta and salad. ``You'll know that stay-at-home dads are
totally accepted when we don't have to do this.''

ANALYSIS: A KEY TO PUTIN'S PLANS IS AN INTOLERANCE FOR CORRUPTION
</HEADLINE>
   (With RUSSIA-PUTIN) 
(rk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Only Vladimir Putin knows for certain where he wants to
take Russia as the nation's acting president. But if his visit last
week to the Railways Ministry is any indication, Russia may be in
for an interesting trip indeed.
</P>
<P>
   As the Moscow daily Kommersant reported, Putin performed the
rote ceremonial duties at a packed meeting of ministry employees
eight days ago, doling out awards and praising the railroads'
contribution to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But then his tone turned icy. Why, he asked, did the railroads
beseech the Kremlin for money when certain customers got special
shipping discounts? And was it not odd that the ministry had
granted certain unnamed people the rights to collect a mountain of
unpaid freight bills? And why was the ministry buying rails from
Japan when Russia's steel mills were idle and offering fire-sale
prices?
</P>
<P>
   Then he left, even before the flustered deputy prime minister
for industrial policy could read remarks congratulating the Kremlin
on its victory in that week's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary scene suggests there is more than one way to
look at Putin's pledge, made even before he became president on
Friday, to restore a strong central government to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Among Westerners, that promise mostly raises fears of a
crackdown on civil liberties or a return to authoritarian rule,
fears fanned by Putin's direction of the savage war in Chechnya.
But his admirers insist that what he truly wants to subjugate is
the untamed and fantastically corrupt Russian bureaucracy and
economy.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt which is the tougher task. President Boris
Yeltsin held immense power, but under his rule the ties between the
Kremlin and major state agencies, provincial governments and
industries steadily atrophied.
</P>
<P>
   The national tolerance of corruption _ bribes, after all, were
sometimes the only way to accomplish anything under Soviet rule _
allowed bureaucrats to ignore Moscow's dictates and to accumulate
fortunes at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, much of the bureaucracy remains under the control of
Soviet-era bureaucrats who are either ideologically opposed to the
Kremlin or simply indifferent to its demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, the power structures of our country remain,
according to the method of work and the personnel that they have,
in conflict with the new regime,'' said Anatoly A. Sobchak, the
former St. Petersburg mayor who is regarded as Putin's mentor.
``These aren't democratic structures that live in a democratic
state and are merely in opposition to the democratic state.''
</P>
<P>
   The new president, he said, ``is capable of making these power
structures loyal and to make them work for the new democratic
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians have heard all this before, of course, as recently as
1991, and it has yet to come to pass. And Russians have swallowed
promises of strong, benevolent and progressive rule, from Nicholas
II to Stalin, only to see them end up in chaos or autocracy or
both.
</P>
<P>
   The new president will inherit near-dictatorial powers in the
constitution which his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, pushed into law
after thwarting a communist-led coup in 1993. Yeltsin never fully
used those powers, either because of physical or political
infirmity or out of a belief they were not needed.
</P>
<P>
   Putin says he does not believe a new constitution is needed now.
But he also has indicated that he wants to make changes through the
system using the new plurality he won in parliament in last month's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Putin indicates in his own writings that he believes Russia
cannot enter the ranks of advanced nations until it roots out
Soviet traditions and bridges the ideological divide that pits the
communist third of the nation against the democratic remainder.
</P>
<P>
   In a special document, ``Russia at the turn of the millennium,''
published on a Kremlin internet site
(www.pravitelstvo.gov.ru/english/statVPengl1.html), he said that
Russia would be mistaken not to recognize communism's
accomplishments. ``But it would be an even bigger mistake not to
realize the outrageous price our country and its people had to pay
for that Bolshevist experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia needs a strong state power and must have it,'' he
wrote. But a strong state, he added, means ``a law-based, workable
federative state.'' And crucial to that, he added, are a
streamlined and corruption-free bureaucracy, a merit system for
hiring and rewarding government workers, a more powerful judiciary
and closer ties between Moscow and its regions.
</P>
<P>
   Putin backed up his call for reform with some sobering
statistics: Even if Russia's per-person gross domestic product were
to rise by 8 percent per year for the next 15 years, he wrote, the
nation would still only reach the level of present-day Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving the level of Britain or France would require a 10
percent annual growth rate _ and even then, Britain or France would
have to stand still.
</P>
<P>
   Investment has dwindled: Only 4.5 percent of the nation's
industrial equipment was less than five years old in 1998, compared
with nearly 30 percent in 1990. Except in the electricity and
raw-material industries, individual productivity is one quarter of
that in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such shortcomings can be overcome, he said, but only by devising
and swiftly carrying out a plan for the nation's restructuring and
recovery. ``The paramount word is fast,'' he wrote, ``and we have
no time for a slow start.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak, who recruited Putin to a team of economic experts when
he was St. Petersburg's reformist mayor in the early 1990s, said
the new president would benefit from his years as an intelligence
agent in East Germany, where he was in regular contact with Western
businesses and governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a convinced supporter of the market economy,'' Sobchak
said. ``But in contrast to the majority of Russian politicians, he
knows the western model of economic and political life not as a
outsider but from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not blindly transfer some of the recommendations of
the West onto Russia. And I don't think he'll repeat the mistakes
we made in the beginning of the '90s,'' when the country plunged
into capitalism without the system of laws and government
regulations needed to sustain it.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Sobchak said, he expects Putin to follow the example of
two American presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D.
Roosevelt, who amassed state power over the government and economy
to shape the capitalistic system that exists today.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt took on entrenched monopolies, helping small
businesses to thrive and competition to flourish. Franklin
Roosevelt reworked the federal government to aid the poor, improve
education and create a less crash-prone financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``His decisive interference in the economy during the Depression
saved America,'' Sobchak said of Franklin Roosevelt. ``I think
Putin has a wonderful opportunity to become for Russia what the
Roosevelts are for America. And if he does this, he'll become the
great president in the history of the country.''

 &HT;    Cowboys know they must pick up the pace
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ If the Dallas Cowboys reach the NFL playoffs,
they will do it with fear in their hearts and urgency in their
steps, according to the team's most outspoken player.
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders has never experienced a week like this. When owner
Jerry Jones challenged 20 veterans in a passionate closed-door
meeting on Monday, the laid-back attitude of an entire franchise
changed. Sanders is among many players who think the Cowboys have
one opportunity to correct a season gone sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speech should encourage everybody, especially us
million-dollar players,'' the All-Pro cornerback said. ``Something
is seriously wrong with us if that didn't encourage us.''
</P>
<P>
   The message from the chief executive was stern and direct.
Excuses no longer will be accepted for a 7-8 football team that has
wasted countless chances to improve its standing.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas will earn the final slot in the NFC playoffs if it beats
the New York Giants today at Texas Stadium. A loss would humiliate
everyone wearing blue and silver.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys think they have more talent than many of the teams
that have beaten them, and that stings everyone in the
organization. Much of the nation has laughed at the Cowboys _
especially after last week's loss to New Orleans _ and Jones showed
his rage during a 20-minute session in his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to pray for Jerry afterward,'' Sanders said. ``Let's
just say he used some words that were special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years I've been here, Jerry's never had a meeting
like that,'' quarterback Troy Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Cowboys respond with a victory remains to be seen.
They have blown six fourth-quarter leads this season. They lead the
league in penalties. Unless they correct the mistakes that have
dogged them all year, the 1999 season will be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took Jerry's speech personally,'' running back Emmitt Smith
said. ``Now it's up to us to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders and Smith understand why Jones took such a harsh stand
Monday. They agree that Dallas has not come close to playing to its
potential. Just last week the Cowboys had five players named to
this season's Pro Bowl, an indication that their cupboard is hardly
bare. By contrast, 7-8 Green Bay _ another team hoping for the last
playoff spot _ will have no one in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he felt ``foolish'' after losing to the lowly Saints
because he is paying $41.5 million in signing bonuses to players on
a losing team. Jones, a longtime executive in the oil and gas
business, knows when his luck runs dry. For starters, he promised
changes will be made to the roster if the players do not show rapid
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to fix this thing,'' Jones said after walking off
the Superdome turf.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, however, it appeared Dallas had no chance of
making the playoffs. The team's mood brightened considerably Sunday
night when they learned they still had postseason life. If they
beat the Giants, the Cowboys will travel to Minnesota, Tampa Bay or
Washington for a wild-card game next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where once there was no life, we have a new life,'' Smith
said. ``What we do with that extra life is up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have victories over Green Bay, Miami and Washington
(twice). But they also have lost games to some of the NFL's worst.
Mental mistakes were blamed for embarrassing losses to
Philadelphia, Arizona and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of their frustration will end if they beat the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has been through quite a lot this decade,'' Smith
said. ``This might be a unique story when all is said and done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are trying to become the first 8-8 team to reach the
playoffs since the 1991 New York Jets. Failure to reach the
playoffs this season would come with a heavy price.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do what we're capable of doing,'' Sanders said,
``it might be the last time a lot of us will be wearing the helmet
with the star.''

<P>
   By the time midnight struck in Maui, even the Internet's most
dedicated harbingers of millennium doom had to concede that things
had turned out better than they expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone still think TEOTWAWKI will happen??'' typed one
presumably sleep-deprived Y2K watcher, using the favorite chat-room
shorthand for ``the end of the world as we know it.'' Her virtual
comrades on Timebomb2000.com were remarkably silent.
</P>
<P>
   But as the year 2000 dawned in cyberspace, the sense of
anticlimax was tempered by a new faith not so much in technology
but in humanity's ability to harness it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noticed that a sense of global community was one of the
take-away messages of the past 24 hours,'' said another posting,
signed ``Diana.'' ``Whatever our challenges, and there will be many
(not necessarily computer-related), these images of shared
experience will be fixed in people's minds. It has the potential to
make us stronger and more resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was because people stayed home to avoid technological
disaster or because they logged on to make sure it had not
happened, millions wove the Internet into their New Year's Eve. By
midnight on the U.S. East Coast, the EarthCam site, which showed
pictures of celebrations in every time zone, was receiving
thousands of visitors a minute. America Online reported that its
traffic dropped just before midnight and surged again immediately
after.
</P>
<P>
   As friends and families zapped e-mail updates across time zones,
and the more ambitious broadcast their parties on the World Wide
Web, many said the computer network made for a more intimate sense
of world celebration than what they could watch on television.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Himona, an educator in Wellington, New Zealand, wrote to a
list of dozens of correspondents as his country slipped into the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still here!!'' Himona said. ``The world didn't come to an
end, the Universe seems intact, and the dreaded apocalyptic y2k bug
didn't devour us all, I think. And the thousands of kids down at
the Wellington waterfront couldn't care less. They're having a
party. Are you all still out there? Or is New Zealand the only
country to survive? Am I the only person left in the Universe?
Speak to me someone!!''
</P>
<P>
   Himona said he heard back from friends and relatives from Wales
to Seattle as the night circled the globe. ``The Internet is person
to person,'' he wrote in an e-mail, ``like the small family
celebration we had last night.''

   At midnight in Bosnia, Elizabeth Sweeney, 26, a U.S. Army
captain stationed at Eagle Base in Tuzla, wrote to her boyfriend at
Fort Knox, Ky. ``Happy yes i am,'' she said, ``and happy new year
too, you make me happy. It is almost 1 am here. Fun little party.
Lots of fake champagne spraying everywhere and lots of noise. I am
sooo sleepy I am going now, before I REALLY fall asleep at the
computer.''

<P>
   Not all New Year's connections on the Internet were quite so
poignant. At midnight in Louisville, Colo., Shane Bower, 28, and
his eight friends took a break from their computers to drink some
Champagne. Bower's ``clan'' had been playing Quake, a computer
game, both with one another and over the Internet with players
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, Bower said, someone in some other time
zone would type ``happy new year'' in the game's chat box and he
would realize that something momentous was going on outside his
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is kind of meaningless when I turn on the computer,''
said Bower, a chemical engineer. ``All of a sudden it's six hours
later, and this time, it was like, all of a sudden it's the new
millennium.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several Web sites served as gathering places for engineers and
novices alike to post observations of computer-related problems in
their corner of the world, or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:23 a.m. in Duesseldorf, Germany, Udo Remmes, a radiologist,
wrote to a site called Zone2000: ``No breakdowns or other problems.
River Rhine still flowing. Dog and daughter sleeping. Bit more of
fireworks tonight. Nearly same procedure as last year _ sorry _ as
every year. However, happy New Year.''
</P>
<P>
   From Manama, Bahrain, David Hyams, a retired businessman, also
gave assurances to the world. ``All is well,'' Hyams, 74, wrote.
``Computer is working, the net is up, there is a dial tone, and
lights are on. Best wishes to all.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyams said he had talked with his daughter, Amy, in San
Francisco earlier in the evening using Yahoo Messenger, a program
that allows voice chat over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On the online auction site eBay, some people's concerns were
more prosaic. Bidding continued through the night, except for two
periods when the company took its servers offline for Y2K-related
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking for small grandfather clocks that stand anywhere from
10 inches to 2 feet in height,'' one bidder with an America Online
e-mail address said in a posting shortly after midnight. ``Can
anyone help?
</P>
<P>
   In the eBay online cafe, another person was offering ``100
batteries, 200 gallons bottled water, 300 hundred rounds 30/06,
etc. _ cheap!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of those who had actually collected such
supplies were not yet ready to laugh about it on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew this wasn't a one-day event,'' one defiant
doomsayer wrote on a year 2000 preparedness site. ``We have to wait
and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Happy New Year anyway,'' responded someone who signed
himself Yawn2K. ``Better luck next apocalypse, survivalists.''

BIG MOMENT COMES AND GOES, MINUS DISASTERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was three hours before midnight on Friday and
John A. Koskinen did not appear worried a bit. His head was back.
His eyes were closed. And a flight attendant aboard the last Delta
Shuttle flight of 1999 from New York to Washington was urging him,
to no avail, to return his seat to the upright position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, sir,'' the attendant said, pulling at the seat.
``Excuse me.'' It was three hours before midnight and the federal
government's year 2000 coordinator, President Clinton's point man
on the potentially debilitating computer problems, was fast asleep.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Koskinen was not taking the arrival of
the new year seriously, or that he had written off the possibility
of any devastating computer mishaps. ``Some people have said, `Why
does this guy look so relaxed?''' Koskinen said. ``If I had any
worries, they were at the beginning. The last two months, I've
slept well every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, a former government budget official and corporate
turnaround expert, had been on the job for more than a year and a
half when the big moment finally arrived. He had held countless
strategy sessions, conference calls, tests, drills, press
briefings, public hearings and closed-door meetings. And even his
brief shut-eye aboard Delta Flight 1769 was work-related. By
catching a quick nap aboard the nearly empty flight, Koskinen was
reassuring the public about the safety of the nation's airlines.
</P>
<P>
   He had arranged his quick trip to La Guardia Airport and back so
he would be in the air at 7 p.m. Eastern time, which was midnight
in the world of aviation, when the air traffic control system
encountered the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy New Year,'' he said casually when the big moment
arrived. The 727 he was aboard kept flying. He settled into his
seat. As far as crises go, this one was a snoozer.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's round-the-clock $50 million command
center had all the hubbub of an insurance office. There were no
officials running around in commando attire. No shouted cries. No
distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty sedate atmosphere,'' said one staff member, who
left midway through the night to ring in the new year at home.
``People are making phone calls and making reports, but there's not
much occurring out there.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So aggressive was the information collection effort, though,
that even minor traffic glitches in far-flung places were reported
straight to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Marion, Ohio, reported that its transportation system had
suffered slowdowns, but the culprit was blowing snow and slick
roads, not wayward computers. Quincy, Mass., noted that traffic was
being rerouted through its downtown because of a New Year's
celebration there. Rock Springs, Wyo., noted on its report that
there is a vacancy for the Red Cross directorship there.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors about what might happen far outshined reality.
</P>
<P>
   There had been the talk among the gloomiest about rioting in the
streets, martial law, an end to society as we know it. Part of
Koskinen's job leading up to the rollover was to calm nerves in
order to prevent runs on banks, hoarding of supplies and other
hysterical behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site set up by the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion attempted to shoot down rumors before they spread too
far: Elevators were not at risk of free fall. Prison gates would
not swing open. The president, who was busy speechifying when the
second hand reached the top of the clock, had nothing sinister up
his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has no intention of declaring martial law for
the Year 2000 transition,'' the Web site advised, even offering
some historical context to back up the point. ``No president has
ever declared a condition of martial law that applied to the entire
country. In fact, not since President Lincoln placed several areas
of the country under martial law during the Civil War has any
president directly proclaimed martial law on behalf of the federal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Government officials warn that year 2000 problems may still crop
up in the days ahead, when businesses open on Monday morning and
the world's computers first begin operating in a year 2000 world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far too early for us to feel totally satisfied and
declare victory,'' Koskinen said at a briefing early Saturday
morning after the new year had begun in the Central time zone. ``I
think we have three or four more days of careful, close monitoring
before we can truly determine how successful we've been.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, computer experts point out that the next potential
catastrophe could come on Feb. 29, when computers have to deal with
a leap year. On that date, Koskinen will be back in the command
center _ dressed in a suit and tie, not camouflage _ ready for the
worst.

AT THE CLINTON PARTY, MORE BUSINESS AND LESS GLITZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the beluga and the rack of lamb, Elizabeth
Taylor in a pink boa and Lara Flynn Boyle nuzzling Jack Nicholson
at a table near the back of the East Room, the White House
Millennium supper seemed oddly like a business dinner.
</P>
<P>
   As arriving guests _ some 360 artists, scientists and
fund-raisers, along with major donors, loyal senators and favorite
employees _ filed past reporters in the entryway of the White
House, more than a few took the opportunity to plug some project or
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm celebrating the 21st century in telecommunications
infrastructure,'' said one sentimentalist. Terry McAuliffe crowed
about raising $16 million to pay for the millennial extravaganza,
and Mary Tyler Moore noted that she was celebrating her ABC movie
``Mary and Rhoda,'' scheduled for Feb. 7: ``I've just seen the
rough cut and I'm very proud.'' Mary Wilson announced a reunion of
the Supremes.
</P>
<P>
   Others said outright that they felt they had gotten their
money's worth in return for major donations to pay for the
festivities. And at the dinner itself, executives seated near
Commerce Secretary William Daley were openly lobbying him on behalf
of their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   There was a conspicuous lack of flashy jewelry on display, and
as many women in low-key velvet pants and tunics as in taffeta
gowns. Some, presumably, were dressing to accommodate the silk long
johns recommended by the White House for keeping warm while
watching the show on the Mall later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few guests were sparkling, and the hostess was, too:
Hillary Rodham Clinton's black silk dress was offset by a collar of
glittering stones. And when a rather baldly appreciative reporter
asked Sophia Loren whether she would be able to keep warm in her
low-cut black dress, she said, ``I have a little wrap,'' and seemed
to gesture toward the diamonds and rubies around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   The president began the dinner with a toast, and on the last New
Year's of the century, Clinton asked his guests, who were packed
Paris-bistro-close in both the East Room and the State Dining Room,
to make a wish, and said he would do likewise. He kept his own
hopes to himself, but spoke of a better future that ``I hope every
American will take a moment to imagine on this Millennium Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, joking that he could hardly be expected to recap the last
1,000 years when ``in the State of the Union I get a whole hour to
talk about a single year and usually I run over,'' he asked the
crowd to join him in a three-part toast to themselves, to Mrs.
Clinton, and to the future itself.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Guests included the Nobel prize-winning scientist Murray
Gell-Mann, who gamely tried out some jokes on Sid Caesar, and
Muhammad Ali, who got a bear hug from the president. Walter Kaye,
the political supporter responsible for first bringing Monica
Lewinsky to the White House, was also on the guest list.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., accompanied by his wife,
Victoria Reggie Kennedy, and his sister, Jean Kennedy Smith, a
former ambassador to Ireland, came in shouting, ``See my pretty
sister the ambassador?'' Lynda Johnson Robb said her red brocade
jacket had begun life as a smoking jacket worn by her father,
President Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The contingent of actors included Ossie Davis, Julie Harris and
Robert DeNiro, who raced past reporters as they argued over whether
Nicholson had just said he was glad to be there because ``this is
America here,'' or ``this is America, dear.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor arrived about an hour late after being ``either
caught in traffic or lost,'' a White House spokeswoman said.
Wearing a deep-red velvet gown, she laughed with gusto as she was
led toward the East Room, stepping haltingly while an assistant
followed behind her pushing a wheelchair. Chelsea Clinton, who was
dressed in midnight blue, joined her parents in the receiving line,
the first time she had taken on such official host duties.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner _ tastes of caviar, foie gras and oyster veloute
and a main course of rack of lamb served with roasted artichoke and
pepper ragout, followed by a green salad and chocolate and
champagne dessert _ guests were bused to the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The show at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial was nothing if not
eclectic, from Tom Jones singing ``It's Not Unusual,'' to Bobby
McFerrin, Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle performing ``He's Got
the Whole World in His Hands.''

   POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-STYLE _ Something about putting on shorts every night
for years and dribbling a ball before thousands changes the way a
performer reacts in front of crowds. The tension of stage fright,
common among those who act, play the concert piano _ or, in most
cases, run for public office _ is missing. The muscles donit
tighten in the same way and the face assumes a loose, locker-room
quality of disregard for the attention being focused on it. As much
as any of the traditional Democratic initiatives he proposes in his
platform, this low-key demeanor, epitomized by the throat lozenge
tumbling constantly in his mouth during his speeches, distinguishes
former Sen. Bill Bradley out on the stump. (Bradley, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   GA-AETNA-PRUDENTIAL _ ATLANTA _ Aetna appears to be on the verge
of getting final approval to acquire Prudential's health care
business in Georgia. But the deal has been overshadowed by
problems. The company is on the verge of being fined for late
payments to doctors and patients. At least one hospital is refusing
to treat patients insured by the company because it says Aetna is
lax in paying its bills. There are also customer service problems
that continue to plague Aetna, and the deal raises the question of
whether service will improve in light of its plans to acquire
Prudential. (Miller, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-RETURNS _ ATLANTA _ If Y2K comes and goes without a blip,
shoppers could ring in the New Year at refund counters. Retailers
that have seen a recent spike in sales of emergency supplies are
expecting a good bit of it to come back if New Year's Eve turns out
to be a non-event. Some retailers, like Sears and Ace Hardware, are
clamping down on customers who bring stuff back. Sears is charging
a 20 percent restocking fee on generators. Some Ace stores won't
take back any emergency supplies. Home Depot has a liberal policy
in general and could see the most refunds. Includes reports from
area stores. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   DOW-2000 _ If you're reading this, congratulations, it means you
survived Y2K. More to the point, it means you can probably look
forward to another good year of economic and stock market growth,
as amazing as that seems. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

A COUNTDOWN TO REMEMBER, OR A BIG YAWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before the countdown, the cork popping, the confetti
and the computer worries _ indeed, long before most people had
personal computers _ there was the anticipation. And no one did
more anticipating than Edward Woodyard, who spent 16 percent of the
1900s anticipating the arrival of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Woodyard, a screenwriter from Armonk, had spent so much time
ruminating on 2000 because he made his reservations for New Year's
Eve 1999 in 1983, when the hotel in Times Square where he finally
did his celebrating on Friday night was a half-finished skeleton of
steel and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided if other people were thinking like I was, I'd better
get my reservations in because when the time comes, it was going to
be a mob scene,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mob scene, of course, but Woodyard was above it,
looking down on Times Square from the 44th floor of the Marriott
Marquis. It seemed the perfect place to consider the question: Did
the arrival of 2000 live up to its billing?
</P>
<P>
   People probably will be arguing about the answer for the next
thousand years. (Or at least a thousand hours, which turns out to
be almost 42 days.)
</P>
<P>
   Woodyard's answer was affirmative but a bit inarticulate; after
a lot of partying, even screenwriters find themselves fumbling for
nouns and adjectives, as well as hoarse from shouting ``10, 9, 8,
7'' and so on. But yes, he said, 2000 was worth the wait. ``I was
almost speechless. I don't have words for it.'' He tried four:
``Spectacular. Phenomenal. Overpowering. Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pity the poor millennium, it never had a chance to get off the
ground,'' said Mark Mitten, who registered the word ``billennium''
as a trademark because, he said, 2000 was the beginning of the
second millennium. Mitten also has a trademark on something called
the ``millennium hype-o-meter'' on his Web site,
www.millenniumhell.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overburdened by Y2K fears, over-the-top parties and marketing
hype, it seemed to have lost any of the potential it had to be a
noble occasion, worthy of waiting a thousand years for,'' said
Mitten. ``With all the overkill, it was hard to know if it had any
significance at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the arrival of 2000 brought a kind of philosophical
seesawing. There were those who thought it was the greatest thing
in the last thousand years, or at least in the last four. Waterford
crystal, which made the ball that slid down the pole on 1 Times
Square at midnight, credited it with a 30 percent increase in sales
last year, double the company's annual growth rate since 1996.
Waterford, in fact, sold out of seven millennium-related keepsakes
that cost $59 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup included warnings that there would be no corks to
pop: that there would be a champagne shortage. But late last week
stores were cutting prices they had raised back when they thought
they would be at a different point on the supply-and-demand curve.
Korbel Champagne did run out, but still considered 2000 a
manufacturer's dream: It had nothing left to sell by the time it
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But were people hyped out? Not Jeffrey Katz, an owner of 1 Times
Square. ``It was a thrill,'' he said. ``The confetti was so
voluminous you felt like you could step off the building and walk
right through it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side were those who sounded disappointed that 2000
had crept in so uneventfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overhyped, definitely,'' said Alan Gross, who lives in
Brooklyn and spent New Year's Eve at home. ``I was hoping my
computer wouldn't work because I'd have an excuse to buy a new
one.'' He booted up shortly after midnight and was disappointed by
the lack of drama.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the issue of whether the arrival of 2000 was
overpromoted was one of those larger questions: Was the Champagne
glass half full or half empty? ``We didn't hype this,'' said Peter
Coleman, a vice president of the Times Square Business Improvement
District. ``We were trying to fulfill people's dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   And Woodyard certainly seemed close to fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the millennium doesn't start till 2001, Arthur C.
Clarke and all that, but the party is when all those zeroes turn
over,'' he said. ``The only place to be in the world is Times
Square.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Bossert, a spokeswoman for the hotel, said that its
cylindrical core was about half finished when Woodyard called in
1983. Marriott offered Woodyard a suite with two adjoining bedrooms
free. (The hotel did not rent other suites for New Year's Eve; it
charged $2,000 for a four-night package for regular rooms.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation remembers where we were when Kennedy was
assassinated and our parents remember V-E Day, when that
happened,'' Walker said. ``This was one of those things: where were
you at the beginning of the millennium, when all those zeroes
turned over. I remember what fun I had as a kid, and I think this
was 50 times that.''

ENTERTAINMENT CAPITAL GETS LACKLUSTER RATING   FOR FESTIVITIES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ With flashing strobe lights, hovering helicopters,
and a typically atomized approach, Los Angeles said goodbye to the
1900s Saturday morning in a celebration that fell short of its own
aims, dampened by rain and by Southern California's seeming
inability to get too excited about anything.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, the designated municipal icon, the HOLLYWOOD
sign, glowed a midnight blue in the hills above the sprawling
metropolis, and as midnight neared, its letters flashed
periodically in streaks of blue and white, like so much psychedelic
marbleized fudge. Moments before the stroke of midnight, Mayor
Richard Riordan and Jay Leno flipped a switch that sent the sign
flashing into shifting shades of purple, yellow, red and orange,
with white flashing strobes outlining its edges.
</P>
<P>
   But even local television stations seemed to give as much
attention to the sloshing fountains of Las Vegas, apparently
underwhelmed by their own city's stab at civic iconography. And
revelers gathered on the rooftops of the 70-year-old residential
subdivision that the Hollywood sign was built to advertise, kept
waiting for a promised spectacle that never quite materialized.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the celebration seemed proof positive that Los Angeles
lacks the sort of public gathering place that defines a New York or
London, and the sign-lighting itself remained a largely private
affair, since homeowners in the neighborhoods around it had
protested the plan and the police set up a network of multiple
checkpoints to keep all but residents and their invited guests from
driving into the network of canyons with the best views. Horns and
cheers rang out from a few dozen houses, but there was nothing like
the huge gathering in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Though city officials fielded what they called the largest
police operation in Los Angeles history, there were no reports of
serious trouble, and Southern California Edison, which supplies
power to 11 million people in 10 counties, said that there was a
greater risk of electricity problems caused by drunken drivers
hitting utility poles than by any problems in computer programs
governing the power grids.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities got under way Friday afternoon with a musical
celebration dubbed Opus 21, in which churches, choirs and other
groups began a simultaneous sounding of bells, cymbals, gongs and
shofars to start the celebration. But by mid-afternoon, pouring
rain and spotty street flooding had scattered a crowd of several
hundred people from Grand Avenue downtown, where the theme was
``The Global Village,'' with a sort of street fair featuring
face-painters, a Ferris wheel and considerably fewer than the 2,000
marching band members that had been promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good,'' said Linda Miller, who came from nearby
Torrance, Calif., where her husband, Dave, to watch their daughter
march in the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wish it didn't have to rain.'' Surveying the crowd,
she added: ``It's a little thin. I think they were a little light
on the advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, on Olvera Street, the site of the city's
original Spanish settlement, crowds were thicker.
</P>
<P>
   But by night's end, police officers in the city's official
command center were downing deli sandwiches and complaining of an
unexpected challenge: boredom.

&HT;     STILL FEW Y2K GLITCHES RERORTED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the world glided smoothly into the new century,
the United States reported Saturday only a smattering of minor Y2K
glitches, but officials cautioned that problems could still crop
up, especially starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, chief of the White House's Y2K command center,
said Monday will be a crucial milestone because it will be the
first day of normal business operations following the long holiday
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he offered generally upbeat news about the nation's
progress. ``We have not been able to find anything of great
significance to report,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the nation's major sectors from airlines to electric
power grids to telecommunications continued working without
incident on the first day of the new century, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon reported Saturday that a satellite intelligence
defense system had failed shortly after 7 p.m. EST Friday when the
clock in that system turned past midnight Greenwich Mean Time.
</P>
<P>
   John Hamre, Deputy Defense Secretary, said that a backup system
is currently in place and that the problem is with a computer on
the ground and not in the satellite itself.
</P>
<P>
   Other reported Y2K glitches, however, were quickly fixed.
Koskinen said an Amtrak computer system used to track trains
automatically went down temporarily early Saturday but that train
officials switched to a manual system and then fixed the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Computers at five nuclear plants across the country also
experienced temporary problems, but Koskinen said they were
immediately fixed and those plants' operations were not affected.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Naval Observatory, which has a master clock in
Washington that serves as the nation's official source of time,
reported the date as Jan. 1, 19100 during the earliest hours of the
new year on its Internet site. The glitch has since been corrected
and was only on that Web site. It was not a problem in the master
clock, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said federal government agencies and private industry would
continue testing their systems and report any glitches, whether
Y2K-related or not. He said checks of federal government buildings
showed temporary problems with alarm systems at U.S. facilities in
Boston, Kansas City and Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Aviation Administration system used to notify pilots
about such things as weather via e-mail shut down Saturday, but
Koskinen said it was unclear whether the problem was Y2K-related. A
backup pilot notification system was put in place, and air traffic
safety was not affected, he added.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, the Social Security Administration,
headquartered in Baltimore, switched to backup generators before
the millenium rollover. The agency switched its systems back to
Baltimore's main power grid at 6 a.m. EST Saturday without
incident. Koskinen said all of Social Security's computers in
Baltimore and at its field offices across the country are working
normally.
</P>
<P>
   Some other federal agencies, also as a precaution, temporarily
shut down their Internet Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Koskinen and other top government officials
gave upbeat reports for the second day in a row as the new year
swept across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, countries such as China, Russia and Ukraine, which
preceded the United States into the new year, rolled into Jan. 1
without problems in their nuclear power plants and other key
systems that American officials had feared might shut down as a
result of a Y2K computer glitch. More significantly, those systems
continued operating in those countries on their second day of the
New Year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reported Y2K problem overseas occurred when Japan's
Shika Nuclear Power Station about 170 miles northwest of Tokyo lost
its radiation alarm system shortly after midnight there. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson described it as a backup system and said
it did not affect plant safety.
</P>
<P>
   The United States passed its first Y2K tests at 7 p.m. EST
Friday, when computers that control airline traffic, about a third
of the nation's power grid and military operations appeared to roll
over into the new year without incident. The
</P>
<P>
   computers are based on Greenwich Mean Time, which is five hours
ahead of the Eastern Standard Time zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's airspace system is up and running safely,''
Federal Aviation Administration chief Jane Garvey said Friday
night. She flew on a jet from Washington, D.C., to Dallas when air
traffic computers passed midnight GMT.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, who had predicted an easy transition into the new
year, said the fact that it happened should not lead to anyone to
``underestimate the nature of the problem that was originally
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the effort not been made, had the money not been spent, we
would be in a very different situation than we find ourselves in
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department estimates that some $100 billion was
spent in the United States over the past five years to fix the Y2K
problem _ which would occur if computers interpreted the digits 00
as 1900 rather than 2000. Worldwide is it estimated that
governments and private industry spent close to $400 billion fixing
</P>
<P>
   their computers.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the world glided smoothly into the new century,
the United States reported Saturday only a smattering of minor Y2K
glitches, but officials cautioned that problems could still crop
up, especially starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, chief of the White House's Y2K command center,
said Monday will be a crucial milestone because it will be the
first day of normal business operations following the long holiday
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he offered generally upbeat news about the nation's
progress. ``We have not been able to find anything of great
significance to report,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the nation's major sectors from airlines to electric
power grids to telecommunications continued working without
incident on the first day of the new century, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon reported Saturday that a satellite intelligence
defense system had failed shortly after 7 p.m. EST Friday when the
clock in that system turned past midnight Greenwich Mean Time.
</P>
<P>
   John Hamre, Deputy Defense Secretary, said that a backup system
is currently in place and that the problem is with a computer on
the ground and not in the satellite itself.
</P>
<P>
   Other reported Y2K glitches, however, were quickly fixed.
Koskinen said an Amtrak computer system used to track trains
automatically went down temporarily early Saturday but that train
officials switched to a manual system and then fixed the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Computers at five nuclear plants across the country also
experienced temporary problems, but Koskinen said they were
immediately fixed and those plants' operations were not affected.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Naval Observatory, which has a master clock in
Washington that serves as the nation's official source of time,
reported the date as Jan. 1, 19100 during the earliest hours of the
new year on its Internet site. The glitch has since been corrected
and was only on that Web site. It was not a problem in the master
clock, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said federal government agencies and private industry would
continue testing their systems and report any glitches, whether
Y2K-related or not. He said checks of federal government buildings
showed temporary problems with alarm systems at U.S. facilities in
Boston, Kansas City and Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Aviation Administration system used to notify pilots
about such things as weather via e-mail shut down Saturday, but
Koskinen said it was unclear whether the problem was Y2K-related. A
backup pilot notification system was put in place, and air traffic
safety was not affected, he added.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, the Social Security Administration,
headquartered in Baltimore, switched to backup generators before
the millenium rollover. The agency switched its systems back to
Baltimore's main power grid at 6 a.m. EST Saturday without

<TEXT>
<P>
   When voters in Maine went to the polls in November and endorsed
the use of marijuana as a medicine, it was more than a victory for
cancer patients and others who say marijuana will help relieve
their pain.
</P>
<P>
   For a small coalition of libertarians, liberals, humanitarians
and hedonists, the vote was another step forward in a low-profile
but sophisticated crusade to end the nation's criminal laws against
marijuana and other psychoactive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Using polls, focus groups and advertising, the coalition has
selected and promoted causes that might arouse sympathy among
Americans, like giving clean syringes to heroin users to prevent
the spread of AIDS or softening tough penalties for drug use. The
most successful has been medicinal marijuana, which has been
endorsed by the District of Columbia and seven states.
</P>
<P>
   What brought together the disparate elements of the coalition,
however, is a far broader cause: changing the critical way that
Americans think about drugs. Proponents say they want to end a war
on drugs that has packed prisons, offered addicts little treatment
and contributed to the spread of AIDS. Some want to go further and
drop criminal penalties for personal drug use, or even make drugs
legal.
</P>
<P>
   The term they have carefully crafted for their goal is ``harm
reduction'': reducing the harm caused by those people who cannot or
will not stop using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accept drugs are here to stay,'' said Ethan A. Nadelmann,
director of the Lindesmith Center, a drug policy center set up in
New York with money donated by the billionaire George Soros.
``There never has been a drug-free society,'' Nadelmann said. ``We
must learn how to live with drugs so they cause the least possible
harm and the best possible good.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the agenda is more ominous: the legalization of
marijuana and other drugs. At a congressional hearing in June, the
White House director of national drug policy, Gen. Barry R.
McCaffrey, warned of ``a carefully camouflaged, well-funded,
tightly knit core of people whose goal is to legalize drug use in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Rusche, director of Families in Action, a coalition in
Atlanta working to help parents prevent children from using drugs,
accused Nadelmann and his supporters of systematically distorting
the picture of what drugs do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we're concerned about children, but we're concerned about
everybody,'' said Ms. Rusche, who likened Nadelmann to the tobacco
industry. ``He denies that drugs have the capacity to hurt people,
and takes no responsibility for the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann describes his position differently. ``Drugs are not
bad,'' he said. ``Drugs are good, bad or indifferent, depending on
how you use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement's supporters range beyond the Lindesmith Center and
other efforts financed by Soros. Supporters include
marijuana-smokers represented by the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws, or Norml, libertarians who argue that
personal drug use is nobody else's business, and old-fashioned
liberals who castigate the government's campaign against drugs as
worse than the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core is the people who to my mind get it, the people who
connect the dots,'' Nadelmann said. ``We believe that the war on
drugs is a fundamental evil in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The crusade to make drugs socially respectable has no precedent
in the United States, said Dr. David F. Musto, a medical historian
at the Yale School of Medicine and the author of ``The American
Disease: Origins of Narcotics Control'' (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``You have these groups funded by wealthy individuals that are a
constant critic of drug policy, and these groups use very
sophisticated marketing techniques,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that most Americans still oppose making illicit
drugs legal. While voters have been tolerant of letting ill people
smoke marijuana, a Gallup poll this year reported that 69 percent
of respondents opposed making marijuana legal for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mark A.R. Kleiman, a professor of public policy at the
University of California at Los Angeles, said, ``When you look at
all these medical marijuana initiatives, they pass by big margins,
but the governors and legislators go the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Because constituents expect their politicians to be hard-nosed,
Kleiman said, ``a legislator who votes for medical marijuana could
lose votes from people who voted for medical marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann said he commissioned a poll to learn whether voters
would support personal cultivation of marijuana; 65 percent of
those sampled thought that growing marijuana should remain a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this research into public attitudes has been the
deliberately vague idea of harm reduction. By casting the issue in
friendlier terms that resonate across the political spectrum,
crusaders like Nadelmann say, they hope to induce Americans to
tolerate, if not embrace, the elimination of criminal penalties
against marijuana _ and as a few see it, the eventual legalization
of all psychoactive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Critics call the medicinal marijuana issue a stalking-horse for
drug legalization. ``My guess is the real agenda is to promulgate
marijuana as a benign substance outside the boundaries of
conventional medicine,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann did not contradict him. ``Will it help lead toward
marijuana legalization?'' he said. ``I hope so.'' But he said that
reports of his support for harder drugs have quoted him out of
context.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann has advised the campaign for putting medicinal
marijuana on state ballots, which is spearheaded by a group calling
itself Americans for Medical Rights, with no mention of marijuana.
The campaign's director, Bill Zimmerman, explained, ``You pick the
name with a view toward winning support for the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all critics of government drug policy want to make illicit
drugs legal. Some assert that prohibition has not stopped drug use.
Others say that money would be better spent treating addicts who
commit crimes rather than locking them up.
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann wants to enlist such people in his cause of repealing
all penalties for drug use. ``What we reformers do is to use these
coalitions on one issue to educate our allies about the broader
implications of the drug war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Stewart, a senior policy analyst for the Drug Policy
Foundation, another group in Washington supported by Soros, said
that lifting criminal penalties for marijuana use would be
sufficient. Writing in the group's newsletter, he explained,
``decriminalization makes the point that adults should not be
arrested for using marijuana as they would use a martini.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart described the Drug Policy Foundation as ``agnostic''
about other illicit drugs. But its founder, Arnold S. Trebach, told
journalists in 1997 that everything from cocaine and heroin to
steroids should be freely available.
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann objects to stigmatizing recreational drug use.
``People shall not be discriminated against based on the substances
they consume,'' he said. ``The extension of the notion of equality
is going to have to include drug users.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union also endorses the right to
consume drugs. Ira Glasser, its director, said this year, ``The
ACLU's position is basically that criminal prohibition is
inappropriate in matters that involve a person's own behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Glasser is also chairman of the Drug Policy Foundation. Holding
both posts, he said, poses no conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann said that a fresh initiative on medicinal marijuana
would be voted on next year in Colorado, where an earlier
referendum was declared illegal, and in Nevada, where the proposal
must be approved twice. Other states that have passed such
initiatives, he said, would be encouraged to get involved in
producing and distributing marijuana for medicinal purposes.

COMMENTARY: THE TALENTED MS. LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Emma Woodhouse learned the hard way about the
dangers of makeovers. She tried to turn her simple friend, Harriet
Smith, into a girl with airs and aspirations. Too late, Jane
Austen's heroine realized she had altered Harriet for the worse,
from humble to vain.
</P>
<P>
   Literature is rife with cautionary tales about experiments in
identity _ from Dorian Gray to Jay Gatsby to Tom Ripley, whose
murderous motto is ``Better a fake somebody than a real nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as we head into Clinton 2000, the vertiginous story
line remains the same: a carnival of makeovers, with inconstancy
all that is constant.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton did a round of TV interviews last week to
try to give his image one more face lift, Linda and Monica sashayed
back onto the stage to flaunt their own transformations. And to add
to the craziness, Hillary, the woman of a thousand faces, was
displaying her dueling identities: first lady being hugged by the
president at the millennium kick-off ceremony and New York Senate
candidate whose best campaign move would be to dump the guy.
</P>
<P>
   You almost had to feel sorry for the Proteus in Chief. He tried
to go deep and look far with Charlie Rose on ``60 Minutes II,''
talking about biomedical advances and the human genome project,
musing about 2050: ``What's this world going to look like?''
</P>
<P>
   But while the president wondered what the world would look like,
the world wondered what Monica and Linda would look like. A
slimmed-down Ms. Lewinsky is starting her new career as a huckster
for Jenny Craig, which fattened the company's stock by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps inspired by Paula Jones' exciting new nose, Mrs.
Tripp unveiled her exciting new head.
</P>
<P>
   How weird: a scandal that investigated whether the president was
treating women as sex objects has ended with most of the women
involved getting makeovers to look sexier.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shock, after Mrs. Tripp blessedly disappeared for
several months, to learn that she was just getting ready for her
close-up. With her utterly transformed visage and dark hair, she
recalled those mobsters who have to get new faces after they turn
rat finks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like she's had a head transplant,'' Lucianne Goldberg
told The New York Post, which was reporting on a new National
Enquirer story.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said that Mrs. Tripp, who was hurt by being portrayed by
John Goodman in a wig on ``Saturday Night Live,'' just wanted to be
pretty. David Letterman conceded the surgery had done wonders:
``She looks like a new man.''
</P>
<P>
   The moral is one Jane Austen would appreciate: ugly is as ugly
does.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp released a statement on Friday saying that the
head-to-toe surgery and liposuction, performed by a Beverly Hills
knife-artist, was paid for by an unidentified private donor who
sympathized with her over the biting parodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just didn't feel good about herself and felt she could
feel a lot better and this is what she went and did,'' Bob
Angelotti, a Tripp spokesman, told The AP.
</P>
<P>
   This woman nearly topples the republic and all she needs to feel
better about herself is fat vacuuming?
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment chaos now boils down to three fashion questions:
Is there still a waiting list at Club Monaco for Monica's lip gloss
color? Were her online totes all sold out for Christmas? How much
weight has she lost?
</P>
<P>
   Before Monica, it was considered retro to openly discuss the
weight and appearance of women. The day after her testimony at a
hearing in Maryland in Mrs. Tripp's wiretap case, The Washington
Post ran a story that began with what it considered to be the
essential fact: ``Thirty pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   And at a Washington cocktail party last week, a gaggle of guests
talking to Kenneth Starr blithely speculated about the number of
pounds the former intern had shed.
</P>
<P>
   We all believe in second acts and second chances _ even third
ones. We all believe in self-improvement. We all believe in the
possibility of genuine change and true conversion.
</P>
<P>
   But this crowd has given personal development a bad name. The
problem is not metamorphosis. The problem is tactical and tacky
metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   All the signals of American culture notwithstanding, the answer
is not to be found in appearances. &QL;

AIR FORCE ROCKS BRAZIL BY CHALLENGING MILITARY SETUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Barely six months ago, Brazil's
government achieved a long-cherished objective with a carefully
negotiated merger of all three of its military forces into a single
ministry that is theoretically under civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   But now, to the government's embarrassment, the air force, the
most nationalistic of Brazil's armed services, is very noisily
challenging that concept.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has already led to the dismissal of the air force
chief, Gen. Walter Brauer. But it has also raised questions about
the proper role of the Brazilian military in politics and the
economy at a time when President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is
intent on reducing the size and reach of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Though Brazil was ruled by a military dictatorship from 1964 to
1985, no one is suggesting that insubordination by the air force
could lead to a coup attempt. The armed forces do not appear to
have either the capacity or the desire for such an action, which in
any case would probably be answered with resistance from the
civilian population and sanctions by Brazil's allies, neighbors and
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has been brewing at least since June, when Elcio
Alvares, a former senator, was sworn in as the first civilian
defense minister in this nation of 165 million people, and the
army, navy and air force were forced to give up the separate
cabinet-level posts they had always held. At that ceremony, Brauer
very publicly snubbed Alvares. He did not congratulate his new
boss, and he led a walkout of senior air force officers.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cause of Brauer's dismissal, however, was his
criticism of a close aide and former law partner of Alvares whose
name has surfaced in a congressional drug-trafficking
investigation. Contending that ``public life has to be very
unblemished and transparent,'' Brauer seemed to suggest in
testimony before the congressional panel that the aide should be
fired.
</P>
<P>
   That breach of hierarchy and protocol irritated Cardoso, and on
Dec. 17 Alvares was ordered to get rid of both the aide and Brauer.
</P>
<P>
   But political analysts note that larger issues lie behind the
dismissal. David Fleischer, a professor at the University of
Brasilia, said that the air force was ``the branch of the armed
forces targeted for the greatest negative impact'' by the
government's policy of selling off state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant nationalist wing of the air force has been
particularly upset by the recent purchase of a 20 percent interest
in the highly successful aircraft-manufacturing company Embraer by
a French consortium. The company was founded by the air force and
later transferred to private Brazilian concerns, but the military
regards the entry of foreign capital in a ``strategic sector'' as
harmful to Brazil's national defense and commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Cardoso administration is now discussing the
privatization of Brazil's airports, despite objections by the air
force, which fears that commercial interests will buy only those
that are profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government intends to create a civil aviation
agency soon, and that would strip the air force of both the
regulatory authority it currently exercises over airports and
flights and the profits and privileges that go with that control.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have also clashed over the direction of Brazil's
nascent space program. The government favors partnerships with
other nations, ranging from China to Ukraine, and with private
commercial interests. The air force prefers to go it alone and,
government officials contend privately, it has been secretly buying
strategic rocket components on the international black market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, scores of retired military officers and a handful of
active-duty generals and colonels attended a ``luncheon of
grievance'' here honoring Brauer. The leader of the retired
officers' club, Gen. Ercio Braga, criticized the government for
``disrespectful'' and ``coarse and surreptitious'' handling of the
controversy. The event and comments immediately drew fire from
Cardoso's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot let this go by without a response, because, above
all, it is necessary to defend democracy and institutional order,''
said Miro Teixeira, a prominent member of Congress. ``Military
officers are able to make such declarations thanks to a democracy
that they themselves did not help build.''
</P>
<P>
   But an extreme right-wing member of Congress, Jair Bolsonaro,
who is a former soldier and who attended the protest luncheon,
added fuel to the fire by saying of Cardoso, ``For the crime he is
committing against the nation, his sentence should be death by
firing squad.'' Outraged fellow legislators now want Bolsonaro to
be suspended from office for a month, and a vote on such a measure
is tentatively scheduled for this week.

   OSH, Kyrgyzstan _ On most days, 11-year-old Azamat Malikov
spends at least an hour or two doing what comes naturally to many
people in Kyrgyzstan. He works at memorizing what is said to be the
world's longest epic poem.
</P>
<P>
   One sunny afternoon, Azamat, resplendent in a dark blue velvet
robe, chanted the story of a battle so vividly that he even
frightened a visitor who could speak no Kyrgyz. Azamat rocked to
and fro, waved his arms and changed his expressions wildly to
illustrate the text.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather asked me to please learn the Manas epic,''
Azamat said afterward. ``He told me that if I did, I would become a
very good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who have studied this epic call it as stirring as ``The
Iliad,'' as episodic as ``Don Quixote'' and as rich in moral
guidance as the Gospels. It tells the story of an ancient hero who
fought to establish and defend a homeland for the Kyrgyz people.
His resolute commitment to virtue makes the epic a textbook of
moral values as well as an enthralling story.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the main cultural treasure of the Kyrgyz people, and
has played a central role in their history. Lacking a strong
religious or political tradition, the Kyrgyz use the legend of
Manas to define their collective identity.
</P>
<P>
   It is what binds them together as a people and, some believe,
what has allowed them to survive while other Asian peoples have
vanished into history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Manas epic is many centuries old, it was first
written down in fragments less than 150 years ago. It is a
quintessentially oral work, passed down across many generations by
Manaschis, masters of recitation who chant it at festivals and
other gatherings. Most of these Manaschis have been men and women
with strong constitutions _ able to go on for hours or days at a
time and often slipping into a kind of trance as they chant.
</P>
<P>
   Because there has never been an authoritative text, each
Manaschi can weave in original lines, and even episodes and
characters. The greatest of them are revered as prodigious creators
in their own right. Over the centuries, they have forged a culture
of memorization that is as strong as any in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the Manas tradition is oral rather than written,
it has proved impossible to suppress. Czarist conquerors and later
the Soviet authorities sought to manipulate its message of Kyrgyz
self-determination. But the tradition is thriving today, thanks in
part to support from the Kyrgyz authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kyrgyzstan emerged from the debris of the Soviet Union in
1991, its educational system has been in ruins. The authorities
have decided to concentrate on an elite of talented children and
have opened up several schools for them. Most of them _ like the
Meerim School in Osh, the second-largest city in Kyrgyzstan _ offer
courses on the Manas legend.
</P>
<P>
   Meerim's pupils are selected from among the gifted and
ambitious. Most come from poor families. Once accepted, some choose
to learn ceramics, computer technology or other skills. But the
group that concentrates on Manas has a special cachet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us Manas is not just about history,'' said the school's
director, Sayrakan Usupova. ``It teaches the importance of being
good. Naturally these kids are excited to be the center of
attention when they perform at weddings and parties. They take
their competitions very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is not really about show,'' Ms. Usupova said. ``It's
about teaching moral principles for the present day. No child who
studies Manas will ever grow up to be dishonest or negative or
unproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   The eponymous hero of this epic is described as a towering
figure who could uproot any tree and hurl boulders from the heights
of the Tian Shan mountain range. He vowed at age 12 to free his
people from oppression, and lived a noble life until he was
treacherously killed. His burial place is secret, and when anyone
seeking it comes too close, a storm is said to break out that can
only be calmed by reciting the epic.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows when this story was first told. Kyrgyz clans moved
into the territory they now inhabit following epic battles in the
ninth century, and feats performed then may have been the basis for
some episodes. The 300 years that followed proved to be a rich
period for Kyrgyz life and culture. Not only the Manas poem but
also more than a dozen other epics, some of them still performed
today, emerged during this period.
</P>
<P>
   The figure of Manas is not known to be based on any single
individual.
</P>
<P>
   By one count, his life story has been told in more than 60
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the original text have undoubtedly been lost forever,
but scholars say more than half a million lines survive. That would
make this epic more than 30 times as long as ``The Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   No definitive version of the surviving epic exists, but the
government is collecting material and hopes to publish one in the
next few years, first in Kyrgyz, then in Russian and perhaps in
English. But resources here are limited, and even with the help of
the United Nations there has been little progress on plans to
release recordings of Manaschis in performance.
</P>
<P>
   President Askar Akayev, who likes to give visitors a two-volume
English translation of selections from the epic, said in an
interview that he first heard it chanted in his native village when
he was 4 or 5. He added with evident pride that he had personally
heard the late Sayakbai Karalayev, said to have been one of this
century's greatest Manaschis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Kyrgyz people, Manas is more than an epic,'' Akayev
said. ``It's what the Bible is to Christians. It inspired people in
their hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to Manas, this small nation preserved its traditions
and history, and survived to become a country in Central Asia.
Kyrgyzstan can become successful in the 21st century only by
adopting modern technology while at the same time preserving the
moral code from Manas.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Akayev convened regional leaders and other dignitaries
for a lavish celebration of the 1,000th anniversary of the Manas
epic. The date was purely symbolic, and the expense left a bad
taste in a country where most people's living standards have
plummeted since the fall of Communism.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech at the celebration, Akayev said that everyone
in Kyrgyzstan should adhere to the seven basic principles of Manas.
This raised some eyebrows, since no one had ever heard of such
principles. It later turned out that the president himself had
divined them.
</P>
<P>
   He listed them as national unity; a generous and tolerant
humanism; friendship and cooperation among nations; harmony with
nature; patriotism; hard work and education; and ``strengthening
and defense of the Kyrgyz state system.''
</P>
<P>
   These principles are now being taught in Kyrgyz schools. They
have become a kind of official study guide for the epic, reminding
young people of the lessons they should learn from it. In effect
Akayev has made this epic the main source of spiritual guidance for
his reborn nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should have beliefs to shape their lives around,'' said
Beksultan Jakiev, a poet and playwright who runs the government
agency devoted to supporting the Manas epic. ``Given our
traditions, it's logical that this should be where people's ethical
base begins.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two active Manaschis, both in their 70s, are
acknowledged as current masters. More are likely to emerge in
future generations.
</P>
<P>
   But some people fear that by turning the epic into a kind of
ideology, Akayev risks cheapening it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has chosen Manas as the state ideal of
Kyrgyzstan,'' said Alexander Kim, a newspaper editor in Bishkek,
the Kyrgyz capital. ``He can't use Islamic or Christian or Marxist
principles, so he artificially created these seven Manas
principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a work of huge cultural and historical importance, but
when it's pressed onto people, that naturally produces resistance.
I personally like to read and study Manas, but I resist when I feel
that I'm being forced to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A larger-than-life equestrian statue of Manas, flanked by his
parents, dominates one of the central plazas in Bishkek. On the
four corners of the plaza are busts of great Manaschis of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Young people who pass by seem interested in the epic and even
proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Jyldyz Mambetova, 23, said she considered early
Manaschis to have been ``the first rappers.'' She first heard the
epic from her grandmother and now reads sections of it whenever she
can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew the Kyrgyz language could be so rich and
expressive,'' Ms. Mambetova said. ``There are so many words I
didn't know. And the stories aren't just exciting. Each one of them
has a moral point. Not many people realize what great cultural
wealth this is.''

WHAT MILLENNIUM? LET OTHERS MAKE MERRY, CUBA WILL WAIT A YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Cuba did not celebrate the start of the third
millennium Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a political statement, even if the Communist Party's
refusal to fade away after the collapse of the Soviet Union or the
continuing U.S. trade embargo make Cuba feel like a time capsule
crammed with dowager buildings and revolutionary slogans. It is
only an acknowledgement _ made on the front page of Granma, the
official newspaper _ that since the Christian calendar began with
the Year One, the new millennium actually starts on Jan. 1 next
year.
</P>
<P>
   So while the rest of the world jumps the gun on the party, Cuba,
Communist or otherwise, ever insistent on following its own
political and social path, will linger in the 20th century for one
more year.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to rumors, neither Madonna nor the Three Tenors showed
up in Havana on Friday night. There were no fireworks or huge
crowds cheering on the stroke of 12, a result of both tradition and
politics. Cubans traditionally spend New Year's Eve at home with
friends and family, waiting until midnight to toss buckets of water
out the window in a ritual that symbolizes saying goodbye to the
past year's bad luck and hard times.
</P>
<P>
   And ever since Jan. 1, 1959, when the dictator Fulgencio Batista
fled Havana, the New Year is more important for commemorating the
day when cheering throngs embraced Fidel Castro and his triumphant
revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   While Cuba officially remains on the verge of the millennium,
its people have grown accustomed to the feeling of being on the
cusp of a new era. They have learned to improvise and survive in an
economy that, despite modest growth, has yet to lift their family
situations. So it was that an elderly artist chuckled as he
reflected on whether the year 2000 held any special meaning for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, every day is the turn of the century,'' he said. ``The
problem is tomorrow. Our preoccupation is tomorrow. What problems
are we going to have tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   Recent weeks have brought contrasting flashes of yesterday and
tomorrow. In numbers not seen since the early days of the
revolution, tens of thousands of people have marched in boisterous
rallies demanding the return of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
refugee who is at the center of a custody dispute between relatives
in Miami and his father in Cuba. In the millennium's last Cold War
battle, some 100,000 protesters in the city of Santiago revived
visions of the old revolutionary fervor on Thursday with their
broadsides against American imperialism and their tributes to
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba is in a time warp,'' said a diplomat who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``In the 21st century Cuba is not going to
have Fidel. He is not going to be around forever. There is going to
be a change and we would like to see it occur in a way that assures
democracy and progress.''
</P>
<P>
   But reminiscent of the days before it started importing
revolution, Cuba is eagerly importing tourists who sip daiquiris in
new hotels or trot out their best high school Spanish as they
bargain down the price of bongos or portraits of Che Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred Italian and Canadian tourists ushered in the New
Year under the dome of the stately Capitol building, which is used
as a museum and convention center, feasting on champagne and
lobster under the stoic gaze of a towering statue that represents
the republic.
</P>
<P>
   In Old Havana, several hundred tourists paid $100 each to dine
under the stars in the plaza outside the cathedral, ringed by
twinkling wreaths hanging from the balconies. As tourists, some in
black tie and slinky gowns, roamed about, ordinary Cubans without
the cash to join the bash looked on curiously from the roped-off
entrances to the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I believe?'' said Yordanka Hernandez, who lives in a
cul-de-sac off the plaza. ``They should do this for us, the Cubans.
Instead, this is for foreigners. As a Cuban, imagine what I think.
We earned it. We're struggling. Struggling for Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a building overlooking the plaza, small groups gathered in
tiny apartments, clinking glasses of rum or dancing to music from
boom boxes as they waited to eat their dinner of pork, rice and
yuca.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate with what we have,'' said Roberto Leyva. ``Let
everybody have their own way. Cubans live among brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   He expected that the New Year observance would bring with it
some official declaration about the revolution's challenges after
41 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comandante will have to talk about the revolution in the
millennium,'' he said. ``For me, this is the best. Here, there are
no assaults, you can walk anywhere. Fidel has created this. If God
exists, that God is Fidel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists flowed through the streets, as they do most days,
taking pictures. Although street vendors grouse that the tourists
often pass by looking but not buying, they are a source of
much-needed hard currency. They also bring a curiosity about an
island that is suffused with near-mythic meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a disillusioned old-time Communist,'' said Allesandro
Damiani, an Italian tourist who works for the European Community.
``I wanted to find out if ideology is stronger than climate and
latitude, or the other way around. I found latitude and climate are
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Damiani said Cuba's opening up to tourism was inevitable since
the collapse of the Soviet Union, which helped subsidize the
government here.
</P>
<P>
   But he also thought it was jarring to see class distinctions he
thought had vanished with the revolution slowly arise between
Cubans who work in tourism and have access to American dollars and
Cubans who do not and are paid in Cuban pesos.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Cubans who has a few more dollars is Manuel Licea,
a singer who first rose to fame in the 1950s with the island's top
orchestras. Though he is fond of his smokes and rum-tinged
espresso, he is still in fine voice, and has become famous again
through his appearances on the wildly popular ``Buena Vista Social
Club'' and ``Afro-Cuban All Stars'' recordings. Since then, he has
traveled to Europe and the United States, playing the traditional
Cuban music known as son for people who remembered it from decades
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The century began with the son,'' he said. ``It will end with
the son.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s he used to greet the New Year in clubs, serenading
tourists with irresistible guarachas that sent their hearts racing
or dreamy boleros that brought tears. The songs, like one titled
``If You Cook the Way You Walk, I'll Eat the Scraps,'' also helped
ordinary folks suffering under the dictatorship forget their
worries.
</P>
<P>
   This New Year, though he was performing in Mexico, his thoughts
were with easing the animosity between Cubans who have long been
divided since the revolution split families and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope for something miraculous in the millennium,'' he said
during a rehearsal break at the Egrem Studios in Havana a few days
ago. ``I hope the Cubans who are in other countries will reach an
understanding between those who are here and those who are outside.
Music, like sport, is something we can do to help that
understanding. That is my dream. Before I have to go to where we
all have to go, to at least see that for 24 hours. Then I can
die.''

 &HT;    PUTIN, ON FIRST DAY AS RUSSIA'S LEADER, VISITS TROOPS IN
CHECHNYA
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Acting president Vladimir Putin moved quickly Saturday
to establish himself as Russia's new leader by flying to the
embattled republic of Chechnya to praise the army.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's most popular politician took over the reins of power
after Boris Yeltsin's surprise New Year's Eve announcement he was
resigning as president after eight tumultuous years. Putin held the
post as prime minister and, under the Russian Constitution, takes
over Yeltsin's job until new elections are held.
</P>
<P>
   The slight, judo-loving former KGB officer is favored to win the
elections, tentatively set for March 26. However, analysts agree
the next three months will be a crucial test of his skills in
navigating Russia's rough-and-tumble political waters.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, 47, showed some political savvy when he skipped a fancy
dinner in Moscow to celebrate the New Year with the 100,000 troops
engaged in a three-month-long battle against what the Kremlin calls
Islamic terrorists in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know that Russia highly appreciates what you are
doing,'' Putin told soldiers as he pinned medals on their chests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (war) is not just about restoring the honor and dignity
of Russia. It is rather more important than that. It is about
putting an end to the break up of the Russian Federation,'' he said
in remarks carried live on Russian TV from a Russian-held town near
the Chechen capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Putin said there was no deadline for
ending the war.
</P>
<P>
   The televised images of a robust and confident Putin among his
troops on the front lines was a marked contrast with the frail
68-year-old Yeltsin, whose has been repeatedly hospitalized in
recent years due to health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thousands of civilians trapped in Grozny spent a
miserable night as Russian jets pummeled the city in one of the
heaviest attacks yet in the three-month campaign, The Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The war, supported by the majority of Russians, is the main
policy that Putin pursued during his four-month tenure as prime
minister. It is credited with vaulting his career as a unknown
bureaucrat to the odds-on favorite to win the election to succeed
Yeltsin. His approval rating as prime minister ran consistently at
</P>
<P>
   almost 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has shown himself a true politician,'' said Leonid Ionin, a
Moscow political analyst. ``Putin is taking off right now and he
will almost automatically become president.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's announcement of early retirement is expected to boost
Putin's electoral chances. His seemingly unassailable ratings could
slip if losses mount in Chechnya and Russian forces get bogged down
in protracted
</P>
<P>
   fighting, even if they seize control of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Putin currently enjoys considerable support in
Moscow among the country's leading politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In Dec. 19 parliamentary elections, his political party, Unity,
won 23 percent of the vote and leads the largest bloc in
parliament. In the days leading up to the New Year, Putin also won
the support of other parties led by politicians traditionally close
to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Saturday, Yeltsin spent his first full day out of
office with his wife, Lyudmila, at their government country house
outside Moscow.

   HONOLULU _ All over the island, noise.
</P>
<P>
   The first explosions went off before the sun slid down the
horizon in purple-orange ribbons, before the crystal ball dropped
in Times Square, before New Zealand's New Year's, even.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as night fell, the rockets began flying from the roofs of
high-rise buildings off Waikiki Beach, from second-story windows in
short, stout houses west of downtown and from the middle of the
roads, everywhere. Legally, the fireworks were not supposed to
start before 9 p.m. Yet by then, the cacophony was such that
conversations had to be shouted or mimed or postponed.
</P>
<P>
   No one cared that the New Year was old news around the world by
the time it would strike midnight here, in the last state in the
country, five hours after Times Square, to celebrate the
millennium. The later the hour, the louder the celebrations became.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists were flabbergasted. ``We didn't think it would be so _
exuberant,'' said Hugh Williams, who comes from Britain and lives
in San Diego. He and his wife, Elizabeth, were awaiting the
witching hour at the Aloha Tower Marketplace, one of the island's
main celebration points. She could not help holding her forefingers
in her ears. ``It sounds like an air war,'' she said. ``A person
could go deaf after this.''
</P>
<P>
   The formal celebrations here looked much like the spectacles
staged in cities around the globe. At midnight, streams of
fireworks lighted the sky as crowds watched shoulder to shoulder,
open-mouthed.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest celebrations were in old neighborhoods where
families had stockpiled fireworks as though they might be called
upon to fire up the island all by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Kalihi had to be one of the loudest, smokiest neighborhoods of
all. The air was thick and gray, with clouds of gun powder that hit
you in the face, clutched your throat and masked your eyes.
Residents strung up strands of thousands and thousands of
firecrackers on pyramid-shaped trellises created just for the
occasion. Families held barbecues in car ports, with several
generations, from great-grandmothers to young children, partaking
in the fireworks' shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, it gets louder and louder, bigger and bigger,''
said Gayle Reese, who said he never lighted 50,000 firecrackers at
once. ``Every year, you hear, oh, we're gonna ban the fireworks.
But if they ban the fireworks, there would be a lot of unhappy
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks are a long tradition here, but their use has grown in
recent years. Calls for a statewide ban on fireworks use by private
citizens have grown too. Last year, there were more people lighting
more fireworks than ever, which led city officials to worry what
would happen this very big New Year's Eve. When fireworks went on
sale Christmas Day, and stores began reporting record sales,
officials worried even more.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the peace, if not the quiet, of Honolulu, the city's
police chief, Lee Donohue, stationed 1,100 officers on duty, twice
as many as last New Year's Eve and three times as many as on an
ordinary Friday night. The Fire Department added reinforcements,
much needed, it turned out, to answer the 107 calls that came in
through midnight, as compared with 77 calls the same night last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In Kalihi, where the police had confiscated some of the more
than 13 tons of illegal fireworks (aerial fireworks and fireworks
that travel more than 12 feet in any direction) they discovered
throughout the city since Dec. 21, Reese said he thought the
neighborhood had the best fireworks show in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Someone mentioned that the New Year's fireworks display in
Greenwich, England, 10 hours ahead of here, was so spectacular it
could be seen from space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' Reese said. ``But Martians will be able to hear us
tonight.''

TOWN IN INDIANA SEEKS LANDMARK STATUS FOR ITS BUILDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ind. _ In a matter of months, this Midwestern small
town of big-city architecture that is a who's who of postwar design
may boast yet another distinction: a group of its buildings is
likely to become the first in modern architecture to win National
Historic Landmark status, an honor more often bestowed on the
nation's earliest buildings.
</P>
<P>
   On one downtown block alone, there is a library by I.M. Pei; a
sculpture by Henry Moore; a church across the street by Eliel
Saarinen; a bank down the block by his son, Eero Saarinen, and a
company headquarters next door designed by Kevin Roche. There are
schools, firehouses, churches, factories and a Cesar Pelli shopping
mall, all part of a collection of about 65 buildings by nationally
known architects.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a city of 37,000 nestled between farmland and
factories in the middle of the prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Historians who will evaluate the application said the
architecture here amounts to an unusual grouping of significant
modern buildings. ``It is almost like raisins in a pudding _ you
have all these raisins studding a pudding, and they are all
wonderful in their own right, but it's the combination of all the
raisins that makes the pudding good,'' said Patty H. Henry, a
historian with the National Historic Landmarks division of the
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   And these works are found far from American architectural meccas
like Chicago, New York, San Francisco or Boston. ``You're talking
Columbus, Ind.,'' she said. ``To find that little gem of a
collection out there is what makes it unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Architects who have worked here agreed. ``It is at once a
classic American town _ it has a Main Street _ and at the same
time, it has this highfalutin architecture,'' said Robert C.
Venturi, who built Fire Station No. 4 here in 1967. He is now one
of the nation's leading architects, at Venturi, Scott, Brown &AMP;
Associates in Philadelphia. ``I admire the architecture there very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   How did a small city about halfway between Indianapolis and
Louisville, Ky., come by such an astounding collection of modern
architecture? It is, after all, a surprise after the 43-mile drive
south from Indianapolis, where the fields are nearly flat and, at
this time of year, pancake-colored, interrupted by worn-down gray
barns, copses of bare-boned trees and the occasional scruffy silo.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings here reflect another incongruity, a partnership
between heavy industry and high art.
</P>
<P>
   Cummins Engine Co. Inc., a maker of diesel engines and electric
generators, is the patron of this company town and its
architecture. The company's retired chairman, J. Irwin Miller, has
long been a fan of modernists, and in 1957 his company began
financing an unusual architecture program through its nonprofit
foundation, the Cummins Engine Foundation. That jump-started the
effort to persuade notable modern architects to build here.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation pays architectural fees in Columbus' Bartholomew
County for new public buildings and for renovations of existing
buildings, as long as the public agencies agree to choose an
architect from a list of contemporary designers selected by an
independent panel of distinguished architects. Agencies also must
give the architects they hire responsibility for planning and
designing the entire building, including landscaping and
furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good architecture needs a good client as well as a good
architect,'' Venturi said. ``I would love to build another one
there _ it is a sympatico environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cummins foundation has spent $13.8 million on 43 projects
since 1957, including 13 new schools, three fire stations, the Post
Office, the triangular City Hall by Edward Charles Bassett and a
number of renovations of existing buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But the nonprofit group's example has also inspired others.
Fewer than half of the notable buildings here have been paid for by
the foundation. The rest have been backed by other local companies,
residents and congregations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The collection of modern churches alone is remarkable. Miller
got the ball rolling, when he persuaded the congregation of his
church, First Christian, to hire Eliel Saarinen to build its church
here in 1942. The result was one of the nation's first churches
with modern architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Eero Saarinen's 1964 North Christian Church, with a
sanctuary cupped in the structure like a chalice, topped by a
192-foot steeple with a delicate cross rising to the heavens. A
year later, Harry Weese built First Baptist Church, with steep
triangular shapes and a low, T-shaped entrance. In 1998 Gunnar
Birkerts' built St. Peter's Lutheran Church, with tall, thin walls
like fins and floor-to-ceiling windows.
</P>
<P>
   The 1942 Eliel Saarinen church, the 1954 Eero Saarinen bank
building and his 1964 church, the 1965 Weese Baptist church, a 1960
school by John Carl Warnecke and Miller's own house, built in 1957
by Eero Saarinen with landscape architecture by Dan Kiley, are the
six buildings expected to comprise the application for National
Historic Landmark status.
</P>
<P>
   A local preservation group, called Preserve to Enjoy, is
expected to file the application in January, and a decision is
expected this summer. If the landmark designation is granted, other
Columbus buildings may be added in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The application is extremely unusual, Ms. Henry said, because it
violates two nearly ironclad rules at the landmark commission.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, buildings must be a minimum of 50 years old, and the
group of Columbus buildings dates from 1942 to 1965. In the year
2000, even the 1960s can seem long ago, but the landmark commission
makes only rare exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the landmark commission seldom honors the work of
living architects, and the school's designer, Warnecke, is retired
but quite alive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the architects who built here are so notable that
exceptions may well be granted. ``They are very well-known modern
architects that will no doubt stand the test of time,'' Ms. Henry
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus application will focus on two areas: the important
modern architecture and the role of the Cummins Engine Foundation
in bringing it to this unlikely spot.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 90, has handed many architectural cares to his son, Will
Miller, chairman of what townspeople here simply call ``the Bank.''
That's Irwin Financial Corp., a local bank and mortgage company
with $2 billion in assets that early this century was the financial
backer of Cummins Engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, the architecture in Columbus has raised
standards across the board, not just in bricks and mortar,'' said
Will Miller, who like his father is an aficionado of modern
architecture. ``It is an example of Churchill's notion that first
we shape our buildings and thereafter they shape us.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, these Midwestern Medicis have managed to create such
an interesting collection of buildings that leading architects
clamor to design small-scale buildings here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nice to be in that selected group of architects to build
there,'' said Kevin Roche of Roche, Dinkeloo and Associates in
Hamden, Conn. He designed the 1970 post office, a 1973 Cummins
engine factory and the 1983 Cummins headquarters, along with some
additions and renovations. ``It is quite prestigious because you
are in the company of distinguished architects.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised the move to try for National Historic Landmark
status. ``It is good for the buildings because it helps preserve
the buildings,'' Roche said.
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer than 2,300 landmarks nationwide _ the program is
far more selective than the National Register of Historic Places,
which has about 70,000 listings. Landmark status can protect
historic buildings from alterations or demolition by requiring
reviews of any changes to the buildings if federal funds or permits
are involved.
</P>
<P>
   A landmark listing would be an honor for both the city and the
architects. Louis D. Joyner, a Columbus architect who is helping
with the application, said, ``The National Historic Landmark
designation is just like winning the Academy Award.''

 &HT;    NFC playoffs could include two 8-8 teams
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NFL opens the 21st century today by taking a big
step backward.
</P>
<P>
   The final Sunday of the season finds four 7-8 teams trying to
get into the playoffs. If Detroit loses at Minnesota, it will be
the first season in which two 8-8 teams advanced to the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC, Dallas, Carolina, Green Bay and the New York Giants
will be doing some scoreboard watching.
</P>
<P>
   In early games, Green Bay hosts Arizona and Carolina hosts New
Orleans. If the Packers and Panthers win, they'll be rooting for
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are in the playoffs if they beat the Giants in a 4
p.m. game in Dallas. If the Cowboys lose, the Packers could claim
the NFC's final postseason spot over New York and Carolina. Green
Bay has the most net points in conference games among the three
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice to get in. Whether we deserve it or not doesn't
matter,'' Packers quarterback Brett Favre said. ``We'll see what
happens. I don't have my bags packed yet. Some might, but I
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, three division titles will be decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one week away from single elimination,'' Titans coach
Jeff Fisher said. ``If that doesn't get your attention, nothing
will.''
</P>
<P>
   AFC East: Division champ Indianapolis (13-2) travels to Buffalo
(10-5), where the Colts have lost 10 of their past 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   If both Indy and the Jaguars (13-2) win, Jacksonville gets
home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, unless the Colts beat
the Bills by 14 more points than the Jags beat the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miami (9-6) visits Washington for what could be
quarterback Dan Marino's last game as a Dolphin. If Miami wins and
either Kansas City or Seattle lose, the Dolphins earn the last AFC
wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   AFC Central: The Titans (12-3) can win the division with a
victory at Pittsburgh and a Jacksonville loss. Tennessee would get
home-field advantage throughout the playoffs if the Titans win and
Indy and Jacksonville both lose.
</P>
<P>
   AFC West: The Seahawks (9-6) will win the division if they beat
the Jets at the Meadowlands. If Seattle loses, Kansas City wins the
AFC West if the Chiefs beat the Raiders in Arrowhead Stadium for
the 12th time in a row. A loss to the Raiders would knock the
Chiefs out of playoffs. A win would give Kansas City at least a
wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   NFC East: The Cowboys (7-8) can clinch the final NFC wild-card
spot by beating the Giants in Texas Stadium, where Dallas has won
six of its past seven games.
</P>
<P>
   New York needs Arizona to win at Green Bay. The Giants would
technically still be alive if the Packers win, but New York would
have to beat the Cowboys by 56 points more than Green Bay's margin
of victory over the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   NFC Central: Tampa Bay (10-5) can capture its first division
title since 1981 by winning at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay is 0-17 in games played when the temperature at
kickoff is below 40 degrees, and six of those losses were at
Chicago's Soldier Field. Today's forecast call for a high of 34
with lows near 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings (9-6) can win the division and a first-round bye if
they beat the Lions and the Bucs lose.
</P>
<P>
   NFC West: The Rams (13-2) have clinched the division, a
first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers' (7-8) playoff chances are slim. Carolina would
have to beat the Saints and needs the Giants to upset the Cowboys.
If the Panthers, Packers and Giants win, Carolina would have to
make up an 18-point deficit in net conference points to Green Bay.

COMMENTARY: ONCE AND AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Beginnings are always difficult: Even the
most tough-minded writer finds it hard to avoid portentousness. And
since this is a quadruple beginning (new year, new century, new
millennium and, for me, new column), I won't even try. What follows
are some broad opening-night thoughts about the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   I deliberately say world economy, not American economy. Whatever
else they may have been, the '90s were the decade of globalization.
Both the bad news (it was a banner decade for financial crises) and
the good (living standards in much of the world continued to rise,
in some cases _ like China _ spectacularly) were closely tied to
the ever-increasing integration of national economies with each
other, to the seemingly unstoppable logic of growing trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it unstoppable? You see, we've been here before.
</P>
<P>
   Historians sometimes call it the First Global Economy: the era
from the mid-19th century onward in which new technologies of
transportation and communication made large-scale international
trade and investment possible for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In their quest to create that global economy, to abolish the
traditional constraints of geography, engineers accomplished
miracles _ laying telegraph cables beneath the Atlantic, digging
tunnels through the Alps and building paths between the seas. The
Panama Canal, whose construction required breakthroughs not only in
earth-moving technology but in medical science, was the high-water
mark of the age (literally: the locks raise ships 85 feet above sea
level).
</P>
<P>
   And just as the canal reached completion, the global economy
fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the First Global Economy was a casualty of war.
The Panama Canal and the Western Front both went into action in
August 1914. The war and its indirect consequences _ hyperinflation
and political instability in Germany, isolationism in the United
States, and so on _ partly explain why the forces of globalization
went into a retreat that by 1945 left the world economy thoroughly
Balkanized.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that even before 1914, though the volume of
trade and investment continued to expand, the globalist idea was on
the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent men might explain that wars were no longer worth
fighting and borders were obsolete; a sophisticated, cosmopolitan
elite _ like the U.S.-educated technocrats who ran Mexico until
they were overthrown in 1911 _ might move freely between
continents; but the political foundations for a global economy were
never properly laid, and at the first serious shock the structure
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   We are now living in the era of the Second Global Economy _ a
world economy reconstructed, largely under American leadership,
over the past half-century.
</P>
<P>
   It took a long time to put Humpty Dumpty back together again:
The share of world output entering into trade didn't reach its
pre-1914 levels until the 1970s, and large-scale investment in
``emerging markets'' _ that is, places that are to today's world
economy what America was to our great-grandfathers' _ has revived
only in the last decade. But this time the economic achievement is
built on stronger foundations _ isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes _ but maybe not strong enough. True, we have gotten
better at making the distinction between commerce and conquest _
trade no longer follows the flag and blatant imperialism is out of
style. (We handed the Panama Canal back last month.) And Western
nations seem to have more or less grown out of the saber-rattling
nationalism that led to catastrophe back in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   But now as then the global idea is very much a minority
persuasion, all too easily portrayed as an ideology of and for a
rootless cosmopolitan elite that is out of touch with ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
   For that, surely, is the lesson of the trashing of the World
Trade Organization meeting in Seattle last November. Not that the
protesters were right: It is a sad irony that the cause that has
finally awakened the long-dormant American left is that of _ yes! _
denying opportunity to Third World workers.
</P>
<P>
   But though the facts may be on the side of the free traders,
though global trade really ought to have mass public support, one
can hardly deny that the opponents are winning the propaganda war.
For the moment, as long as it seems to deliver the goods and
services, globalization is tolerated; but it is not loved.
</P>
<P>
   The big economic question for the next century, in other words,
is really political: Can the Second Global Economy build a
constituency that reaches beyond the sort of people who congregate
at Davos? If not, it will eventually go the way of the first.

ON OPENING NIGHT, BRITISH WARM UP TO THEIR DOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, England _ There was no escaping the hideousness of
the waiting, more than two unheated hours of it, in lines snaking
down hallways and up and down stairs and outside in the rain until
the fancily dressed millennium night revelers gradually began to
resemble supplicants in a Depression-era bread line.
</P>
<P>
   But the 10,500 guests to the strictly by-invitation New Year's
Eve extravaganza at the custom-built Millennium Dome here at ground
zero of world time barely complained, having a strong cultural
belief in the dreary inevitability of queues.
</P>
<P>
   They were undoubtedly cheered up, too, by the sight of people
like Sir Christopher Bland, the chairman of the BBC, and Andrew
Motion, Britain's debonair poet laureate, standing wretchedly in
line along with everyone else, waiting to get their tickets and
then to pass through a variety of security checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind queuing _ it's what we do best,'' said Jeanette
Francis, a clerical officer from York who won a local competition
for tickets to the dome's opening night celebration, the crowning
achievement of the New Labor government's effort to mark the
passing millennium with both a magnificent monument and a party to
end all parties.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Mrs. Francis complain much when, after finally getting
inside the awesome structure, which dominates the east London
skyline like some sort of wildly lit spaceship, she was made all
too aware of another unpleasant development. Not much of the $1.2
billion spent on building the dome, it seemed, had actually gone to
heat the place.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, partygoers huddling in evening dresses and
winter coats could not help but be swept up in the grand scale and
euphoria of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the evening, an enormous concert in the
dome's central arena, was organized with split-second precision, so
that midnight _ observed by watching Big Ben toll 12 times on giant
screens next to the stage _ fell at exactly the right time.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment itself was the result of months of planning
and soul-searching about tradition, innovation and symbolism in a
very old country looking forward to a very new era. In perhaps the
most debated moment in a country made up increasingly of people
from a variety of religions, the archbishop of Canterbury led the
guests in a prayer that was emphatically Christian.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the program was a hodgepodge of the traditional and
the new, fashioned in dizzying sequence from a variety of different
eras and cultures. Handel's ``Let the Bright Seraphim,'' performed
by the opera singer Rosemary Joshua, was sandwiched between ``So
Young,'' by the Irish rock group the Corrs, and the Beatles' ``Let
It Be,'' performed by the singer Heather Small.
</P>
<P>
   There was a version of ``Amazing Grace'' that segued into a
traditional African folk song, with a chorus of hundreds. There was
``Cymru Fach,'' a traditional Welsh song, and ``A New Beginning,''
an almost heartbreakingly beautiful piece by the composer John
Tavener, commissioned to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   After all the singing and prayers and fireworks and laser shows,
there was a huge dance-and-acrobatic extravaganza, with people
dressed as butterflies, ships, dragons and various kinds of
flowers, among other things, with musical influences from Africa
and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The most amusing moment of the night may have come when the
crowd saw, projected on the screen, the image of Queen Elizabeth,
prim in a little hat, stiffly holding hands with Prime Minister
Tony Blair as everyone sang ``Auld Lang Syne.'' It was unclear,
however, whether the queen herself was actually singing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how the dome, not the most popular of
projects in Britain after a year of bad press devoted to the
delays, the controversies and the cost, will fare as the yearlong
public spectacle it was intended to be. There was little time at
the party to investigate the various zones that have been built
around the themes of the mind, the body, work, commerce and faith,
among other things, but the government's hope is that it will
become as entrenched in the public consciousness as the Festival of
Britain in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the night, after the queen had made her stately
exit, the regular people massed like an army of Cinderellas and
retreated to the subway, only to find that their coach had turned
to a pumpkin once more. ``We are sorry for the delay,'' began the
conductor, as the doors closed and the train went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers' British patience finally snapped. The tired,
tipsy, uncomfortable, crowded people let out one anguished
collective groan, undoubtedly the most noise any had ever made on a
subway before. ``Happy New Year,'' said the conductor.

SMALL-TOWN WARMTH ON A COLD MAINE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBEC, Maine _ It feels a bit silly to report that, yes indeed,
the sun came up here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was no ordinary dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Set on the easternmost point in the continental United States,
the candy-cane-striped lighthouse here at West Quoddy Head
attracted nearly 500 people so eager to greet the new year Saturday
morning that they wanted to be sure to catch the first rays of its
first American day.
</P>
<P>
   And catch them they did, though a little later than planned.
</P>
<P>
   Lubec's claim to the millennium's first light had been based on
expectations that the sun would rise here at just after 7:04 a.m.,
theoretically beating out by milliseconds competitors on Cadillac
Mountain in Bar Harbor, Maine, and on Nantucket Island in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But the sun's upper tip did not flare above Grand Manan Island
on the Bay of Fundy until about 7:09; and plans to compare sunrise
moments in real-time with people in Nantucket and Bar Harbor failed
because of spotty cell-phone reception (which might have been
because of the phone freezing in the frigid morning air.)
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Nobody seemed to have felt cheated as the sun rose
into a gilded blue sky, sending a glimmering column of blinding
orange reflection straight across the water.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Tinker of Lubec, who plays the bagpipes, had prepared the
crowd for sunrise with a piped rendition of Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony until her fingers became too stiff from the cold; and
Hovey Hall, a local trumpeter, led the crowd in the National Anthem
_ whose line about the ``dawn's early light'' seemed unusually
apropos.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy color guard raised the American flag, which was too
frozen to flap in the light breeze, and a Lubec school choir in
L.L. Bean-sponsored hats and gloves sang ``Children of Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   There were even enough fireworks left from earlier Saturday
morning to set off a last 100-shot salute in celebration of the
sun's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   On such a morning, in midwinter Maine, ``Who would believe there
wouldn't be a bit of wind,'' said Wendell Denbow, a carpenter who
was watching his daughter, Brittany, sing in the chorus. ``It's a
good sign, a good omen.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Ness, a member of the town's millennium committee, was
similarly thankful that the weather was not foggy, or else the
foghorn at the lighthouse would have been bellowing. Some on the
committee, she said, had joked about knitting a great stocking to
muffle it, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   She and other residents remained slightly amazed at all the
attention accorded to Lubec, a fishing hamlet of about 1,800 that
residents candidly describe as usually quite dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a small, hometown celebration geared toward peace and
children,'' Ms. Ness said, ``and somehow the media got hold of it,
and it just got ridiculous.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, unabashed, Lubec offered New Year's visitors the best of
tiny-town charm, from a bonfire at the Frog Pond on Friday night to
Saturday morning's free breakfast at the American Legion hall.
(Those who ventured as far as the nearest city, Eastport, on Friday
night also got to see the Maine version of the Times Square
dropping of the ball: A lighted lobster pot was dropped from a
crane into the ocean.)
</P>
<P>
   Cooking on campstoves outside the American Legion hall,
volunteers on Saturday served up blueberry pancakes, blueberry
muffins, red flannel hash, eggs, bacon, ham, donuts and more to all
comers _ of which there were many, a line of three dozen stretching
into the parking lot by 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Though the breakfast was a New Year's celebration, it also
seemed a celebration of small-town warmth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes it back to the way it should be _ you don't find
communities like this any more,'' said Bill Halligan as he dished
out a casserole concoction that he had decided to tell diners was
``cheese sausage toast souffle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The heck with the football games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast was the idea of two Lubec friends, Alan Mead and
Herb Phillips. ``We decided we'd do a breakfast,'' Mead said, ``and
I said, `Let's make it free so everyone will come.' And look at the
line we've got!''
</P>
<P>
   Inserted Halligan, ``He's always doing something nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The kettle-drum-sized pan of hash that Mead was stirring seemed
to keep changing back and forth between home fries and hash,
depending on what ingredients came his way. What would happen, he
was asked, if the food, some donated and some paid for by
contributors, ran out?
</P>
<P>
   ``Both grocery stores in town are open today,'' he said, ``so
we'll have something.''
</P>
<P>
   That small-town flavor cheered visitors like Andy Solomon and
Shirley Fan, who came from Astoria, Queens, for the celebration. As
the sun rose, Solomon said, ``I was just thinking how incredibly
nice everybody is here.''

   NEW YORK _ A stockpile of $750,000 worth of spare parts set
aside for Year 2000 fixes remained in a storeroom Saturday in New
York City's computer center in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The only power failure associated with the transition to 2000
came when a foil balloon in Queens rose and struck some wires,
blacking out 100 customers, utility officials said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said it was too early to say that no computer
repairs would be needed, with systems of lesser importance
scheduled to kick on in the days ahead. But they emphasized that
globally, it was increasingly evident that something remarkable had
been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible to attack the problem partly because of the
nature of the Year 2000 glitch, a fairly fundamental failure of
systems to distinguish between certain dates, said Joseph J. Lhota,
the deputy mayor for operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew that the vast majority of your computer systems would
not work because of a very simple thing,'' Lhota said. ``It was a
definable problem, and we had a time frame for dealing with that
problem.''

 &HT;    Olympic scandal could end federal funds
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Already threatening to cut off American corporate
dollars that bankroll the Olympics, critics in Congress now are
concerned about the increasing amount of federal funds going to
prepare U.S. cities to host the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to spend $1.4 billion on the 2002 Salt Lake
City Winter Games, more than twice the $605 million spent on the
much larger Atlanta Olympics in 1996, congressional investigators
reported recently. Only $75 million in federal funds went to Los
Angeles for the 1984 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``These funds are spent whether the Games have been won by
legitimate efforts or the questionable practices of payoffs and
special favors that have already been amply documented,'' said Rep.
John Dingell (D-Mich.).
</P>
<P>
   Dingell and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) requested the report from
the General Accounting Office, the congressional auditors. The
senators questioned whether the government should spend so much to
support the upcoming Salt Lake City Olympics, which has been marred
by a vote-buying scandal.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has held two Olympic hearings in the Senate, one on the
controversial bid city selection process and the other on doping.
He plans a third early this year to review the reforms established
by the International Olympic Committee last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly a total lack of control and accountability,''
McCain said. ``Until this report, no one had a clue how much money
was being spent and on what.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, until the GAO study, there never had been a
comprehensive accounting of federal tax dollars spent on Olympic
Games held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found 24 government organizations helped underwrite the
1996 Atlanta Games. An estimated $184 million was used for direct
support of the planning and staging of the Games, including about
$92 million for security and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Another $421 million was spent for infrastructure improvements
to the city, such as public housing, transit, highway and other
capital projects. Most of that money would have eventually been
provided to the city, but the spending was accelerated to meet the
Olympic deadline, according to state and federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   However, some of the funds, such as $17 million spent on Olympic
buses and $22 million on the Olympic whitewater venue in
Copperhill, Tenn., would never have left the federal bank had it
not been necessary to get Atlanta ready for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest-spending departments:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Department of Transportation was the city's biggest
benefactor, pouring some $394 million into accelerated roads,
bridges and transit projects, according to the GAO study.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Justice department anted up $23 million for security and
safety, including 1,200 agents and staff of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, 150 U.S. marshals, 130 Immigration and
Naturalization Service staff to assist processing international
visitors and a $4 million grant to pay Atlanta police overtime.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Department of Defense spent $39 million on everything from
security to construction of the Savannah River Walk near the
Olympic yachting venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these federal expenditures may well be necessary, but
there may also be a fair amount of goldplating,'' said Dingell, the
ranking Democrat on the House Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch testified before the
Commerce committee's oversight and investigations subcommittee last
month about the reforms his organization adopted to avoid a repeat
of the vote-buying scandal that rocked the Olympic movement last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Those reforms included the establishment of a new ethics
commission, a ban on IOC visits to bid cities, the addition of 15
athletes to the IOC and new rules on age limits and terms of
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the most important IOC reform _ the
establishment of an independent ethics commission _ is an
incomplete work in progress lacking in specifics,'' Dingell said.
``Until ethics rules and procedures are in place, I cannot say that
the IOC is reformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Congressional interest in the Olympics has not waned
since the multimillion-dollar influence-peddling scheme tied to the
awarding of the Salt Lake City Games was made public in December
1998. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House subcommittee,
said he wants quarterly reports from the IOC on the ethics
commission's progress. He said he, too, may hold another hearing
next year if he doesn't think the panel is serious about routing
out wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Howard Baker is a member of the commission, which he
says will be responsible for investigating any future allegations
of improprieties by IOC members. He testified that the commission
is still ``a work in progress,'' but said he was optimistic that
the IOC was serious about preventing future scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his assurances weren't enough to call off critics on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax dollars are going to host cities at the expense of other
programs,'' McCain said. ``How many important public safety
projects and other programs in other cities and states were
postponed or canceled so that these cities could put on an
Olympics?''
</P>
<P>
   Of the $605 million spent on Atlanta, less than 20 percent, or
only $104 million had been specifically appropriated for an Olympic
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hefty tab for the Atlanta Games, the lawmakers were
even more concerned about the anticipated $1.4 billion bill related
to the Salt Lake City Games.
</P>
<P>
   About $1.1 billion will be spent for transportation projects
such as highways and a commuter railway that probably would have
been built anyway, the report said. Another $272 million will be
spent solely for the planning or operation of the 2002 Games,
including about $200 million by the FBI and other agencies for
safety and security.
</P>
<P>
   The Winter Olympics are much smaller, and traditionally less
expensive. But as the report showed, the federal government is
sinking still more money into staging the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a city wins the Games, it is effectively obligating the
federal taxpayer to underwrite a wide range of activities, from
infrastructure and transportation projects to security,'' Dingell
said. ``But until this point, there has been no central accounting
for federal spending on the Olympics, and there has been no
conscious decision by the taxpayers or their representatives to
spend the money on the Games. This needs to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Some eight U.S. cities have begun work on bids for the 2012
Games.

&HT;     STILL FEW Y2K GLITCHES REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;    (Eds: FIXES headline word REPORTED)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the world glided smoothly into the new century,
the United States reported Saturday only a smattering of minor Y2K
glitches, but officials cautioned that problems could still crop
up, especially starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, chief of the White House's Y2K command center,
said Monday will be a crucial milestone because it will be the
first day of normal business operations following the long holiday
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he offered generally upbeat news about the nation's
progress. ``We have not been able to find anything of great
significance to report,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the nation's major sectors from airlines to electric
power grids to telecommunications continued working without
incident on the first day of the new century, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon reported Saturday that a satellite intelligence
defense system had failed shortly after 7 p.m. EST Friday when the
clock in that system turned past midnight Greenwich Mean Time.
</P>
<P>
   John Hamre, Deputy Defense Secretary, said that a backup system
is currently in place and that the problem is with a computer on
the ground and not in the satellite itself.
</P>
<P>
   Other reported Y2K glitches, however, were quickly fixed.
Koskinen said an Amtrak computer system used to track trains
automatically went down temporarily early Saturday but that train
officials switched to a manual system and then fixed the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Computers at five nuclear plants across the country also
experienced temporary problems, but Koskinen said they were
immediately fixed and those plants' operations were not affected.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Naval Observatory, which has a master clock in
Washington that serves as the nation's official source of time,
reported the date as Jan. 1, 19100 during the earliest hours of the
new year on its Internet site. The glitch has since been corrected
and was only on that Web site. It was not a problem in the master
clock, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said federal government agencies and private industry would
continue testing their systems and report any glitches, whether
Y2K-related or not. He said checks of federal government buildings
showed temporary problems with alarm systems at U.S. facilities in
Boston, Kansas City and Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Aviation Administration system used to notify pilots
about such things as weather via e-mail shut down Saturday, but
Koskinen said it was unclear whether the problem was Y2K-related. A
backup pilot notification system was put in place, and air traffic
safety was not affected, he added.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, the Social Security Administration,
headquartered in Baltimore, switched to backup generators before
the millenium rollover. The agency switched its systems back to
Baltimore's main power grid at 6 a.m. EST Saturday without
incident. Koskinen said all of Social Security's computers in
Baltimore and at its field offices across the country are working
normally.
</P>
<P>
   Some other federal agencies, also as a precaution, temporarily
shut down their Internet Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Koskinen and other top government officials
gave upbeat reports for the second day in a row as the new year
swept across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, countries such as China, Russia and Ukraine, which
preceded the United States into the new year, rolled into Jan. 1
without problems in their nuclear power plants and other key
systems that American officials had feared might shut down as a
result of a Y2K computer glitch. More significantly, those systems
continued operating in those countries on their second day of the
New Year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reported Y2K problem overseas occurred when Japan's
Shika Nuclear Power Station about 170 miles northwest of Tokyo lost
its radiation alarm system shortly after midnight there. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson described it as a backup system and said
it did not affect plant safety.
</P>
<P>
   The United States passed its first Y2K tests at 7 p.m. EST
Friday, when computers that control airline traffic, about a third
of the nation's power grid and military operations appeared to roll
over into the new year without incident. The
</P>
<P>
   computers are based on Greenwich Mean Time, which is five hours
ahead of the Eastern Standard Time zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's airspace system is up and running safely,''
Federal Aviation Administration chief Jane Garvey said Friday
night. She flew on a jet from Washington, D.C., to Dallas when air
traffic computers passed midnight GMT.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, who had predicted an easy transition into the new
year, said the fact that it happened should not lead to anyone to
``underestimate the nature of the problem that was originally
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the effort not been made, had the money not been spent, we
would be in a very different situation than we find ourselves in
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department estimates that some $100 billion was
spent in the United States over the past five years to fix the Y2K
problem _ which would occur if computers interpreted the digits 00
as 1900 rather than 2000. Worldwide is it estimated that
governments and private industry spent close to $400 billion fixing
</P>
<P>
   their computers.

   ST. CROIX, U.S. Virgin Islands _ The windswept eastern tip of
this Caribbean gem is about as far as you can get from the
stress-filled world of cell phones, screaming fax machines and
rush-hour traffic that marks the lives of so many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Which made St. Croix the perfect setting for a low-key,
island-paced millennium celebration.
</P>
<P>
   There were no crystal-tipped balls dropping from above, no
roaring crowds jammed beneath a towering city skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was the wide open vista of one of the Caribbean's
most magnificent settings: a rock-studded beach, a sweeping
hillside, a sky filled with a million stars. Fireworks lit the
Christiansted harbor, arching over the masts of sailboats moored to
buoys.
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix promoted its location as the easternmost point of U.S.
territory in this hemisphere, hoping to draw a big millennium crowd
that would boost business damaged by late-season Hurricane Lenny,
which lightly brushed the island in November.
</P>
<P>
   Most hotels reported full houses, and dozens of bars and
restaurants sponsored New Years' bashes featuring everything from
reggae to steel drum versions of Auld Lang Syne.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of the celebration was pure Caribbean _ laid-back,
friendly, almost impromptu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Island people love to party,'' said Bernice Dixon, a St. Croix
resident.
</P>
<P>
   At parties around the island, residents and visitors alike
rocked well past midnight in the balmy weather, all thoughts of the
Y2K bug banished by the calypso beat. Kids screamed at the
fireworks, while islanders blowing hollowed-out conch shells added
to the din.
</P>
<P>
   Elford Williams, a retired St. Croix resident with 14 children
and 22 grandchildren, summed up the thoughts of many.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a lot to a lot of people,'' he said. ``It's the
turning of time and history. I thank God I lived to see this. It's
a real milestone.''

RAVE REVIEWS FOR 2000 AFTER AN ANXIOUSLY ANTICIPATED OPENING
NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By N.R. KLEINFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the bleary afterglow of the pulsating mass party
in Times Square, New Yorkers awoke Saturday to a city that in the
first hours of the year 2000 looked and acted pretty much the way
it did in 1999. Things worked. The terrorists stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Vitti, a maintenance worker who had to report to his job
at Manhattan Plaza at 6 a.m. and thus slept as the 1990s expired,
got up and welcomed the 2000s by testing an electrical outlet in
his Bronx apartment. Sure enough, it worked. He flicked on the
radio. No blackouts. No bombs. Just another workday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was fine, so I hopped on the subway,'' he said,
noting that it too clacked down the tracks just the way it did all
through the 1990s. ``It has turned out to be a normal Saturday
morning, more or less.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a hyperbolic night when so many fidgety people
did their cork popping in their own homes, New York stepped into
the new year a little sleepier, a little messier, but with any
throbbing headaches relieved considerably by the excess of
normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   Times Square itself, immobilized for a day by celebrators and
cheer, looked untidy but intact. Police estimates of the turnout of
possibly 2 million people for the elongated extravaganza was
quadruple the conventional New Year's Eve crush. And yet the
merrymaking, watched carefully by unprecedented might from the
city's police force, proceeded with exceptional bonhomie and
minimal reports of misconduct. The lights still shone and no
terrorists intruded on the gaiety.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, under dank skies, a new morning shift of people
who couldn't let go of their celebratory urges continued to wander
into the party scene. Steve Delladonna, 26, of Mamaroneck, and Tara
Berrigan, 25, of Niagra Falls, got to Times Square around 4:30 p.m.
Friday, and there was already no room. Unable to edge close enough
to see anything worthwhile, they retreated to their hotel at 7:30
and settled for watching the ball drop on television. At 8 Saturday
morning, they finally got to really see Times Square. ``I've never
seen so much garbage in my whole life,'' Ms. Berrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   In an early morning display of self-congratulation at the city's
crisis center, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani heaped praise on New York for
being, in effect, very un-New York _ cheerful, well-behaved,
polite. Summing up the celebration, the mayor said everyone ``did
it happily, they did it with a great deal of enthusiasm and
optimism, but they did it in a way in which they didn't do any harm
to each other, any harm to property.''
</P>

<P>
   Was he describing New York or Sioux Falls?
</P>
<P>
   The police reported only 14 arrests during the 26-hour Times
Square marathon, mostly for disorderly conduct and other minor
infractions. The authorities received an uncommonly steep 48 bomb
threats, including one targeting the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge,
though the mayor said all of them proved to be bogus. On a typical
day, the city gets about 16 bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
   The magical moment arrived after a seemingly unending succession
of highly choreographed festivities that began at 6 a.m. Friday and
marked the hourly expiration of 1999 across the globe with puppets,
costumed dancers and carnival performers.
</P>
<P>
   One minute before midnight, Dr. Mary Ann Hopkins, a surgeon
being honored for her work in war-ravaged countries as a volunteer
with Doctors Without Borders, pushed the button that sent a
half-ton Waterford crystal ball sliding down a flagpole atop One
Times Square. The specially composed ``Anthem for the Millennium''
blasted from the array of speakers lining a dozen square blocks.
</P>
<P>
   As the illuminated globe touched down, that poignant numeral,
``2000,'' beckoned luminously. Fireworks exploded in the chilly sky
and three tons of confetti coated the crowd. Thousands of balloons
swirled lazily into space. An exultant roar of uncontained joy
erupted from the crowd that could be heard in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   Some 8,000 police officers were assigned to the blocks
encircling Times Square, about double the normal allotment, and
virtually every member of the police force was on duty somewhere,
some of them equipped with anthrax antidote kits in the event of a
biological attack. A mile-long, three-block wide patch of Midtown
was closed to traffic. Cars were searched, manhole covers welded
shut, trash receptacles whisked into storage.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The most serious arrest was of a man from Saginaw, Mich.
Identified as George James, 29, he was discovered by police
officers in a parking garage on West 53rd Street walking around
with handcuffs. The officers had stepped into the garage to use the
bathroom. When they searched James' heavily lived-in van, they
found a raft of pornographic magazines and a loaded shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   James, who works as a repair truck dispatcher for a cable
television company, was charged with several counts of illegal
possession of a weapon. The police said he told them that the
shotgun was for his own defense, and they said there was no
evidence that he intended to use it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is always an untidy side to New Year's Eve _ the drunken
driving incidents, the barroom brawls _ and while this one was not
spared from such blemishes, neither was it inordinately marred by
them. Hospital emergency rooms in the city reported that activity
was generally quieter than normal. In New Jersey, fog and iced-over
roads did cause a spate of traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In Times Square, after the $7 million extravaganza finally
lapsed at 8 a.m. and the last red-eyed stragglers limped on their
way, sanitation crews driving their mechanical brooms whirred down
the avenues to scoop up innumerable flattened party hats and
noisemakers. By late morning, the city Sanitation Department
estimated that it had collected 34 tons of garbage, up from 21 tons
last year, and the cleanup was still going on. All of 103 workers
and 12 supervisors tackled the job, which was handled by 57 workers
and eight supervisors the year before.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, affability reigned throughout the region. The
first breath of new life was believed to have been taken at Sisters
of Charity Medical Center. Rebekah Yi was born at one second after
midnight, weighing 6 pounds 13 ounces. The parents, Yunmi Yi and
Chan Yi, are from Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of parties, large and small, persisted hours into the
beginning of 2000. Some paid major money to clink champagne glasses
and embrace, and some none at all.
</P>
<P>
   A thunderous party at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn attracted
about 20,000 people who danced in the streets and watched their own
laser show and fireworks display. Some of the revelers, though,
were disappointed by pre-party suggestions that it would rival
Times Square in turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Field, the chairman of Interscope Communications and notable
for his trendier than trendy New Year's Eve bashes, resurrected the
infamous Studio 54 discotheque for a glittery party of 2,000 of his
dearest friends, most of them too young to remember when Studio 54
was Studio 54 rather than a cabaret theater. At midnight, champagne
flowed from the rafters as women adorned in silver bikini bottoms
and go-go boots gyrated to the beat of Prince's ``1999'' beneath a
12-foot disco ball.
</P>
<P>
   A goodly number of city restaurants closed for the special
evening, springing their employees and owners for private
celebrations or personal seclusion. Others charged steep prices to
eat _ $1,000 at Le Cirque and $2,000 at Windows on the World.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the stores and restaurants enveloping Times Square
closed because of the congestion and police barricades. The Stage
Deli, 10 blocks from the ball drop, closed for the first time in 62
years.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, though, the region's citizens began the 2000s
with a pinch-me-it's-OK feel. Once they checked that no bomb had
exploded, they turned to whether the little things still worked _
the cell phone, the electricity, the precious cable TV. Was there
still hot water? Could you get gas for the car and a can of dog
food? Was the E train running?

SPORTS COLUMN: HELPING HANDS FROM SOME OTHER SIDELINE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here we are, in the year 2000, and Don Casey is the coach of a
red-hot team named the New Jersey Nets. Corporate synergy triumphs
again.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that Casey's team is 10-3 since his new
organizational ally Joe Torre motored over the George Washington
Bridge to spread Yankees stardust over the then-bedraggled, 2-15
Nets? Suddenly, tantalizingly, the Nets are no longer stringing
together defeats, like an order of Spaghetti Calipari.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury turned into Derek Jeter. Keith Van Horn morphed
into Bernie Williams. The Nets have been sharing, bonding, winning.
And this all apparently began when they waited an hour after
practice one afternoon for a late-arriving Torre, a development
Casey took as a sign that his players were desperate enough to
listen to someone.
</P>
<P>
   Torre came with tales of accountability, of persistence, of
stretching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he was lenient with rules but that he wanted guys
out on the field, doing exercises together, but, most of all, not
thinking about their own statistics,'' Casey said after the Nets
won their franchise record ninth straight at home on Thursday over
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   In case none of this sunk in, Torre took the 62-year-old Casey
aside and told him: ``Remember one thing. Your health comes
first.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Torre himself experienced the best and worst of times,
winning his third World Series in four seasons as the Yankees'
manager, while undergoing treatment for prostate cancer detected
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   All around the metropolitan area, it was a strange and in many
ways torturous year for managers and coaches. In the face of a
win-now frenzy, under attack from outside their organizations and
within, they needed a break. They needed support. They needed each
other.
</P>
<P>
   So Bobby Valentine graciously took it upon himself to drop in on
Jim Fassel on the day Fassel most likely saved his job as coach of
the Giants. Fassel's team had been spinning out of control and
playoff contention. His offense was a mess. His defense was in
chaos. Earlier that week, Michael Strahan had picked a fine time to
criticize Fassel's leadership, while the coach was home in
California, burying his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Enter, Bobby V., spiritual healer, beacon of logic.
</P>
<P>
   In a pregame primer, Valentine told Fassel that at least he
still had his own hand-picked staff. Valentine had to rally the
Mets into the playoffs, save himself, with one eye on the field and
the other on coaches who were forced on him after front-office
meddlers fired his most trusted aides. Valentine survived a
gut-wrenching, late-season slide and had the last laugh, or until
Kenny Rogers sent him home from Atlanta for a postseason cry.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired to better use his assistants while they were still
around to assist, Fassel handed off play-calling chores to Sean
Payton, his first-year quarterback coach. The Giants proceeded to
slaughter Bill Parcells' Jets, the game Fassel had to win. He
salvaged mediocrity from what would have been calamity. With modest
success and some timely luck, by Sunday evening he could still be
smiling his way into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Madison Square Garden, Jeff Van Gundy has reportedly
been asked by superiors to begin exercising his atrophying facial
muscles. For part of 1999, it was not easy being Van Gundy,
typically stuck between a Checketts and a Grunfeld, a Ewing and a
Sprewell. After outlasting his adversary, General Manager Ernie
Grunfeld, Van Gundy saw his job teeter on a Miami rim during the
playoffs. The Knicks went all the way to the championship series.
The Garden president, Dave Checketts, reluctantly gave up his Phil
Jackson fixation and handed Van Gundy a lucrative contract
extension. Why is this man frowning?
</P>
<P>
   Even Parcells, who thought he was going to the Super Bowl until
Vinny Testaverde limped out of this season, laughs off critics who
claim he was unprepared with a seasoned backup. As soon as the
expected purchase of the Jets by the Knicks owner Charles Dolan is
complete, Parcells could well be dispatched to the Garden to teach
his company mate Van Gundy new tricks: how to make players and
reporters heel and roll over.
</P>
<P>
   With all these teams living under one corporate roof, maybe
Parcells will usher in an age of cross-fertilization, take his shot
at the Rangers or the Knicks. He probably thinks he's a better
hockey coach than John Muckler. Poor Muckler. He's been fired in
the newspapers more than Casey. Does anyone remember _ does anyone
even know _ that this man coached Edmonton to the Stanley Cup?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. The travails of a hockey coach barely register on the
scale of human suffering. The MetroStars relieved their coach, Bora
Milutinovic, but that was probably a favor. The Nets relieved John
Calipari last March, but that was because he drove everyone crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari's 3-17 start was the perfect excuse. Casey, a likable
lifer from South Jersey, at 2-15 had the support of the Nets'
Jersey-bred owners, and George Steinbrenner, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're losing like that, you don't want to go out for
dinner, you don't want to go out at all,'' Casey said. ``We're not
out of the woods yet, and we've got to go win on the road. But
right now, the darkness of Armageddon seems to be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the world, Casey made it across the bridge to the 21st
century. He's happy to still be home, in New Jersey.  &QL;

 &HT;    DAY 1 IN HOLY LAND SEES FEW PROBLEMS OR POLICE
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ New Year's Day 2000 held good news and bad news for
the Holy Land. The evening before had passed with few technological
glitches or security threats, but there was no apparent arrival of
the Messiah, either.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Israel nor the Palestinian-controlled areas reported any
problems with basic services on Saturday. While air traffic had
been called off overnight, the first flight left Israel's Ben
Gurion International Airport for Zurich without incident Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Most businesses were closed. Banks, as a precaution, were not
scheduled to open until Monday, a day later than usual. But many
Palestinians, who follow a Muslim work week, were back on the job
without major problems. Israelis begin their week Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On the spiritual front, a small minority of believers sees the
start of 2000 as kicking off the process of Christ's return.
</P>
<P>
   Though most do not set a specific date, the New Testament states
that he will return on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem and walk
through the sealed Golden Gate into the walled Old City quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mount of Olives was unchanged Saturday _ a dusty
Palestinian neighborhood where taxis and tour busses jam up traffic
on the pocked roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the anti-climax,'' said Palestinian Ibrahim Dawud,
owner of the Mount of Olives Hotel. ``We're reverting back into
insignificance.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel is adjacent to the Chapel of the Ascension, where
Christ is believed to have ascended to heaven and is expected to
return. With 60 rooms, the hotel had several pilgrims and dozens of
media guests the night before but was nearly empty Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer an anti-climax to an anti-Christ,'' joked Dawud,
referring to the villain many of his guests believe will play out
the end of the world in a duel with God.
</P>
<P>
   Most believers in Christ's return do not try to put a specific
date on his arrival. Only two people _ one on the Mount of Olives
and one near the Golden Gate _ were detained by Israeli police
Friday night for religiously-inspired rantings. Authorities had
feared suicides or attacks on the Temple Mount area behind the
Golden Gate, but there were none.
</P>
<P>
   There were clearly fewer police than their record numbers of the
night before, though paramilitary units were still stationed on the
mount and an Israeli soldier could be seen reclining on the wall
above the Golden Gate.
</P>
<P>
   Two digital cameras still transmitted continuous views of the
two sites to the Internet Web site known as MessiahCAM at
www.olivetree.org. The founders of the site, Peter and Christine
Darg of Virginia, see the year 2000 as a time to focus on
spirituality _ not the literal date of Christ's return.
</P>
<P>
   There were minor Y2K-related glitches in Palestinian-controlled
Bethlehem, the place of Christ's birth at the center of the
millennium anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The large countdown-clock towering over Manger Square, a
donation from the city of Athens, Greece, appeared to break down at
midnight on New Year's Eve. Saturday it was clicking the minutes
off like seconds. And, many of the 2,000 doves released at 12:01
a.m. Saturday were panicked by simultaneous fireworks. Loose
feathers were scattered along the stones of the square.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bethlehem post office was running without problems and
tourists were pleased with the smooth first day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the place to be. It brings our faith to life,'' said
Sue Reimer, 65, a teacher from Beaumont, Texas. As she left the
Church of the Nativity she summed up the night: ``So many newsmen,
so little news.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not until after the Players' Riot of 2019, in which
hundreds of fans were injured and two died, that America began to
take seriously the possibility that sports was no national campfire
but rather a dangerously out-of-control brush fire that could
consume the entire country. The president's hastily assembled
Rocker Commission summed up the situation in this plaintive
statement: ``Twenty years ago, a grown man in a New York Rangers
jersey would be an object of mild amusement. Ten years ago, he
would be questioned by mental health authorities. Today, he would
be detained by the police as a potential terrorist. How has this
happened?''
</P>
<P>
   How indeed has the relationship between athlete and fan become
one of such mutual rage that the Plexiglas walls of hockey arenas
have been extended to completely enclose the rinks. Basketball
games are once again played inside metal cages. Because the armed
guards at major baseball and football games were mostly retired
players, they refused to open fire when the athletes finally
stormed the stands. They watched the carnage with detachment, if
not some delight.
</P>
<P>
   Why did love turn into hate?
</P>
<P>
   The commission's anthology of learned answers was predictable
and unsatisfying: social, economic and physical disparities, it
maintained, had created such a psychological gulf that ``player
regarded fan as `the other' and fan objectified the player as a
cartoon figure, thus removing any common ground of humanity and
empathy.''
</P>
<P>
   As the commission chairman, professor John Rocker, a
distinguished historian and psycho-analyst, pointed out: ``From my
own experience as a young player, I can understand how ignorance
and fear, inflamed by media stereotypes, can lead to the breakdown
of society. Frankly, it was just a matter of time. Look at
history.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Players' Riot (the Players' Association preferred to
call it the Players' Defense) occurred 100 years after the 20th
century's sports nadir _ the 1919 Black Sox scandal _ and 50 years
after its zenith _ the year in which the Jets and the Mets won
championships and the Knicks began their great title run _ was
proof to some that it was merely the dip of a cycle. In time,
sports would swing back into the national affection.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission, calling the Riot a watershed event from
which sports might never fully recover, cited a series of smaller
events that had led up to it:
</P>
<P>
   _ By the turn of the century, the amoral, outrageous,
thrill-driven sensibility of professional wrestling had pushed
other sports to turn up their heat. Purists were most concerned
about Major League Baseball's secret quota of one bench-clearing
fight per team per month, with pacifists fined.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extreme sports, a short-lived pastime for increasingly
short-lived people, was eventually banned; the ABC show ``Snuff
Sport,'' in which it was alleged that ambulance crews were
purposely given misdirections, is still defending lawsuits. But
harpoon fights between teams in war canoes and dogfights between
World War I fighter plane replicas created a climate in which
recreational athletes became ashamed to play noncontact sports like
golf, tennis and softball. Thus, spectatorship rose dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   _ Those who continued to want to compete in some way turned to
Virtual Games (known also as Zelig Games) in which hologram
representations were inserted into classic and later live events.
Eventually, a generation raised with advanced video skills was able
to win in mock contests with real athletes, often by cheating.
</P>
<P>
   _ As traditional male sports continued to be devalued, women
sports ascended. Women's tennis, soccer and volleyball eclipsed the
men's games, while it became necessary in men's minor-league
baseball, football and basketball to require a certain number of
female athletes per team to assure attendance. There was great
controversy over the possibility of such requirements in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cablevision's computerized ``call-the-shot meters,'' enabling
fans to vote on such coaching decisions as run-pass or
substitutions in specified games, was a sensation for several
seasons, especially after bad decisions were purposely sent in by
gamblers. But then Fox Interactive introduced betting on individual
plays, and fans voted with their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   _ With ballparks and arenas no more than stage sets (ESPN's
attempt to use digitized crowds was blocked by the actors' guilds),
the so-called moderate, or cultural, fans, once seen occasionally
at major events, disappeared. There were only the corporate fans in
the luxury sky boxes and the hard-core fans in the hard seats.
</P>
<P>
   It was the mounting tension between the hard-cores and the
players while the sky boxers egged them all on, according to the
Rocker Commission, that set the scene for the Riot.
</P>
<P>
   The game in which it occured, between the Gainesville Dells and
the South Bend Compaqs of the Microsoft League, was the renewal of
a traditionally violent rivalry. The two cities were still reeling
over the demise of Division I college football, set in motion by a
minor scandal at Notre Dame in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL had easily established minor league teams, administered
by former college athletic departments, but they were seen as
mercenary gangs who didn't even pretend to read or write.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Leaguers, a volatile mix of high school stars and NFL
has-beens, played a particularly brutal game while their fans
frequently fought in the stands. They were urged on by skyboxers
who floated flaming dollar bills down among the hoi polloi.
</P>
<P>
   On this Thursday night, despite dogs, sky-cams, metal detectors
and random frisks, a fan smuggled a folding plastic cross-bow into
the stadium. Late in a close game, an arrow hit a 400-pound lineman
in the buttock. When he eventually noticed, he became enraged and
led both teams over the moat, past the guards, through the
electrified fence and into the stands. Apparently assuming that it
would become another Dells versus Compaqs free-for-all, fans stood
up to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the players were loyal to each other, not to
uniforms. It was athletes vs. fans, and with few exceptions, it was
no contest. The massacre ended because the players, exhausted from
the game, ran out of steam and allowed those fans still standing to
run away.
</P>
<P>
   The guards regrouped and raced up to protect the sky-box level,
which was spared. This is probably why few athletes were charged
with felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, professor Rocker had tears in his eyes when he
announced the findings of his commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become two Americas, jock and fan,'' he said. ``Two
peoples who need each other desperately have somehow been divided.
I would fear for the future of the nation, if I didn't see a
positive in all this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both groups, jock and fan, are remarkably similar, filled with
immigrants who don't speak good English, gays, ex-cons, and even
some 20-year-old single moms. Remembering my own misguided, yet
somehow prophetic, remarks of the last century, I am filled with
hope that we finally have something here to build on.''

A COUNTDOWN TO REMEMBER, OR A BIG YAWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Changes name in last paragraph from Walker to Woodyard.) 
(jw) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before the countdown, the cork popping, the confetti
and the computer worries _ indeed, long before most people had
personal computers _ there was the anticipation. And no one did
more anticipating than Edward Woodyard, who spent 16 percent of the
1900s anticipating the arrival of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Woodyard, a screenwriter from Armonk, had spent so much time
ruminating on 2000 because he made his reservations for New Year's
Eve 1999 in 1983, when the hotel in Times Square where he finally
did his celebrating on Friday night was a half-finished skeleton of
steel and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided if other people were thinking like I was, I'd better
get my reservations in because when the time comes, it was going to
be a mob scene,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mob scene, of course, but Woodyard was above it,
looking down on Times Square from the 44th floor of the Marriott
Marquis. It seemed the perfect place to consider the question: Did
the arrival of 2000 live up to its billing?
</P>
<P>
   People probably will be arguing about the answer for the next
thousand years. (Or at least a thousand hours, which turns out to
be almost 42 days.)
</P>
<P>
   Woodyard's answer was affirmative but a bit inarticulate; after
a lot of partying, even screenwriters find themselves fumbling for
nouns and adjectives, as well as hoarse from shouting ``10, 9, 8,
7'' and so on. But yes, he said, 2000 was worth the wait. ``I was
almost speechless. I don't have words for it.'' He tried four:
``Spectacular. Phenomenal. Overpowering. Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pity the poor millennium, it never had a chance to get off the
ground,'' said Mark Mitten, who registered the word ``billennium''
as a trademark because, he said, 2000 was the beginning of the
second millennium. Mitten also has a trademark on something called
the ``millennium hype-o-meter'' on his Web site,
www.millenniumhell.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overburdened by Y2K fears, over-the-top parties and marketing
hype, it seemed to have lost any of the potential it had to be a
noble occasion, worthy of waiting a thousand years for,'' said
Mitten. ``With all the overkill, it was hard to know if it had any
significance at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the arrival of 2000 brought a kind of philosophical
seesawing. There were those who thought it was the greatest thing
in the last thousand years, or at least in the last four. Waterford
crystal, which made the ball that slid down the pole on 1 Times
Square at midnight, credited it with a 30 percent increase in sales
last year, double the company's annual growth rate since 1996.
Waterford, in fact, sold out of seven millennium-related keepsakes
that cost $59 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup included warnings that there would be no corks to
pop: that there would be a champagne shortage. But late last week
stores were cutting prices they had raised back when they thought
they would be at a different point on the supply-and-demand curve.
Korbel Champagne did run out, but still considered 2000 a
manufacturer's dream: It had nothing left to sell by the time it
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But were people hyped out? Not Jeffrey Katz, an owner of 1 Times
Square. ``It was a thrill,'' he said. ``The confetti was so
voluminous you felt like you could step off the building and walk
right through it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side were those who sounded disappointed that 2000
had crept in so uneventfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overhyped, definitely,'' said Alan Gross, who lives in
Brooklyn and spent New Year's Eve at home. ``I was hoping my
computer wouldn't work because I'd have an excuse to buy a new
one.'' He booted up shortly after midnight and was disappointed by
the lack of drama.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the issue of whether the arrival of 2000 was
overpromoted was one of those larger questions: Was the Champagne
glass half full or half empty? ``We didn't hype this,'' said Peter
Coleman, a vice president of the Times Square Business Improvement
District. ``We were trying to fulfill people's dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   And Woodyard certainly seemed close to fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the millennium doesn't start till 2001, Arthur C.
Clarke and all that, but the party is when all those zeroes turn
over,'' he said. ``The only place to be in the world is Times
Square.''

<P>
   Lucy Bossert, a spokeswoman for the hotel, said that its
cylindrical core was about half finished when Woodyard called in
1983. Marriott offered Woodyard a suite with two adjoining bedrooms
free. (The hotel did not rent other suites for New Year's Eve; it
charged $2,000 for a four-night package for regular rooms.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation remembers where we were when Kennedy was
assassinated and our parents remember V-E Day, when that
happened,'' Woodyard said. ``This was one of those things: where
were you at the beginning of the millennium, when all those zeroes
turned over. I remember what fun I had as a kid, and I think this
was 50 times that.''

 &HT;    RUSSIA-CHEHNYA (Alkhan-Yurt, Chechnya) _ For the first three
months of their military campaign, Russia made short work of the
militants. Russian forces raced through the northern plains of
Chechnya before seizing the lowlands to the south. Grozny, however,
is different. The sprawling city has turned out to be, once again,
a deadly killing zone.

FINE TIMING BY YELTSIN GAVE RUSSIA A BREATHER 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By ALISON SMALE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As always, Boris Yeltsin picked his moment.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing to resign on the last day of the old year, Yeltsin
guaranteed that almost all Russians would be deeply engaged in
celebrating the arrival of the new one, traditionally the day of
the biggest family feast here. Better than that, he acted at a time
of enormous political flux: the start of a protracted break in the
political year, and just 12 days after the election of a new
Parliament, where rival blocs have yet to solidify.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of acting in this political void is that Yeltsin
avoided the usual flurry of public discussion and political
sparring that would normally follow such a sensation. His
successor, Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, was able to dominate such
news programs as there were by making his trip to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Daily newspapers will not appear here for at least another four
days, because of the holidays. Television stations are mostly
running favorite old Soviet movies, New Year's entertainment
programs or concerts. Financial markets are closed. Many of
Yeltsin's political rivals are out of town or abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have not been heard from since Yeltsin's announcement
that he was stepping down include Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the
liberal Yabloko party, and Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime
minister whose political bloc fared relatively poorly against the
supporters of Putin and other Yeltsin allies in last month's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Even when political life does shift into something resembling
second gear at midweek, many politicians and businessmen will still
be out of town. There is, after all, Orthodox Christmas to
celebrate on Jan. 7, not to mention, six days later, Old New Year,
as it is affectionately known in deference to the calendar that
operated before the 1917 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to feast days and weekends, many Russians will not work
until Jan. 14. Moscow's streets, jammed with traffic in the pre-New
Year's shopping rush, are deserted. One of the two main business
dailies, Kommersant, will not even appear until mid-January.
Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a widely read daily newspaper, will not
publish until Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   All this means that Yeltsin's sudden and unchallenged transfer
of power to Putin will go mostly undiscussed in the usual political
forums for the bulk of the next two weeks. And Russians are free
meanwhile to indulge in their most beloved pastimes: gathering
around tables and discussing life, raising toasts and
philosophizing, walking through the tender winter air, dusted with
snowflakes, reveling in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Around one Moscow table Saturday night, the very suggestion of
having to discuss Yeltsin and Putin prompted several guests into
loud declamations about their distaste for all politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just been listening to a wonderful toast about how a few
troubles are an essential part of life, and that the most important
thing is our souls,'' cried Yevgeniya Melkonova, a homemaker.
``It's the first day of the year, and this isn't the day for
talking about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Yelena Strikovskaya cut in: ``Well, everybody in fact did talk
about it when it happened. It was unexpected, but we got used to it
quickly. There have already been so many resignations.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk then turned to Putin. Like many Russians, Ms.
Strikovskaya heatedly criticized Putin for saying on television
last fall that Chechen terrorists should be wiped out, and using an
extremely crude slang expression. ``I just can't even hear about
politics,'' said one guest, Olga Maslova, 38, who works at a Moscow
television station. ``I understand that it's our duty to be
interested, that it's our future, for our children, and so on. But
I simply don't believe in any of those politicians.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The view that Russian politicians are unscrupulous and corrupt
is widespread. Putin's first decree, officially exempting Yeltsin
from any future prosecution, is universally seen as an attempt by
the ex-president to protect not only himself, but his family and
close friends, several of whom amassed considerable wealth and
power during his eight years in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Around this table, the decree was taken as an unavoidable fact
of life, and one that may not guarantee Yeltsin a future above the
law. Besides, one guest noted, the first act of Gerald Ford as
president was to pardon Richard Nixon, so there was, in his eyes at
least, a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Those Russian journalists who were heard from basically
reflected the national desire to relax and forget about the daily
grind of politics for a few days. Lena Berezinskaya, writing for
the online newspaper Vesti.Ru, noted that Yeltsin rarely took
offense at journalists, simply riding above the many bad things
they wrote about him. ``But how journalists hated him for quitting
on Dec. 31'' _ either because they had nowhere to air their
opinions, or because they had to work.

 &HT;    POPE, IN NEW YEAR'S DAY MESSAGE, URGES ``PEACE IN THE NAME OF
GOD''
 &HT;    By ADAM L. FREEMAN 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY _ Pope John Paul II continued his rigorous
Christmas-time schedule Saturday by opening the Holy Door of the
Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the four major basilicas in
Rome, and blessing 4,000 marathon runners.
</P>
<P>
   They were among the crush of more than 20,000 gathered in St.
Peter's Square to celebrate New Year's Day, which is observed by
the Roman Catholic Church as World Peace Day.
</P>
<P>
   After opening the Holy Door, the visibly fatigued 79-year-old
pontiff called on those attending the solemn morning ceremony in
Santa Maria Maggiore to regard the tumultuous history of the 20th
Century as a valuable lesson for future international peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's message, I have remembered some conditions for
strengthening the path to peace on an international level. . .a
path unfortunately always threatened,'' the pope said. ``How we are
reminded of the painful events that continuously scarred the
history of the 20th Century. Because of this we must now more than
ever wish for peace in the name of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the ceremony, John Paul traveled across town
to St. Peter's Basilica where he greeted a crowd of more than
20,000 gathered in St. Peter's Square. He delivered the Papal
Angelus, or ``message at noon,'' and offered a New Year's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to the theme of peace, the pontiff told the crowd to
work toward universal reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Christ is our peace. He calls on us to love every human
being without discrimination, converting the heart and mind to
thoughts of peace, and to distance ourselves from the temptation of
violence and war,'' he declared from the window of the pontifical
apartment overlooking the square.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the crowded piazza were the 4,000 marathon
runners taking part in the Rome Millennium 2000 Marathon, coined as
``the world's first marathon of the New Millennium.'' Its starting
line was at St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul bestowed a special blessing upon the runners, telling
them ``'to take peace with them through the streets of Rome as
peace is also the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has been following a grueling schedule since marking
the start of the Grand Jubilee celebration on Christmas Eve by
opening the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica. He has since
presided over daily ceremonies.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The pattern that has brought exceptionally dry weather to most
of the nation during the last several days will become more
unsettled this week as a series of fast-moving disturbances sweep
from the Western states across the Plains toward the Great Lakes
states. Most of the East will be unseasonably mild during the early
part of the week while chillier conditions begin to envelop the
West.
</P>
<P>
   A broken band of snow and ice will fall to the north of a
low-pressure center as it moves from the central Great Lakes Sunday
morning to northern Maine early Monday. Farther south, mild breezes
from the southwest will send temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above
the seasonal average over a large area from the southern and
central Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic seaboard. Scattered
light showers will accompany the mild air from the Ohio Valley to
the interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Southeast will also be unusually warm. Sunshine will
be plentiful in southern Florida, while a mixture of sun and patchy
clouds prevails in most of the region. A band of clouds and a few
light showers will accompany a cool front as it moves toward the
lower Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will be common along west-facing slopes from the
Northwestern states to the central Rockies as brisk high-level
winds import moist air from over the Pacific. Showers will linger
in the onshore winds near the Northwest coast. The Southwest will
be mainly dry although variable clouds and snow showers will occur
in the mountains of northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Forecasts
</P>
<P>
   Advancements in weather forecasting in the years ahead will
likely be tied to the same factors that helped improve predictions
in the 20th century. During the 1900s, the advent of remote sensing
devices like satellites and radar helped to fill the gaps between
observation sites, allowing meteorologists to better define the
state of the atmosphere. These detailed observations, combined with
increasing processing power, led to steady improvements in computer
weather prediction, expanding the range of forecasting skill from
about 24 hours at mid-century to nearly a week at its end.

   ALKHAN-YURT, Russia _ When he is asked about the fighting in
Grozny, Konstantin Kukhlovets shows the red splotch on his index
finger. The 24-year-old lieutenant said he was firing his machine
gun so furiously that he was scalded by the heat of the gun barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Three of his men were wounded in a 10-minute firefight, and
Kukhlovets says his entire unit might have been annihilated if they
had tried to fight their way into the center of the city against
entrenched Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been fighting all over Chechnya, but Grozny is the
first place we have come across such intense resistance,'' he said
at this settlement, four miles southwest of the Chechen capital.
``The rebels have fortified their positions, and it is much harder
to fight inside a city.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first three months of their military campaign, Russia
made short work of the militants. Russian forces raced through the
northern plains of Chechnya before seizing the lowlands to the
south.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny, however, is different. The sprawling city has turned out
to be, once again, a deadly killing zone. The Russian soldiers have
made inroads, but still do not control the city center _ a fact
that could become a major challenge to Vladimir V. Putin, the newly
appointed acting president of Russia, whose current popularity is
based in large part on the reportedly low Russian casualties up to
now in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Under the division of war chores among Russian forces, the
Interior Ministry troops are charged with the thankless task of
clearing Grozny's apartments, alleyways and basements of rebels.
According to the official statistics, 21 Interior Ministry troops
have been killed in Grozny and 56 wounded in the last week, since
the military began its drive on the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   But senior Interior Ministry officials acknowledge that those
statistics understate the actual Russian losses. Russian troops are
officially counted as dead only when their bodies have been found
and identified. As the fighting has raged in Grozny's streets, the
Interior Ministry's actual losses have sometimes averaged 10 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Grozny is extremely difficult,'' said Valery
P. Zhuravel, the deputy commander of the Interior Ministry troops
in the region. ``The rebels have prepared many strongholds. The
militants are mainly in the center of the city, but they are able
to move around a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The street fighting is more than a military matter. The Kremlin
sold the war to the Russian public by insisting that Russian
casualties would be held to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   If the toll continues to mount, public support for the war _ and
for Putin _ may begin to wane. The prospect of a long war may be
one reason why Boris Yeltsin decided to retire now as president and
to organize early elections while Putin's ratings are still
relatively high.
</P>
<P>
   In a chilly field near Alkhan-Yurt, the 21st Brigade does not
spend much time debating politics. The troops are mostly young
draftees who were quietly serving their tour of duty in Sofrino, a
small town near Moscow, when the fighting erupted in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   They fought the rebels in Dagestan in August and were sent to
Chechnya in October. Chechnya was clear sailing, they said, until
Grozny. The fighting there weighs heavily on their minds. Part of
their unit is still engaged in house-to-house fighting in the city.
After they are withdrawn in a few days, many of the troops now
waiting their turn here will have to face the Grozny meat grinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first real losses started when we entered Grozny,'' said
Aleksei G. Lyulin, a 20-year-old private from the Belgorod region.
``We have had many wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Sergei Chigayev, a 19-year-old with rosy cheeks, chimed in
that he was afraid that he would soon end up in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even going to a small village to look for firewood is scary,''
he said. ``You can see from the way the villagers stare at us that
they really don't want us here. But the idea of going to Grozny is
really frightening. We have had no special training for what we
have do there.''

 ALKHAN-YURT, Chechnya: do there.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What the Russian troops have to do in Grozny is certainly a
dangerous job. In Moscow, Russian spokesmen have promised that the
troops will not ``storm'' Grozny, an allusion to the first war in
Chechnya, when a Russian armor column zoomed into the center of the
city on New Year's Eve in 1994 and was quickly annihilated.
Instead, they assert, Russian troops are conducting a ``special
operation'' to take the city, implying that sophisticated tactics
are being used to keep Russian losses to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Russian troops say they are involved in messy urban
warfare with heavily armed, experienced and motivated rebels.
</P>
<P>
   These are the Russian tactics, as described by commanders and
soldiers here: First, Russian artillery and warplanes pound the
city, trying to stun and weaken the rebel resistance. Then the
Russian troops move in. A special ``rapid deployment team'' of
commandos leads the way. Interior Ministry troops come next,
followed by Russian tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers surround a building. After it is sealed off, they
go from room to room, searching for rebels and arms. If the
Russians run into heavy resistance, they withdraw and call in
artillery and airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen paramilitaries commanded by Bislan Gantamirov, the
former mayor of Grozny _ who was convicted of embezzlement but
released from jail so that he could fight on the side of the
Kremlin _ are not in most of the heavy fighting, Kukhlovets said.
Despite Gantamirov's claims of battlefield prowess, it is the
Russian soldiers who play the main role.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, however, are not acting according to the Russian
script. Instead of running at the sound of Russian artillery, they
hide in Grozny's cellars and ride out the strikes. The artillery,
Russian troops conceded, generally destroys the upper stories, but
leaves the basements intact.
</P>
<P>
   When the Russians return, the rebels shoot at them from
carefully fortified positions, nestled among the ruins of Grozny's
buildings and surrounded by sandbags. The militants are often
deployed in two-man teams.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with automatic weapons and grenade launchers, they are
good shots. Kukhlovets said one rebel with a grenade launcher had
hit the driver of a Russian armored personnel carrier in the head.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel fire is so deadly that it is usually too dangerous to
maneuver an armored personnel carrier through the city. The
militants generally evacuate their dead, so Russian troops often
have no idea of how many casualties they are inflicting on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   In a week of fighting, the Russian troops have seized most of
the northwestern part of the city. But the rebels still control
much of the city center. And even the northwestern area slips from
Russian control at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night anything that moves will be shot at,'' Kukhlovets
said. ``So nobody goes out at night, neither the rebels nor us. If
my soldiers have to go to the bathroom, I tell them to do it out
the window. The slightest movement is forbidden.''
</P>
<P>
   Kukhlovets returned last week from Grozny. Apart from a slight
concussion, he was not hurt. Two other officers were killed in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from his account, there is tough fighting ahead. If the
rebels' confidence has been shaken by Russian firepower, it was not
apparent to Kukhlovets' platoon. During one chilly night in Grozny,
the rebels taunted the Russian soldiers, yelling out from their
hiding places that ``Ivan'' and other ``Russian fools'' have come

AN NBA LABOR WAR THAT'S TURNED PERSONAL
</HEADLINE>
   (With BKN-NOTEBOOK) 
(rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just over two years ago, he secured for Kevin Garnett the
richest contract in professional sports history _ a $126 million
deal that helped stoke the flames of a labor war between players
and owners. Eric Fleisher was becoming such a feared power broker,
he even held a franchise hostage while inviting a bevy of
comparisons to David Falk, the shrewdest and best known of the
sports agents. Fleisher's clientele included Stephon Marbury, Joe
Smith and Al Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   Today his company, Assist Sports Management, has been reduced to
being a bit-part player in the agent game. The most prominent
players he represents are journeyman Antoine Carr, Nets reserve
guard Sherman Douglas and Knicks reserve forward John Wallace.
Fleisher filed a lawsuit two weeks ago in New York state court in
Manhattan, naming 14 individual and four corporate defendants. In a
23-page complaint, Fleisher alleges that his former protege, Andrew
Miller, 10 players and Wilhelmina Models of New York engaged in a
scheme to defraud him out of his multimillion-dollar agency.
Fleisher is seeking more than $30 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have clearly turned around,'' Fleisher said last
Thursday. ``I try not to dwell on what's happened, but momentum is
a funny thing. It can change quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of his complaint, Fleisher alleges that Miller,
whom he hired as an unpaid intern in 1992 and who rose to be the
firm's president, betrayed him by secretly signing clients while
still employed by Assist, then left the firm last July, taking
Fleisher's impressive client base with him. Miller now works for
WSports, a division of Wilhelmina Models.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complaint has absolutely no merit,'' Miller said by
telephone last week. ``My lawyers intend to have it dismissed
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's lawyers have yet to file a motion to dismiss the
complaint, but Fleisher said they had asked for immediate
depositions and discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Among Fleisher's more sensational claims is that the players
were lured away by promises of ``romantic liaisons'' with
unidentified Wilhelmina models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to know about the models; that's getting all
the attention,'' Fleisher said. ``But there's much more to this
than that. This says a lot about loyalty in this business. Clearly,
as you become more high profile, there's a competitive element
there. But this was from inside. This particularly hurts because it
was someone who I trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's a financial component, but also an emotional
component to it. I'm very angry. This was a young kid who I brought
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher has lost 16 clients to Miller's company, including
Garnett and Smith. But they are not defendants in the suit;
Fleisher said he had settled his differences with them out of
court. Marbury left Fleisher for Falk in late 1998. Among the 10
players named in the suit are Chauncey Billups, Harrington and
Tyronn Lue, a fact that has raised concerns at the office of the
players union.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be suing players; that's not good for
business,'' said Ron Klempner, a lawyer with the National
Basketball Players Association. ``Little good can come from that.
The repercussions down the road could be severe for him.'' But
Klempner added, ``Maybe he felt so wronged by what happened that
was the only way he felt he could go.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the players who are being sued could be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher said: ``When someone does something wrong, you have two
choices: look the other way or take action. The reality is, they
were under contract. Will it have potential future implications?
Yeah, it may. But it was something that needed to be done. Those
were all of the young clients that the business was geared toward
the next 10 to 12 years. When I look at it objectively, that was my
retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher, the son of the late union chief Larry Fleisher, is no
stranger to controversy. During the Garnett contract negotiations,
Fleisher told the Minnesota Timberwolves' owner, Glen Taylor, and
the general manager, Kevin McHale, that Garnett would not sign with
the franchise after the club divulged to the news media that
Fleisher and Garnett had turned down a $100 million offer. Fleisher
and his client were pilloried for turning down $15 million more
than the owner had paid for the franchise before finally getting
Taylor to fork over an extra $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher also engaged in a legal fight with a former partner _
his brother, Mark _ over the breakup of their business association.

LAKERS TURN DEFENSIVE  
 A GUN WITHOUT BULLETS 
AROUND THE LEAGUE
</HEADLINE>
   (With BKN-NOTEBOOK-AGENT) 
(rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is such a familiar story line _ Lakers Grow Up, Learn How to
Win _ that not even Phil Jackson is buying it until the postseason
begins. But in his first year with Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant, Jackson has gotten the Lakers to buy into a defensive
philosophy that may pay huge dividends in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason the Lakers won their 10th straight game last
week, have won 17 of their last 18 and at 25-5 possess the best
record in the NBA. It is not the triangle offense as much as it is
a collapsing defense that has taken ammunition from some of the
league's top guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are not as pretty but they are much more gritty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil has got us believing in helping each other out and
shutting teams down,'' O'Neal said. ``We're still unstoppable
sometimes on offense. But when we turn up the defensive intensity,
it's lights out, baby. People think we're just pretty boys out
here. We can get down and dirty, too. It just took a few years for
us realize our capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers finished December with a 14-1 record. They have not
lost since Dec. 8 in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   A Gun Without Bullets
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of his firing last week, it is open for debate
whether P.J. Carlesimo had lost the respect of his players at
Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   But one wonders if his tenure in the Bay Area would have been
different had the franchise made a concerted effort to draft and
build around Vince Carter instead of his North Carolina teammate,
Antawn Jamison, drafted one spot behind Carter. Or if the Warriors
had decided to send Latrell Sprewell to Miami for a legitimate
power forward, P.J. Brown, and a serviceable shooting guard, Dan
Majerle, instead of to the Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and
Terry Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.J. wasn't the problem as much as everyone thinks he was,''
said a recently released Warrior, who requested anonymity. ``We
didn't have any players. They still don't have any players.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the League
</P>
<P>
   As the year 2000 begins, it has come to this: Isaiah Rider says
he is sick and tired of teammates who don't care enough about
winning. Rider, a renowned malcontent, laced into teammates after a
loss to the Pacers on Wednesday, using an expletive-filled diatribe
to vent his frustration over the Hawks' being outscored by 40-10 in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't care, man,'' Rider said. ``I'm tired of this
laughing and giggling. We're losing. I care. I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider entered the weekend averaging 23.0 points, good for 10th
in the league. He said those numbers mean little because of the
Hawks' 11-18 record.
</P>
<P>
   He was so angry about the loss, he missed Atlanta's team flight
to Detroit on the same night, his third missed flight of the
season, and the Hawks suspended him for one game. ...
</P>
<P>
   From the Future-Hall-of-Famers-Play-Hurt Dept.: John Stockton's
nose was broken in the closing minute of Monday night's 92-91
victory over the Phoenix Suns, when Jason Kidd struck him with an
elbow. Stockton, 37, was taken for X-rays to Lakeview Hospital in
Bountiful, Utah, where team doctors reset his nose. He played
Wednesday against Vancouver.

FORMIDABLE BUT FADED FEATS FROM THE PREVIOUS TURN OF THE CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How far Major League Baseball has come in 100 years. In 1900 the
National League snubbed the newly named American League, denying
the upstart equal status, even refusing to acknowledge the league's
existence. In the first year of this new century, the leagues are
not only considered equal but they also have become blurred by the
elimination of separate league offices and league presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year of the 1900s, the Players Protective
Association was formed and won significant concessions, without a
work stoppage, from the AL president, Ban Johnson: no player would
be traded, sold or sent to the minor leagues without his written
permission, disputes would be submitted to binding arbitration, and
a three-year limit would exist on the clause that enabled clubs to
reserve players. It was enlightened thinking unmatched to this day.
</P>
<P>
   But later that year, at the same meeting at which they ignored
the other league, NL owners rejected the efforts of the
association's lawyer to gain similar rights for players in that
league. In some ways, baseball has not come very far at all.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century 100 years ago, Cy Young had run off a
streak of nine successive seasons in which he won more than 30
games three times and more than 20 six other times. But he didn't
win the Cy Young Award even once.
</P>
<P>
   When players' achievements are discussed or listed in record
books, they are usually done so in the context of ``modern'' times,
that is, from 1900 on. Most people tend to ignore what players did
before 1900, even if they were two-century players.
</P>
<P>
   It is not very likely that sometime later in this century a new
modern era beginning in 2000 will be recognized, although the way
hitters have been hitting home runs and teams have been scoring
runs in recent seasons, this era may have to be considered
separately from the past to account for offensive inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever line of demarcation was created to separate pre- and
post-1900, events that occurred before should not be ignored. Some
had an impact on post-1900 developments; some were just interesting
in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   For eight seasons before 1900, the National League had 12 teams.
But a month before that season began, the league reduced its
membership to eight teams, lopping off Baltimore, Cleveland,
Washington and Louisville. Cleveland, known as the Spiders,
finished the 1899 season with a 20-134 record, the worst for number
of losses and winning percentage (.130) ever compiled by what would
be classified as a major league team.
</P>
<P>
   The downsizing of the league left New York, Brooklyn, Boston,
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, St. Louis and Chicago. Those
eight cities would be the National League for the next 53 years,
until the Braves moved from Boston to Milwaukee in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the elimination of one of the two teams he owned,
Barney Dreyfuss ``traded'' 13 of his Louisville players for four of
his Pittsburgh players. Included in the trade were four players who
would one day be in the Hall of Fame _ shortstop Honus Wagner,
outfielder Fred Clarke and pitchers Jack Chesbro and Rube Waddell.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Leach was one of the players in the Louisville-Pittsburgh
trade who didn't reach the Hall of Fame, but he holds a distinction
nonetheless. Leach led the National League in home runs in 1902,
and his total of six was the lowest total for a home run champion
in the 1900s. These days that is a routine week for Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1894 Bob Lowe of the Boston Beaneaters became the first
player to hit four home runs in a game. He hit only 13 others
during the season. That same year his teammate Hugh Duffy hit .438,
which remains the highest average any player has ever had. Duffy
also edged Lowe for the home run title, 18 to 17.
</P>
<P>
   At that time the home run record was 27, the number Ned
Williamson hit for the Chicago White Stockings (Chicago's American
League team would later appropriate the name) in 1884. The third
baseman whacked 25 of his home runs at the team's home park,
Lakefront Park, which happened to have the shortest distances of
any park ever, 196 feet to left field, 180 to right.
</P>
<P>
   Before that season, balls hit over those fences were doubles.
They were doubles after that season, too. Williamson, who had hit a
total of eight home runs in six previous seasons, connected for a
total of 29 in six subsequent seasons. If that record can be
discounted as a fluke, the record-holder before Babe Ruth made home
runs his province beginning in 1919 was Harry Stovey, a first
baseman, who hit 14 home runs for Philadelphia in 1883.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Stovey nor Williamson took his home run bat into the
1900s so neither has been a part of baseball lore. Bill Duggleby is
not either, but the Philadelphia Phillies pitcher should be. He
registered his best season in 1901 when he compiled a 20-12 record,
but that is not why he should be remembered. He hit a grand slam in
his first major league at-bat in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   What is so special about that? No other player has hit a grand
slam in his first major league at-bat. Bobby Bonds is the only
other player who hit one in his first game, but his shot, in 1968,
came in his third time at the plate. Ruth, Aaron, Mays, McGwire _
no one did what Duggleby did.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McGinnity pitched his first major league game, for
Baltimore, in 1899. He won 28 games, just as he did the following
season for Brooklyn, which in the first month of the 1900s
purchased him and five other players from cash-strapped Baltimore.
But it was with the New York Giants that the right-hander earned
his reputation and nickname, Iron Man.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1903 McGinnity pitched both games of doubleheaders
three times and all three times gained complete-game twin
victories. He started 48 games that season and completed 44. He won
31 times (he won 35 the following season). He pitched 434 innings,
the most anyone pitched in the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Cy Young won 511 games, more than anyone won in the 1900s or the
1800s. Young played from 1890 through 1911 and completed 749 of the
815 games he started, a 92 percent ratio. He was a 20-game or
30-game winner 13 times in a 14-season span, missing only in 1900,
when he had a 19-19 record. He gained 267 of his victories before
1900. Only 28 pitchers in history have won more than that total.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a quarter-century pitchers have been pampered and
treated as gingerly as if they were made of Tiffany glass. From
four-man rotations teams have gone to five. Pitch counts are used
as a safeguard against pitchers being overworked, but in reality as
a way for managers to protect themselves against charges of
overuse.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever pampered Amos Rusie. A strong right-hander, Rusie
was primarily an 1890s guy who won 246 games in nine seasons.
That's an average of 27 victories a season. In only one of those
seasons did he fail to win at least 20 games. That was the only
year he did not pitch for the Giants. He won more than 30 in four
successive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Rusie struck out more than 300 batters in each of his first
three seasons with the Giants, 1890, '91 and '92. No pitcher would
have 300 strikeouts in three different seasons until the 1960s, but
Sandy Koufax did not do it three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Rusie made as many as 62 starts. In each of his first
three seasons with the Giants, he pitched 500 or more innings.
Pitchers today need three seasons to accumulate 500 innings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rusie was as tough on management as he was on opposing batters.
He held out the entire 1896 season because the Giants' owner would
not give him the extra $200 he wanted. But he wound up getting what
would have been his entire salary for that year because National
League teams contributed to a fund to make up the $3,000 Rusie
lost.
</P>
<P>
   The other owners were not being charitable. They wanted to avoid
Rusie's lawsuit in which he was seeking free agency. What a
concept. Owners continued avoiding it for the next 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rusie returned in 1897 and pitched himself to a 28-10 record and
led the league with a 2.54 earned run average. The next season he
was a 20-game winner for the eighth consecutive time. But again he
and the Giants tangled over the salary he should receive.
</P>
<P>
   This time he sat out two seasons, 1899 and 1900. It was as if
Pedro Martinez had sat out last season and would do the same next
season. After the 1900 season the Giants traded Rusie to Cincinnati
for Christy Mathewson, who had pitched for the Giants as a rookie
that year but had been drafted by the Reds for $100 after the
Giants sent him back to the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Rusie was only 29 years old, but he would stage no more
holdouts. He started two games for the Reds and relieved in one,
and his career was over. Mathewson? He won 20 that season and would
win 373 games in a career in which he was a 30-game winner four
times and a 20-game winner nine other times, winning 22 or more
games for 12 successive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, the team that would dominate the
20th century didn't exist. The New York Yankees, nee Highlanders,
came into existence for the 1903 season as part of the peace pact
between the NL and the AL The AL agreed to stay out of Pittsburgh,
and the NL agreed to let the AL have a New York team.

AN INTERNATIONAL HUG AT MEXICO-U.S. BORDER
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Texas)   (jw) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ In a vivid reminder that many people along the
Texas-Mexico border regard the region as one country instead of
two, the mayors of Laredo and its Mexican sister city, Nuevo
Laredo, walked across one of the bridges above the Rio Grande and
celebrated the new millennium with an international hug and a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Como esta?'' asked Mayor Betty Flores of Laredo as she greeted
Mayor Horacio Garza Garza of Nuevo Laredo at the halfway point of
International Bridge No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting on International Bridge No. 1 was freighted with
symbolism for this isolated border region where culture and
nationality seem as blurred and fluid as the Rio Grande itself. A
few hundred people shouted ``Viva Mexico!'' after singing the
Mexican national anthem and then cheered loudly after listening to
``The Star Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our values have stood the test of time,'' Ms. Flores said in a
short speech.
</P>
<P>
   A day before, on the last day of the 1900s, the scene at the
bridge had been the usual: Old women and cowboys, teen-agers and
tourists and thousands of other people crossed back and forth from
Mexico, some shopping, others coming or going from jobs on one side
of the border or the other. The notion that a line on a map could
create hard boundaries seemed as far-fetched as, say, the world's
changing with the tick of a clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like it was one city,'' said Terry Medinilla, a sales
clerk at El Porvenir, a clothing store that depends on customers
walking across the bridge from Mexico. ``We can't be without them,
and they can't be without us.''
</P>
<P>
   By late in the evening, the bridge was empty, closed by
officials for the ``abrazo,'' or embrace, ceremony. At about 11
p.m., Central time, the Mexican mayor and his entourage followed a
contingent of green-helmeted soldiers toward the stone marker
signifying the international boundary. From the American side, Ms.
Flores and members of the local city council walked arm-in-arm to
greet their Mexican counterparts. Four Laredo police officers
carrying the American flag made up a modest color guard.
</P>
<P>
   The future actually arrived in Laredo six years ago. In January
1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement transformed Laredo
into the busiest cargo crossing point on the border. Unemployment
plummeted as 12,000 trucks a day carried goods back and forth. The
trucks have also polluted the air and clogged the roads.
</P>
<P>
   After the embrace and the speeches, the people walked back to
their sides of the river, dividing into two countries once more. In
Nuevo Laredo, a huge red, white and green Mexican flag fluttered
beside the river. On the Laredo side of the river, a few hundred
people attended a free concert. Fireworks crackled from both sides
of the river, as did a more dangerous local New Year's custom,
gunshots fired in celebration into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Then, an hour or so later, the noise subsided, traffic began
flowing across the bridge as the border checkpoints reopened, and
life on the border resumed along the stale, green waters of the Rio
Grande.

   ``It isn't over yet,'' said Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman
of the House subcommittee that investigated Y2K readiness. ``We
have to see what, if any, damage will be done'' once computers face
the strain of a full work week.
</P>
<P>
   But Horn and other Y2K authorities were greatly encouraged by
initial assessments of the bug, a software flaw that could cause
older computers to misread the two-digit date ``00'' as 1900,
rather than 2000. Without repairs, that seemingly simple
misunderstanding could cause serious equipment malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   When the date began rolling over on New Year's Day, global
monitors started looking for trouble in telecommunications systems,
power grids, transportation networks and other vital operations.
But many hours into 2000, officials could find no significant Y2K
problems, even in those countries that many had feared were ill
prepared, such as Russia, Ukraine and China.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce McConnell, director of the United Nations-backed
International Y2K Cooperation Center, said Saturday that while he
believes ``we are on the verge of a major success,'' no one will be
sure for several days. In some countries, as many as two out of
three computers won't be turned on during the long weekend, he
said. ``We don't think we're out of the woods yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a few banks tried to avoid possible Monday
morning jitters by opening branches Saturday to demonstrate the
smoothness of operations. None reported problems.
</P>
<P>
   But while Y2K authorities say the champagne should stay on ice
through the weekend, they do seem confident that the worst-case
scenarios, such as widespread power blackouts and massive traffic
tie-ups, won't occur.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing why the Y2K effort has been going so well so far,
authorities are virtually unanimous in praising John Koskinen,
chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, 60-year-old the former deputy director at the Office
of Management and Budget, was appointed two years ago by President
Clinton to spur business and government officials to fix Y2K bugs.
His no-nonsense approach won over industry leaders, as well as
congressional Republicans, who often are reluctant to take advice
from Clinton appointees. Horn said Koskinen was ``an excellent
choice'' because he was so non-partisan in his dealings with
Congress, which approved $8.5 billion for Y2K fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology
Association of America, said the Y2K battle progressed more quickly
than many business people had expected because Koskinen, Horn and
several other members of Congress revealed themselves to be
``really good people'' who just wanted solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the luck of the draw,'' Miller said, but those who were
drawn to lead the Y2K battle turned in ``an amazing effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Saturday revealed no significant Y2K problems, some
glitches were reported around the country. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pentagon said a U.S. military spying system was blinded
for about three hours because of a Y2K failure. A back-up system
partially restored operations while software patches were being
made.
</P>
<P>
   _ An Amtrak computer that tracks trains failed temporarily in
Saturday's early hours, but operators quickly switched to a manual
system and fixed the software.
</P>
<P>
   _ Computers at five nuclear plants across the country also
reported some temporary problems, but none were related to plant
operations or safety.
</P>
<P>
   _ The U.S. Naval Observatory, which has a master clock in
Washington keeping the nation's official time, reported Saturday's
date as Jan. 1, 19100 on its Internet site. The glitch, which was
corrected, affected only the Web site, not the master clock.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some 150 slot machines at three Delaware race tracks failed
briefly because of a Y2K bug.

   WASHINGTON _ While country after country continued to report
success this weekend in smothering the Y2K computer bug, U.S.
leaders delayed declarations of victory Saturday. They say the true

INDIA DEAL CALLED A WIN FOR TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARION LLOYD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ Even as Indians breathed a collective sigh of relief
Saturday at the peaceful resolution of the hijacking crisis,
celebrations were dampened by the realization that the weeklong
standoff had ended in a victory for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation has won the battle but lost the war,'' said V.R.
Mehta, vice chancellor of Delhi University and a specialist in
international affairs. He argued that the Indian government had
paid a dangerously high price for the release of the 155 passengers
and crew aboard the hijacked Indian Airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
   The government freed three jailed Islamic militants Friday to
secure the release of the hostages, who had endured extreme cold
and death threats from their captors throughout the harrowing
weeklong ordeal. It was India's 13th hijacking in 20 years, but the
first in which the government gave in to the hostage-takers'
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal that the government was finally forced to agree to .
. . is certainly a bitter pill for the country to swallow,'' The
Hindu newspaper wrote in a front-page editorial Saturday. The Times
of India was equally pessimistic, declaring, ``No amount of
verbiage or dissimulation can convert this setback into a victory
for the Indian nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers expressed the widespread view that the bargain struck
by the government, however unavoidable, would set a dangerous
precedent for other would-be hijackers _ particularly Islamic
militants fighting for the secession of the northern Indian state
of Jammu and Kashmir. The 53-year dispute over India's only
Muslim-majority state has sparked two wars between India and Muslim
Pakistan and become a cause celebre of Islamic fundamentalists
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The five hijackers and at least one of the freed militants were
believed to be members of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, one of a dozen
Islamic groups waging a 10-year-old insurgency in Kashmir. The
group is named on the US list of terrorist organizations for its
role in the spate of kidnappings and bomb attacks in India over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the politically savvy timing of enabling the hostages to
return home New Year's Eve, the deal cut for their release was
expected to have lasting repercussions for the government. The
Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which leads the governing
coalition, rode to a second term in office in October on the heels
of its success in routing out hundreds of Islamic infiltrators in
Kashmir last summer, as well as conducting India's first successful
nuclear tests in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the calling cards of the BJP was its supposed great
nationalistic outlook and its firm stand on national security,''
said Bharat Karnad, a defense specialist with the Center for Policy
Studies in New Delhi. ``That's precisely what is being eroded at
the edges at the moment and . . . it's going to get at their
reputation and standing amongst the people.''
</P>
<P>
   However, others said many Indians recognized that the government
had found itself in a no-win situation. ``I'm sure people realize
that given the situation, there was no way out,'' said Mehta. He
blamed the international community for not coming out strongly
enough in condemning the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   The primary criticism of the government was that it had failed
to prevent the hijacked plane from leaving Indian territory _ a
critical lapse that curtailed its negotiating power with the
hijackers. The plane had stopped for 40 minutes in the western city
of Amritsar for refueling. But a series of communications failures
_ including the fact that the prime minister was not even alerted
of the crisis until 45 minutes later _ enabled the hijackers to
ensure that the plane reached friendlier ground in Islamic
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties, which had professed support for the
government during the negotiation period, sought Saturday to
capitalize on the concessions made to the terrorists. ``This will
have far-reaching implications for this government,'' said Anil
Durrani, spokesman for the main opposition Congress party. He said
Congress governments, which have governed India for most of its 53
years of independence, ``chose to sacrifice rather than give up
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The party is expected to highlight the contrast between the
current government's response and that of former prime minister
Indira Gandhi, whose hard-line stand against Sikh separatists in
the northern state of Punjab cost her her life. Gandhi deployed
Indian soldiers in 1984 to flush out militants from their hideout
inside Sikhdom's most important shrine, the Golden Temple. The
offensive, known as Operation Bluestar, led to her assassination at
the hands of her Sikh bodyguards several months later.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials sought to deflect criticism by drawing a
different comparison between this week's hostage crisis and another
in 1989. The government at the time, led by the populist People's
Party, traded 30 jailed militants for the release of one kidnapping
victim _ who happened to be the daughter of the powerful home
minister.
</P>
<P>
   But Karnad said such comparisons were meaningless in terms of
the broader impact of the hostage swap. ``It's a moot point, the
mathematics of the deal, because it undermines the basic principle
of dealing with terrorists,'' he said, ``that you don't bargain
with hostages because you become vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to release the militants from Indian jails also
sparked heavy criticism from the military. The army suffered heavy
casualties in last summer's operation to flush out hundreds of
Pakistani-backed militants from Kashmir, which has been the cause
of two of the three wars between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act of the government is a shot in the arm for the
terrorists,'' a senior army official was quoted as saying in the
Indian Express newspaper. ``The sacrifices made by the police and
the soldiers have come to naught.''

 A LONG LEGACY OF TRYING BUT FOLDING  (rk) 
 By DAVID FISCHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not all professional sports leagues formed in the past 100 years
made it to the next. While the Women's National Basketball
Association has survived three seasons, its rival, the American
Basketball League, did not. The sports landscape has been littered
with ignominious moments from defunct leagues gone by.
</P>
<P>
   Federal League, 1914-15
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis Hoosiers, paced by Benny Kauff's league-leading
.370 batting average, captured the Federal League flag in 1914. The
Hoosiers became the Newark Peps in 1915, the only major league
baseball pennant-winner to move to a new city the following year.
</P>
<P>
   American Professional Football Association, 1920-22
</P>
<P>
   In its first year the league had two rival football teams in
Chicago: the Cardinals and the Tigers. The owners knew there were
only enough fans to support one team, so they decided to play a
game against each other with the provision that the loser had to
leave the city. Only one touchdown was scored that day, by
Cardinals quarterback Paddy Driscoll. The Cards _ forerunners of
the NFL's Arizona Cardinals _ won, 6-3, and the Tigers left town.
</P>
<P>
   American Football League, 1926-27
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, the NFL got its first superstar when Red Grange, the
Galloping Ghost, signed with the Chicago Bears. The next season,
Grange's manager, C.C. (Cash and Carry) Pyle, wanted the Bears to
increase the player's pay. When the Bears' owner, George Halas,
refused, Pyle formed the American Football League with Grange and
his team, the New York Yankees, as its main attraction. The war
between the leagues ended in 1927 when Grange caught his cleats in
the grass and ruined his knee. Without its superstar, the AFL
folded.
</P>
<P>
   American Basketball League, 1925-31
</P>
<P>
   After the Original Celtics had won the ABL title in 1927 and
1928, officials decided the team was too good for the league. They
broke up the squad and sent the players to different teams. Nat
Holman and George ``Horse'' Haggerty, both former Celtics, found
themselves on opposing teams in a tight game. With seconds left,
Haggerty had the ball. Then he heard someone call, ``Hey, Horse!''
It was Holman. Without thinking, Haggerty threw the ball to his old
teammate. Holman took the pass and scored an easy bucket, winning
the game.
</P>
<P>
   All-America Football Conference, 1946-49
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 two African-American players, Woody Strode and Kenny
Washington, signed to play with the Los Angeles Rams of the NFL.
Bill Willis, a fellow African-American, wanted to play pro
football, too, but his only offer was a tryout with the Montreal
Alouettes of the Canadian Football League.
</P>
<P>
   While traveling to the Alouettes' training camp, Willis stopped
to visit his former college coach, Paul Brown, then coach of the
Cleveland Browns of the newly formed AAFC. Brown persuaded Willis
to practice with his team. Willis was so impressive, Brown signed
him immediately. Nine days later, presumably because Brown thought
Willis would need a black roommate on road trips, the team signed
Marion Motley. The Browns won all four AAFC championships and then,
after joining the NFL, won its 1950 title.
</P>
<P>
   National Basketball League, 1937-49
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Connors, a 6-foot-5-inch forward for the Celtics,
splintered a wooden backboard in Boston Arena during warmups with
the Chicago Stags in 1946. A visiting rodeo provided a replacement
backboard so the game could be played. Connors would go on to star
in the TV series ``The Rifleman,'' prompting one former teammate to
say, ``He went from being the worst shot in the East to the best
shot in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   American Basketball Association, 1967-76
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Chaparrals' owner, Roland Speth, traveled alone to
the expansion draft in New York in 1967 and chose players according
to a list provided by team scouts. What Speth did not realize was
that the players were listed alphabetically, not by talent. So Jim
Burns of Northwestern was drafted ahead of a star player from
Kentucky named Pat Riley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Conquistadors' head coach, Wilt Chamberlain,
skipped three games in the 1973-74 season, one so that he could
attend a book signing of his autobiography and two for unknown
reasons. San Diego finished 37-47.
</P>
<P>
   World Hockey Association, 1972-79
</P>
<P>
   The Calgary Broncos' general manager, Scotty Munro, selected the
Soviet premier, Alexsei Kosygin, in the initial free-agent draft.
Neither the Broncos, who were out of money, nor Kosygin played a
game in the WHA.
</P>
<P>
   World Football League, 1974-75
</P>
<P>
   The Memphis Southmen had a grizzly bear cub as their mascot.
During one game, the cub playfully chewed through the insulation of
a wire lying on the ground; when he got to the core he gave himself
a terrific shock that threw him over on his back and shorted out
the stadium scoreboard for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The week before the 1975 season finale, the Hawaiians, who
played in Honolulu, asked their players to take pay cuts to save
the franchise. Both quarterbacks refused and quit. Two days before
the game, the team recruited two replacements: Milt Holt, who had
played at Harvard, and Jim Fassel, who had been a player-coach for
the Hawaiians in their first year. Holt was taken from a desk job
at Honolulu City Hall, and Fassel, now the head coach of the
Giants, had been driving a truck in Los Angeles. The Hawaiians lost
to the Southern California Sun, 26-7.
</P>
<P>
   World Team Tennis, 1974-79  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vitas Gerulaitis, star player for the Pittsburgh Triangles in
1974, ordered the public-address announcer at the Civic Arena to
invite the crowd of nearly 11,000 to proceed from a match to his
20th birthday observance at a nearby hotel. Gerulaitis had reserved
the top floor. The result: heavy partying and at least one broken
bathtub. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Connors, star of the Baltimore Banners, wondering why his
team was called the Banners: ``Who's Francis Scott Key? I thought
we were named after some guy named Banner.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, though not because of the Connors comment, WTT
disbanded. It re-formed in 1981 and still exists, but without the
Banners or the big-name stars.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   North American Soccer League, 1968-84
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Diplomats were affectionately referred to by
headline writers in the 1970s as the Dips. No shorthand nickname
was used for the Hartford Bicentennials, who would have been known
as the the Bis.
</P>
<P>
   A game between the Seattle Sounders and the Tulsa Roughnecks in
1980 included 70 fouls, two ejections and five yellow cards. After
the Sounders had won in a shootout, Seattle goaltender Jack Brand
went after the Tulsa general manager, Noel Lemon. Brand, his fists
clenched, was pulled away by players from both teams as fans and
police officers poured onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Women's Basketball League, 1978-81
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa Cornets led the league in attendance for two seasons,
but like 10 of the original 18 franchises, the team folded in 1981.
Among the reasons was the owner George Nissen's $1 million
investment in ``Dribble,'' a movie starring Pete Maravich and
featuring several Cornets, which was never released.
</P>
<P>
   Major Indoor Soccer League, 1979-91  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Slaten of the St. Louis Steamers was thrown out of a 1981
playoff game for trying to punch a player from the other team.
Slaten was the Steamers' announcer.
</P>
<P>
   United States Football League, 1983-85  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Coach George Allen's Chicago Blitz had lost, 21-15, to the
Boston Breakers in a meeting of contenders for the league's lone
wild-card spot in 1983, Allen threatened to cut the backup
quarterback Tom Rozantz for enjoying himself on the plane ride
home. At 30,000 feet, Allen said, ``Anybody who isn't dedicated can
leave now.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Express brought in John Hadl as head coach in
1984 to mentor rookie quarterback Steve Young. The year before,
Hadl had been John Elway's quarterback coach in Elway's rookie
season with the Denver Broncos. Hadl's assessment: ``Elway will be
the greatest drop-back passer in the game. He throws better than
anybody except maybe Namath. Steve has a tendency to scramble _
make a big play on his own. You can't go wrong with either one.''

MEXICANS LOOK ON, SOMBERLY, AT THE WORLD

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexicans, who feel that their history often leaves
them underestimated and misunderstood, were not very comfortable
being part of a global millennial celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The government, to impart a sense that they were on the cusp of
technological progress, set up a four-screened television monitor
in Mexico City's central square to show the New Year arriving all
over the globe.
</P>
<P>
   But as the hours wore on toward midnight, one hour after New
York's, it was a subdued and reluctant crowd that watched
celebrations in Cairo, Paris and Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans usually love a good party, but the advent of the 2000s
was just not very inspiring to them.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other event, the advent of the 2000s reminded
Mexicans that they are part of an increasingly interconnected
world. To many, the reminder was unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as though they don't know their own country,'' Adriana
Diaz Romero, 16, a high school student, said of the authorities as
she pondered images of confetti-covered Americans and longed to
hear mariachi trumpets instead. ``I want to feel the heat and see
the never-ending disaster that is Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The city government closed down Paseo de la Reforma, the main
boulevard through downtown, and staged a parade with swaying mambo
bands, mural-like floats and figures representing hallowed national
heroes on stilts and roller skates. But only a small, low-key crowd
turned out to see it, just as the crowd remained thin in the
central square.
</P>
<P>
   In part, people were feeling the weight of their history. The
notion that the passing of time can well bring preordained
misfortune goes back many centuries here.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many were not comfortable with such an unavoidably global
event. They are wary of entering a modern economic and cultural
competition against the whole world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economy is more and more oriented to satisfy global
economic interests,'' said Oscar Mendez, 54, a schoolteacher. ``We
can see that we are on our way into a worldwide economy, but we
also know that there are many differences between Mexico and the
strong countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of joining others' festivities by satellite, many in the
central square stopped to contemplate the stony, half-exposed
pyramid that was the center of the Aztec capital before the Spanish
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The haunting ruins of the 15th-century temple sit on one corner
of the square, sandwiched between the National Palace and the
cathedral, which Spanish conquerors purposely built on top of the
Aztec edifices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to observe the same thing they observed: the
advance of time,'' said Carlos Contreras Sanchez, 68, a retiree, as
he peered at the ruins. ``It's the same party in a different
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans are descended from a turbulent history that began not
one but nearly three millenniums ago with a civilization, the
Olmecs, that was fascinated with time and created early calendars
and writing.
</P>
<P>
   To the nation's Aztec forebears the movement of time was the
prime factor determining the course of life. An Aztec's fate was
almost entirely determined by his or her birth date, and many days
were thought to bring inescapable bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the year 2000 brought out similar pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to think of it as a renovation,'' said Jose Luis
Razon, 38, a federal employee. ``I know I should be positive. But I
keep thinking of the pollution in this city, and the sorry state of
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one political figure, in his New Year's resolution,
vowed to try to change his dark view of life. Adolfo Aguilar
Zinser, an independent federal senator, wrote in a column on Dec.
31, ``Our political life is filled with ridiculous turns of event
that should leave us dying of laughter.'' He pledged to make his
column funnier in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo could see the struggles to come to
grips with a long past, and he tried to help. In place of a frothy
New Year's greeting, he turned his millennium address on Friday
evening into a sober history lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a country that measures its history not in years or
centuries but in millenniums,'' he said. After recounting the wars
and conquests Mexico has suffered, he added, ``Mexico has solid
foundations of unity, identity and hope.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare display of disrespect, Mexicans disapprovingly
whistled at Zedillo when he descended into the square from the
National Palace to shake hands in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Just before midnight the people in the central square got what
they wanted. A 200-piece mariachi band, with every musician wearing
one of those impractical but distinctive sombreros, serenaded the
new year.

HOSTAGES RECALL TIMES OF TERROR AMID BOREDOM 
</HEADLINE>
 (With INDIA-HIJACK) 
(jw)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The hostages called the hijacker dressed all
in black by his nickname, Burger, and within days of commandeering
an Indian Airlines jet, he had the 178 passengers and 11 crew
members joining in for singing games and joke-athons.
</P>
<P>
   The grown-ups listened to him recite Urdu poetry. The children
called him uncle. And a newlywed wife who had a birthday in
captivity was grateful when he bought a shawl from a Nepali hostage
who dealt in them and presented it to her. He was the most
sympathetic of the five hijackers, and when he walked up and down
the aisles holding a gun, he would pause solicitously to chat with
passengers, who were only allowed to go to the bathroom after
asking for permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very friendly with everybody,'' said Ipseeta Menon, 25,
who once asked him if he got his nickname because he liked eating
hamburgers. (He did not, and the name remained a mystery.)
</P>
<P>
   Cut off as the hostages were, with even the sunlight shut out by
the drawn window covers, they thought the masked Burger was a nice
guy _ that is until Thursday morning, when he told them that they
would all be killed one by one because the Indian government had
refused to meet the hijackers' demands.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, this did not happen. The story had a happy
ending. On Friday the hostages were released after India agreed to
free three militants who, like the hijackers, were opposed to
Indian rule of the Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   But the experience of being trapped on an Airbus for eight days
has left many of the hostages feeling deeply traumatized.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, they described days of tedium and moments of
terror. They talked of living with the stench of overflowing
toilets and of deciding to stop eating solid foods in an effort to
avoid the dreaded bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   And some admit to the strange bond they formed with Burger, the
tall, muscular hijacker who was good cop and bad cop all rolled
into one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could change from a very sweet person to one who could
shoot you within seconds,'' said Ravi Kollatt, a former merchant
marine from Cochin. ``I could see it in his eyes. They were smiling
eyes, but then suddenly they would become small.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostages' journey began on Christmas Eve. Flight 814 was
late, but there was a festive air in Katmandu as they waited to
board the plane that would carry them on a hop to New Delhi. Among
them were eight newlywed couples returning from honeymoons in
Nepal. Married in arranged matches, they had only begun to get to
know each other _ but would soon find themselves tested in a way
they had never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Several passengers said they thought it was a joke when men with
guns yelled that they were hijackers. One described a steward
pushing a drink cart down the aisle who kept moving when one of the
hijackers waved a gun at him. Weren't those pistols and the grenade
just fake weapons, like in the movies?
</P>
<P>
   But reality quickly set in. ``When my husband raised his head,
they shoved it down roughly,'' said Suchana Goel, of Bhopal, a
newlywed. ``We were terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first two days the hijackers were jumpy and brusque,
hostages said. The plane kept taking off and landing in different
places _ the passengers had no idea where. As they jumped from
Amritsar, India, to Lahore, Pakistan, to Dubai in the United Arab
Emirates and finally, on Christmas morning, to Kandahar,
Afghanistan, they were bewildered. Many were blindfolded.
</P>
<P>
   On the harrowing first night, before the plane landed in Dubai,
the hijackers picked out a group of strong-looking men and took
them into the executive-class compartment, whose occupants had all
been moved to economy. Ripen Katyal, 25, a newlywed, was among
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right in front of us they slashed his throat,'' said K. Keshav
Kannan, who was in Nepal on business for his company, Pepsi. ``They
wanted to make an example.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few knew what had happened. Katyal's new wife, Rachna,
sitting in economy, had not heard a thing. In Dubai, the hijackers
released a group of 27 women and children and unloaded Katyal's
body. When her husband did not return, Mrs. Katyal got scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor thing, she was crying for two days,'' said Mrs. Menon,
herself one of the newlyweds. `` They were avoiding her. Then on
the third day, Burger said to her, ``I'm like your elder brother.
Your husband has been released in Dubai. You should be happy he is
safe and sound.' Rachna never knew he was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Unaware that the hijackers had murdered Katyal, many passengers
became chummy with Burger once the plane settled in Kandahar.
Though cameras for CNN and BBC were constantly trained on the craft
and television stations in India broadcast news of little else, the
passengers heard nothing.
</P>
<P>
   One day Burger started a round of joke-telling. He began it with
the one about the man in the helicopter who feels cold, asks why
the fan is on, stops the propeller and dies. There was weak
laughter. Then the captain of the jet picked up the thread and told
one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Burger also got them to participate in a singing competition
called antakshri. One passenger would sing part of a song, then the
next would have to start a song with the last word in the previous
song. There was merriment as young people sang Hindi movie tunes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was only on the fourth day of captivity that the Indian
government began negotiating with the hijackers _ and many of the
passengers felt abandoned. If there had been a minister or VIP on
board, they told one another, they would already be free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not getting any information from the Indian
government,'' said Mrs. Menon. ``And the hijackers were being very
friendly to us, very genuine. We didn't know they had killed
Rupal.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the sixth day, the hijackers told the hostages
that 35 of them would be exchanged for one militant. Women,
children and the elderly were selected for the swap. One elderly
woman refused to leave her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those left behind sobbed, fearing they would be more
vulnerable now that many of the weaker people were gone.
</P>
<P>
   But the next morning brought what all the hostages said was the
most terrifying moment. Something had gone badly wrong in the
negotiations. The deal had apparently fallen through. And Burger
was furious.
</P>
<P>
   People were still asleep, but he wanted to wake them. First he
threw open the doors of the jet and the cold wind swept down the
aisles. Then he turned on the lights. Finally he got on the
intercom.
</P>
<P>
   He told them all to pray to their Gods because in half an hour
he and his fellow hijackers would begin shooting them. And if
anyone so much as moved, he warned, he or she would be killed. He
ordered them all to put their heads down.
</P>
<P>
   For hours Mrs. Menon, a dentist, said there was pin-drop silence
except for the sound of people weeping. She held onto her husband's
hand for comfort. ``At that time, we came to know these people were
not to be trusted,'' she said. ``We thought the end had come.''
</P>
<P>
   Kollatt, a father of three who was traveling alone, found
himself wondering who would be picked first. ``I started weighing
every person. Is it you or you? Will they ask for volunteers? Will
I volunteer?''
</P>
<P>
   But that same afternoon, the hostages say, the hijackers came to
tell them that they had made a new deal to free all of them. And
the next day, New Year's Eve, when the moment of liberation finally
arrived, it was the hijackers who left the plane first.
</P>
<P>
   Before climbing down the ladder, Burger turned to the hostages
and apologized for what they had done. ``We'll meet again,'' he
said, waving.
</P>
<P>
   In his final moments with his captives, several of them joked
with him. ``If you see us in an airport lounge and you are on a
similar mission, will you tip us off so we can stay off the
flight?'' one asked.
</P>
<P>
   He promised he would. And then he was gone, down a ladder to a
waiting car that whisked him away on a vanishing mission.

A COUNTDOWN TO REMEMBER, OR A BIG YAWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before the countdown, the cork popping, the confetti
and the computer worries _ indeed, long before most people had
personal computers _ there was the anticipation. And no one did
more anticipating than Edward Woodyard, who spent 16 percent of the
1900s anticipating the arrival of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Woodyard, a screenwriter from Armonk, had spent so much time
ruminating on 2000 because he made his reservations for New Year's
Eve 1999 in 1983, when the hotel in Times Square where he finally
did his celebrating on Friday night was a half-finished skeleton of
steel and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided if other people were thinking like I was, I'd better
get my reservations in because when the time comes, it was going to
be a mob scene,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mob scene, of course, but Woodyard was above it,
looking down on Times Square from the 44th floor of the Marriott
Marquis. It seemed the perfect place to consider the question: Did
the arrival of 2000 live up to its billing?
</P>
<P>
   People probably will be arguing about the answer for the next
thousand years. (Or at least a thousand hours, which turns out to
be almost 42 days.)
</P>
<P>
   Woodyard's answer was affirmative but a bit inarticulate; after
a lot of partying, even screenwriters find themselves fumbling for
nouns and adjectives, as well as hoarse from shouting ``10, 9, 8,
7'' and so on. But yes, he said, 2000 was worth the wait. ``I was
almost speechless. I don't have words for it.'' He tried four:
``Spectacular. Phenomenal. Overpowering. Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pity the poor millennium, it never had a chance to get off the
ground,'' said Mark Mitten, who registered the word ``billennium''
as a trademark because, he said, 2000 was the beginning of the
second millennium. Mitten also has a trademark on something called
the ``millennium hype-o-meter'' on his Web site,
www.millenniumhell.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overburdened by Y2K fears, over-the-top parties and marketing
hype, it seemed to have lost any of the potential it had to be a
noble occasion, worthy of waiting a thousand years for,'' said
Mitten. ``With all the overkill, it was hard to know if it had any
significance at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the arrival of 2000 brought a kind of philosophical
seesawing. There were those who thought it was the greatest thing
in the last thousand years, or at least in the last four. Waterford
crystal, which made the ball that slid down the pole on 1 Times
Square at midnight, credited it with a 30 percent increase in sales
last year, double the company's annual growth rate since 1996.
Waterford, in fact, sold out of seven millennium-related keepsakes
that cost $59 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup included warnings that there would be no corks to
pop: that there would be a champagne shortage. But late last week
stores were cutting prices they had raised back when they thought
they would be at a different point on the supply-and-demand curve.
Korbel Champagne did run out, but still considered 2000 a
manufacturer's dream: It had nothing left to sell by the time it
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But were people hyped out? Not Jeffrey Katz, an owner of 1 Times
Square. ``It was a thrill,'' he said. ``The confetti was so
voluminous you felt like you could step off the building and walk
right through it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side were those who sounded disappointed that 2000
had crept in so uneventfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overhyped, definitely,'' said Alan Gross, who lives in
Brooklyn and spent New Year's Eve at home. ``I was hoping my
computer wouldn't work because I'd have an excuse to buy a new
one.'' He booted up shortly after midnight and was disappointed by
the lack of drama.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the issue of whether the arrival of 2000 was
overpromoted was one of those larger questions: Was the Champagne
glass half full or half empty? ``We didn't hype this,'' said Peter
Coleman, a vice president of the Times Square Business Improvement
District. ``We were trying to fulfill people's dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   And Woodyard certainly seemed close to fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the millennium doesn't start till 2001, Arthur C.
Clarke and all that, but the party is when all those zeroes turn
over,'' he said. ``The only place to be in the world is Times
Square.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Bossert, a spokeswoman for the hotel, said that its
cylindrical core was about half finished when Woodyard called in
1983. Marriott offered Woodyard a suite with two adjoining bedrooms
free. (The hotel did not rent other suites for New Year's Eve; it
charged $2,000 for a four-night package for regular rooms.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation remembers where we were when Kennedy was
assassinated and our parents remember V-E Day, when that
happened,'' Woodyard said. ``This was one of those things: where
were you at the beginning of the millennium, when all those zeroes
turned over. I remember what fun I had as a kid, and I think this
was 50 times that.''

something to prove in Tuesday night's Sugar Bowl. The Florida State

one of the five finalists. Then he didn't even get the Biletnikoff
Award which supposedly goes to the nation's best wide receiver. And
it is given by the Tallahassee Quarterback Club. ``I made a
mistake, I know, but that one I just don't understand,'' said
Warrick. ``That was just ridiculous,'' said defensive tackle Corey
Simon of Warrick not getting the Biletnikoff. If you think the
Florida State players are mad at the way Warrick has been treated,
you're right. And the way they are talking, the Seminoles may take

A RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES TO SUCCEED CARDINAL O'CONNOR
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., Mo., N.J., Md., Pa., Wash., D.C., S.D., Mass., Colo.,
Ill., Ore.)   (jw) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   As the shepherd to 2.4 million parishioners and a man whose
utterances are closely monitored, the archbishop of New York has
historically had the tallest pulpit in the Roman Catholic Church in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By nature of the position, he can be the Vatican's leading
spokesman in America, a figure whom foreign dignitaries feel they
must meet and a religious leader whose views carry great weight
among other faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop since 1983, is likely to
retire soon, and speculation and hope are swirling about whom Pope
John Paul II will appoint to this post. Many who speak about it do
so only on background.
</P>
<P>
   The men most often cited as potential successors share certain
characteristics. They are mostly archbishops, in their late 50s and
60s, with experience of important posts in Rome. They include the
archbishop of St. Louis, a man with strong diplomatic skills, who
is considered close to the pope; the head of the Newark
archdiocese, one of the most ethnically diverse in the church, and
the archbishop of the American military, who has long enjoyed a
close relationship with O'Connor. A handful of others, some with
close ties to New York, round out the list.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop of New York, said the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor
of the Jesuit magazine America, really does the equivalent of four
full-time jobs: administrator and fund-raiser, national Catholic
spokesman, leader among bishops and consultant on American issues
to the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, perhaps, O'Connor, through his outspokenness on
issues as diverse as abortion and immigrants' rights, has
established a tone some people now associate with the office
itself. He has redefined the job, said George Weigel, author of a
biography of Pope John Paul II, ``Witness to Hope'' (HarperCollins,
1999), and a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center
in Washington. Like the pope himself, the cardinal has ``recovered
a much more ancient notion of the bishop as an evangelist,'' Weigel
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But the cardinal has indicated that he expects to retire soon.
Last summer, he underwent brain surgery for a tumor. And he will
turn 80 on Jan. 15, the age at which, by church law, he loses his
vote in the College of Cardinals, the Vatican body that elects the
next pope. In November, the cardinal wrote what sounded like a
farewell letter to American bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics in the 4,700-square-mile archdiocese _ which includes
Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx and seven counties to the north
_ do not lack opinions about the qualities an archbishop should
bring to the job. In a New York Times poll conducted from Nov. 29
to Dec. 5, Catholics in the archdiocese said the next archbishop
should be compassionate and humane, help the poor and the homeless,
and show strong leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with New York Catholics turned up similar sentiments.
``I want a direct, outspoken and very humanitarian leader,'' said
Lorraine Cortes-Vazquez, president of the Hispanic Federation, a
network of nonprofit organizations. ``One who is loving, clear,
extremely responsible and holds people accountable, but who is very
interested in hearing other perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Cuomo, who endured the cardinal's criticism as a Catholic
politician who supported abortion rights while governor, said, ``If
Catholics all knew about Cardinal O'Connor, they would want someone
very much like him.'' He said the cardinal had been ``perhaps the
strongest'' pro-labor archbishop in New York's history.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen McDonnell, a parishioner at St. Boniface Church in
Brooklyn, said she favored the idea of an archbishop with the
ability to listen: ``The church does not work by consensus, and I
understand that, but to be an effective leader, one must be
sensitive to differences, especially in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   And one priest said ``the big thing'' the next archbishop ought
to have is administrative skills.
</P>
<P>
   Father Reese said that if one added up what Catholics wanted in
a New York archbishop, ``it ends up being a saint with an MBA from
Harvard Business School.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The potential successor whose name comes up the most often is
Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis, a city the pope visited for
two days in January 1999, his only stop in the United States after
a pastoral visit to Mexico. Prior to his appointment in 1994,
Archbishop Rigali, 64, earned a doctorate in canon law and spent
three decades in Rome, much of that time in the Vatican's
diplomatic offices. Not surprisingly, he is credited with excellent
diplomatic skills. Like Cardinal O'Connor, he is viewed as a church
conservative but is considered to be more reserved.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of Newark, 69, a
native of New York City who served as an auxiliary bishop in the
archdiocese. Among American bishops, he has a reputation as a
leader on international issues. He travels widely and has pushed
for debt relief for the world's poorest nations. People in the
church describe him as gregarious and accessible.
</P>
<P>
   He is fluent in Spanish, and his fluency would be an asset in
New York, where Hispanics constitute 36 percent of the church's
parishioners. He has a doctorate in sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Another prelate whose name often comes up is a man long close to
Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop Edward O'Brien. He is head of the
archdiocese for the military services, the Washington-based
jurisdiction over chaplains. O'Brien, 60, was vice chancellor and
director of communications in the New York archdiocese, and has
experience as a former rector of seminaries in New York and Rome.
He is described as quiet but personable. He, too, has a doctorate,
in moral theology.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other possible successors include Cardinal William Keeler, the
archbishop of Baltimore since 1989. He is 68 and has a reputation
for extensive work in interfaith relations, particularly between
the church and Jews. But some in the church say moving someone who
already had been elevated to cardinal would be unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Also mentioned is Bishop Henry Mansell, 62, of Buffalo, a former
auxiliary bishop of New York, who has served in Buffalo since 1995.
He is close to O'Connor and was popular with priests in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Donald Wuerl, 59, of Pittsburgh is also a possibility.
Bishop Wuerl once was bishop coadjutor in Seattle, appointed by
Rome to exert greater papal authority over the liberal former
archbishop in Seattle, Raymond Hunthausen. He has earned
considerable praise during his 11 years in Pittsburgh, where he is
regarded as an effective pastoral leader and administrator. But he
is more often spoken of as a likely successor to either Cardinal
Anthony Bevilacqua in Philadelphia or Cardinal James Hickey in
Washington, both in their late 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Two other names mentioned are Archbishop Charles Chaput of
Denver, an outspoken conservative with American Indian ancestry &UR; , &LR; 
who formerly served as bishop of Rapid City, S.D., and Bishop Sean
O'Malley, 55, of Fall River, Mass., a Franciscan priest who is
fluent in Spanish and previously was a bishop in the Virgin
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the speculation amounts to only educated guesses. The
insiders have been surprised before. In late 1996, for example, as
Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, archbishop of Chicago, was dying of
cancer, speculation focused on half a dozen well-known bishops,
mainly Midwesterners with close Chicago connections. But the
following April, the Vatican chose Francis George, the archbishop
of Portland, Ore., who just 11 months before had held the
relatively obscure post of bishop of Yakima, Wash.  &QL;

DISTINGUISHED WORDS FROM SOME DISTINGUISHED SPORTSWRITERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until the beginning of the 20th century, the coverage of sports
in newspapers, except for the occasional heavyweight title fight or
a local football or baseball game, was little more than an
afterthought. Then, with increasing leisure time for readers to
both play and watch, sports grew more important to life and
lifestyle. Editors caught on, and sportswriting began to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a list of seven sports columnists _ in roughly
chronological order _ who have arguably had the greatest impact on
their profession as both reporters and writers. There have been
numerous other distinguished sports journalists in the last 100
years _ from Charles Dryden to Frank Graham to Shirley Povich _ but
space dictates that the list be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Those included here range from Ring Lardner, who began writing
about baseball in 1906, to Jim Murray, who wrote his sports column
nearly up to the day he died, in 1998. Lardner, Damon Runyon and
Grantland Rice were giants for the first half of the century. Red
Smith, Jimmy Cannon, Dick Young and Murray were prominent in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Grantland Rice (1880-1954)
</P>
<P>
   Rice was generally considered the best-known sportswriter of his
generation. He read widely and brought a certain literate quality
to sportswriting that hadn't quite been there before. He began
writing for The Nashville News in 1901, after graduation from
Vanderbilt. He later wrote for The New York Mail and The New York
Tribune. In 1930 he began his popular syndicated sports column,
``The Spotlight.'' Of the two so-called schools of sportswriting in
the early part of the century _ the skeptical ``Aw Nuts'' writers
versus the more romantic ``Gee Whiz'' writers _ Rice was clearly in
the latter group.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote perhaps the most famous opening paragraph in
sportswriting history. It appeared on Oct. 19, 1924, as a lead to
his report on the Notre Dame-Army football game, won by Notre Dame,
and which starred the Fighting Irish backfield: ``Outlined against
a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again. In dramatic
lore they are known as Famine, Pestilence, Destruction, and Death.
These are only aliases. Their real names are Stuhldreher, Miller,
Crowley and Layden.''
</P>
<P>
   Ring Lardner (1885-1933)
</P>
<P>
   Lardner began his career as a sportswriter for The South Bend
(Ind.) Times, but made his greatest impact in newspapers as the
``Wake of the News'' sports columnist for The Chicago Tribune. His
literary fame, however, rests primarily on his short stories, such
as ``Alibi Ike'' and ``You Know Me Al.'' His inventions in language
and perspective also enlivened his sports columns.
</P>
<P>
   From a column in 1910 in which he assumes the role of a
spectator for a Chicago White Sox-Philadelphia Athletics game:
</P>
<P>
   ``On my right sat a gent who knew something, and he soon gave
evidence of the fact. Morris Rath opened the Sox attack with a safe
bunt. He was nailed at second when Lord missed his swing on a hit
and run.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Stealing second with nobody out,' remarked the guy who
knows. `And the papers call him a brainy ballplayer. If he had good
sense, he'd trade all his brains for a little bit of ability.'''
</P>
<P>
   Damon Runyon (1884-1946)
</P>
<P>
   He began writing for newspapers when he was 12 years old. He
worked for newspapers in Pueblo, Colo., Colorado Springs, Denver,
San Francisco and became one of the country's star reporters _ and
sports columnists _ with The New York American. He covered wars,
murder trials and World Series with equal distinction. Like
Lardner, it is Runyon's short stories that enlarged his fame. His
``Runyonesque'' characters live on in the musical ``Guys and
Dolls,'' adapted from his short stories.
</P>
<P>
   From the lead in a column from the 1930 Kentucky Derby:
</P>
<P>
   ``Say, have they turned the pages
</P>
<P>
   Back to the past once more?
</P>
<P>
   Back to the racin' ages
</P>
<P>
   An' a Derby out of the yore?
</P>
<P>
   Say, don't tell me I'm daffy,
</P>
<P>
   Ain't that the same ol' grin?
</P>
<P>
   Why it's that handy
</P>
<P>
   Guy named Sande,
</P>
<P>
   Bootin' a winner in!''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Cannon (1909-1973)
</P>
<P>
   He was born in New York and grew up in Greenwich Village. He
wrote for several New York newspapers, covered the city and worked
as a war correspondent, but in 1946 he began his syndicated sports
column for The New York Post. He later moved on to The
Journal-American. His rich prose made him one of the most
distinctive columnists of the century, but he may have been best
known for the occasional column, ``Nobody Asked Me, But. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Following are some lines over the years from ``Nobody Asked Me,
But. ... '':
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible for a girl to be homely with a gardenia
in her hair.'' ... ``I've never seen a circus clown I thought was
funny.'' ... ``I can't ever remember staying for the end of a movie
in which the actors wore togas.'' ... ``The trouble with the big
leagues is that there aren't enough big leaguers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Young (1918-1987)
</P>
<P>
   He revolutionized sports coverage when, as a beat reporter for
The Daily News assigned to the Brooklyn Dodgers in the early 1940s,
he began to go into the clubhouse after games to find out what the
players had seen and thought during the game. Before this,
reporters in the press box wrote solely what the reporters had seen
and thought during a game. In 1957, Young began writing his column,
``Young Ideas,'' after the team owner, Walter O'Malley, decided to
move the Dodgers to Los Angeles. In 1982 he moved on to The New
York Post. Writing with wit and a hard-hitting, direct style, he
was frequently in verbal battles with an assortment of sports
figures throughout his years as a columnist.
</P>
<P>
   The following is from a 1957 column:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is called an obit, which is short for obituary. An obit
tells of a person who has died, how he lived, and of those who live
after him. This is the obit on the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preliminary diagnosis indicates that the cause of death was an
acute case of greed, followed by severe political implications. ...
and, now, Walter O'Malley leaves Brooklyn a rich man and a despised
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murray (1919-1998)
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1990, began his career as a
reporter for The New Haven Register. He moved on to write for The
Los Angeles Examiner, Time magazine and Sports Illustrated, before
joining The Los Angeles Times as a sports columnist in 1961. He
soon became widely syndicated, and was highly praised for his
acerbic wit (and, not surprisingly, highly denounced by some of the
subjects of his wit). But, like all good writers, he could also
touch a sensitive chord.
</P>
<P>
   From a column in 1979, in which he tells of the loss from an
operation of his ``good eye'' _ the other eye had seen only a hazy
world _ and now admitted that he was virtually blind: ``I'd like to
see Sugar Ray Robinson or Muhammad Ali giving a recital, a ballet,
not a fight. Also, to be sure, I'd like to see a sky full of stars,
moonlight on the water, and yes, the tips of a royal flush peaking
out as I fan out a poker hand, and, yes, a straight two-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to think of it, I'm lucky. I saw all of those things. I
see them yet.''

ANNIE PLUMMER, 63, WHO GAVE DICTIONARIES TO CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Mich., Ill., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Annie Plummer, a housekeeper in Savannah, Ga., whose
single-minded campaign to distribute thousands of free dictionaries
to needy schoolchildren made her nationally known as ``The
Dictionary Lady,'' died Dec. 23 at her home. She was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Plummer died of lung cancer, said Edward L. Ellis Jr.,
pastor of the First Bryan Baptist Church &UR; , &LR;  of which she was a
member.
</P>
<P>
   One morning in 1992, Ms. Plummer was struck by the fact that
pupils were empty-handed while walking to the Garrison Elementary
School in Savannah near where she lived.
</P>
<P>
   No books.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to Ms. Plummer, who had been an outstanding student
in the late 1970s when she returned as an adult to complete her
education at the Richard Arnold Community School in Savannah, that
if these children were given a basic book like a dictionary, it
would help stimulate their interest in learning and could change
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Plummer started the project modestly when she used $50 of
her own money to buy 30 pocket dictionaries. Borrowing a slogan
from the United Negro College Fund, she painstakingly wrote in each
book &UR; : &LR;  ``A mind is a terrible thing to waste. I challenge you not
to waste yours.''
</P>
<P>
   She later told a reporter, ``I went to the corner and started
giving them out.''
</P>
<P>
   A local newscaster publicized Ms. Plummer's efforts and soon she
began to receive donations. To raise more money for the project,
Ms. Plummer began selling Dictionary Lady T-shirts for $10 each and
helped organize a Dictionary Walkathon. Churches and community
organizations chipped in to buy and distribute still more
dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   A shrewd businesswoman, Ms. Plummer persuaded one dictionary
publisher to sell her a number of copies of the $5.95 book for just
65 cents each.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Ms. Plummer's stated aim was to provide every
third-grade student in Savannah and surrounding Chatham County _
about 4,000 in all _ with a free dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   She told a reporter that by 1996 her informal organization had
not only met that goal but had distributed more than 17,000 copies
of a paperback dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the idea spread across the country. Ms. Plummer was
featured in articles in Southern Living and People magazines and
was visited and praised by well-known people like Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Weiner, a former mayor of Savannah, said of Ms. Plummer:
``Here's a lady who didn't wait for government to do the job. Good
for her!''
</P>
<P>
   To date, 32,800 books have been distributed, and now there are
at least six ``Dictionary Ladies'' heading similar drives in
communities around the country, including Detroit, Chicago and San
Diego. The program's Web site is:
http://savannahnow.com/community/dictionarylady/
</P>
<P>
   The Dictionary Lady Foundation, which was incorporated in
Savannah in 1997, now provides guidance to branch organizations.
``We are hoping to get helpers in every town and school district
throughout the world,'' said Barbara Dorsey, Ms. Plummer's
daughter, who said she plans to continue her mother's work.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Oneta Plummer was born on Oct. 17, 1936, in Sylvania, Ga.,
the fifth of 12 children of a truck driver and a housekeeper. She
was raised in Savannah and dropped out of school in the ninth grade
when she became a mother.
</P>
<P>
   As a single parent seeking to provide for herself and her
daughter, Ms. Plummer went to work as a housekeeper. She soon
became involved in neighborhood campaigns like getting a traffic
light installed at a busy intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Ms. Plummer returned to school, and she received her
diploma in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her daughter, who lives in Savannah, Ms. Plummer
is survived by a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Plummer was passionate about black history. In honor of her
vigorous lobbying, a bill to foster the teaching of black history
at state schools now before the Georgia House of Representatives
has been named ``HB 1492 _ Annie Plummer Act.''

OUTDOORS: A MEMORABLE TRAIL, AND A TALE TO MATCH 
</HEADLINE>

 By PETE BODO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, N.Y. _ By the time we crested the grassy knoll and
started down the logging road, Bianca, an 8-year-old German
shorthair retriever, looked thoroughly disgusted. She waited
patiently on the trail, ready to dive into the brush and search for
that singular and elusive game bird, woodcock. Her knitted brows
and tensed legs conveyed the question: What on earth is taking you
so long?
</P>
<P>
   A satisfying answer to that question has never been rendered.
Still, it was not a day for doing anything hastily. The air was
simultaneously crisp and warm, and so still that the yellow leaves,
no longer able to cling to the boughs of the maple tree, fell as
slowly as snow. It was that perfect, unforgettable day that comes
along every now and then, even on the brink of a new century.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day filled with wonder and color, in which intimations
of mortality and acute well-being were equally mixed. And I had the
pleasure of sharing it with one of the very few great woodsmen and
hunters I know, Paul de Nemeskeri-Kiss, who had the grace to give
his dog a more user-friendly name than his own.
</P>
<P>
   Paul is 78 now, and in dog years I suppose Bianca is no spring
chicken, either. In fact, these days Paul can keep Bianca in
hunting form during the off-season only with the help of his wife,
Sophie. The three of them go to a park daily near their home in the
Riverdale section of New York City. Paul and Sophie take up
stations on park benches a few hundred yards apart, and Bianca runs
between them, collecting a tiny biscuit each time.
</P>
<P>
   But it's different when Paul pulls on his wool tweed hunting
knickers, and knots the tie that he still insists on wearing in
this age of Thinsulate, Gore-Tex and casual Fridays. Then the years
fall away from Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the bird, Bianca,'' Paul called out. ``Where's the bird?''
</P>
<P>
   Bianca's radio collar began to beep steadily, signaling that she
was on point. Using our shotguns like kayak paddles, we pushed
through the thicket of porcelain berry and wild rose that created
perfect woodcock cover.
</P>
<P>
   The woodcock feeds exclusively on earthworms, digging them out
with a long, curved beak. The mottled brown bird blends perfectly
with the habitat in which it forages _ moist, damp bottom land
carpeted with twigs and leaves and free of grass. The woodcock
loves cover as dense and impenetrable as a ball of twine.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike grouse or pheasant, woodcock won't flush, or fly off to
avoid danger, until the very last moment. They hold tight, trusting
their fate to the density of the cover, and their perfect
camouflage. On the wing, the birds fly like bottle rockets. So even
when you can swing a gun in all the thick scrub, your chances of
actually killing the bird are slim.
</P>
<P>
   Paul and I approached Bianca, who was so torn between pointing
the bird (her job) and jumping on it (her desire) that she was
trembling. The woodcock burst into the air, right in front of my
nose, and I almost fell over as I twisted, turned, got the gun up
in plenty of time to realize I had no shot. Bianca gave me a look
of admonition. Paul merely chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's stop here for a little rest,'' Paul said, shortly before
noon. We sat down on the stone wall of a long-abandoned farmstead.
Paul pushed back his long, silver hair and carefully unfolded a
paper napkin that contained a partly smoked cigarette. His watery
blue eyes twinkled as he smoked, and in his thick Hungarian accent
relived days of splendor and majesty in the great woods, the
Carpathian mountains of his native land.
</P>
<P>
   Once, as a youth, he saw an enormous wolf in a high meadow.
Judging the distance as 300 yards, he compensated for the bullet
drop by holding his sights on a flower about a foot above the back
of the wolf. His subsequent shot missed the wolf but blew apart the
flower. Paul was so excited that he had misjudged the distance by
half. As hunting stories go, it was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   We continued our hunt. We had slowed down some, but Paul's
exhortations were undiminished: ``Bianca! Where's the bird? ... Go
in there Bianca, you haven't been there yet .... Get the bird ....
Oh, Bianca, come on, there _ over there.''
</P>
<P>
   We put up half a dozen woodcock, and missed every blessed one. I
finally managed to shoot a pheasant, a plump, stocked bird that had
none of the guile of a wild woodcock. But Bianca didn't mind that
at all. She had been working very hard for us without much
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   We emerged into a rolling meadow, not far from where we left the
car. Bianca nosed around the edge of the field. ``She's not really
tired, she can keep going,'' Paul said. ``But me, I think I've had
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Bianca plunged into a patch of brush along the dirt
road, and went to point. ``Bianca,'' Paul called out. ``What are
you expecting to find there? There's no bird. There's no bird in
there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   We emptied our guns. The serene afternoon light was diminishing.
Reluctantly, Bianca came off point and a curious stillness
descended on our perfect day.

EDITORIAL: RUSSIA'S FLAWED REFORMER  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 2:
</P>
<P>
   In suddenly resigning as Russian president on Friday, Boris
Yeltsin showed once again why he will be remembered as a
practitioner of the unexpected political stratagem. Like so many of
Yeltsin's gambits over the years, the move upended expectations and
scrambled Russian politics. It also came with a promise of immunity
from prosecution for Yeltsin for any misdeeds of his government.
That will likely roil the coming presidential campaign, a fitting
legacy for a courageous but disappointingly erratic man who guided
Russia through the first years of a turbulent, still unfinished
journey from tyranny to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's action immediately lifted the presidential prospects
of the politician he hopes will succeed him, Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin. Under the Russian Constitution, Putin became acting
president when Yeltsin stepped aside, and the date for new
elections was advanced from June to March. That gives Putin the
powerful advantage of campaigning as an incumbent at a time when
his popularity is surging because of the Russian military offensive
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, for one last time, seemed to be betting that an
impulsive, bold move would turn Russia toward a more promising
future. As with earlier Yeltsin surprises, a positive outcome is
far from assured. For one thing, the political terrain could shift
abruptly even by March if Russians became disillusioned with the
attack on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's political instincts also remain unclear. He is a former
KGB officer and head of Russia's domestic intelligence agency. As
prime minister, he has prosecuted a brutal assault on Chechnya. Yet
he has encouraged economic reform, has talked of the need to
improve relations with the West and is allied with some of Russia's
most progressive politicians.
</P>
<P>
   After Yeltsin's uneven leadership, Russia could use a steady,
reform-minded president who knows how to run an efficient
government. Yeltsin was the first freely elected leader of Russia.
His great strengths were an iron will and a daring vision for
remaking Russia into a free-market democracy. He was fearless in
his drive to rid Russia of Communism, and his stand against an
attempted coup in 1991 kept reform alive. Later that year he
engineered the end of Communist rule in Moscow and the collapse of
the Soviet empire. History will honor him for these acts.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin proved indifferent at governing. Economic reform was
stunted by corruption, his government failed to collect taxes, and
his penchant for sacking prime ministers often left the Kremlin in
disarray. Opposition in the parliament made governing difficult,
but Yeltsin lacked the discipline to manage a complex government.
</P>
<P>
   Though he broadly pursued closer ties with the West, and played
a helpful role in ending the war in Kosovo last year, Yeltsin could
be inconsistent in dealing with foreign issues. His preoccupation
with Chechnya wounded Russia at home and abroad. Weakened by heart
problems and respiratory ailments, he was in recent years a shell
of the leader he had been in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians will doubtless question the sincerity of the
apology Yeltsin offered on Friday for the mistakes he made and the
economic hardships that so many of his countrymen have endured.
More information will be needed before anyone can judge whether the
decision to spare Yeltsin from possible prosecution was warranted
or wise. However, Russians ought not to forget the singular
achievement of Boris Yeltsin. For all his maddening weaknesses, he
led his nation toward democracy after 1,000 years of tyranny.

BANKING MATTERS DRAW FEW CLIENTS ON SATURDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, WVa.)  (js) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Show me my money.
</P>
<P>
   That's what a number of banks and brokerage houses across the
country had feared hearing from crowds of itchy-palmed clients on
the first morning of the year 2000. To show customers that their
money had not vaporized overnight, a few offices stayed open all
night, and many others opened early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, few worrywarts to reassure and fewer
panicked withdrawals of cash, according to representatives of the
banks and brokerage houses that opened. In more than a few lonely
branch offices, employees wondered why they had gotten up early and
come to work, only to look at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we going to keep occupied today with our entire staff
in here?'' asked Susan Langdon, manager of the Lincoln Center
branch of Charles Schwab in Manhattan. The discount brokerage firm
opened 300 of its 340 branches across the country Saturday, and the
customer traffic was light, according to Greg Gable, a spokesman
for Charles Schwab in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lincoln Center branch, which opened at 9 a.m. sharp, the
front door had been unlocked for 45 minutes before the first
customer of the new millennium walked in to find Mrs. Langdon and
six other investment advisers eager to calm his nerves. He did not
want to be calmed. He wanted to set up an account to buy high-tech
stocks on line.
</P>
<P>
   So it went across much of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cleveland area, despite an advertising campaign touting
its New Year's Day hours _ along with a $25 cash bonus to new
checking account customers and half-point discount on installment
loans _ Metropolitan Bank &AMP; Trust had only one customer waiting at
its branch in Mayfield Heights when it opened at 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Bader, dressed in a short coat with a fur collar,
stopped at the bank to see if her Social Security check had cleared
early, not to verify that her savings account was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no doubts,'' she said about the bank's year 2000
readiness. ``I was just worried about my Social Security check.''
</P>
<P>
   In West Virginia, where 10 branches of the City National Bank
were open all night, customer volume was light and there were no
significant withdrawals of cash, according to Matt Call, executive
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of this is to discourage people from taking
out their money,'' said Call, noting that the plan seemed to have
worked better than anticipated.

WINNING BID TO DEVELOP 9 ACRES NEAR U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A development group led by the Fisher real estate
family has won the bidding for one of the most sought after prizes
in New York real estate: nine acres of waterfront land south of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Fisher group, which includes the developer Sheldon Solow and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, would pay Consolidated Edison up to
about $600 million for the site, although the exact sum depends on
the cost of demolishing the sprawling Waterside Steam Plant, which
sits on part of the property, and the number and size of the
apartment buildings and office towers the city allows to be built
along the East River.
</P>
<P>
   The property consists of four parcels on First Avenue, between
35th and 41st Streets. The developer, like some 20 other bidders
for the land, is hoping to build up to 5 million square feet of
residential and commercial buildings, bordered by an esplanade
along the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only substantial piece of land left in Midtown,''
said Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairman of Insignia/ESG, a real estate
company. ``For both Sheldon and the Fishers, this is their moment
to make a huge statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fisher group overcame an unexpected, last-minute offer from
the second-place finisher, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman of
Boston Properties, who was joined by the developers Leonard Litwin
and Donald Zucker. But after some intense negotiating last Tuesday
afternoon, the Fishers were able to hang on to the prize.
</P>
<P>
   According to the losing bidders and other real estate
executives, the Fisher team is expected to begin formal contract
negotiations with Con Ed Monday, a process that could go on for
weeks. Con Ed is not expected to announce a deal until the
agreement is presented to the company's directors later this month.
Con Ed is also seeking approval from the Public Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Robert P. Stelben, the treasurer and executive vice president of
Con Ed who oversaw the 14-month auction of the property, declined
on Saturday to discuss the sale other than to say: ``When we have a
winner, we'll announce it. But we don't have a winner.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even after a contract is signed, it may be more than three years
before the developer can begin building on the site. Under an
agreement with the state commission, Con Ed must expand the
generating capacity of its steam plant on 14th Street to offset the
loss of Waterside, which could take three years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the developer must go through the city's
lengthy and often contentious environmental and land use review
process. A coalition of local apartment owners and civic groups has
already said that it wants to see a master plan for the entire nine
acres.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kahan, a leader of the coalition, said the group does
not want a densely packed development whose tall towers would loom
over the United Nations or the surrounding neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding for the property drew so many buyers and was
especially fierce because the land represented the last large tract
available in Manhattan. Its waterfront location made it ideally
suited for residential development and, with corporate tenants
running out of space, it may make a good office site as well.

EDITORIAL: THE POWER OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 2:
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, sales over the Internet do not look impressive,
accounting for between 0.3 percent and 3 percent of retail sales.
But a survey released last week by the Boston Consulting Group and
Shop.org, the trade association of online retailers, shows that
e-commerce during the holiday season has quadrupled since last
year, the first Christmas season for which Internet sales were
important. E-commerce looks poised to transform entire sectors of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sales have soared in apparel, books, music, specialty
foods, electronics, financial services and travel. The rapid growth
has created headaches. It turns out that designing a spiffy Web
site for customers to click and order from is a lot easier than
coordinating the mundane tasks of stocking popular items, pulling
them off the shelves and shipping them on time to meet customer
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its small size, electronic commerce is already reshaping
markets. Take term life insurance. Although few sales are completed
over the Internet, premiums plummeted over the past two years, says
Professor Austan Goolsbee of the University of Chicago, as
customers searched the Web for the best prices. Comparison shopping
is one of the key ways in which the Internet is shifting market
power from producers and distributors to ordinary consumers.
Customers are also finding novel uses of the Web. Many are selling
unwanted holiday gifts on eBay, the large online auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Goolsbee makes a more subtle point about the impact of
e-commerce. Brokers _ by which he means people in any industry who
gather small pieces of information and sell services to consumers _
are vulnerable. Travel agents, stockbrokers, insurance agents and
even car dealers fit this category. The Internet can replace
brokers because it provides a fast, low-cost substitute way to sort
information.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet could also do for retailing and information
services what the cable industry has done for television _ provide
niche services. The bricks-and-mortar way of doing business imposes
huge distribution costs that make it unprofitable for sellers to
cater to small groups. By directly connecting consumers and
producers, the Internet drastically cuts distribution costs and
makes it potentially profitable to sell specialty music recordings
and other such items, especially to higher-income families.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Internet sales will turn out to be a fad.
But markets powerfully drive businesses toward low-cost, convenient
practices. There will be problems along the way, but the Internet
will likely change the way America does business far beyond the
habits of holiday shoppers.

PLAN TO ADD DIESEL BUSES IS CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A plan by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
to put hundreds of new diesel-powered buses on New York City
streets in the next five years is drawing determined resistance
from environmentalists and legislators, who say it will increase
smog and health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Those critics note that Los Angeles, Cleveland and other major
cities have barred purchases of diesel buses and have switched to
models that use cleaner-burning compressed natural gas. But the
MTA's $17.5 billion capital plan, announced in September, would put
greater emphasis on speed and capacity by adding faster and larger
buses using diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And while the authority does plan to continue buying some
natural gas buses, it is focusing its antipollution efforts on an
experimental hybrid engine that runs on both diesel and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't put our heads in the sand on this issue,'' said
Lawrence G. Reuter, the president of New York City Transit, the MTA
subsidiary responsible for subways and buses.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Wednesday, Reuter said the authority was
taking a bold step forward in the technology of mass
transportation. Within eight years, he said, it hopes to begin
converting the hybrid buses to use fuel cells, a technology that
powers buses entirely with rechargeable electric batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, most of the criticism of the capital spending
proposal had focused on whether the authority was thinking big
enough about new construction projects like the Second Avenue
subway. But with the spending plan entering serious negotiations in
Albany, where it must be approved by the Legislature and Gov.
George E. Pataki, attention has shifted to the proposal to buy
1,056 new buses. The authority says more than 70 percent of them
will be powered at least in part by diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say the MTA should move more rapidly to reduce
diesel emissions, which have been linked to asthma and other
respiratory illnesses. In New York City, studies have shown the
asthma rate to be three times the national average. Natural gas
provides the only proven low-pollution alternative to diesel, the
critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that converting the fleet to natural gas is a big,
tough task, but we are hopeful that the MTA will find a way to do
it,'' said Richard Kassel, a senior lawyer for the Natural
Resources Defense Council. Kassel met with senior transit officials
last week to make the case for natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation authority may face a more powerful opponent
in Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, who is one of four members
of a state panel that oversees the agency. The authority needs the
panel's unanimous approval to put the five-year plan in place.
Other members include representatives of the Senate, Pataki and
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, who represents Manhattan's Lower East Side, has reserved
his strongest objections for the failure to plan on an extension of
the Second Avenue subway to Lower Manhattan. But he has also
sharply criticized the authority's plan to buy diesel buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't make sense,'' Silver said on Wednesday, adding
that he would use his veto power if the authority did not reduce
its reliance on diesel. ``Buying dirty buses is counterproductive
to the overall goal of improving air quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTA plan would spend $800 million on the 1,056 new buses,
including 300 standard-size 44-seat buses. Although the authority
has said all the new standard-size buses will be fuel efficient, it
said that how many would be diesel-electric hybrids and how many
would use natural gas had not been decided.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the new buses _ 356 in all _ would be express
coaches serving commuters to Manhattan. Those models, similar in
design to long-distance buses, would use standard diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
   And along congested, heavily used routes, the authority wants to
add 400 ``articulated'' buses _ oversize vehicles that bend in the
middle vaguely like an accordion. They are 50 percent larger than
standard buses and use diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, with these purchases and with the retirement of older
buses, the current fleet of 4,300 will have been reduced to 3,900
buses, but it will include faster and bigger ones that can carry
more passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher P. Boylan, the authority's deputy executive
director, said diesel engines were the only proven technology
available to power the new express coaches and articulated buses.
Even so, Boylan said, the faster and bigger buses will reduce
pollution, both because newer diesel engines will emit less
pollution and because bigger and faster buses will increase the
efficiency of the transit system.
</P>
<P>
   By carrying more riders greater distances, he said, more people
will be encouraged to ride buses, which will in turn reduce traffic
and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for riders and environmental groups contend that
the health risks of diesel emissions outweigh the gains in
efficiency. A series of medical studies across the country by such
groups as the California Scientific Review Panel and the American
Journal of Public Health have established a direct link between
diesel emissions and respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta and others have documented a sharp rise in asthma and
other respiratory diseases in New York City and other urban areas.
Recent studies by New York state's Department of Environmental
Conservation have shown particularly high levels of soot from
diesel exhaust in Midtown Manhattan and other congested city
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chief cause of such pollution is diesel truck
traffic, critics of the transportation authority argue that it
should lead the way in reducing air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign,
an advocacy group for riders, said passengers would be served just
as effectively by more standard-size natural gas buses on the same
routes where the MTA plans to use the larger articulated models.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the authority's assertion that the express coaches
must use diesel, other critics note that New Jersey Transit uses 50
express models, similar to the ones sought by the authority but
slightly smaller, that run on compressed natural gas. They are made
in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA does plan to buy some natural gas models for its
standard buses, but the authority appears to be betting heavily on
the hybrid electric-diesel engine, which is being developed in a
consortium with Lockheed Martin Corp. The system is powered by a
small diesel engine that constantly charges an electric generator,
producing levels of air pollution that Boylan said were as low as
or lower than compressed natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   After experimenting with 10 of the hybrid electric vehicles for
a year, the authority made its first major commitment to the
technology in December when it ordered 125 of them, even without
the financing sought in its five-year plan. Reuter of New York City
Transit said the hybrid buses had been purchased without
competitive bidding because only one company manufactures them.
</P>
<P>
   The company, the Control Systems division of Lockheed Martin,
based in Johnson City, N.Y., has developed the engine over 10
years, with a combination of $10.4 million in grants and
low-interest loans from the New York Power Authority and the
state's Energy Research and Development Authority. The hybrid
engines are installed in buses produced by two other New York
companies, Orion Bus Industries of Oriskany and Nova Bus of
Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   Boylan said the authority was also concerned about high costs
associated with compressed natural gas. The city's bus depots must
be renovated to handle the gas under extremely high pressure, he
said, and the natural gas buses in the fleet break down more
frequently than the diesel buses.
</P>
<P>
   The hybrid buses would not require any expensive changes to the
depots and could be deployed more quickly at a time when ridership
is increasing rapidly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the MTA's critics say the authority is making a major
commitment to a technology that remains experimental, while
neglecting to upgrade its depots to prepare for one that is already
widely available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MTA already has a track record of delay and evasion in
moving into a compressed natural gas technology that has been
proven around the country,'' Russianoff said. He said the hybrid
buses ``simply may not work, and we will find ourselves five years
later incurring the expense of a technology they don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Russianoff and other advocates of buses using compressed natural
gas say the authority should move much more aggressively in
renovating the depots to handle the high-pressure fueling systems
required.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 22 depots, only one has been equipped to serve the
authority's 89 natural gas buses.
</P>
<P>
   Those buses were sidelined for most of December, MTA officials
said, after a series of small explosions forced that depot, in
Sunset Park, Brooklyn, to shut down in late November. Three transit
workers were injured and hospitalized, and two of them may have
suffered permanent hearing loss, Reuter said. The depot reopened on
Dec. 25.

AMERICA'S CUP CHALLENGER SERIES IS HEATING UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ With a new year and a new America's Cup
challenger round looming, Paul Cayard gazed out over the Viaduct
Basin.
</P>
<P>
   In the foreground were 60 huge spectator yachts that had chosen
central Auckland's new marina for their millennium celebration. In
the background were the America's Cup boat sheds, temporary homes
to the six challenger syndicates and to Team New Zealand, the Cup
holder, which is busily biding time until February, when the
America's Cup finals begin.
</P>
<P>
   The challengers must first sort themselves out, and they were to
restart that process in the Louis Vuitton Cup semifinals, which
begin Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome,'' said Cayard, the skipper of America One, surveying
the scene. ``There has been no other venue like this in the
America's Cup. Newport used to be like this a bit. Look at this
display of wealth here in front of us. That in itself is a show,
and it's nice that it's mixed in with the Cup. If you're a sailing
enthusiast, this obviously is the mecca of the sport for the next
couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   How long the gifted, driven Cayard and his syndicate get to
enjoy the atmosphere will be determined in the next two weeks. The
remaining challengers are America One, America True and Stars &AMP;
Stripes, all from the United States; Prada Challenge from Italy;
Nippon Challenge from Japan; and, most surprising, Le Defi Francais
from France, which managed to nudge past the New York Yacht Club's
Young America in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Now the scoreboard is set back to zero, and each of the six
semifinalists will race twice against the others over a 10-day
period that could extend beyond that if the mercurial Auckland
weather does not cooperate. The top two teams will advance to the
Vuitton final that will produce Team New Zealand's opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are at least five of the competitors, if not all
six, that can win any given day given a few breaks,'' Cayard said,
``and there are plenty of opportunities for breaks out here. The
wind is real fickle and shifty. It's a tough racecourse, so you
can't take anything for granted. It's not like if you have a little
speed edge you are going to win for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this is the riskiest part of the whole event,'' he
said of the six-team semifinals. ``In light of the conditions, I
would have much preferred a situation where we were racing with
only four semifinalists and having a best-of-seven against just one
guy. I think that would give the stronger teams more likelihood of
prevailing. Here you could get caught out a couple of times, and
that could make all the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The favorites are the well-funded, two-boat campaigns of Prada,
Nippon and America One. But America True, the coed team headed by
Dawn Riley, has spent the last two and a half months defying
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we don't feel surprised, because we always rated
ourselves higher than other people rated ourselves,'' said America
True's skipper, John Cutler, whose team was one of the first to set
up shop in Auckland. ``The preparation in our program was done at
such a higher level than what people thought it was. It does feel
good to prove everybody wrong. But now it's different. Everything
we've done before doesn't count anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the first three rounds were hardly lacking in drama, with
boats sustaining serious damage in the sometimes punishing
conditions, they were atypically low on rhetoric. That changed last
week with Nippon's decision to practice with Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   America True was only the latest challenger to decline the
invitation to spar with the Kiwis, but Nippon's hard-charging
Australian skipper, Peter Gilmour, lobbied aggressively for the
opportunity. His competitors, particularly Stars &AMP; Stripes'
on-shore head, Dennis Conner, responded with some sharp words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around 20 years, and I can tell you we didn't sail
against the potential challengers in 1974 or in 1980, and we didn't
sail against them in 1983 or 1995,'' said Conner, who has won the
Cup three times as a skipper. ``It's surprising. You have to ask
yourself what's in this for Peter. Maybe he doesn't think he's
going to the America's Cup, and he wanted to get a picture of the
Japanese boat sailing against Team New Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   Conner, who was sitting at the same table with the other
skippers at a news conference, then turned to Gilmour and said,
``Maybe Peter, if you're steering the New Zealand boat on the
defense in 2003, maybe we'll understand.''
</P>
<P>
   As the audience began to ``ooh'' like a boxing crowd after a
well-landed punch, Conner grinned and said, ``Oops, I shouldn't
have said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour said: ``This is how a lot of serious prejudices and
misunderstandings build up in different cultures. New Zealand is a
very competitive and great sporting team and should be respected as
such. They don't need to be treated as pariahs.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the practice session was diluted because
Gilmour chose to race in the boat he used in the third round but
will not use, surprisingly, in the semifinals. The New Zealanders
also practiced with what is considered their slower boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm sure we helped them,'' Gilmour said. ``But I believe
we helped ourselves more.''
</P>
<P>
   Nippon is not the only team to abandon its newer boat for the
semifinals. Prada is also switching from ITA 48, the boat it used
in the last round robin, back to ITA 45, with which it dominated
the first two rounds. Cayard and America One will use their new
boat _ USA 61 _ which has yet to see action here.

COMMENTARY: A PERSPECTIVE AS TIME TICKS ONWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT KISCO, N.Y. _ Well, we survived.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember back to the 1900s, it was touch and go. Or so it
seemed. People feared something called Y2K. Terrorists abounded.
Others thought time would expire with a bang.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was a silent majority secretly hoping for a kind of
inverse Y2K, a time-as-panacea where rather than all life's
conveniences going haywire, all of life's little annoyances, from
telemarketers to catalog profusion, would mysteriously clear up. It
would be, as the joke goes, like playing country and western music
backward: You'd get out of jail. Your dog would come back to life.
Your wife would return. Your pickup would run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   We just can't seem to let the turning of the clock alone. Gerald
Celente, the editor of Trends Journal in Rhinebeck, said it was
part of what he called the ``Narcissistic '90s'' where everything
had to be a big statement, like ``big cars, big houses and big
mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   He said this last week while widely promoting his ``Top 10
Trends of the 21st Century,'' which included a new millennium
religion, an Internet-based political revolution and other Big
Ideas. Celente hurriedly excused himself, saying, ``I've got MSNBC,
Fox, CNN, a lot of things.'' But he first imparted this cautionary
note: ``By nature, the future is foreseeably unforeseeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could argue? Or even understand?
</P>
<P>
   Some perspective was found in a most unlikely place. At a
day-care center for the elderly in Mount Kisco called My Second
Home, there were people like Hilda Hiller, 83, who have spent a lot
of time watching time tick by.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go year by year,'' Ms. Hiller said. ``Day by day. It sneaks
up on you. You plan for one season and then the next, and they roll
into each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hiller, wearing a red sweatshirt that said ``Am I Cool or
What?'' with a picture of a snowman in sunglasses, acknowledges
that it will be difficult to get her head around living in another
century. ``I've been with one so long, it's hard to think about
being in a different one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal, says Eleanor Sponheimer, who is 95 and less than
overwhelmed by the big moment. ``It happens all the time,'' she
said. ``Time is going. Time changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sponheimer, it should be pointed out, is not some naysayer.
She has seized a few opportunities in her time, graduating from
college at age 66, getting a master's degree in English at 72 and
then teaching for a few years in Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I always look forward to things,'' Ms. Sponheimer
said. ``I think that's human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   But it can be a struggle, especially now with the whole world
seemingly bent on hurtling forward. At the elderly center, you can
feel the tug between the hazy future and the memory of all that has
gone before.
</P>
<P>
   Angela La Grassa embodies it.
</P>
<P>
   A spirited woman of 82, her eye-catching purple dress and
matching shoes are a statement. At the center's Millennium Lunch on
Thursday, her friends want her to sing a favorite song. But she
isn't in the mood. Her husband died several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   She pulls a picture from her pocketbook of her wedding in 1937.
They were a stunning couple, their faces pressed close together.
She was a seamstress in the garment district; he was a tailor. And
they danced. ``You heard of the Roseland?'' she asked. ``That was
our second home.''
</P>
<P>
   She wants to be happy so she lets her friends talk her into
making the moment special. She stands and she sings perfectly in
Italian, her foot tapping and her eyes growing brighter. The song
is by her father, who was a musician, and when she finishes, she
sings it in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darling, you are my first love, you are my love forever,'' she
sings. ``You are mine forever, from now till eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. La Grassa sits down to applause and the celebration of the
future continues.
</P>
<P>
   At one point they talk about what they would put in a time
capsule. A Bible. An encyclopedia. A Hopalong Cassidy episode,
someone says. A clock, another suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Why a clock?
</P>
<P>
   ``To show that time goes on,'' said Rita Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   To which a weak voice somewhere in the room added: ``With or
without us.''
</P>

&HT;     Y2K WATCHERS FIND FEW PROBLEMS, SHIFT FOCUS TO MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: updates throughout)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the world glided smoothly into the new century,
the United States reported Saturday only a smattering of minor Y2K
glitches, but officials cautioned that problems could still crop
up, especially starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, chief of the White House's Y2K command center,
said Monday will be a crucial milestone because it will be the
first day of normal business operations following the long holiday
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he offered generally upbeat news about the nation's
progress. ``We have not been able to find anything of great
significance to report,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the nation's major sectors from airlines to electric
power grids to telecommunications continued working without
incident on the first day of the new century, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon reported Saturday that a satellite intelligence
defense system had failed shortly after 7 p.m. EST Friday when the
clock in that system turned past midnight Greenwich Mean Time.
</P>
<P>
   John Hamre, Deputy Defense Secretary, said that a backup system
is currently in place and that the problem was with a ground-based
computer used to process information from the satellite. He said it
was shutdown for a little more than two hours but declined to
identify its mission or where the ground-based satellite was
located.
</P>
<P>
   Other reported Y2K glitches were quickly fixed. Koskinen said an
Amtrak computer system used to track trains went down temporarily
early Saturday but that train officials switched to a manual system
and then fixed the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Naval Observatory, which has a master clock in
Washington that serves as the nation's official source of time,
reported the date as Jan. 1, 19100 during the earliest hours of the
new year on its Internet site. The glitch has since been corrected
and was only on that Web site. It was not a problem in the master
clock, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said federal government agencies and private industry would
continue testing their systems and report any glitches, whether
Y2K-related or not. He said checks of federal government buildings
showed temporary problems with alarm systems at U.S. facilities in
Boston, Kansas City and Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Aviation Administration system used to notify pilots
about such things as weather via e-mail shut down Saturday, but
Koskinen said it was unclear whether the problem was Y2K-related. A
backup pilot notification system was put in place, and air traffic
safety was not affected, he added.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, the Social Security Administration,
headquartered in Baltimore, switched to backup generators before
the millenium rollover. The agency switched its systems back to
Baltimore's main power grid at 6 a.m. EST Saturday without
incident. Koskinen said all of Social Security's computers in
Baltimore and at its field offices across the country are working
normally.
</P>
<P>
   Some other federal agencies, also as a precaution, temporarily
shut down their Internet Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   He said the federal Y2K web site recorded 3 million hits on
Friday, compared to 700,000 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Internet functions were unaffected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the energy front, eight of the more than 3,200 utilities in
the nation reported Y2K problems with their clocks used to
synchronize operations. Seven of the 103 nuclear power plants
reported `minor Y2K related issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the nuclear or non-nuclear plants experienced any
operational problem as a result, according to Koskinen.
</P>
<P>
   In transportation, there were small glitches, he said, all of
them minor.
</P>
<P>
   The National Retail Federation reported retailers were
functioning normally Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Hopka, a Y2K spokeswoman for the retailers, said a 1997
survey showed that if big retailers had done nothing to prepare for
Y2K, `they wouldn't have opened this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Koskinen and other top government officials
gave upbeat reports for the second day in a row as the new year
swept across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, countries such as China, Russia and Ukraine, which
preceded the United States into the new year, rolled into Jan. 1
without problems in their nuclear power plants and other key
systems that American officials had feared might shut down as a
result of a Y2K computer glitch. More significantly, those systems
continued operating in those countries on their second day of the
New Year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reported Y2K problem overseas occurred when Japan's
Shika Nuclear Power Station about 170 miles northwest of Tokyo lost
its radiation alarm system shortly after midnight there. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson described it as a backup system and said
it did not affect plant safety.
</P>
<P>
   The United States passed its first Y2K tests at 7 p.m. EST
Friday, when computers that control airline traffic, about a third
of the nation's power grid and military operations appeared to roll
over into the new year without incident. The
</P>
<P>
   computers are based on Greenwich Mean Time, which is five hours
ahead of the Eastern Standard Time zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's airspace system is up and running safely,''
Federal Aviation Administration chief Jane Garvey said Friday
night. She flew on a jet from Washington, D.C., to Dallas when air
traffic computers passed midnight GMT.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, who had predicted an easy transition into the new
year, said the fact that it happened should not lead to anyone to
``underestimate the nature of the problem that was originally
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the effort not been made, had the money not been spent, we
would be in a very different situation than we find ourselves in
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department estimates that some $100 billion was
spent in the United States over the past five years to fix the Y2K
problem _ which would occur if computers interpreted the digits 00
as 1900 rather than 2000. Worldwide is it estimated that
governments and private industry spent close to $400 billion fixing
</P>
<P>
   their computers.

and was only on that Web site. It was not a problem in the master
clock, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said federal government agencies and private industry would
continue testing their systems and report any glitches, whether
Y2K-related or not. He said checks of federal government buildings
showed temporary problems with alarm systems at U.S. facilities in
Boston, Kansas City and Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Aviation Administration system used to notify pilots
about such things as weather via e-mail shut down Saturday, but
Koskinen said it was unclear whether the problem was Y2K-related. A
backup pilot notification system was put in place, and air traffic
safety was not affected, he added.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, the Social Security Administration,
headquartered in Baltimore, switched to backup generators before
the millenium rollover. The agency switched its systems back to
Baltimore's main power grid at 6 a.m. EST Saturday without
incident. Koskinen said all of Social Security's computers in
Baltimore and at its field offices across the country are working
normally.
</P>
<P>
   Some other federal agencies, also as a precaution, temporarily
shut down their Internet Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   He said the federal Y2K web site recorded 3 million hits on
Friday, compared to 700,000 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Internet functions were unaffected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the energy front, eight of the more than 3,200 utilities in
the nation reported Y2K problems with their clocks used to
synchronize operations. Seven of the 103 nuclear power plants
reported `minor Y2K related issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the nuclear or non-nuclear plants experienced any
operational problem as a result, according to Koskinen.
</P>
<P>
   In transportation, there were small glitches, he said, all of
them minor.
</P>
<P>
   The National Retail Federation reported retailers were
functioning normally Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Hopka, a Y2K spokeswoman for the retailers, said a 1997
survey showed that if big retailers had done nothing to prepare for
Y2K, `they wouldn't have opened this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Koskinen and other top government officials
gave upbeat reports for the second day in a row as the new year
swept across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, countries such as China, Russia and Ukraine, which
preceded the United States into the new year, rolled into Jan. 1
without problems in their nuclear power plants and other key
systems that American officials had feared might shut down as a
result of a Y2K computer glitch. More significantly, those systems
continued operating in those countries on their second day of the
New Year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reported Y2K problem overseas occurred when Japan's
Shika Nuclear Power Station about 170 miles northwest of Tokyo lost
its radiation alarm system shortly after midnight there. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson described it as a backup system and said
it did not affect plant safety.
</P>
<P>
   The United States passed its first Y2K tests at 7 p.m. EST
Friday, when computers that control airline traffic, about a third
of the nation's power grid and military operations appeared to roll
over into the new year without incident. The
</P>
<P>
   computers are based on Greenwich Mean Time, which is five hours
ahead of the Eastern Standard Time zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's airspace system is up and running safely,''
Federal Aviation Administration chief Jane Garvey said Friday
night. She flew on a jet from Washington, D.C., to Dallas when air
traffic computers passed midnight GMT.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, who had predicted an easy transition into the new
year, said the fact that it happened should not lead to anyone to
``underestimate the nature of the problem that was originally
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the effort not been made, had the money not been spent, we
would be in a very different situation than we find ourselves in
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department estimates that some $100 billion was
spent in the United States over the past five years to fix the Y2K
problem _ which would occur if computers interpreted the digits 00
as 1900 rather than 2000. Worldwide is it estimated that
governments and private industry spent close to $400 billion fixing
</P>
<P>
   their computers.

INVESTMENT SEEMS TO HAVE PAID OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, was Y2K the most overhyped phenomenon in 2,000 years?
</P>
<P>
   Or did the diligence of a world preparing as if for war stave
off the real danger of a cascading technological disaster?
</P>
<P>
   With the once-dreaded year 2000 having arrived in time zone
after time zone with virtually no millennium-bug chaos, it seems
that the many predictions of computer meltdowns, driven by the
shift to the date 01-01-00, could now be widely disparaged as
Chicken Little nonsense. They may even be seen as a conspiracy
perpetrated by self-interested vendors of technology.
</P>
<P>
   The big caveat is that much potential Y2K damage might not
become apparent until the business world goes back to work Monday,
and perhaps not for days or weeks after that.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus Saturday of a cross-section of government
officials and Y2K specialists seemed to be that the stunningly
uneventful New Year's Eve really did reflect one of civilization's
finer hours.
</P>
<P>
   Years of planning, billions of dollars in investment, and
unprecedented cooperation and information-sharing among nations and
industries clearly paid off when New Year's Day arrived with
seemingly no more glitches than any other.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, specialists said, the vast sense of anticlimax
that greeted the arrival of the year 2000 reflected widespread
misunderstanding of what Y2K was all about.
</P>
<P>
   While many people viewed Y2K as potentially a small number of
huge problems, technical experts understood that the real risk was
of a huge number of Lilliputian problems that would bog down
society for days or weeks. These efforts would be inconvenient,
costly, and annoying, but in most cases probably far from matters
of life and death. Media-fueled nightmares of crashing airplanes,
plunging elevators, and entire states shivering in the dark were
far off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   If the ``millennium bug'' still has any life, it now looks as
though it could linger as a chronic, low-grade virus. It clearly
will not be an acute heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Groton computer consultant David J. Hayes, whose car sports a
well-bolted ``Y2K'' license plate, is a former chief information
officer for several area companies. Hayes noted that ``the guy who
invented the term Y2K said at one time that it's going to be death
by 10,000 papercuts,'' Hayes said. ``It's going to be all small
problems, but there are going to be a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from the disaster scenario to the hassle
scenario,'' said John Gantz, chief research officer with IDC Corp.
of Framingham, which has been running ``Project Magellan'' to
monitor Y2K problems around the world.
</P>
<P>
   IDC now estimates that computer ``downtime'' connected to
dealing with Y2K will cost the global economy $21 billion this
year. Those impacts may not become clear until this week, because
probably 85 percent of the world's computers were shut off Friday
night, Gantz said.
</P>
<P>
   While $21 billion is one of those numbers that sounds big, in
context it represents barely 1/1,500th of the $32 trillion global
economy. And while there will likely be widespread problems to fix,
every society will be able to attack them in an environment where
the basics of modern life _ electricity, telephones, water
supplies, traffic lights _ seem to be functioning as well as they
ever did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say that it was massively overhyped,'' Gantz said
of Y2K apocalypse scenarios. ``I believe the work had to be done,
but everyone focused on the most dramatic possible outcomes of what
could have happened. We always said Y2K will appear not as a flood,
but as a lot of leaky basements.''
</P>
<P>
   The true impact of Y2K will be felt as companies and government
agencies deal with balky order processing systems, confused
accounting spreadsheets, and screwed-up transaction records that
may take a few minutes here and an hour there to fix.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Webster, cochairman of the Washington-based Year 2000
Group, said, ``Most Y2K errors are pretty dull. A program stops
working or it makes a bad calculation. None of this means planes
falling out of the sky or nuclear meltdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta telecommunications analyst Jeffrey Kagan said, ``It
looks like the worst most of us will have to deal with is
inconveniences and frustrations, not real problems. Inaccurate
bills. Wrong orders. Late deliveries.''
</P>
<P>
   What is likely to be lost in the finger-pointing over whether
millions of people were unduly panicked about Y2K is that, given
the stakes, officials had no choice but to take on the problem.
Leaving, say, Belgium or the state of Ohio unremedied for Y2K as a
test case for whether Y2K was really serious would have rightly
been dismissed as an absurd option, given the risks and the
interconnectedness of electric grids, telecommunications networks,
and global trade.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton's top Y2K troubleshooter, John Koskinen,
gave voice Saturday to the rhetorical question now on the minds of
many: ``Has this all been hype?''
</P>
<P>
   No way, Koskinen insisted. Rather, the smooth arrival of New
Year's Day from Auckland to Honolulu reflected the governments' and
industry's success in handling ``the biggest management challenge
the world has had in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not underestimate the nature of the problem that was
initially there,'' Koskinen said. ``Had the effort not been made,
had the money not been spent, we would be in a very different
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Judge, spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency
Management Agency, which helped coordinate monitoring efforts for
state agencies that spent $103 million preparing, said, ``I
personally wouldn't have wanted to be the guy who said, `Nothing is
going to happen. We'll just keep our fingers crossed.' The
potential was catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   And it also bears remembering that Y2K anxiety was in some ways
a luxury of prosperous nations. ``Y2K makes no difference in
Nigeria,'' said technician Ayodele Adewale, celebrating the new
year in the streets of Lagos. ``We do not normally have light or
water, so if we do now then it must be a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some think the fact that Y2K came and went without
disasters may also prove to be a turning point for many people in
industrialized, technological societies who feel uncertain about
their growing dependence on computers. Even as they yield countless
benefits for people's work and leisure, digital systems often
inspire mistrust, or a sense that humans are not fully in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is going to feel more comfortable with technology
going forward,'' said Gary Beach, publisher of 135,000-circulation
CIO Magazine, a Framingham-based specialty publication for business
information executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology did not fail us in the last 24 hours, and it didn't
fail us because of the human aspect, the unbelievable work by men
and women who faced these issues and solved them. This was one of
the best examples of human cooperation in the history of mankind.''

cases, run for public office _ is missing. The muscles donit
tighten in the same way and the face assumes a loose, locker-room
quality of disregard for the attention being focused on it. As much
as any of the traditional Democratic initiatives he proposes in his

generations by Manaschis, masters of recitation who chant it at
festivals and other gatherings, and has now become a moral and

been an authoritative text, each Manaschi can weave in original
lines, and even episodes and characters. The greatest of them are
revered as prodigious creators in their own right. (Staton R.

   The Cornhuskers (11-1) and the Volunteers (9-2) meet again in
the Fiesta Bowl here on Sunday night, and Martin, about to play his
final game for Tennessee, does not intend to have the same thing
happen to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a different team than we were back then,'' said Martin,
who led Tennessee to a 13-0 championship season a year ago with a
Fiesta Bowl victory here. ``I feel I know more about Nebraska than
any team we've played this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Nebraska knows the weapons I possess as a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   So does the rest of the country. Martin's storybook year in
1998, when he led the Volunteers to their first national title in
31 years, capped by a 23-16 victory over Florida State, may not
have repeated itself this season, but he continued to add new
dimensions to his multifaceted game.
</P>
<P>
   With the graduation of wide receiver Peerless Price, Martin
developed the ability to find multiple receivers, a broadening of
his game that has not gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tee established himself as a winner while at Tennessee,'' said
Phillip Fulmer, Tennessee's coach. ``Not enough can be said about
his leadership and character.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his interceptions were up and his touchdowns were down
in his senior year, the 6-foot-3-inch Martin is seen as a possible
first-round National Football League draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by a viral infection, Martin did not take part in a full
practice with the Volunteers until Wednesday. He did, however,
spend a lot of time watching film of the Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been seeing Nebraska in my sleep,'' he said. ``They have
more to offer than Florida State did last year. This feels like a
big conference game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers returned to national prominence this year after
a subpar 9-4 season in 1998. But they are also nagged by questions
of what might have been. A 4-point loss to Texas on Oct. 23
deprived the Huskers of an unbeaten season and the chance to play
in the Sugar Bowl, where a victory would have made them the first
major college team to win four national championships in one
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Crouch, a running threat at quarterback, has directed a
potent Husker attack after taking over the starting job from Bobby
Newcombe after the second game.
</P>
<P>
   Upset that he would not start the season as the No. 1
quarterback, Crouch returned to his Omaha home in late August to
assess his future with the Cornhuskers. He appeared on the verge of
calling it quits when a visit by Frank Solich, the Nebraska coach,
convinced Crouch that the team needed him, whether as a backup
quarterback or at his second position, wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed when I wasn't named the starter,'' Crouch
said. ``Then I accepted that my best chance to be on the field
would be as a wide receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich went with a quarterback platoon to open the season and
Crouch played well enough to claim the starting job. When the
starting running back, DeAngelo Evans, quit the team, Crouch, who
is evasive and fast, picked up the slack. He became the first
quarterback to lead the Cornhuskers in rushing since 1955 with 889
yards in 180 carries, and was named the Big 12 co-offensive player
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had said all of these things would have happened, that
we'd be 11-1 and playing in the Fiesta Bowl, I don't think I would
have believed you,'' Crouch said.
</P>
<P>
   For Crouch to effectively run the option offense against the
Volunteers, he will have to overcome a defense that gave up only
three rushing touchdowns all season.
</P>
<P>
   For Martin to go out with a victory, he will have to employ his
scrambling skills and penetrate Nebraska's second-ranked pass
defense headed by the first team all-American defensive backs Mike
Brown and Ralph Brown.
</P>
<P>
   And in the game within a game, Crouch and Martin will be
matching up against each other, and the Tennessee quarterback has
experience on his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I am passing on the torch with this game,'' Martin
said. ``I want to go out with a win.'' &QL;

<HEADLINE>
AROUND THE WORLD, ARTISTS MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Israel, N.Y., Nev.)  (jw) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beneath the cacophony of exploding fireworks, there was music
and dancing around the world on Friday night as entertainers of
every stripe, and their fans, set about proving that art, if not
eternal (who knows?), at least provides a worthy human tribute to
the last, and the next, 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there was a disappointment here and there. The Javits
Convention Center extravaganza in Manhattan, with the headliners
Andrea Bocelli, Aretha Franklin and Sting, was canceled, a casualty
of poor ticket sales. And in Jerusalem, a performance of Handel's
``Messiah'' was canceled as well, after a rabbinical ban on public
celebrations that would violate the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   But from Egypt and the pyramids in Giza, where the passage of a
millennial moment is old hat (this is the sixth) and 50,000 people
attended a new opera by Jean-Michel Jarre, a French composer of New
Age electronic music; to Cambodia and the ancient temple at Angkor
Wat, where traditional ballet dancers performed in the company of
2,000 prayer-offering Buddhist monks; to Rio de Janeiro, where 3
million samba dancers packed Copacabana Beach; to Berlin, where 60
bands played on 10 stages for a three-mile-long party that
stretched across the once divided city; to Istanbul, where in
Taksim Square, the Turkish band Athena rocked the casbah; to Las
Vegas, where Bette Midler and Barbra Streisand made diva lovers
swoon, the new era clicked over to a sometimes hopeful, sometimes
wistful but generally joyful noise.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where the 24-hour celebration in Times Square
saluted the cultures of the world in hourly performances that
reflected the year 2000's incremental arrival around the globe,
Billy Joel, a hometown boy (well, O.K, a Long Island boy) rang in
the occasion at Madison Square Garden with a nostalgic medley of
his best-known pop ballads.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote this for my first ex-wife,'' said Joel, beginning a
rendition of ``Just the Way You Are.'' His show infused good
feelings with wry melancholy, as evidenced by a particularly
yearning version of ``New York State of Mind'' and even the
dolorous opening measures of Beethoven's ``Moonlight'' Sonata.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere of pleasant familiarity was repeated, albeit on a
smaller scale, in clubs around the city, as it doubtless was in
cities everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunnyside, N.Y., on a stretch of Queens Boulevard where halal
meat markets, Turkish grocers and taquerias sit side by side and
the newsstand sells papers in eight languages, Avenging Disco
Godfather, a five-piece Celtic rock band, made its weekly
appearance at Tailors Hall. In the one-room pub with a roaring fire
and a candlelit chandelier, 75 regulars gathered for an Irish new
year. The band covered classics by the Beatles and Janis Joplin
with a lilting Irish skew.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the distinctly less intimate Florida Everglades,
80,000 people gathered for a midnight-to-dawn concert by the rock
band Phish on 500 acres on the Big Cypress Seminole Indian
Reservation, home to a tribe that first had contact with European
explorers half a millennium ago.
</P>
<P>
   Amid oak, cypress and palm trees, the party included hot-air
balloons, two Ferris wheels and a ballet troupe, not to mention a
handful of nudists and men on stilts. Many in the crowd had
traveled from around the country to hear the band, which has
achieved the kind of cult following that once adhered to the
Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Chicago commissioned a millennium line dance, the
``milly,'' sort of a Midwestern macarena, from a local
choreographer, Harrison McEldowney. Set to a tune by another
Chicagoan, Wade Hubbard, it was danced just before midnight Friday
by the 3,500 celebrants at the McCormick Place Lakeside Center for
a dinner presided over by Mayor Richard M. Daley.
</P>
<P>
   After midnight, the milly gave way to a more conventional boogie
_ and in the end, a series of conga lines, with Maggie Daley, the
mayor's wife, leading one.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas, in the 20th time zone to enter the new year,
Barbra Streisand gave a rare performance at the MGM Grand, the same
place she last appeared six years ago, when the hotel opened.
</P>
<P>
   Then, an anxious Ms. Streisand took the stage for the first time
in 20 years. This time, appearing confident and excited, she sang
to a sold-out house of 13,000 people and repeatedly brought them to
their feet during the 2{-hour show. They all carried flashlights
they had been given as they entered _ in case the power failed,
which it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   At the stroke of midnight, silver, white and gold confetti
dropped in the arena as Ms. Streisand sang her final number _
``People,'' of course.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was there an extravaganza to match ``The Twelve Dreams
of the Sun,'' a three-hour song cycle staged as an opera, with more
than 1,000 musicians, dancers and singers and based on an ancient
Egyptian myth about the daily dusk-to-dawn journey of the sun and
the gifts it bestows on humanity during its passage: time,
protection, wisdom, eternity, fidelity, memory, courage, space,
innocence, celebration, purity and freedom.

   The anthemic work by Jarre melded electronic music with Western
jazz and Arabic rhythms and melodies, and the music and dancing
were augmented by a spectacular laser show against the backdrop of
the pyramids and the great Sahara.

 &HT;    Stock market's New Year's resolution: No end to the good news
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Congratulations, you survived Y2K. Now you can look
forward to another year of economic and stock market growth, as
amazing as that seems.
</P>
<P>
   But consider these things for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Within one month the economy will tie the all-time record for
sustained growth, and a month after that it will set a new mark:
107 months since the end of the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the bull market in stocks continues to set
records whether you date it from 1990 or 1982 _ if the latter, it's
called a ``super bull market.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer prices, which were advancing at better than 6 percent
per year in 1990, averaged half that for most of the '90s, and less
than 2 percent in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate fell from 7.8 percent in June 1992 to 4.1
percent in November.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder then that consumer confidence has soared
throughout the decade, and during December, reached the highest
level in 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the other ``confidence'' indexes that everybody
loves to watch, since they represent money made or money lost _
namely, the various stock market indexes.
</P>
<P>
   The best known _ the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue
chip stocks _ has risen 386 percent since Oct. 11, 1990, the bottom
of the last bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 has risen 397 percent and the
Nasdaq composite more than 1,149 percent , clearly reflecting the
high-tech dynamism of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the soaring Nasdaq Stock Market became the market story
of 1999, as the technology-loaded index topped 4,000 for the first
time and gained an unprecedented 86 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   New dot-com companies sprouted as entrepreneurs tried to keep
ahead of the demand for Internet services from businesses and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   If the Internet came into its own in 1999, the computer's
ability to increase productivity while holding hold down labor
costs emerged in the 1980s, after which corporations have invested
heavily in information technology.
</P>
<P>
   That, in fact, is a major explanation for the economy's growth
in the '90s. Other reasons include downsizing, the long-term drop
in interest rates, brisk consumer spending, a business-friendly
Federal Reserve, deregulation and relative stability in the
post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market, in turn, is a product of sustained economic
growth, unusually strong corporate profit growth, the long-term
decline in inflation, the huge baby boom generation reaching middle
age, and the near-exponential increase in individual investing
through mutual funds and various retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   None of these fundamentals is expected to change this year,
which means the bull market will continue, most analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this market's going to go a long ways,'' says Robert
S. Robbins, market strategist for Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta. ``I
think it will probably go another five years, maybe longer. If it
does, in another five years, I think the market will double.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean investors won't have setbacks from time to
time. Robbins attaches about a 50 percent probability to a
correction, or sell-off, of as much as 10 percent in the S&AMP;P 500
sometime this year, but not a bear market _ a drop of 20 percent or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, most strategists are almost embarrassed to make a
negative forecast, given how many times they have been wrong in the
last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   First Union analysts said that from 1997 to 1999, ``virtually
all economic forecasts erred by underestimating growth and
overestimating inflation.'' Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, were
too conservative in their forecasts of market performance.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean forecasters have suddenly become cockeyed
optimists, since most forecasts are also laced with words of
caution about 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, uncertainty about the impact of Y2K clouds most
economic forecasts, according to the First Union analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional view, which we share, is that 1999 growth was
boosted to some degree by precautionary inventory building and the
final technological fixes of the millennium bug,'' said chief
economist David Orr.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the reverse effect should result in ``more moderate
growth in the first half of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus forecast of 16 Wall Street economists surveyed by
Bank of America was that the economy would show a 4.5 percent
annual growth rate in the final quarter of 1999, then drop to 2.1
percent in the first quarter of 2000 before moving slightly higher
in later quarters.
</P>
<P>
   A more serious problem is inflation, which emerged last year as
a serious concern for both the Federal Reserve and the investment
markets _ especially the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the Fed to raise short-term interest rates by a
total of three-quarters of a percentage point in three moves _ in
June, August and November.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts look for more rate boosts in 2000 unless the
economy cools enough to dampen inflationary pressures. The Fed's
fear is that a tight labor market, foreign economic recovery and
rising prices of oil and other commodities could lead to higher
domestic prices as companies raise prices to cover their higher
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation potential of U.S. trade problems, which affect the
value of the dollar, contributes to the Fed's concern about the
inflation outlook. Foreign economic recovery also has the potential
of pressuring the United States to raise interest rates to prevent
an outflow of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario, which mainstream analysts overwhelming
reject, is a Fed-induced rise in interest rates to a level that
triggers a recession, and that in turn causes a bear market in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe the stock market is highly vulnerable to a
sell-off should something like a jump in rates alter the generally
upbeat mood on Wall Street. They say stocks are more overvalued
than ever, and that trading is dangerously concentrated in a narrow
list of big stocks, including those in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts argue that the stock indexes have been deceptive
for at least two years, steadily rising while most stocks have been
in a ``stealth bear market.'' The S&AMP;P 500 rose 19.5 percent in
1999, but more than half of the 500 stocks declined in value last
year. Measured against their 52-week highs, the carnage was even
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, optimists make a strong case that the end is not
near, for the economy or the bull market, n 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Thayer, chief economist for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis,
looks for ``slower growth with modest inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wage gains and the stock market's wealth effect will keep the
economy going, he argues, while electronic commerce and foreign
competition will hold inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect economic growth in 2000 to slow to a 2.6 percent
annual pace, down from the 3.8 percent rate that we expect (for
1999),'' says Thayer. ``We also look for inflation to stabilize in
the 2 percent-to-2.5 percent range.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuation of these solid fundamentals is expected to keep
the bull market alive by boosting corporate profits. Earnings grew
last year much more vigorously than anticipated: from 10.5 percent
in the first quarter to an estimated 20.3 percent in the final
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect some pullback in profit growth, but they
still look for double-digit gains: 19.3 percent in the first
quarter and about 17 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Acampora, director of technical research for Prudential
Securities, says the Nasdaq composite could reach 5,000 this year,
an increase of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the Dow could reach 13,500 or 14,000 and the S&AMP;P
500 could hit 1,700 or 1,800. If that happens, 2000 would be the
sixth straight year of double-digit gains among the major stock
averages.
</P>
<P>
   Acampora argues that the market maintains its overall strength
through a system of ``rolling corrections,'' in which one sector or
industry group may suffer a sell-off while money continues to flow
into others.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon puts a floor beneath the stock indexes even as
large numbers of individual stocks may be tanking by 20 percent or
more, as happened in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers and investment advisers say that's why investors
should be especially careful of what they buy. Be selective and buy
stocks based on a company's quality of management and track record,
they say. Also, once in the market with a solid portfolio, stay
there until there is a real reason for selling.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks will dip from time to time, and even the strongest will
suffer setbacks in a broad market sell-off. But on balance, based
on what is known and can be reasonably projected, analysts enter
2000 convinced that stocks are a safe investment for some time.

ACTING PRESIDENT VISITS TROOPS FIGHTING IN CHECHEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Not content to sit pat a day after assuming power in
Russia, the acting president, Vladimir Putin, reminded voters
Saturday why they like him so much, with a surprise visit to troops
fighting the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's overnight trip to the Russian-held city of Gudermes, to
present soldiers with medals and with hunting knives engraved with
his signature, and to offer a ringing vote of support for their
efforts to crush separatist militants, bore the traits that make
him the favorite to win in a landslide in an early presidential
vote set for March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the vigor, the flair for the unexpected and the gift
for populist politics that Russians once associated with Boris N.
Yeltsin, the man who stepped down on Friday to make way for Putin.
Very quickly, Putin appears to be acquiring Yeltsin's knack for
using the power of his position to project his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's trip to Chechnya, on his first full day on the job,
also served as a reminder that other than his hawkish leadership of
the war effort, little is known about the former spy from St.
Petersburg, who now holds sway in the Kremlin and who enjoys a
soaring popularity rating. His political and economic views remain
a mystery, even to veteran observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After watching Putin for years, I still don't really know who
he is,'' said Alexander Gorshkov, a St. Petersburg-based
investigative journalist. ``In four months as prime minister he
hasn't done anything other than Chechnya. We still don't know what
his plans are for the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gorshkov and other analysts expressed doubt that the
questions surrounding Putin amount to enough to derail his drive to
win the presidency. In a turnaround, the man who was widely
ridiculed as an obscure and bland nonentity when Yeltsin anointed
him his successor in August is now seen by many Russians as someone
who can put a halt to a decade of decline.
</P>
<P>
   While much of Putin's support is based on the perceived success
of the war in Chechnya, he has also tapped into deeply held
emotions in Russian society. He is seen as being strong and
decisive in standing up for Russian interests after a decade of
perceived capitulation to former Cold War enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin's popularity goes beyond the war,'' said Vladimir
Pribylovsky, a member of the Panorama research center. ``He
represents a nostalgic stereotype of a decisive leader with a
strong hand who will defend Russia's independent interests without
bowing to the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has used his weaknesses to his advantage. A lackluster
public speaker, he uses simple, clipped phrases, often spiced with
tough-guy jargon. The public has taken to this and sees it as a
refreshing no-nonsense style _ which is appealing to Russians who
are weary of lofty rhetoric and high-minded promises. Most of
Russia's prime ministers in the past ten years have been
technocrats who talk about loans and deficits and inflation and
financial policies. But in Russia, more than just the economy
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin personifies the hopes people have that things can be
changed for the better,'' said Alexei Grazhdankin, deputy director
of the All-Russia Center for Public Opinion Research. ``People
don't want miracles, they just want order, and Putin has given the
impression that he is providing order.''
</P>
<P>
   Grazhdankin said that Putin's background in the Soviet
intelligence community, and later as director of the main successor
to the KGB, the Federal Security Service, or FSB, is an asset with
much of the public. Many Russians now think of the Soviet-era
security services as an important ingredient for law and order that
has been lost, rather than a tool of repression whose passing
should be celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, according to Grazhdankin, evokes in many the image of
late Soviet leader Yury Andropov, who ran the KGB before ascending
to the pinnacle of power in the Soviet Union. Some view Andropov's
brief reign _ he died in February 1984 after just 15 months in
office _ as a missed opportunity for national revival. The
widely-accepted view of the KGB of that era is of a force engaged
in trying to reform the Soviet Union from within by closing the
large economic and technological gap between it and the West.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Putin's public statements center around the need for
powerful central authority to restore Russia's confidence in itself
and preserve its place as a stable world power.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong state for Russians is not an anomaly, not something
that must be fought for or against, but on the contrary, it is the
source and guarantor of order, the initiator and driving force of
all change,'' Putin said in a statement issued last week at a
conference of the upstart Unity political party, which parlayed his
backing to a strong second place finish in recent parliamentary
elections despite being just two months old. ``Russia will not
soon, if ever, become a copy of, say, the United States or England,
where liberal values have deep historical traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   If Putin's past, and his views, have raised doubts in the West,
its leaders have gone out of their way to hide them. President
Clinton told Putin in a telephone call Saturday that US-Russia
relations under Putin's leadership were ``off to a good start''
despite differences on Chechnya and other issues, the White House
said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday in Chechnya, Putin praised officers and soldiers in
Gudermes, 18 miles east of Chechnya's capital, Grozny, where
Russian planes and artillery pounded rebels in an effort to capture
the city Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just about restoring the honor and dignity of
Russia,'' Putin said in remarks broadcast live on Russian
television early Saturday. ``It is rather more important than that.
It is about putting an end to the break-up of the Russian
Federation. That is the main task. Russia is grateful to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he left the republic, Putin said that Russia would pursue
its current military tactics in Chechnya, adding that he had
developed the tactics himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do everything in an optimal way,'' Putin said.
``Optimal means the fewest possible casualties among our troops and
the absence of casualties among civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to 40,000 mostly elderly and infirm civilians are trapped in
Grozny. Residents have been huddled for weeks in basements, too
afraid to go outside or risk the journey through the Russian
bombardment to escape Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, waves of low-flying Russian jets unleashed scores of
bombs on the shattered city in one of the biggest attacks yet on
the Chechen capital, according to news agencies in Grozny. Tanks
and artillery surrounding Grozny fired barrages into the city. But
federal forces were apparently far from capturing the city and were
taking heavy losses, although no figures were available.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's state-controlled media have ironed out the awkward
details of the war, just as they have helped build up Putin's image
while slamming his potential rivals in the presidential vote _
former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov
and Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov _ with a constant stream of
allegations of wrongdoing, duplicity and illness.
</P>
<P>
   Putin Saturday denied that the New Year visit to the troops was
a planned opening of his election campaign, saying the trip was set
up months ago. The trip nevertheless demonstrated the way the
state-controlled media have helped his popularity rating soar to 70
percent. Putin was shown flying in a Su-25 ground attack jet,
touring villages captured from Chechen rebels, and demonstrating
his black-belt prowess in judo.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has managed to garner support from across Russia's
spectrum of elites. The military and security services support him
because he has increased the defense budget and is giving them a
free hand in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalists support him because he is not afraid to talk tough
with the West. Russia's business and financial elite support him
because he has promised not to redistribute the former government
property they privatized, often on very favorable terms, during
Yeltsin's eight years in office.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Putin is seen by the public as being
independent from these special interest groups. That is probably
only half-true. Putin has relied on high oil prices to fuel his war
effort and lend the Russian economy, which depends heavily on the
export of raw materials, the look of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   He has presided over the Kremlin's effort to take control of the
lucrative revenue from Russia's oil pipeline and railway transport
monopolies, which some analysts say has provided financial backing
for Unity's political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The top officials associated with this effort, Yeltsin's former
chief of administration Alexander Voloshin and first deputy Prime
Minister Nikolai Aksyonenko, are seen as closely linked to the
financier and informal Kremlin adviser Boris Berezovsky, long
rumored as a main strategist behind the Yeltsin presidency. Both
Aksyonenko and Voloshin look set to keep their jobs under Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, the system of shadow influence remains the
same,'' said Mikhail Berger, editor of the Segodnya daily
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets soared on the news of Putin's appointment,
hoping that a an energetic, popular leader would finally be able to
make the hard decisions needed to spur Russia's long-delayed
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But the central question surrounding Putin's future economic
plans is the relationship he creates with Berezovsky and other
financial elites, known here as ``the oligarchs.'' Under Yeltsin,
this group's insider practices and offshore dealings have come to
symbolize the way big business has thrived despite the rest of the
country, rather than fueling a national economic revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central question in Russia's economy today,'' said Sergei
Parkhomenko, editor of Itogi magazine, ``is whether Putin will
control the oligarchs or whether they will control him.''

 &HT;    FSU's Warrick seeks redemption
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ For Peter Warrick, Tuesday night's Sugar Bowl game
represents nothing less than a fight for his legacy at Florida
State.
</P>
<P>
   To put it bluntly: Will Warrick be remembered as the guy who
made a mistake and lost the Heisman Trophy? Or will he be the
player who helped Florida State win its second national
championship?
</P>
<P>
   To Warrick, those will be the stakes when the No. 1 Seminoles
take on No. 2 Virginia Tech at the Super Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my last shot to prove what I can do in college ball,''
said Warrick, a senior from Bradenton, Fla. ``I hope to do
something that people will remember. I want them to remember what I
did on the field _ not how I messed up off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick should be entering this game as the Heisman Trophy
winner. But those hopes died in October when he and teammate
Laverneous Coles were arrested on theft charges. With help from a
Dillard's cashier, Warrick and Coles paid $21 for more than $400
worth of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of felony theft was eventually reduced to a
misdemeanor and after sitting out two games, Warrick returned to
the team. He thought that, plus a firestorm of negative press,
would be the extent of his punishment. He was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest, the Heisman Trophy was Warrick's to
lose. He did. In fact, he did not get enough votes to warrant a
trip to New York as a finalist.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the most crushing blow of all. At the ESPN College
Football Award show in Orlando on Dec. 9, Warrick sat in stunned
silence as the Biletnikoff Award, which goes to the nation's best
wide receiver, went to Troy Walters of Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``No disrespect, but I had never heard of Troy Walters,''
Warrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's teammates were seething after what they viewed as a
snub by the Biletnikoff which, ironically, is named after a Florida
State Hall of Famer and is presented by the Tallahassee Quarterback
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the Heisman Trophy thing, but I understood it,''
said defensive tackle Corey Simon, who was in Orlando for the
announcement. ``But how can anybody in their right mind not vote
Pete as the best wide receiver? I have absolutely no respect for
that award any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Warrick's teammates have closed ranks, saying that
the punishment has now surpassed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the guy made a terrible mistake and he's paid a
tremendous price for it,'' quarterback Chris Weinke said. ``It cost
him the Heisman Trophy. His name has been drug through the mud all
over the country. And the thing is, they just don't know the guy
and very few of the people ripping him have ever bothered to find
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Their feelings for Warrick and his situation run so deep that
last week Florida State's players chose him one of two permanent
team captains.
</P>
<P>
   ``That felt good,'' Warrick said. ``I've been around these guys
for a long time. They know me.'' So Tuesday night, Warrick will try
to repair some of the damage the only way he knows how _ by helping
the Seminoles win the last national title of the '90s. ``There's
not a day that goes by that I don't think about winning the
national championship,'' he said. ``We've come close but we still
don't have the ring.''

<P>
   Key utilities and government officials across the country
declared victory over the Y2K software bug Saturday, raising hopes
that business computers will also operate smoothly as the workweek
begins.
</P>
<P>
   Major electric generating and transmission companies, water
services, telecommunications providers, and banks reported few
problems associated with the rollover to Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Considering fears that the date change might cause blackouts and
other big disruptions, what did emerge seemed minor, such as faulty
dates on some Massachusetts state e-mail. Other issues bordered on
the comic, such as problems at certain financial Web sites that
temporarily assigned one man in Maine a $76 million windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in much better shape than anyone would have
predicted,'' John Koskinen, President Clinton's top Y2K adviser,
said at a news conference in Washington. ``We have not been able to
find anything of great significance to report here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For most Y2K (issues), success is already achieved,'' echoed
Dennis DiMarzio, chief operating officer for the City of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant setback reported by the US government
involved a military spy system that was blinded for three hours
after a satellite data-processing unit crashed. Service was
partially restored within a few hours, said Deputy Defense
Secretary John Hamre.
</P>
<P>
   After months of intense worry about readiness of major
institutions, the smooth transition raised the ironic question of
whether too much money and attention might have been paid to the
potential glitch. The answer may not be known for weeks as
organizations discover whether mundane problems might add up to
anything significant.
</P>
<P>
   But given the stakes, the progress reports from some of the
economy's most important sectors suggested that Y2K at least had
become an economic issue rather than a matter of civil order.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were especially pleased that so few problems
seemed to emerge related to ``embedded'' computer chips, which are
built into many devices such as traffic lights and were often hard
to test in advance.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston Edison's command center in Dorchester, by 1 a.m.
Saturday the utility's chief Y2K planner, Jim Ashkar, had shifted
his attention from keeping the lights on to making sure the
company's billing and payroll systems worked as designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be tarred and feathered by the customers,'' he said
after it seemed clear the region's lights would stay on. But
looking forward, he noted, ``We could still be tarred and feathered
by our shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was good for Y2K to come along,'' said Boston Mayor
Thomas M. Menino. ``It forced us to do some work we probably would
have postponed for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the United States, worries began to ease Friday as
few problems emerged as midnight arrived overseas.
</P>
<P>
   At the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency's underground
command center in Framingham, dozens of relieved officials clapped
and hugged at 12:01 a.m. Saturday as lights stayed on and public
celebrations continued uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday afternoon the state's chief Y2K planner, Val
Asbedian, said he knew of only ``cosmetic'' difficulties around
Massachusetts, such as problems with the phone system of a state
college he declined to identify. Asbedian said he expected only
``nuisances or embarrassments'' would emerge when the workweek
begins.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Electric Reliability Council, the utility
trade group responsible for monitoring the nation's power system,
said data clocks at eight utilities failed a time-check at midnight
Greenwich Mean Time, or 7 p.m. Friday on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   No power operations were impacted as a result, the group said.
Federal officials reported problems at five nuclear power plants,
which face stricter monitoring than most power facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Problems included faults in card-readers that control building
access. At the Millstone nuclear power plant in Waterford, Conn.,
programs that monitor wind-speed and radiation emissions failed and
had to be reset, the government reported. Spokespeople for
Northeast Utilities, the plant's owner, couldn't be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Business consultants like Steve Goldberg in Needham said they
weren't ready to call Y2K a nonevent, noting that more than half of
all business PCs won't even be turned on Monday morning. ``All we
know so far is that the infrastructure held, but that's good
news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With their lights on and television sets working, thousands of
office workers assigned to overtime duties in Boston's financial
district found themselves with little to do in the early morning
hours Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At FleetBoston Financial's command center at One Federal St.,
company spokesman Jim Shepker said the region's largest bank began
sending call-center representatives home at 2 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply were not being used,'' Shepker said. Once the
lights stayed on, he said, ``customers weren't worried.''
Altogether the bank had 4,000 workers on duty over the weekend,
2,800 more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for other big financial institutions in the region
including Fidelity Investments, State Street Corp., and Citizens
Financial Group said they had nothing to report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals and health-care services were also seen as vulnerable
to Y2K-related glitches, but no troubles were found at major
institutions including Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center and at
Newton-Wellesley Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At the John F. Kennedy Federal Building downtown, a fire alarm
system malfunctioned and had to be reset Saturday morning,
officials said, though the cause of the problem was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Business at Logan Airport, off dramatically on Friday and early
Saturday because of travelers' concerns about the bug, picked back
up at noon. About 80 percent of the flights normally scheduled for
a Saturday were expected to operate for the day, said Jose Juves, a
spokesman for the Massachusetts Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials reported two problems
believed to be Y2K-related, but both were fixed immediately and did
not affect traffic. One involved printers at oceanic air traffic
facilities in New York and Oakland, Calif. In the other case, files
with the date ``00'' were wiped out of a weather advisory system.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems seemed to involve lower stakes. In Delaware, slot
machines at three racetracks refused to take bets, apparently
because of the date change.
</P>
<P>
   In Stockton Springs, Maine, schoolteacher Bill Carpenter said he
logged on to a financial Web site run by Microsoft Corp. at 12:15
a.m. Saturday to discover a decimal-place error in his on-line
stock portfolio had resulted in a $76 million windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great moment!'' he said. ``We were lighting cigars
with $20 bills for an hour.'' After promising several party guests
$1 million apiece, Carpenter said he logged back on at 1:30 a.m.
only to see his gains had been erased. ``I'm still not sure what to
tell them,'' he said of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Microsoft Corp. blamed the error on faulty
data provided by a contractor she declined to name; other on-line
services including AltaVista and YYY also reported difficulties.
With weekend Y2K efforts an apparent success, businesses Saturday
began to focus on what else might turn up. Kevin Lamont, a manager
at the HMV Record Store in Harvard Square, said he is more
confident that serious problems have been avoided. ``It does feel
good to know that it's over,'' Lamont said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Bruce McConnell, head of a United Nations-backed
Y2K coordination center, credited everything from international
cooperation to ``good luck'' to minimizing Y2K woes.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the weekend results, he said, ``Starting Monday, we
will hear of many errors, but most of them will not pose serious
problems and will be quickly fixed.''

ACTING PRESIDENT VISITS TROOPS FIGHTING IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeats to correct headline)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Not content to sit pat a day after assuming power in
Russia, the acting president, Vladimir Putin, reminded voters
Saturday why they like him so much, with a surprise visit to troops
fighting the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's overnight trip to the Russian-held city of Gudermes, to
present soldiers with medals and with hunting knives engraved with
his signature, and to offer a ringing vote of support for their
efforts to crush separatist militants, bore the traits that make
him the favorite to win in a landslide in an early presidential
vote set for March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the vigor, the flair for the unexpected and the gift
for populist politics that Russians once associated with Boris N.
Yeltsin, the man who stepped down on Friday to make way for Putin.
Very quickly, Putin appears to be acquiring Yeltsin's knack for
using the power of his position to project his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's trip to Chechnya, on his first full day on the job,
also served as a reminder that other than his hawkish leadership of
the war effort, little is known about the former spy from St.
Petersburg, who now holds sway in the Kremlin and who enjoys a
soaring popularity rating. His political and economic views remain
a mystery, even to veteran observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After watching Putin for years, I still don't really know who
he is,'' said Alexander Gorshkov, a St. Petersburg-based
investigative journalist. ``In four months as prime minister he
hasn't done anything other than Chechnya. We still don't know what
his plans are for the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gorshkov and other analysts expressed doubt that the
questions surrounding Putin amount to enough to derail his drive to
win the presidency. In a turnaround, the man who was widely
ridiculed as an obscure and bland nonentity when Yeltsin anointed
him his successor in August is now seen by many Russians as someone
who can put a halt to a decade of decline.
</P>
<P>
   While much of Putin's support is based on the perceived success
of the war in Chechnya, he has also tapped into deeply held
emotions in Russian society. He is seen as being strong and
decisive in standing up for Russian interests after a decade of
perceived capitulation to former Cold War enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin's popularity goes beyond the war,'' said Vladimir
Pribylovsky, a member of the Panorama research center. ``He
represents a nostalgic stereotype of a decisive leader with a
strong hand who will defend Russia's independent interests without
bowing to the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has used his weaknesses to his advantage. A lackluster
public speaker, he uses simple, clipped phrases, often spiced with
tough-guy jargon. The public has taken to this and sees it as a
refreshing no-nonsense style _ which is appealing to Russians who
are weary of lofty rhetoric and high-minded promises. Most of
Russia's prime ministers in the past ten years have been
technocrats who talk about loans and deficits and inflation and
financial policies. But in Russia, more than just the economy
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin personifies the hopes people have that things can be
changed for the better,'' said Alexei Grazhdankin, deputy director
of the All-Russia Center for Public Opinion Research. ``People
don't want miracles, they just want order, and Putin has given the
impression that he is providing order.''
</P>
<P>
   Grazhdankin said that Putin's background in the Soviet
intelligence community, and later as director of the main successor
to the KGB, the Federal Security Service, or FSB, is an asset with
much of the public. Many Russians now think of the Soviet-era
security services as an important ingredient for law and order that
has been lost, rather than a tool of repression whose passing
should be celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, according to Grazhdankin, evokes in many the image of
late Soviet leader Yury Andropov, who ran the KGB before ascending
to the pinnacle of power in the Soviet Union. Some view Andropov's
brief reign _ he died in February 1984 after just 15 months in
office _ as a missed opportunity for national revival. The
widely-accepted view of the KGB of that era is of a force engaged
in trying to reform the Soviet Union from within by closing the
large economic and technological gap between it and the West.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Putin's public statements center around the need for
powerful central authority to restore Russia's confidence in itself
and preserve its place as a stable world power.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong state for Russians is not an anomaly, not something
that must be fought for or against, but on the contrary, it is the
source and guarantor of order, the initiator and driving force of
all change,'' Putin said in a statement issued last week at a
conference of the upstart Unity political party, which parlayed his
backing to a strong second place finish in recent parliamentary
elections despite being just two months old. ``Russia will not
soon, if ever, become a copy of, say, the United States or England,
where liberal values have deep historical traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   If Putin's past, and his views, have raised doubts in the West,
its leaders have gone out of their way to hide them. President
Clinton told Putin in a telephone call Saturday that US-Russia
relations under Putin's leadership were ``off to a good start''
despite differences on Chechnya and other issues, the White House
said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday in Chechnya, Putin praised officers and soldiers in
Gudermes, 18 miles east of Chechnya's capital, Grozny, where
Russian planes and artillery pounded rebels in an effort to capture
the city Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just about restoring the honor and dignity of
Russia,'' Putin said in remarks broadcast live on Russian
television early Saturday. ``It is rather more important than that.
It is about putting an end to the break-up of the Russian
Federation. That is the main task. Russia is grateful to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he left the republic, Putin said that Russia would pursue
its current military tactics in Chechnya, adding that he had
developed the tactics himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do everything in an optimal way,'' Putin said.
``Optimal means the fewest possible casualties among our troops and
the absence of casualties among civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to 40,000 mostly elderly and infirm civilians are trapped in
Grozny. Residents have been huddled for weeks in basements, too
afraid to go outside or risk the journey through the Russian
bombardment to escape Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, waves of low-flying Russian jets unleashed scores of
bombs on the shattered city in one of the biggest attacks yet on
the Chechen capital, according to news agencies in Grozny. Tanks
and artillery surrounding Grozny fired barrages into the city. But
federal forces were apparently far from capturing the city and were
taking heavy losses, although no figures were available.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's state-controlled media have ironed out the awkward
details of the war, just as they have helped build up Putin's image
while slamming his potential rivals in the presidential vote _
former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov
and Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov _ with a constant stream of
allegations of wrongdoing, duplicity and illness.
</P>
<P>
   Putin Saturday denied that the New Year visit to the troops was
a planned opening of his election campaign, saying the trip was set
up months ago. The trip nevertheless demonstrated the way the
state-controlled media have helped his popularity rating soar to 70
percent. Putin was shown flying in a Su-25 ground attack jet,
touring villages captured from Chechen rebels, and demonstrating
his black-belt prowess in judo.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has managed to garner support from across Russia's
spectrum of elites. The military and security services support him
because he has increased the defense budget and is giving them a
free hand in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalists support him because he is not afraid to talk tough
with the West. Russia's business and financial elite support him
because he has promised not to redistribute the former government
property they privatized, often on very favorable terms, during
Yeltsin's eight years in office.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Putin is seen by the public as being
independent from these special interest groups. That is probably
only half-true. Putin has relied on high oil prices to fuel his war
effort and lend the Russian economy, which depends heavily on the
export of raw materials, the look of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   He has presided over the Kremlin's effort to take control of the
lucrative revenue from Russia's oil pipeline and railway transport
monopolies, which some analysts say has provided financial backing
for Unity's political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The top officials associated with this effort, Yeltsin's former
chief of administration Alexander Voloshin and first deputy Prime
Minister Nikolai Aksyonenko, are seen as closely linked to the
financier and informal Kremlin adviser Boris Berezovsky, long
rumored as a main strategist behind the Yeltsin presidency. Both
Aksyonenko and Voloshin look set to keep their jobs under Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, the system of shadow influence remains the
same,'' said Mikhail Berger, editor of the Segodnya daily
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets soared on the news of Putin's appointment,
hoping that a an energetic, popular leader would finally be able to
make the hard decisions needed to spur Russia's long-delayed
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But the central question surrounding Putin's future economic
plans is the relationship he creates with Berezovsky and other
financial elites, known here as ``the oligarchs.'' Under Yeltsin,
this group's insider practices and offshore dealings have come to
symbolize the way big business has thrived despite the rest of the
country, rather than fueling a national economic revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central question in Russia's economy today,'' said Sergei
Parkhomenko, editor of Itogi magazine, ``is whether Putin will
control the oligarchs or whether they will control him.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Only Vladimir Putin knows for certain where he wants to
take Russia as the nation's acting president. But if his visit last
week to the Railways Ministry is any indication, Russia may be in
for an interesting trip indeed.
</P>
<P>
   As the Moscow daily Kommersant reported, Putin performed the
rote ceremonial duties at a packed meeting of ministry employees
eight days ago, doling out awards and praising the railroads'
contribution to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But then his tone turned icy. Why, he asked, did the railroads
beseech the Kremlin for money when certain customers got special
shipping discounts? And was it not odd that the ministry had
granted certain unnamed people the rights to collect a mountain of
unpaid freight bills? And why was the ministry buying rails from
Japan when Russia's steel mills were idle and offering fire-sale
prices?
</P>
<P>
   Then he left, even before the flustered deputy prime minister
for industrial policy could read remarks congratulating the Kremlin
on its victory in that week's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary scene suggests there is more than one way to
look at Putin's pledge, made even before he became president on
Friday, to restore a strong central government to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Among Westerners, that promise mostly raises fears of a
crackdown on civil liberties or a return to authoritarian rule,
fears fanned by Putin's direction of the savage war in Chechnya.
But his admirers insist that what he truly wants to subjugate is
the untamed and fantastically corrupt Russian bureaucracy and
economy.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt which is the tougher task. President Boris
Yeltsin held immense power, but under his rule the ties between the
Kremlin and major state agencies, provincial governments and
industries steadily atrophied.
</P>
<P>
   The national tolerance of corruption _ bribes, after all, were
sometimes the only way to accomplish anything under Soviet rule _
allowed bureaucrats to ignore Moscow's dictates and to accumulate
fortunes at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, much of the bureaucracy remains under the control of
Soviet-era bureaucrats who are either ideologically opposed to the
Kremlin or simply indifferent to its demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, the power structures of our country remain,
according to the method of work and the personnel that they have,
in conflict with the new regime,'' said Anatoly A. Sobchak, the
former St. Petersburg mayor who is regarded as Putin's mentor.
``These aren't democratic structures that live in a democratic
state and are merely in opposition to the democratic state.''
</P>
<P>
   The new president, he said, ``is capable of making these power
structures loyal and to make them work for the new democratic
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians have heard all this before, of course, as recently as
1991, and it has yet to come to pass. And Russians have swallowed
promises of strong, benevolent and progressive rule, from Nicholas
II to Stalin, only to see them end up in chaos or autocracy or
both.
</P>
<P>
   The new president will inherit near-dictatorial powers in the
constitution which his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, pushed into law
after thwarting a communist-led coup in 1993. Yeltsin never fully
used those powers, either because of physical or political
infirmity or out of a belief they were not needed.
</P>
<P>
   Putin says he does not believe a new constitution is needed now.
But he also has indicated that he wants to make changes through the
system using the new plurality he won in parliament in last month's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Putin indicates in his own writings that he believes Russia
cannot enter the ranks of advanced nations until it roots out
Soviet traditions and bridges the ideological divide that pits the
communist third of the nation against the democratic remainder.
</P>
<P>
   In a special document, ``Russia at the turn of the millennium,''
published on a Kremlin internet site
(www.pravitelstvo.gov.ru/english/statVP(US)engl(US)1.html), he said
that Russia would be mistaken not to recognize communism's
accomplishments. ``But it would be an even bigger mistake not to
realize the outrageous price our country and its people had to pay
for that Bolshevist experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia needs a strong state power and must have it,'' he
wrote. But a strong state, he added, means ``a law-based, workable
federative state.'' And crucial to that, he added, are a
streamlined and corruption-free bureaucracy, a merit system for
hiring and rewarding government workers, a more powerful judiciary
and closer ties between Moscow and its regions.
</P>
<P>
   Putin backed up his call for reform with some sobering
statistics: Even if Russia's per-person gross domestic product were
to rise by 8 percent per year for the next 15 years, he wrote, the
nation would still only reach the level of present-day Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving the level of Britain or France would require a 10
percent annual growth rate _ and even then, Britain or France would
have to stand still.
</P>
<P>
   Investment has dwindled: Only 4.5 percent of the nation's
industrial equipment was less than five years old in 1998, compared
with nearly 30 percent in 1990. Except in the electricity and
raw-material industries, individual productivity is one quarter of
that in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such shortcomings can be overcome, he said, but only by devising
and swiftly carrying out a plan for the nation's restructuring and
recovery. ``The paramount word is fast,'' he wrote, ``and we have
no time for a slow start.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak, who recruited Putin to a team of economic experts when
he was St. Petersburg's reformist mayor in the early 1990s, said
the new president would benefit from his years as an intelligence
agent in East Germany, where he was in regular contact with Western
businesses and governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a convinced supporter of the market economy,'' Sobchak
said. ``But in contrast to the majority of Russian politicians, he
knows the western model of economic and political life not as a
outsider but from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not blindly transfer some of the recommendations of
the West onto Russia. And I don't think he'll repeat the mistakes
we made in the beginning of the '90s,'' when the country plunged
into capitalism without the system of laws and government
regulations needed to sustain it.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Sobchak said, he expects Putin to follow the example of
two American presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D.
Roosevelt, who amassed state power over the government and economy
to shape the capitalistic system that exists today.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt took on entrenched monopolies, helping small
businesses to thrive and competition to flourish. Franklin
Roosevelt reworked the federal government to aid the poor, improve
education and create a less crash-prone financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``His decisive interference in the economy during the Depression
saved America,'' Sobchak said of Franklin Roosevelt. ``I think
Putin has a wonderful opportunity to become for Russia what the
Roosevelts are for America. And if he does this, he'll become the
great president in the history of the country.''

   NASCAR marketers will also be the first to give their ubiquitous

that result in spectacular crashes. Replacement cars and, if
necessary, replacement drivers, will be ready to roar from the pit.
It will be a huge television ratings hit and _ throwing in

   In its second century, Major League Baseball could experience
new developments, and it could be business as usual. After the
first or second season of the new century, for example, depending
on when the current labor agreement expires, baseball could face
its ninth work stoppage in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries and offense will continue to escalate. The owners will
try again but fail again to curtail player salaries; the disparity
between star salaries and wages for everyone else will continue to
grow. Some inroads will be made in dealing with the disparity
between high-revenue and low-revenue clubs.
</P>
<P>
   When games routinely end with scores like 15-12, officials will
grudgingly take steps to help the downtrodden pitchers, raising the
mound a few inches from the 10-inch height that was legislated in
1968 and expanding the strike zone by enforcing the borders
provided in the rule book. Pitchers will throw fewer called balls,
resulting in shorter games.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series will become a true World Series when the major
leagues add teams in such countries as Mexico, Japan and Australia.
But an even more compelling event will be the World Cup of
Baseball, involving countries from all over the world, with major
league players competing for the countries of their birth.

   On an individual basis, Ken Griffey Jr. will challenge Hank
Aaron's career record of 755 home runs, and later in the century
Trey Griffey will pursue his father's total. But no one will
approach Cal Ripken's streak of 2,632 consecutive games played. Joe
DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak will also stand.

</P>
<P>
   The next 100 years hold intriguing possibilities for golf. The
sport continues to grow in popularity, and Tiger Woods has become
perhaps the world's most famous active athlete. Woods' career will
be a key for golf in the early 21st century, because if he remains
dominant for the next 10 to 15 years, his star power will only
attract more fans and more corporate dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Expect golf's global appeal to broaden, with men and women from
all parts of the world winning major championships. And there will
be more youngsters like Woods, Sergio Garcia, and Se Ri Pak ready
to win as professionals before they turn 21.
</P>
<P>
   But much of golf's future will depend on how well it capitalizes
on its current strength. For golf to continue to grow, it must
become more affordable and more accessible, giving more youngsters
from diverse backgrounds a chance to play regularly and to become
part of the game's future.

   Football
</P>
<P>
   The year is 2014, and NFL Commissioner Bill Parcells speaks at
the annual state-of-the-league address. His main topic: the number
of changes that took place in what was a hectic year for
professional football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year 2014 will be remembered as one of the busiest in
decades,'' the commissioner's opening statement begins. ``We've
expanded to 35 teams, with a franchise in Salt Lake City. The new
technology that allows fans watching the game at home on television
to listen in on actual huddles has been a rousing success. Our
first woman head coach went 18-2 in the regular season and we had
the first 70-yard field goal.''
</P>
<P>
   A question from the news media: ``Commissioner Parcells, the Los
Angeles Warriors just signed John ``Millisecond'' Flash to a
seven-year, $200 million contract. He was recently timed in the
40-yard dash at 3.99, making him the fastest human being ever. And
the Giants signed 400-pound offensive lineman Jessie
``Cholesterol'' Smith to a long-term deal. So my question is, are
players becoming too big and too fast?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad you asked that,'' Parcells replies. ``Lookit, 14
years ago I traded Vinny Testaverde so I could move up in the draft
and trade for Peter Warrick, who turned out to be the best receiver
Florida State ever had. And we now know the Ray Lucas-to-Warrick
combination is the best ever. My point is, the game evolves, it
gets faster, but it always stays the same great game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Commissioner, there is talk among ownership that you want to
return to coaching. Is that true?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no. Bill Belichick is the general manager and coach.
He's won three Super Bowls with the Jets. Coaching is a young man's
game. I retired from coaching at the end of the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is one thing I am considering. How does President
Parcells sound to you guys?''

Teams will share it wisely and so will the players as the league
grows to a healthy 40 franchises by 2025.
</P>
<P>
   Because players will be so big and skilled, teams will play with
either one fewer skater or on a bigger ice surface. In the next few
decades, the league will see many European coaches, several
African-American superstars and at least one female goalie. The

   The future of soccer is hard to miss. It comes pouring out of

Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The world's game is already in vogue for millions of Americans,
hyphenated or otherwise. Not relying on newspapers still stuck in
ancient formulae, soccer fans seek out the world's male superstars
where they are vastly available. Fans flick on the tube and marvel
at David Beckham's silky passes for Manchester United. Fans crank
up the Internet and follow the inexplicable burial of Roberto
Baggio at Inter Milan. Fans push a button and there is Rivaldo of
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The images on the screen put the domestic Major League Soccer in
refreshing perspective. It is all right to be secondary. The best
American lads must go overseas for the money and the challenge.
They will come back for international tournaments and show what
they have learned. In the meantime, Americans have a new love of
soccer _ Michelle Akers' passion; Gao Hong's flair; Sissi's romps;

   Besides the new rules, the International Tennis Federation will
change the Davis Cup format to a two-week, Olympic-style
competition that will be played at major sports venues.

   Prize money for the Grand Slam tournaments will continue to

 &HT;    Voters get break before big push
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most of the presidential candidates gave the
citizens of New Hampshire a break last week, but not Republicans
Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer caused a stir in Manchester when he told reporters that
the Vermont Supreme Court's decision recognizing gay couples ``was
in some ways worse than terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer explained that the nation could survive terrorist attacks.
But he worried that the decision would lead to a breakdown of
traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes met with three generations of the Shannon family in
Londonderry to tout his proposal to allow workers to invest their
payroll taxes in private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates were not totally absent from New Hampshire,
which holds the first primary Feb. 1. There was no holiday from the
TV ads for Republicans George W. Bush and John McCain and Democrats
Bill Bradley and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   New millennium brings new round of debates
</P>
<P>
   Remember the complaints from other Republican candidates that
Bush was running a ``yellow rose garden'' campaign (a Texas twist
on the expression used to describe an incumbent president's use of
the White House Rose Garden in his re-election campaign)? They
wanted a shot at him in debates and Bush was refusing to
participate. He took part in three of them in short order in
December.
</P>
<P>
   In January, everyone should get their fill of debates. As of
now, the Republicans will debate Thursday in New Hampshire, Friday
in South Carolina, Jan. 15 in Iowa and Jan. 26 in New Hampshire. In
addition, a Jan. 10 debate in Michigan will draw at least Forbes
and McCain. Bush will not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Bush jumps into Web with AOL site on tax plan
</P>
<P>
   Bush has joined Forbes and McCain in using the Internet to
advertise his campaign, offering to calculate for America Online
users how much they would save under his tax proposal.
</P>
<P>
   AOL users see the interactive banner ads when they log on.
Clicking on another ad, viewers can read about Bush's position on
various issues. The ads also provide links to his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised more than $160,000 through online contributions,
far less than Bradley and McCain, who each have raised more than $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bundle up, guys: It's cold where you're going
</P>
<P>
   The three Republican candidates atop the polls _ McCain, Bush
and Forbes _ will need plenty of warm clothes for January, much of
which will be spent in New Hampshire. McCain is planning 22 days of
campaign activity between Monday and Feb. 1, befitting the campaign
that has bypassed the Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses to make its stand in
New England. Bush will spend 14 or 15 days in the state, where he
trails McCain in polls. And Forbes will be in New Hampshire for 13
days. The magazine publisher is putting more emphasis on Iowa and
will be there all but one day between Jan. 11 and Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Udall's one-liners brighten McCain's campaign rallies
</P>
<P>
   The late Morris Udall ran for president only once, in 1976. Yet
he left a wealth of one-liners, many of which McCain repeats at
campaign events. He always credits his fellow Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   A Udall sampler:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Udall goes into a barbershop in New Hampshire and says, ``Hi,
I'm Mo Udall and I'm running for president.'' The barber replies,
``Yeah, we were just laughing about that this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New Hampshire voters demand an unusual amount of face time
with the candidates. Udall, on that topic: Asked what he thought of
Mo Udall, an undecided voter said, ``I don't know. I've only met
him twice.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP candidate plans raffle in opposition to gun control
</P>
<P>
   A Republican congressional candidate in Illinois has devised an
innovative way to raise money and make a point. Dr. Michael Curtiss
is raffling off a .45-caliber handgun ($600 value) and a
semiautomatic rifle ($750 value). All it takes is $5.
</P>
<P>
   Winners also will receive instruction ``in how to use the
weapons responsibly,'' according to a posting on Curtiss' Web site.
Curtiss notes that he ``has a genuine concern for the preservation
of 2nd Amendment Constitutional Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The raffle caught the attention of none other than G. Gordon
Liddy, Watergate burglar turned talk show host. Liddy ``applauded''
and endorsed Curtiss, who has two announced opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic incumbent Lane Evans is expected to seek re-election
in the 17th Congressional District, which borders Iowa.

FAITHFUL AWAIT SIGN OF SECOND COMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As the clock rolled into 2000 Saturday,
``Messiahcam'' was focused on the Golden Gate in the stone walls of
the Old City for those who believe the Messiah will return to walk
through the same passageway.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours leading up to midnight on New Year's Eve into early
Saturday, the ``Messiahcam'' Web site, which can be found at
www.messiahcam.org or www.olivetree.org, was registering up to
3,000 hits every two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Transmitting digital images of the Golden Gate every 30 seconds
via the Internet, the site got so busy around midnight that it kept
jamming.
</P>
<P>
   So even if the Messiah had returned, the cyber-faithful might
not have been able to see it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Darg, president of Virginia-based Daystar
International, which she calls a ``multimedia Christian ministry,''
set up the site a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't expecting the Lord to come back at the stroke of
midnight,'' says Darg. ``The purpose of the site is to watch and
pray for the return of the Messiah whenever that might occur.''
</P>
<P>
   But much of Darg's literature and her ministry builds the case
that specific signs _ such as the emergence of the State of Israel
in 1948 and its capture of East Jerusalem in 1967 _ are all divine
indications that the world is close to ``The End of Days,'' as the
time before the Second Coming is referred to in the apocalyptic
passages of the Book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Coming is a profound belief and hope for Christians
of all denominations, but the relatively small group of believers
that attempts to define exactly when it will happen and takes the
apocalyptic imagery of the Bible literally has gotten substantial
media coverage amid all the millennial hype.
</P>
<P>
   There were fears that the streets of Jerusalem would witness
mass suicides by apocalyptic groups, or that some extremist might
try to take violent action that would precipitate the ``war to end
all wars'' that Revelation foretells before the return of the
Messiah. Israeli security forces deported as many as 50 Christian
believers over the last months, and added 12,000 police and
military officers to patrol the streets.
</P>
<P>
   None of these dire predictions happened. Instead, the night was
one of quiet prayer by Catholics from around the world from the
Garden of Gethsemane up into the olive groves where Jesus is
believed to have spent his last hours before his trial and
crucifixion. Nearby, in the Garden Tomb, Protestant believers
gathered for a night of song and prayer to usher in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Just past midnight Saturday, the Mount of Olives, which the
Golden Gate faces and where Christians believe Jesus ascended and
where the Scriptures say he will return _ was crawling with the
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   But they were all members of the media, not believers.
</P>
<P>
   A small army of more than 100 reporters and photographers
searched everywhere for those Christian believers who follow
interpretations like Darg's that ``The End of Days'' is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters flocked to the Golden Gate, the eastern gate of
the Old City, believed to be the one that Jesus might have walked
through, when an apparently deranged man named Richard was detained
by Israeli police for yelling wildly about ``the mark of the
beast'' and ``the end times'' and other fragments from Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Hilsden, pastor of Jerusalem's King of Kings Church, said,
``It seems like the reporters were almost upset that nothing
happened. But the only people who I ever heard talking about the
new year as the time of the return of the Messiah were on
television and in newspapers. You do not hear that in churches.
There's no theological basis for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Gershom Gorenberg, a senior editor of the
Jerusalem Report and a specialist on millennialist movements, for
this small, potentially violent or self-desructive fringe, the dawn
of the millennium and the sense of failed expectations could lead
to rising frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failed expectations are one of the most volatile points for
anyone who has seriously expected the end,'' said Gorenberg. ``So
they will be running into this disappointment over the whole year
and beyond. . . . The level of emotion now goes up one step, not
down.''

LOTT IS WEIGHING A CHALLENGE TO UPSHAW
</HEADLINE>
   (With FBN-NOTEBOOK) 
(rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronnie Lott spent nine years with the San Francisco 49ers and
earned a reputation as one of the best safeties ever to play the
game. No one was more fearless as a player, or more respected by
his peers. Quite simply, he helped change the fortunes of the
franchise, earning five Super Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lott says he is hoping to change the way the NFL Players
Association does business and is strongly considering a run to
replace its longtime executive director, Gene Upshaw.
</P>
<P>
   If Lott does run, it will represent the first significant
challenge Upshaw has faced, because Lott is held in such high
esteem by many players. Before Lott agreed to be interviewed last
week, a small number of players from various teams were asked if
they would vote for him if he became a candidate. All said his
reputation for honesty alone would merit serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Four Giants said they would strongly consider voting for Lott, a
future Hall of Famer. When asked why, one veteran said: ``The times
I've spoken to him, he has been nothing but a straight-up guy. He's
a legend. He's very honest. He'd get some votes in this locker room
for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   And, most likely, in a lot of locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, now a pro football analyst for Fox, has flirted with the
idea of running for head of the union before, but decided against
it, feeling the time was not right. He is more serious about
running now, he said, because of his rising anger over what he
perceives to be the union's lack of dedication to nonstar players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is supposed to be the main part of the job, looking out
for the interests of all players, not just star players,'' Lott
said. ``Whether it is Michael Irvin catching passes in Dallas, or
Olindo Mare kicking field goals in Miami, or Victor Green with the
Jets, everyone should have a say. The way it is now, that is not
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think players are kept in the dark about issues on purpose.
That way the status quo is maintained. Gene and the NFL owners are
pretty comfortable with each other. I think owners like it that
way, because if the union is comfortable with the NFL, then the
union will never really push the league hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's offices were closed last week. An NFLPA spokesman
did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is clearly not a fan of Upshaw and other leaders of the
union. In 1997 he filed a lawsuit against union leaders, arguing
that Players Inc., the NFLPA's marketing arm, stole the idea of the
Super Bowl players' party from him and former Oakland running back
Marcus Allen, who joined Lott in the suit. The case is set for
trial in May. The NFLPA has denied the claims.
</P>
<P>
   Should Lott win the case and also beat Upshaw in an election, he
would be expected to donate any monetary judgments to charity in
order to avoid a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is exploring the exact procedure he would face in mounting
a challenge to Upshaw. For one thing, he would very likely need a
certain number of signatures from rank-and-file players on a
petition.
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw has presided over the largest growth ever in NFL player
salaries, the average player now earning about $1 million a year.
Medical and pension benefits have also increased. Pro football has
also enjoyed labor peace for more than a decade, and thus there are
many players who think Upshaw is doing a more than creditable job.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Lott said, the union's executive committee, the
small group of NFLPA officials who are instrumental in many key
decisions, needs reform. There should be term limits for executive
board members ``because the league is constantly changing,'' Lott
said. ``There is a tremendous amount of turnover among players. I
think you always need to have fresh faces on the executive
committee who bring fresh ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I've had players say to me, `How can we get some of
those people out of the union?' And I always say, `You can't the
way the system is set up.' The system needs to be changed so people
aren't on the executive board five years or 10 years or longer. The
same should go for the executive director.''
</P>
<P>
   Another complaint Lott said he had heard from players was the
general lack of guaranteed salaries. Football lags behind other
professional sports in that if a player signs for a four-year, $4
million salary, the entire amount is usually not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   For lower-tier players the situation is worse, Lott said. Not
only are most of their base salaries not guaranteed, but their
signing bonuses are usually low, making these players expendable.
Lott wants to see this situation changed, though persuading owners
to guarantee salaries would be his most difficult challenge.
</P>
<P>
   If Lott does attempt to become executive director, he will, in
the words of one veteran player, be a formidable opponent, and, if
he wins, a good leader. ``Ronnie is Ronnie,'' the player said.
``He's tough, and he would give Gene a good fight.''

   Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning is having an outstanding
season, but there is no question he is benefiting from the success
of running back Edgerrin James and wide receiver Marvin Harrison.
James and Harrison have combined for 3,672 yards, the
second-highest total in the 1990s by a running back/wide receiver
duo. James and Harrison may yet pass running back Emmitt Smith and
wide receiver Michael Irvin of Dallas, who combined for 3,751 yards
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Right behind James and Harrison is the St. Louis duo of Marshall
Faulk and Isaac Bruce. They have 3,520 yards this season.
</P>
<P>
   Blue in the Bayou
</P>
<P>
   This has been a miserable season for rookie running back Ricky
Williams. His New Orleans team has won three games. Coach Mike
Ditka has said Williams needs to improve his conditioning and has
even called him weird because he wears his helmet while doing
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Williams may have reason to be grouchy. His base salary for this
season, because of a highly questionable contract he signed after
becoming the No. 1 player in the draft, is just $175,000. He had
the chance to earn more than $3 million in incentives, but will get
only $50,000 because of his poor rushing numbers and the terrible
season the Saints have had.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ditka believes he will be back as coach next season.
If he does return, owner Tom Benson may ask for major changes in
his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Around the League
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Coach Mike Riley called the Pro Bowl snub of Chargers
linebacker Junior Seau a travesty. ... The Jets' defensive
coordinator, Bill Belichick, remains the No. 1 candidate to replace
coach Pete Carroll in New England. Coach Bill Parcells, meanwhile,
has already completed his book on the 1999 season. The manuscript
contains no hints about his future plans. ... With one Sunday left
in the regular season, 21 players have broken the 1,000-yard
receiving mark, the second-largest group ever. Eight players are
within 100 yards of 1,000. In 1995, 23 players had 1,000-yard
receiving seasons. ... The Baltimore Ravens recently added a
minority investor, Stephen Bisciotti, who also has an option to buy
the remaining 51 percent of the franchise from the principal owner,
Art Modell, in 2004. Yet Modell said, ``I plan on being in the NFL
for a long time.''

 &HT;    Odds and ends from the Outback Bowl
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The Outback Bowl claimed the title of ``First Bowl
Game of the New Year'' by starting at 11:07 a.m, 4 minutes and 50
seconds ahead of the Cotton Bowl. However, the Cotton Bowl beat it
to the final buzzer. The first quarter here lasted 50 minutes, the
first half 112 minutes, and, including overtime, the game ate up a
whopping 4 hours and 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Outback Bowl also set a standard for tightly-contested
matchups, becoming the first overtime game of the 2000s.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet inspiration
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Hap Hines had an indirect impact on more than the
placekicking Saturday. He said that his girlfriend's mother made a
chocolate pie for quarterback Quincy Carter, and Carter told him
the pie made the difference for him.
</P>
<P>
   The senior also revealed that he was gung-ho to kick the winning
field goal in overtime after Patrick Pass made a first down at the
Purdue 15, but he said, ``I've been around Coach (Jim) Donnan long
enough to know that his way's the right way and they did it just
perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   HInes came in three plays later for the 21-yard gamewinner.
</P>
<P>
   Local hero
</P>
<P>
   Purdue receiver Chris Daniels, who is from nearby Clearwater,
set a Purdue bowl game record with 12 receptions and finished the
season with 121 receptions for 1,232 yards, both school records.
``I heard stories that when he came in, he was kind of the deep
snapper and ninth-string receiver,'' said quarterback Drew Brees.
``He turned himself into one heck of a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Imperfect attendance
</P>
<P>
   Outback Bowl officials announced that 54,059 tickets had been
distributed in 66,005-seat Raymond James Stadium, although there
were far more empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   The sparse attendance was camouflaged since the red of the seats
matched the Bulldog colors. Because the game was not a sellout, it
was not shown in the Tampa area on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   No Sanks
</P>
<P>
   After Jasper Sanks fumbled with 2:11 left in the first half, he
never returned to the game. Sanks wound up with six yards on four
carries, and also lost two yards on his lone reception.
</P>
<P>
   Year of the Dog?
</P>
<P>
   Purdue coach Joe Tiller said fate wasn't on his team's side. ``I
guess the new millennium didn't have us winning this game,'' he
said. ``Maybe in the Chinese New Year, this is the year of the
Bulldog, woof, woof, woof.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad luck
</P>
<P>
   Entering the Outback Bowl, Purdue's Travis Dorsch ranked third
in the Big 10 and 10th nationally with 18-of-28 field goals. He'd
also made all 37 of his extra point attempts. But he got off on the
wrong foot when he missed the extra point following the second
touchdown, then missed field goals of 40 yards (third quarter), 38
yards (fourth quarter) and 43 yards (overtime).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long off-season,'' said the sophomore.
``I'll be watching a lot of tape and rededicating myself. As much
as I'm disappointed, I feel bad for those 17 seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the charts
</P>
<P>
   After missing the extra point, why did Purdue persist in trying
two-point conversions? The Boilermakers failed twice, when just one
point-after would have won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because like a fool, we have these charts,'' said Tiller. ``We
went for two when the charts said we should go for two. I can't
fault the charts. In 30 years it hasn't let me down...too often.''
</P>
<P>
   Long ball
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kilgo, who stepped in for Wynn Kopp at punter, averaged
48 yards on three punts. That set a Georgia bowl record for highest
punting average, breaking the mark of 47.3 yards set by Bucky Dilts
in the 1977 Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Worst ad placement
</P>
<P>
   Former Bulldogs basketball coach Tubby Smith's testimonial for a
homebuilder was placed on the same page as mug shots of the Georgia
football team in the official program.

GIANTS REACH END OF THE SEASON, BUT CHANGES COULD BEGIN SOON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday brings the final game of the New York Giants' regular
season, but there is little about this team that feels finished.
Uncertainty clouds the team picture even as hope still pervades it.
</P>
<P>
   For the Giants, Sunday could bring an extraordinary confluence
of events that sends them to the NFL playoffs. Or, they could lose
for the sixth time in their last eight games, a bewildering
second-half collapse for a team that was in first place of its
conference at the season's midpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants could conclude the season with a victory over Dallas
Sunday and finish 8-8, or they could be defeated and hand Giants
coach Jim Fassel his first losing season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Fassel would celebrate a second consecutive .500
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, 8-8 is better than 7-9,'' he said last week. ``But I'm
not happy with either one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants could display the kind of character and mettle the
team's co-owner Wellington Mara called for in his uncommon address
to the players on Wednesday, and yet, even if they rout the Cowboys
Sunday, 15 or 20 current Giants might still be playing their last
game with the franchise because there are 20 players on the roster
who will become free agents.
</P>
<P>
   It is a day that could be remembered as significant for the good
things that happened to the Giants, or a day remembered, tellingly,
as an example of the things that went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am watching everything very closely,'' Fassel said of
Sunday's game. ``It's true a lot of different scenarios can play
out. Every one means something to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenario the Giants long for the most is the one that is
probably the least likely. How else to describe something that has
not happened in 52 years?
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' only valid chance to make the playoffs begins with
an upset victory by the Arizona Cardinals in a 1 p.m. game at Green
Bay. Arizona, a franchise that had its origin in Chicago, has not
won in Green Bay since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   But if these Cardinals, led by quarterback Jake Plummer, can add
another inexplicable game result to a season of unexplainable
outcomes, then the Giants need only defeat the Cowboys to earn the
final NFC wild card playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Cowboys have motivation, too, and it is not
affected by the score of the Cardinals-Packers game. A Dallas
victory over the Giants sends the Cowboys into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Since little about this day can be commonplace for the Giants,
there is one other scenario that extends their season: If the
Packers win, the Giants can still make the playoffs if they defeat
Dallas by 56 more points than the Packers' margin of victory over
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Fassel to be blitzing 10 men or throwing deep
passes on every down in an attempt to score 75 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do whatever is reasonable to get us into the playoffs,''
Fassel said. ``But some of those things aren't reasonable. You
wouldn't play a very good game. At that point in time, you just
take your medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say the Giants will not play hard. Fassel, and
more importantly Mara, has demanded as much. And the coach said
that regardless of the outcome in Green Bay, he would be playing
all his regulars, including those who are injured, like running
back Joe Montgomery, who has a rib injury, and tight end Pete
Mitchell, who has a badly sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel and the team's management will be making personnel
evaluations Sunday. Because the Giants have lost to Minnesota, St.
Louis, Indianapolis and twice to Washington _ all teams headed to
the playoffs _ the team leaders are becoming convinced they do not
have enough championship-level players on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get in the off-season,'' Fassel said last week,
``that's the way you measure whether you want to keep this guy or
that guy. Is he going to help us win a championship? Not whether
he'll help us be 8-8. That's not the goal. If he can't help us win
a championship, then he doesn't have a place here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will face a number of off-season decisions on
pivotal, noteworthy players. Among the unrestricted free agents is
Phillippi Sparks, the team's starter at left cornerback since 1994.
Sparks may want more money than the Giants are willing to give him,
especially since he is likely to draw offers from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks' backup, Conrad Hamilton, is also an unrestricted free
agent, as is left tackle Roman Oben. So is nickel linebacker Scott
Galyon, who may leave because he wants a chance to start elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Galyon is a weakside linebacker, the position played by the
Giants' three-time Pro Bowler Jessie Armstead.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also have 11 restricted free agents, players who
other teams can bid on even if the Giants have the right to match
any offer. But it might be hard to hold on to all 11.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Tiki Barber and safety Sam Garnes are the biggest
names on the restricted free-agent list. The Giants will find a way
to keep Garnes, and they will probably use their leverage in the
process to make it hard for other teams to lure Barber away.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Christian Peter and linebackers Ryan Phillips
and Pete Monty are also restricted free agents. There is a chance
some team might take a shot at third-string quarterback Mike
Cherry, who is also a restricted free agent as soon as the season
ends.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the more veteran players, who in the NFL world of
nonguaranteed contracts, could be cut loose. Defensive tackle
Robert Harris, right tackle Scott Gragg and tight end Howard Cross
could each face an unsettling off-season as the Giants sort out
their needs and what they can afford under a tight salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is free safety Percy Ellsworth, a popular player and
the team's only real threat to intercept passes the last two
seasons. Ellsworth, another unrestricted free agent, probably will
not be pursued by the Giants this off-season because they made
safety Shaun Williams their first-round pick in 1998 and are paying
him accordingly. The Giants think that it is time for Williams to
get on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think about it, but it's a reality,'' Ellsworth
said, acknowledging that Sunday could be his last game with the
Giants. ``I'll just try to give them something good to remember me
by.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Sunday's game is trying to do the same thing for
the disjointed 1999-2000 Giants season.

<P>
   DALLAS -- Sacha Lancaster didn't have to point to the reason the
Texas Longhorns imploded in a 27-6 loss to Arkansas in the 64th
Cotton Bowl on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the third quarter they started bickering _ 'You got this
guy, No, you got that guy,' `` the Arkansas defensive tackle said
in assessing what went wrong with the Longhorns offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, they were never out of the game until
that happened. We just started laughing. We pointed it out to them.
They got mad.''
</P>
<P>
   They just didn't get even.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the Razorbacks narrowly avoided safeties on
back-to-back plays and turned a third-and-12 at the 1 into a
48-yard gain enroute to the go-ahead touchdown, momentum began
creeping Arkansas' way. When the Horns had to settle for a field on
the ensuing drive after getting a first-and-goal at the same 1-yard
line, it flat jumped on the Razorback's Winnebago.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas, an up and down team that had beaten Fiesta Bowl bound
Tennessee but lost to 3-8 Louisiana State this season, was up when
it counted most in the second half, scoring the last 17 points of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   For the third-straight game, all losses, the Longhorn defense
played well but didn't get much help from its offensive
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were inept on offense,'' Coach Mack Brown said. ``We
couldn't run the ball. When you can't run the ball, you can't
protect. It goes back to their guys whipping our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas (9-5) gave up eight sacks -- that's 20 in the last three
games -- and set school bowl record lows for average yards per rush
and net yards rushing and suffered through their worst rushing game
ever (minus-27 yards). It won't challenge the school-record low of
6 yards they set against Nebraska because bowl games don't count
toward school records.
</P>
<P>
   That would be about their only break of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Playing without four players, including team MVP and defensive
end Aaron Humphrey, Big 12 record-setting receiver Kwame Cavil, who
were suspended for unspecified rules violations this week, the
Horns proceeded to get beaten up physically as well. Quarterback
Major Applewhite injured his left knee trying to escape a rusher in
the third quarter and was helped to the sideline and carted off to
the lockerroom with what looked to be a serious injury. A school
spokesman said there was considerable swelling and he'll have a
magnetic resonance imaging test early this week. His status for
spring drills, which begin Feb. 21, is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams ace Terrol Dillon was also knocked out of action
early with ankle and thigh injuries and didn't return, though the
Horns' punt coverage didn't suffer.
</P>
<P>
   With Applewhite gone, the job of trying to lead the Horns back
fell to freshman Chris Simms, who was promised only a series in
each half but who played most of the second half, completing 9 of
18 passes for 91 yards and leading the Horns offense to the
Arkansas 7 in the fourth quarter, only to throw four straight
incompletions.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had gone into the game hoping to use more three- and
four-wide receiver offenses and to widen the split of their tight
ends to from one to three yards, all with the intent of spreading
out the Hogs' defense. But the loss of Cavil and an ankle injury to
backup flanker Jeremy Jones in practice Thursday caused offensive
coordinator Greg Davis to tweak the game plan. Texas didn't use the
spread as much, and Arkansas stopped the run and pressured
Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if all the Longhorns' offensive woes over the last 10
touchdownless quarters can be traced to the lack of a consistent
running game, Davis said, ``I don't think that's an
oversimplification.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game the Horns came up short on third down. Though
they completed 4 of 6 passes on third-down in the first half, none
resulted in first downs. Davis said the Horns coaches pulled in the
reins to steady an offense missing Cavil, who had a hand in 33
percent of the Horns' passing yards this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the ballgame we wanted to settle them down, throw
without regard to down and distance,'' Davis said. ``We were trying
to settle them down and get them confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamel Thompson, who drove down to campus with Cavil three
Augusts ago when both were reporting as freshman, took his friend's
place. He had Cavil's number -- he wrote the numbers of his
suspended teammates on white tape on his shoes to let them know he
was thinking of them -- but didn't have his numbers, catching four
passes for 33 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Redding, filling in for Humphrey at left end, had four tackles,
deflected a pass and had a sack, one of the Longhorns' three. The
Longhorn defense played admirably, holding Arkansas to only 127
yards and intercepting two passes. Freshman Cedric Cobbs, who
scored two touchdowns and was named the game's Outstanding
Offensive Player for his 15-carry, 98-yard performance, though it
should be noted that the Longhorns where obviously in trouble when
their deep snapper (Hunter McWilliams) was credited with twice as
many tackles (2) and their All-American defensive tackle (Casey
Hampton).
</P>
<P>
   The Horn defense nearly turned the momentum of the game,
dropping Arkansas quarterback Clint Stoerner for a 2-yard loss that
the Horns thought was a safety -- in the post-game press conference
Brown looked up toward assistant Big 12 commissioner Donnie Duncan
in the back of the room and said, ``I can't talk about WAC
officials either, can I Donnie?'' Brown said. On the next play they
held Cobbs for no gain, forcing a third-and-12.
</P>
<P>
   Horn cornerback Ervis Hill bit on a stick-and-go route -- with
receiver Anthony Lucas faking an eight-yard hitch and going deep --
and Stoerner led Lucas for a 48-yard gain. Six plays later Arkansas
scored to take a 10-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Texas drove to the Arkansas 1 on its next drive, but designated
touchdown scorer Chris Robertson was stopped for no gain,
Applewhite completed an out pattern to Chad Stevens for no gain and
then Robertson was thrown for a 5-yard loss on a pitch left. Kris
Stockton added a 22-yard field goal, but the Horns lost any chance
at taking control.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' pregame motivational slogan was hinged on a win on Jan. 1
for the Horns' 10th victory of the season and a spot in the top 10.
They even got that backwards -- instead of 1-10-10, they got
10-10-1 -- what their overall record falls to in 21 Cotton Bowl
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fought. We didn't fight _ we didn't fight as hard, put it
like that,'' said UT cornerback Ahmad Brooks. ``That's
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the season we said our motto was 'No
excuses,' no matter what got in our way,'' said senior fullback
Ricky Brown. ``We still stand behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster, his cheeks covered with greasepaint and his blond
hair braided, said he figured the Horns were ripe for the taking
when both squads attended a banquet last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed our highlight films -- of course, their highlight
film was much longer _ and they were like, yeah, okay,'' he said.
``When ours was on, we all got crazy. We knew then their momentum
was not up to our level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' said UA safety Kenoy Kennedy,
``if they stayed out and partied or what. They just weren't in
it.''

 &HT;    Millennium coverage kept couch potatoes satisfied
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most anticipated new year in a millennium, and we
watched it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of the year 2000's arrival showed that TV has
transformed us not into a global village, but a global couch. By
today, the whole country takes for granted a hundred New Year's
images from around the world: a wildly exploding Eiffel Tower; an
old man and young boy rowing a canoe out into the Pacific in
Kiribati; the spider-like climbers on Sydney's opera house. People
suddenly know Tonga, know Wellington is New Zealand's capital, know
who made the crystal ball that dropped in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The morning-to-midnight (and then some) coverage of this New
Year's Eve was mostly a bust for news, but a boon for TV as
international tour guide. The whole world was reduced to niche
programming, and even broadcast TV became more like a special free
weekend preview of the Discovery Channel. All the Y2K glitch
expectations and terrorist rumors that mobilized the media in the
first place left platoons of virus-hunting reporters with little to
say or do.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday morning, ABC's Sam Donaldson, stuck the previous day
cooling his heels at the Y2K command center in Washington (``We're
spinning cobwebs here,'' he moaned), snarled: ``Still no major acts
of terrorism to report. No Y2K problems...'' Still, there was hope
in his voice...
</P>
<P>
   It was kind of a relief. We've come to expect TV to
overcompensate when news doesn't arrive on cue _ to pretend like
there's news whether there's news or not. Those great gaps of
nothingness that TV pretended to fill during the Clinton-Lewinsky
scandal, and the deaths of Princess Diana and John Kennedy Jr. _
they were like dress rehearsals for covering the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Faced on Friday with nothing but breaking news-free air _ except
for the wee-hours exceptions of CNN turning to the hostage release
in Afghanistan and Russian president Boris Yeltsin's resignation,
events ABC gave lip service to _ TV finally just let the air fill
itself.
</P>
<P>
   It was a curious experiment for ABC. The network played at being
CNN for a day, keeping its news division _ and, with a slightly
gimmicky feel, Jennings _ on 24 straight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the very edge of the millennium, you hearty
souls,'' a confident, bright-eyed Jennings offered Friday at 4:50
a.m., striding around a hangar-like studio that overlooked Times
Square, which he occassionally waved out to, as if giving a papal
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   But a few hours past midnight _ having gone through a daybreak
brown jacket, a midnight tux and a party's-over sweater _ Jennings
started to act a little like the up-all-night lab rat he'd become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you'll forgive me, but having been here almost 24
hours, you get a little sentimental,'' he said around 3 a.m. Then
he choked up and his voice cracked while he thanked people he
worked with.
</P>
<P>
   But it worked, too. TV can be a swell friend _ no matter what
else it is, it's always there for us _ and seeing the smooth,
worldly Jennings no matter when we tuned in was an odd, TV kind of
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was also something a disorienting about it: a 21st
century news-entertainment warp that made one anxious about what's
to come. ABC billed the news that preceded Jennings' arrival Friday
morning as its ``Millennium Pre-Game Show,'' a title that sounded
worse than glib when the news was about hijackers and a Russian
president. When President Clinton appeared at the White House
around 11 a.m. to make a statement about Yeltsin, ABC ignored it,
and stuck instead with the midnight celebration in Beijing (CNN and
Fox News both followed Clinton, though CNN went to a split-screen
of Clinton and China's new year).
</P>
<P>
   CNN, meanwhile, seemed on the defensive much of the time _ in
ABC, it finally had someone bigger than the Fox News clowns to
compete with all day. (Even PBS often showed the same views from
around the world as CNN.)
</P>
<P>
   There were also times, especially early on, when CNN hyped
itself with the unseemliness of an entertainment-driven broadcast
network. On Thursday night, World Today anchor Wolf Blitzer chirped
during the newscast that ``24 hours from now, CNN will be in its
16th hour of millennium coverage!'' He then introduced a
five-minute promo voiced by Larry King. When that ended, Blitzer
slid seamlessly into his next item: ``Let's take a closer look now
at the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN appeared to be playing at entertainment the same way ABC was
playing at news. The confounding thing is, by the time we reached
the year 2000, both sort of succeeded. Turned out all they really
had to cover was a party.
</P>
<P>
   TV had us on the couch. The question for this new century: How
do we want it to keep us there?

Hokies' aspirations should worry Seminoles
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ At the turn of a new century, when there is so
much time spent reliving the past, the Florida State football
program can look across the line of scrimmage at Nokia Sugar Bowl
opponent Virginia Tech and get a glimpse of history.
</P>
<P>
   Its own.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1-ranked Seminoles vs. the No. 2 Hokies could be big
brother vs. little brother.
</P>
<P>
   You know how it is. He wants to walk like you and talk like you.
He wants to dress like you and act like you and, yes, eventually
even screw up enough courage to take a whack at you.
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what will happen Tuesday night inside the
roaring, boiling caldron of noise at the Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're ready,'' says Virginia Tech's All-American
defensive end and Lombardi Award winner Corey Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for more than just a long-shot Hail Mary attempt at an
upset. Ready to line up and compete evenly. Ready to follow in the
footsteps of the Seminoles. Ready to show a college football world
that spent most of 1999 questioning Virginia Tech's credentials
that a new year, a new era, a new major contender has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very aware of what they've done,'' says Florida State
coach Bobby Bowden. ``I think there is a pretty good comparison of
Virginia Tech's program to ours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 24 years and (Tech head coach) Frank Beamer has
been there, what, 10 or 11 years? I'd say he has their program
where we were at about the same time. He's done it very much the
same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamer has been in charge of the Hokies for 13 years. But who's
counting? Especially when the only number that matters is No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State breaks through
</P>
<P>
   And nobody knows better than Bowden what it means for a program
that has been climbing steadily up the rankings to finally get that
opportunity to reach the top rung on the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1987, Bowden's 12th season in Tallahassee, Fla., when
the Seminoles took the big step up to the elite level. Florida
State had finished seven of the previous 11 seasons in the Top 25,
but then began a streak of 12 top-five finishes, including a
national title won at the 1994 Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   So who says history can't repeat itself?
</P>
<P>
   Along come the Hokies out of Blacksburg, Va., making their
seventh straight bowl appearance and destined to finish in the Top
25 rankings for the sixth time in seven years. What's more,
Virginia Tech has used the talents of redshirt freshman quarterback
Michael Vick to make the big leap.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, it was regarded as an upset to beat Alabama in
the Music City Bowl, and now the Hokies are mere 5{-point underdogs
to the blue-blooded Seminoles with the national championship on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   From little-known to 11-0. From outsiders to outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Florida State. For the Seminoles, in a way, it is like
trying to run from their shadow. Or reflection in the mirror. Or
that annoying little brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida State's program under Bobby Bowden and level of
consistency is exactly where we're trying to reach,'' Beamer says.
``We've been working hard to get up onto the national level for a
long time and we have built toward that level steadily. Only eight
schools can say they've been to a bowl game for the past seven
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of our consistency. I think that's a key to
Florida State's reputation. I truly believe we have everything at
Virginia Tech that it takes to play at that high level every year.
We've got a great state for football, we have great facilities and
play in a great conference. I don't see why Virginia Tech should
not be able to play at a top level every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech on the verge
</P>
<P>
   Beamer credits the Big East Conference, its TV contracts and its
Bowl Championship Series tie-in as key ingredients in the rise of
the Hokies to this shot at glory. But just as critical has been his
team's ability to deliver. In 1995, the unheralded Hokies smashed
Texas 28-10 in the Sugar Bowl to complete a hello-look-at-us 10-2
season and have not backslid since.
</P>
<P>
   BYU was a one-year wonder as an elite-level team. Not so with
Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came here and beat Texas, it was important that it was
a national team that we played, a good team,'' Beamer says. ``When
we were able to beat them, I thought people really began to look at
us a little differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in order to become the kind of program that Florida
State is now, what you do is just continue taking steps. Sometimes
it's little steps and sometimes it's big steps. The idea and the
goal is to become them.''
</P>
<P>
   The way to do it is to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're the Seminoles, you have to wonder, and maybe worry, if
the little brother isn't so little anymore.

   HONOLULU _ All over the island, noise.
</P>
<P>
   The first explosions went off before the sun slid down the
horizon in purple-orange ribbons, before the crystal ball dropped
in Times Square, before New Zealand's New Year's, even.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as night fell, the rockets began flying from the roofs of
high-rise buildings off Waikiki Beach, from second-story windows in
short, stout houses west of downtown and from the middle of the
roads, everywhere. Legally, the fireworks were not supposed to
start before 9 p.m. Yet by then, the cacophony was such that
conversations had to be shouted or mimed or postponed.
</P>
<P>
   No one cared that the New Year was old news around the world by
the time it would strike midnight here, in the last state in the
country, five hours after Times Square, to celebrate the
millennium. The later the hour, the louder the celebrations became.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists were flabbergasted. ``We didn't think it would be so _
exuberant,'' said Hugh Williams, who comes from Britain and lives
in San Diego. He and his wife, Elizabeth, were awaiting the
witching hour at the Aloha Tower Marketplace, one of the island's
main celebration points. She could not help holding her forefingers
in her ears. ``It sounds like an air war,'' she said. ``A person
could go deaf after this.''
</P>
<P>
   The formal celebrations here looked much like the spectacles
staged in cities around the globe. At midnight, streams of
fireworks lighted the sky as crowds watched shoulder to shoulder,
open-mouthed.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest celebrations were in old neighborhoods where
families had stockpiled fireworks as though they might be called
upon to fire up the island all by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Kalihi had to be one of the loudest, smokiest neighborhoods of
all. The air was thick and gray, with clouds of gun powder that hit
you in the face, clutched your throat and masked your eyes.
Residents strung up strands of thousands and thousands of
firecrackers on pyramid-shaped trellises created just for the
occasion. Families held barbecues in car ports, with several
generations, from great-grandmothers to young children, partaking
in the fireworks' shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, it gets louder and louder, bigger and bigger,''
said Gayle Reese, who said he never lighted 50,000 firecrackers at
once. ``Every year, you hear, oh, we're going to ban the fireworks.
But if they ban the fireworks, there would be a lot of unhappy
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks are a long tradition here, but their use has grown in
recent years. Calls for a statewide ban on fireworks use by private
citizens have grown too. Last year, there were more people lighting
more fireworks than ever, which led city officials to worry what
would happen this very big New Year's Eve. When fireworks went on
sale Christmas Day, and stores began reporting record sales,
officials worried even more.
</P>
<P>
   One man was critically injured after getting hit in the back of
the head with shrapnel from exploding fireworks on Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the peace, if not the quiet, of Honolulu, the city's
police chief, Lee Donohue, stationed 1,100 officers on duty, twice
as many as last New Year's Eve and three times as many as on an
ordinary Friday night. The Fire Department added reinforcements,
much needed, it turned out, to answer the 107 calls that came in
through midnight, as compared with 77 calls the same night last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In Kalihi, where the police had confiscated some of the more
than 13 tons of illegal fireworks (aerial fireworks and fireworks
that travel more than 12 feet in any direction) they discovered
throughout the city since Dec. 21, Reese said he thought the
neighborhood had the best fireworks show in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Someone mentioned that the New Year's fireworks display in
Greenwich, England, 10 hours ahead of here, was so spectacular it
could be seen from space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' Reese said. ``But Martians will be able to hear us
tonight.''

<P>
   Through it all _ the Olympic gold medal for the long jump, the
world record that stood for 23 years, the private audiences with
heads of state _ Bob Beamon always felt like the untouched,
unloved, unwanted child he was raised to believe he was.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the outpouring of affection from an adoring public nor
the love he finally found after four failed marriages could make up
for the neglect and physical abuse he suffered as a child growing
up in South Jamaica, Queens. What Beamon remembers most about his
childhood were the stories his father, James, and his paternal
grandmother, Bessie, who raised him, told him about his mother,
Naomi Brown Beamon. His mother died at age 25 when Beamon was 8
months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said my mother never held me,'' recalled Beamon, who was
in New York in early December to accept an award from Sports
Illustrated, which cited his record-setting long jump during the
1968 Olympics as one of the 10 greatest sports events of the
century. ``When I was born, they said she left me in the hospital.
Beyond that, nobody talked about my mother or her side of the
family. It was one of those hush-hush things.''
</P>
<P>
   In his recently published autobiography, ``The Man Who Could
Fly'' (Genesis Press), Beamon describes how, at age 35, he finally
summoned the courage to confront his grandmother about a lifetime
of things left unsaid. Only then did he discover he had been lied
to.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had his mother held him, there was visual proof of it.
A black-and-white photograph shows his mother standing on a street
corner holding her son in her arms. His mother, who had
tuberculosis at the time of his birth, died shortly after the
picture was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture was incredible in terms of what I'd heard, that
she never held me,'' Beamon said. ``It was communication with my
mother and I. So when my wife and I were writing this book, things
started to come together and make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamon found out that the secrecy surrounding his mother's life
and the estrangement between the Brown and Beamon families were
brought about because his mother, who had been physically abused by
her husband, became pregnant with Bob when her husband was in
prison. Beamon's biological father was a physician who worked at
the hospital where his mother worked as a nurse's aide. His mother
never told the doctor about the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't take me home because she was too ill to care for me
and because my daddy had threatened to kill me if she ever brought
me to his house,'' Beamon said. He was sent to live with his
grandmother in Harlem, while his half brother, Andrew, who was
mentally retarded, lived with his mother in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Beamon had cause to become another one of the countless
poverty-stricken urban youths consumed by the lures of the streets,
drugs or violence. Instead, he rose above circumstance through
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Beamon may have gone to school in what he described as his
grandfather's ``prewar, two-sizes-too-big'' clothes, he may have
gone to bed hungry and he may gone through his young life untouched
by loving arms, but he knew how to jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could jump higher than the older boys,'' writes Beamon, who
at 6 feet 4 inches was also a talented basketball player. ``Even
when I was in elementary school, everybody always wanted me on
their team.''
</P>
<P>
   As a student at Jamaica High School, Beamon came under the
tutelage of Larry Ellis, the renowned track coach, and was named to
the all-American track and field team as well as the all-city
squad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, his senior year, Beamon was ranked second in the long
jump in the United States and received a track-and-field
scholarship to the University of Texas at El Paso. Three years
later, on a humid October afternoon in Mexico City, Beamon soared
through the thin air, landing 29 feet 2{ inches later into a sand
pit of Olympic glory. Mike Powell broke the record in 1991, but
Beamon still holds the Olympic record.
</P>
<P>
   The jump, once deemed by many as the single greatest individual
achievement in sports, seemed so surreal to Beamon, it has taken
years for him to fully appreciate its magnificence.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much was going on with the black athletes threatening to
boycott the games and all the stuff in my personal life and the
problems back at UTEP,'' said Beamon, a soft-spoken man with an
acquired flair for fashion.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Beamon was living through an unhappy marriage to a
former high school girlfriend he believed to be pregnant with his
child _ she was not _ and had lost his athletic scholarship after
he and eight other members of the university's track team boycotted
a meet at Brigham Young University. The team was protesting
references in the Book of Mormon that castigate the black race as
inferior.
</P>
<P>
   What Beamon does remember about Mexico City, beyond the image of
Tommie Smith and John Carlos standing on the awards podium with
black-gloved fists raised above their bowed heads, was that his
high school sweetheart was in the stands cheering him on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with all the competitions I had been in since I was 17, I
never had a loved one or family member in the stands rooting for
me,'' he wrote. ``Just from that personal point of view, I knew
that this was even more special than I had ever imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   These days life is sweet for Beamon, now 53. He lives in Miami
and is happily married to Milana Walter Beamon, a film producer,
who helped him co-write his book. He has a new job as director of
athletic development at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton.
His book tour is playing to receptive audiences. And a public
service announcement he filmed for the Children's Court Centennial
Communication Project, a program to commemorate the 100th
anniversary of Juvenile Court that interviews 25 people whose lives
have been changed by judges or other officers of the court, is
being shown across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he still longs for those lost shared moments of
his childhood and youth. So Beamon, who was not allowed to get
close to his mother's side of the family, is making up for lost
time.
</P>
<P>
   He and his cousin Diane Brown Brisbane, his mother's brother's
daughter, talk often on the telephone. Brisbane was the relative
who located the only surviving print of Beamon and his mother and
attended his book signing in Manhattan in November. He has also
established ties with his great-aunt, Emmie King, who wanted to
raise Beamon and tried, unsuccessfully, to locate him and his
brother, who died in 1993. Beamon later found out that his aunt and
uncle were literally just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Naomi died, I kept asking about her children and I never
got an answer,'' King recalled. ``Bob shouldn't have had to go
through life thinking he was unwanted because that wasn't the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 2, when Beamon rose from his seat at Madison Square
Garden to accept his award, his wife, Aunt Emmie, her companion,
George Butler, Brisbane and her son, Al, 35, were present in the
audience. This time around, Beamon had family cheering for him. &QL;

BOBBY BOWDEN AT 70, AND WINNING MORE THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Fla., Va., Texas, Ill., W.Va., Ala., Kan. Ky., Ga., La.)  (jw) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The coach is looking for soup in his
kitchen, something warm to take to the couch while he puts up his
feet and watches a nature show and lets his head clear from the
cold he always manages to catch around the holidays. For an hour at
least, until the wives of his assistant coaches arrive for a gift
exchange, Bobby Bowden does not have to be Bobby Bowden, the
kindly, homespun icon of Florida State football.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he can be tired and 70 years old. He can be free of the
meetings and game films and having to put names with the numbers
and faces of some 80 kids a half a century younger than him.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight hours ago, Bowden flew to Dallas and back to visit a
high school recruit. There have been two crisply paced staff
meetings, where the coach consulted his voluminous notes and
tersely told his assistants what they needed to do if Florida State
was going to win a second national title, if, after 34 years and
303 career victories as a head coach, Bowden was going to complete
his first undefeated season by beating Virginia Tech in the Sugar
Bowl on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For four more hours, he has stood alone on a tower above the
practice field and scratched more notes for more terse
instructions. In between, he has signed dozens of footballs and
pictures and answered hundreds of pieces of mail _ even dictating
individual letters to members of a flag football team in Bartlett,
Ill. He has taken two naps on his office couch and dozed off
another time or two while watching game film.
</P>
<P>
   Now at home, the TV drowns out the Christmas carols his wife,
Ann, plays on the compact disc player. The rustle of Bowden's
garnet and gold Seminoles sweat suit precedes him every time he
pops his head around the corner to ask Ann whether the salad is for
him. How about the ham? And which button turns off the music?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like most old people,'' says Ann Bowden, who through 50
years, 6 children and 21 grandchildren has been the coach's wife.
``We've got satellites and all this stuff, but if we push a wrong
button we don't know how to get it to work again. We remember
things 30 years ago, but forget where we put our keys this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach, indeed, has made concessions to age. He rides a golf
cart to the practice field. He has turned over the play-calling to
his offensive coordinator, Mark Richt. More often than he likes,
Bowden must greet some of his players with a catch-all ``buddy''
when their names don't immediately find their way to the tip of his
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing that has not dimmed as Bowden squints his way
through the twilight of his coaching career has been his success.
For the third time in four years, Florida State (11-0) is playing
for a national championship. For the 13th consecutive year, his
team will finish in the top four in the national rankings and close
out a season with 10 victories or more.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden dawdles in his kitchen and spends too much time on the
sofa when he is home. When the man who has tried to return
``dadgum'' to the American lexicon, however, crosses his arms,
shuts his eyes and remembers a head coaching career that began in
1955 at South Georgia College, he spits out game scores and
players' names that span three seasons of a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started I had more a big brother relationship
with my team,'' Bowden said. ``Then it evolved into a father-son
thing and now I'm more like a grandfather _ a little more patient
and forgiving. Maybe softer.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled. Once a 100-yard football field is marked off
and 22 players are on the field, Bowden is as hard-nosed and
precise as the war generals he spends his off hours reading about.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Saturday, 45 minutes before practice began, the coach
motored his golf cart to the practice field and parked all alone as
he does every day. It is his sacred quiet time and no one dares to
bother him _ not assistants, not players. In fact, when an errant
punt bounced in his direction and threatened to disturb his peace,
several of those beefy young Seminoles cringed and tried to will
the ball to bounce away from Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   If the icon has gone soft, it has not affected his sense of
order. Though he has cut back his hours and likes to say he now
only ``coaches his coaches,'' when Bowden ascends that steel
platform at the start of each practice, every Seminole assistant,
trainer and player knows who is in command.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Buckley, the former Seminole defensive back now playing
for the Miami Dolphins, dubbed it the ``Tower Of Power.'' It is
where Seminoles who blew a blocking assignment or botched a pass
route glance furtively, hoping that Bowden was concentrating on
some other part of the field or writing in his notebook. His
assistants do not bother looking; they know Bowden has recorded the
errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dread getting those notes in the staff meetings in the
morning,'' said Dave Van Halanger, the strength and conditioning
coach who played for Bowden at West Virginia and has been an
assistant at Florida State for 17 years. ``He doesn't miss
anything. You know when it's coming.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is in his office, when a half-chewed cigar is jammed in
his mouth, that Bowden most resembles the great military men he so
admires. He insists on answering every bit of mail. His longtime
assistant, Sue Hall, is constantly taking polite but firm orders
over the intercom as he scribbles his name through a four-foot pile
of mementos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough guy to work for,'' Hall said. ``He wants things
done his way and wants it done now. You don't run something this
big without a certain regimen and pace.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   By studying Patton, MacArthur and Rommel, Bowden has created
something this big _ Florida State football. In the process, he
joined Bear Bryant, Pop Warner, Amos Alonzo Stagg and Joe Paterno
as the only major-college coaches to win 300 games. He doesn't care
how cliche it sounds to link war and football; they have been his
passions since he was bedridden with rheumatic fever as a
13-year-old in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   For six months, Bowden listened to World War II on the radio,
imagining how the great generals' feigns and flanking maneuvers
looked on the battle field. He shared the room with his
grandfather, Robert Cleckler who was of German descent, so he paid
special attention to enemy movements.
</P>
<P>
   From Rommel, Bowden learned a lesson about strategy. From
Patton, MacArthur and the victors, he learned two traits that
embody his Florida State program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rommel was a great tactician _ he knew how to think in
surprises,'' Bowden said. ``He could do more with less than any of
the great generals. They all demonstrate discipline and that you
need reserves so if you're getting annihilated on one front, you
can attack somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The traits that would help Bowden claim his spot in college
football history were in place in 1955 when, as a 25-year-old, he
took his first head coaching job at South Georgia College. He won
22 games there, but they don't count on his record because at the
time it was a two-year school.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he showed a knack for recruiting. His team was
culled from farm boys and returning veterans. He plucked his
assistant and childhood friend, Vince Gibson, from a higher paying
job as a high school coach in Florida. ``I took a $900 pay cut and
left the beach to make $3,600 a year because Bobby sold me on the
power we could build up there,'' says Gibson, who went on to coach
Kansas State, Louisville and Tulane. He will play host to a party
for Bowden, the South Georgia team and their Birmingham friends in
New Orleans before the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is tough.
</P>
<P>
   In his second season, after South Georgia had lost its opener,
Bowden addressed his ``boys'' _ it didn't matter many were older
than him, he was the coach _ about rumors he had heard about their
breaking training. He asked them to raise their hands if it was
true. Seventeen hands went up _ 17 scholarships were taken away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Bobby is that he comes off as such a nice,
sweet Southern boy that people underestimate him,'' Gibson said.
``He's a tough guy and can be a hard one when he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is loyal.
</P>
<P>
   Every year since, he has driven to Georgia for the reunion of
those teams. ``You go to those reunions,'' Gibson said, ``and you
got guys 65 years old who worship Bobby like a father.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two more head coaching stops that shaped Bowden
before he arrived in Tallahassee in 1976. In 1959, he became head
coach at his alma mater _ Howard, now Samford University _ in
Birmingham. Down the road in Tuscaloosa, Bryant was in his second
year of building Alabama into a power. Bowden often made the
50-mile drive to watch and learn. He saw how the military principle
of reserves worked in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't one of his guys, but he was cordial and helpful,''
Bowden said. ``He knew I could help him out. In those days, Coach
Bryant monopolized players because he had so many scholarships.
Each spring, he'd have an assistant coach walk me around the field
with a list of guys who weren't going to play much. They'd ask me
who I wanted and then they'd talk the boys into transferring to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bowden went 31-6 in four years at Samford, he returned to
the assistant-coaching ranks _ including a stint at Florida State _
before being named coach of West Virginia in 1970. There, he went
42-26 over six seasons and learned a tough lesson: the game is a
business. After finishing 4-7 in 1974, some Mountaineer fans hanged
him in effigy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd probably still be there if that didn't happen,'' Bowden
said. ``It taught me people are fickle and you got to do what's
best for you.''
</P>
<P>
   When Florida State called in 1976, Bowden was thinking short
term. Both his and Ann's mothers were widows in Birmingham, and
Tallahassee was just a six-hour drive. Besides, the coach thought
that sooner rather than later, Alabama or Auburn would be ready to
bring him home as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have facilities and the salary wasn't that
great,'' Ann Bowden said. ``Frankly, I thought Bobby was ready to
go to a big-time program.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead Bobby Bowden built one. Warrick Dunn, Deion Sanders and
more than 40 other Seminoles are now in the National Football
League. In athlete-rich Florida, Bowden found the raw talent to
construct his football reserve. He went 5-6 his first season and
has not been under .500 since. The Seminoles have gone to bowl
games 18 straight years. Bowden has visited housing projects in
Miami and farms in the Florida panhandle in pursuit of players. He
can tick off recruiting adventures: the stoned grandfather who did
not move in his rocking chair, the baby sister who fell asleep in
his lap, the pecan pies a mama made in South Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like people,'' Bowden said of recruiting. ``I like meeting
their daddies and grandmas and visiting with them. It's not work at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   And they like him _ so much so that they entrust him with their
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden concedes that his players do not drop into his office
just to talk as much as they used to. He attributes it to the
distance of generations and perhaps to the Bear-like status he has
earned across the South. But just like members of those South
Georgia teams, his current players idolize him. Still, when his
star wide receiver Peter Warrick was arrested in a shopping mall
scam, Bowden suspended him for two games before reinstating him
after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. Another wide receiver,
Laveranues Coles, was also involved and was kicked off the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laveranues had already been in trouble and I had warned him,''
Bowden said. ``It was Peter's first time. I got a lot of letters
wondering how I could allow Peter back. I wrote every one of them _
first I don't condone that behavior. Second, if that was your kid
and your life wouldn't you want him to have a second chance? And I
haven't heard back from any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Seminoles tight end Ryan Sprague said that those were the tenets
Bowden preached before football games. He said the pregame talks
are like church services: Bowden with his note cards is the pastor,
the players his congregation. The sermon is about life; the last
five minutes about the truisms of football. Hang on to the ball.
Don't arm-tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, a junior, was a walk-on for the Seminoles and did not
have a conversation with his coach in his first two years. When
Bowden acknowledged him one afternoon with a pinch and a ``hey,
buddy,'' Sprague rushed home to call his parents. Even now, on
Bowden's Sunday highlight show, the coach misidentifies his
starting tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had me being from St. Augustine and from Savannah,'' said
Sprague, who is from Augusta, Ga. ``But when you think about all
the players he's had and all the history he's made, we're just a
wrinkle in time for him. He is who he is. He is the guy who runs
Florida State football and that means a whole lot to a bunch of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach spooning the soup on his sofa recently signed a
contract worth $1 million a year through 2004. As much as Bowden
likes watching TV, stroking the two cats that roam the house and
going to Europe to retrace the campaigns of history's great
generals, he likes being a coach more.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys signing all those footballs, breaking down films and
making all those notes. He is energized on Saturday nights in the
winter, when a fire is roaring and pool lights in the backyard are
on and he and Ann are having Florida State recruits and their
families at their home for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves the television, the media, the recruiting the whole
package that is college football,'' Ann Bowden said. ``I think it
scares him to think this might be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden will continue to take naps so he can climb the Tower of
Power. He will continue to think football strategy all alone on his
golf cart on the practice field. He believes he will continue to
win. His reason is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you retire, there is just one more big event,'' he said.
``And I ain't ready for that.'' &QL;

DISTINGUISHED WORDS FROM SOME DISTINGUISHED SPORTSWRITERS
</HEADLINE>
 (ADDS Red Smith to complete list; MAKES 2 takes) 
 (rk) 
 By IRA BERKOW  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until the beginning of the 20th century, the coverage of sports
in newspapers, except for the occasional heavyweight title fight or
a local football or baseball game, was little more than an
afterthought. Then, with increasing leisure time for readers to
both play and watch, sports grew more important to life and
lifestyle. Editors caught on, and sportswriting began to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a list of seven sports columnists _ in roughly
chronological order _ who have arguably had the greatest impact on
their profession as both reporters and writers. There have been
numerous other distinguished sports journalists in the last 100
years _ from Charles Dryden to Frank Graham to Shirley Povich _ but
space dictates that the list be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Those included here range from Ring Lardner, who began writing
about baseball in 1906, to Jim Murray, who wrote his sports column
nearly up to the day he died, in 1998. Lardner, Damon Runyon and
Grantland Rice were giants for the first half of the century. Red
Smith, Jimmy Cannon, Dick Young and Murray were prominent in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Grantland Rice (1880-1954)
</P>
<P>
   Rice was generally considered the best-known sportswriter of his
generation. He read widely and brought a certain literate quality
to sportswriting that hadn't quite been there before. He began
writing for The Nashville News in 1901, after graduation from
Vanderbilt. He later wrote for The New York Mail and The New York
Tribune. In 1930 he began his popular syndicated sports column,
``The Spotlight.'' Of the two so-called schools of sportswriting in
the early part of the century _ the skeptical ``Aw Nuts'' writers
versus the more romantic ``Gee Whiz'' writers _ Rice was clearly in
the latter group.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote perhaps the most famous opening paragraph in
sportswriting history. It appeared on Oct. 19, 1924, as a lead to
his report on the Notre Dame-Army football game, won by Notre Dame,
and which starred the Fighting Irish backfield: ``Outlined against
a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again. In dramatic
lore they are known as Famine, Pestilence, Destruction, and Death.
These are only aliases. Their real names are Stuhldreher, Miller,
Crowley and Layden.''
</P>
<P>
   Ring Lardner (1885-1933)
</P>
<P>
   Lardner began his career as a sportswriter for The South Bend
(Ind.) Times, but made his greatest impact in newspapers as the
``Wake of the News'' sports columnist for The Chicago Tribune. His
literary fame, however, rests primarily on his short stories, such
as ``Alibi Ike'' and ``You Know Me Al.'' His inventions in language
and perspective also enlivened his sports columns.
</P>
<P>
   From a column in 1910 in which he assumes the role of a
spectator for a Chicago White Sox-Philadelphia Athletics game:
</P>
<P>
   ``On my right sat a gent who knew something, and he soon gave
evidence of the fact. Morris Rath opened the Sox attack with a safe
bunt. He was nailed at second when Lord missed his swing on a hit
and run.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Stealing second with nobody out,' remarked the guy who
knows. `And the papers call him a brainy ballplayer. If he had good
sense, he'd trade all his brains for a little bit of ability.'''
</P>
<P>
   Damon Runyon (1884-1946)
</P>
<P>
   He began writing for newspapers when he was 12 years old. He
worked for newspapers in Pueblo, Colo., Colorado Springs, Denver,
San Francisco and became one of the country's star reporters _ and
sports columnists _ with The New York American. He covered wars,
murder trials and World Series with equal distinction. Like
Lardner, it is Runyon's short stories that enlarged his fame. His
``Runyonesque'' characters live on in the musical ``Guys and
Dolls,'' adapted from his short stories.
</P>
<P>
   From the lead in a column from the 1930 Kentucky Derby:
</P>
<P>
   ``Say, have they turned the pages
</P>
<P>
   Back to the past once more?
</P>
<P>
   Back to the racin' ages
</P>
<P>
   An' a Derby out of the yore?
</P>
<P>
   Say, don'te I'm daffy,
</P>
<P>
   Ain't that the same ol' grin?
</P>
<P>
   Why it's that handy
</P>
<P>
   Guy named Sande,
</P>
<P>
   Bootin' a winner in!''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Cannon (1909-1973)
</P>
<P>
   He was born in New York and grew up in Greenwich Village. He
wrote for several New York newspapers, covered the city and worked
as a war correspondent, but in 1946 he began his syndicated sports
column for The New York Post. He later moved on to The
Journal-American. His rich prose made him one of the most
distinctive columnists of the century, but he may have been best
known for the occasional column, ``Nobody Asked Me, But. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Following are some lines over the years from ``Nobody Asked Me,
But. ... '':
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible for a girl to be homely with a gardenia
in her hair.'' ... ``I've never seen a circus clown I thought was
funny.'' ... ``I can't ever remember staying for the end of a movie
in which the actors wore togas.'' ... ``The trouble with the big
leagues is that there aren't enough big leaguers.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Smith (1905-1982)
</P>
<P>
   Born Walter Wellesley Smith, he worked for newspapers in
Milwaukee, St. Louis and Philadelphia before being hired in 1945 by
The New York Herald Tribune. He became the most widely syndicated
sports columnist of his generation. Smith joined The New York Times
in 1971, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Commentary in
1976 at age 70. His Pulitzer citation praised his humor and
humanitarianism, as well as ``the erudition, the literary quality,
the vitality and freshness of viewpoint'' of his columns.
</P>
<P>
   On the final day of the 1951 season, the Dodgers needed a
victory to tie for the National League pennant. It was the bottom
of the 12th inning at Shibe Park and it was getting dark. The
Phillies had the bases loaded and two out. Eddie Waitkus smashed a
drive toward center field. Jackie Robinson, wrote Smith, ``flings
himself headlong at right angles to the flight of the ball, for an
instant his body is suspended in midair, then somehow the
outstretched glove intercepts the ball inches off the ground. He
falls heavily, the crash drives an elbow into his side, he
collapses. ... stretched at full length in the insubstantial
twilight, the unconquerable doing the impossible.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Dick Young (1918-1987)
</P>
<P>
   He revolutionized sports coverage when, as a beat reporter for
The Daily News assigned to the Brooklyn Dodgers in the early 1940s,
he began to go into the clubhouse after games to find out what the
players had seen and thought during the game. Before this,
reporters in the press box wrote solely what the reporters had seen
and thought during a game. In 1957, Young began writing his column,
``Young Ideas,'' after the team owner, Walter O'Malley, decided to
move the Dodgers to Los Angeles. In 1982 he moved on to The New
York Post. Writing with wit and a hard-hitting, direct style, he
was frequently in verbal battles with an assortment of sports
figures throughout his years as a columnist.
</P>
<P>
   The following is from a 1957 column:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is called an obit, which is short for obituary. An obit
tells of a person who has died, how he lived, and of those who live
after him. This is the obit on the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preliminary diagnosis indicates that the cause of death was an
acute case of greed, followed by severe political implications. ...
and, now, Walter O'Malley leaves Brooklyn a rich man and a despised
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murray (1919-1998)
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1990, began his career as a
reporter for The New Haven Register. He moved on to write for The
Los Angeles Examiner, Time magazine and Sports Illustrated, before
joining The Los Angeles Times as a sports columnist in 1961. He
soon became widely syndicated, and was highly praised for his
acerbic wit (and, not surprisingly, highly denounced by some of the
subjects of his wit). But, like all good writers, he could also
touch a sensitive chord.
</P>
<P>
   From a column in 1979, in which he tells of the loss from an
operation of his ``good eye'' _ the other eye had seen only a hazy
world _ and now admitted that he was virtually blind: ``I'd like to
see Sugar Ray Robinson or Muhammad Ali giving a recital, a ballet,
not a fight. Also, to be sure, I'd like to see a sky full of stars,
moonlight on the water, and yes, the tips of a royal flush peaking
out as I fan out a poker hand, and, yes, a straight two-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to think of it, I'm lucky. I saw all of those things. I
see them yet.''

ARTIST PRINTS ADS SUITABLE FOR HANGING, FROM BUILDINGS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., England)  (rk) 
 By ANN WOZENCRAFT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When he stands on 42nd Street in Manhattan, Udi Aloni
can see his ideas towering over the milling crowds. And with his
photo-crisp advertisements for Apple Computer, the Gap, Old Navy
and DKNY looming 40 feet high on the faces of skyscrapers, there is
no question that Aloni, a 40-year-old Israeli artist, is making an
impression on the Big Apple. From 10th Avenue to Broadway, Aloni's
huge, high-resolution signs, called wallscapes, overlook every
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to alter the urban landscape without having visual
pollution,'' Aloni said. ``Wallscapes are much more organic to the
city, and I thought it would be cool if I could hang my work on
these buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Aloni came to New York in 1994 to focus on his art, not to dream
up a new way of displaying commercial advertisements. But when he
looked up at New York's massive buildings, he saw a potential
canvas. He had already experimented with digital printing in his
art _ interactive projects that explore religious themes _ and
realized that the same tools could be used for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed the idea to NUR MacroPrinters, an Israeli company
that produces a large-format continuous inkjet press. Unlike
painted billboards, wallscapes are printed via disk onto a
lightweight vinyl mesh material and hung flat like posters against
the sides of buildings. Not only are the images razor-sharp, but
they can also be produced faster and removed more quickly and
easily than a painted billboard. From that concept, MegaArt was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like MegaArt are sprouting _ and being snatched up by
larger companies _ to take advantage of the fast-growing and
lucrative large-format digital printing business, which industry
analysts expect to grow to about $10 billion from $1.5 billion in
the next three years. MegaArt's competitors range from huge
billboard companies like Metromedia to small graphic design
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar names _ the Gap, Apple, DKNY _ are loyal MegaArt
clients. Advertisers create the images and send them via CD-ROM to
MegaArt, which prints them. MegaArt says that it produces about 85
percent of the wallscapes in New York City, and the company has
expanded its work to Israel, Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Aloni often worked with advertisers to
translate their ideas to his large canvases, and some still seek
his advice.
</P>
<P>
   MegaArt's sales have soared, to $11 million in 1999 from $1.5
million for the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 1997. Profits rose
50 percent in the same period, and the number of employees has
increased to 83 from five. The company expects sales to reach $18
million this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   MegaArt was acquired in September 1998 for $14.4 million by
Unidigital, a digital printing and media services company in
Manhattan that went public in 1996. Aloni is now the second-largest
shareholder of Unidigital, behind William E. Dye, Unidigital's
chairman. In 1998, Unidigital acquired SuperGraphics, a company in
Sunnyvale, Calif., that makes vinyl ads that wrap around buses.
Aloni runs MegaArt and SuperGraphics under one division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Udi is a visionary,'' Dye said. ``His creative insight into
new media concepts makes him really unique.''
</P>
<P>
   MegaArt's workshop, in a 30,000-square-foot renovated warehouse
on Pier 40 at West and Houston Streets, is a bustling production
center with seven printers that roll out gigantic images on the
sturdy vinyl mesh. Although MegaArt's ownership has changed, Aloni
says his mission is the same: to take the company to the next level
artistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been freed from the day-to-day numbers and all the things
I'm not so interested in,'' hesaid. ``Now I can concentrate on the
creative side, developing concepts for the future. It's what really
gives me my passion for this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Unidigital's strategy is to incorporate entrepreneurs and let
them develop their businesses. ``There are so many images grabbing
for our attention,'' said Rudolf Hokanson, an analyst who used to
cover the company for CIBC Oppenheimer, the investment bank. ``So
if you can be a master of digital printing, you have a better
chance of being the one who offers a total solution for the
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Displays Inc., or TDI, was the first large
company to give MegaArt its business. Bill Murphy, TDI's director
of operations, said he was impressed with both Aloni's artistic
background and his understanding of digital technology.
</P>
<P>
   MegaArt usually has about 25 wallscape projects going on at
once, charging $20,000 to $400,000. TDI spends $3,000 to $300,000 a
year to lease wall space, then sells the space to advertisers for
$5,000 to $50,000 a month, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Udi is an artist by trade, so he really appreciates the work
we do,'' said Rebecca Weill, a spokeswoman for the Gap. ``He has a
really good eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last January, MegaArt has focused on a new concept called
``station domination,'' which means one advertiser buys all the
space at one location for one or two months.
</P>
<P>
   In partnership with TDI, which has franchise agreements with
several transit authorities, including the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, MegaArt prints the images and displays
the work. For example, Pontiac is spending $100,000 a month to
display almost 300 images at the Port Authority bus terminal and
$200,000 a month for 138 ads at the World Trade Center. In the Bond
Street Underground station in London, all the signs were changed to
read ``Blonde Street'' for a Clairol ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look for ways to service the clients and simplify the
process,'' said Brigg Hyland, vice president for special projects
at TDI. ``That allows the client greater flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Aloni used to feel conflicted about his two roles: artist and
entrepreneur. But he said he is over that now. ``My job is to find
cool applications for these new digital tools,'' he said. ``I've
grown as an artist since I started my business. I bring the same
spirit and passion to both parts of my life.''

Tough decisions put Solich firmly in control of Cornhuskers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ It has been two years since Tom Osborne handed
over the keys to a football program whose elite status is exceeded
only by that of the men who made Nebraska Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne and Bob Devaney were Cornhuskers legends. Frank Solich
was merely a name engraved on the head coach's office door; an
unproven coach facing a seemingly impossible task.
</P>
<P>
   He was scrutinized and criticized. He inherited what seemed to
be a lose-lose situation. And when the 1998 season unraveled into a
lose-lose-lose-lose situation _ an unheard-of 9-4 finish _ the long
shadows of the Cornhuskers legends dwarfed Solich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach felt a lot of pressure,'' Nebraska senior rover Mike
Brown said. ``I think a lot of people doubted his ability as a
coach. That was totally unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Only now, here at the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, where maybe the
greatest of all the great Nebraska teams earned the 1995 national
championship, can Solich feel comfort and confidence that it's not
just his name engraved on the door of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Solich has begun to carve his own legacy and he's done
it by making the kind of tough decisions that even caused Osborne
to hear criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Solich called a wayward player's bluff last September and the
bold, potentially season-crippling move bonded the team closer than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know the biggest reason Nebraska stands 11-1
going into tonight's Fiesta Bowl showdown with Tennessee after last
season's debacle, go back to early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment that contrasted similar moments when the
Cornhuskers were at their best under Osborne. Even the legendary
coach was questioned earlier this decade over how he handled
players such as former I-back Lawrence Phillips, whose off-field
troubles and attitude threatened to divide the team.
</P>
<P>
   When Solich faced a similar threat this year with I-back
DeAngelo Evans, whose complaints about playing time and bickering
with teammates sliced morale to pieces, Solich hammered his own
stake into the ground. Evans stormed into Solich's office
threatening to quit the team.
</P>
<P>
   Solich told Evans, fine. Quit. Leave. When Evans later asked to
return to the team, but refused to apologize to teammates, Solich
polled players and agonized over the call before deciding not to
allow Evans back. All it did was rally Nebraska players around the
coach and prove that this program no longer was Osborne's.
</P>
<P>
   It belonged to Solich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some unfortunate things happen, but he showed our staff
and players what he stood for,'' Nebraska assistant Turner Gill
said. ``The thing I really admired was how he handled things not
only on the football field but in helping bring our team
together.''
</P>
<P>
   If a season can be defined in one moment, this Nebraska
resurgence is defined not on the field, but off it, where the coach
took charge last September.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers rattled off nine wins in 10 games after Evans
left the team and only got better when Solich made another tough
decision when he switched Bobby Newcombe from quarterback to
wingback, handing the starting quarterback job to Eric Crouch.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe has since made it clear that he still would like to
play quarterback and Newcombe's father has gone public with his
disgust over Solich's move. But when the Cornhuskers line up today,
Newcombe will be at wingback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the small things are what can really make a difference
between having four losses and having one loss or no losses,''
Solich said. ``It can go the other way very easily. There are more
headaches (as head coach) but that's the way it is in any kind of
leadership role. As an assistant, you think you see things clearly.
But as a head coach, you have to make the final decision. You just
have to feel justified that you made the right call and move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   It's becoming clear that when Osborne hand-picked Solich as his
successor he made the right call. With a win tonight, the
Cornhuskers likely will finish ranked No. 2 nationally, with a Big
12 championship and Solich finishing his first two seasons with 20
wins _ more than either Devaney or Osborne had in their first two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that are intangible are the things that make
Frank,'' Nebraska defensive coordinator Charlie McBride said.
``He's solid as a rock. He's loyal. He's a tough guy and he's not
going to sit and take anything. He's disciplined and his team shows
that discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Solich was given this prestigious,
pressure-packed job. But only now is it clear that the program
finally NO CARRIER

</P>
<P>
   TAMPA _ The most famous version of ``The Drive'' happened 13
years ago when John Elway rallied Denver past Cleveland in the AFC
Championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the University of Georgia used its own adaptation for
similar success.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs trailed Purdue by 25 points in the second quarter
but put together a 94-yard drive that forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   They completed the biggest comeback in bowl history when Hap
Hines kicked a 21-yard field goal in overtime for a 28-25 win over
the Boilermakers in the 2000 Outback Bowl at Raymond James Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The largest previous comeback was 22 points, on two prior
occasions. Notre Dame, with Joe Montana at the helm, beat Houston
35-34 after trailing 34-12 in the fourth quarter of the 1979 Cotton
Bowl. A Jim McMahon-led Brigham Young squad made up a 35-13,
third-quarter deficit to beat Southern Methodist 46-45 in the 1980
Holiday Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (8-4) got the ball with 7:28 left in the fourth
quarter after Purdue's Vinny Sutherland downed a punt at the 6.
Sophomore quarterback Quincy Carter then led the 'Dawgs on what he
called one of the best drives at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He hit tight end Jevaris Johnson for 23 yards, then Michael
Greer rambled 32 yards on a catch-and-run down to the Purdue 40.
Carter hit Randy McMichael, the other tight end, for 14 yards
before McMichael dropped a third-and-12 pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (tight ends) had made the plays all year,'' Carter said.
``When he dropped that one, I said, `Don't get your head down.
You'll make another play.'''
</P>
<P>
   After Georgia called its final timeout, Carter hit Terrence
Edwards on the next play for 21 yards on a crossing route.
Surprisingly, the Boilermakers (7-5) called timeout with the 'Dawgs
facing third-and-goal at the 8. Then Carter got a most fortuitous
bounce on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   Scrambling to his right, he threw back toward the middle. Purdue
safety Adrian Beasley knocked it off Willie Fells' shoulder pads to
McMichael, who snared it with 79 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   In the overtime, the Boilermakers went on offense first. After
moving the ball smoothly for most of the game, they stalled in
overtime. Travis Dorsch, who had a streak of 40 straight PATs
snapped on Purdue's second touchdown, was wide right on a 43-yard
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our guys played hard for the most part,'' said
Purdue coach Joe Tiller. ``Little did we know how critical our
first missed extra point of the season was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Runs of 10 and 9 yards by Patrick Pass ultimately led to Hines'
game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsch missed two field goals in the second half. Each could
have rendered Georgia's comeback moot, but the Purdue sophomore
missed kicks from 40 and 38 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove the ball like we have all year,'' said Purdue
quarterback Drew Brees, named the game's most outstanding player
after completing 36 of 60 passes for 378 yards _ all Outback Bowl
records. ``We just didn't get any points out of it. This game
reminded everybody of the whole season and how it has gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the misses, Carter capped a 77-yard, eight-play drive by
running it in from the 8 with 4:33 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone talks about different QBs around the country,''
Donnan said. ``But nobody means any more to their team than Quincy
Carter does to our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers' first three possessions ended with Brees
touchdown passes. The first two went to Chris Daniels, the senior
from Clearwater. The third scoring pass went to Sutherland with 63
seconds left. It came one play after a Purdue fumble was nullified
by an offsides penalty on the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   On fourth-and-21, Purdue was forced to punt. Twice it was called
back for a penalty. On the third try, Greer returned it to the
Georgia 32, but fumbled it away.
</P>
<P>
   Brees tossed his fourth TD pass of the game on the next play. It
was a 32-yarder to Chris James; last year he played at Jesuit High,
about a mile from the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers led 25-0 with 4:22 gone in the second, but
Georgia pulled out an option reverse, and reversed its fortunes
just 59 seconds after they appeared destined to lose.
</P>
<P>
   From the 26, Edwards took a pitch from Carter and galloped 74
yards to put the Bulldogs on the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the momentum back. We needed a big play and I just
happened to deliver,'' Edwards said. ``We hadn't had a chance to
run it, but coach Donnan called it at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Brees was ready to drive Purdue to another score, but Georgia
junior cornerback Jamie Henderson intercepted a pass and returned
it 50 yards to the Purdue 40. He might have gone in for a touchdown
had Brees not tripped him up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Bulldogs got a 32-yard field goal from Hines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can have all those yards,'' Henderson said. ``We're the
ones walking out with a W and not an L.''

PLANNING PREVENTS Y2K TROUBLE, BUT SOME WARN THAT PROBLEMS STILL
LOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 DAVID HAYES AND FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For months we were told to hope for the best
but expect the Y2K worst.
</P>
<P>
   Localized power outages? Quite possible. Problems with the water
supply? Could be. Are the banks ready? Better have some extra cash,
just in case. And food. Buy some extra food.
</P>
<P>
   When the best happened, the first words we uttered were ``hype''
and ``scam.''
</P>
<P>
   A world suffering a global party hangover woke up Saturday to
the anticlimax of the century. Everything still worked.
</P>
<P>
   Money and time _ lots of both _ resulted in the Y2K bug being
pretty much a no-show, even though a lot more glitches began
surfacing Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, President Clinton's chief Y2K adviser, was
defending the $100 billion spent on Y2K by government and business
in the United States before the ball even dropped in Times Square
on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone who's spent any time on this problem who
doubts that, had the effort not been made, had the money not been
spent, we would be in a very different situation here right now,''
Koskinen said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would, I think, have significant failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen and others cautioned that we were not out of the woods
yet. As has been warned for weeks, workers returning to their jobs
Monday still may face computer glitches and outright failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is too much focus on New Year's weekend,'' said Bruce
McConnell, director of the International Y2K Cooperation Center.
``If you think that the only time to worry about the Y2K bug is on
January 1, then you're underestimating the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on which estimate you believe, government and business
worldwide spent either $320 billion or $500 billion on Y2K fixes.
Government officials and industry analysts said that much money,
plus the years of work spent by some companies to fix problems,
paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there was so much preparation done accounts for
the fact we have encountered so few problems,'' said Don Meyer,
spokesman for the U.S. Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000
Technology Problem.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are plenty of unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia many government agencies adopted a ``fix on failure''
approach: Don't bother until it breaks. At least two Middle Eastern
oil-producing countries took the same approach.
</P>
<P>
   According to early reports, there were no widespread failures in
any of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there were no reports of failures in those countries at
all _ although admittedly American intelligence in all three
countries is poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could have expected so few problems?'' said Andy Kyte, an
analyst with GartnerGroup, a technology research firm that has been
following the Y2K issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closer analysis will show that so many businesses had shut
down for two or three days that, really, the world's computer
systems had been deactivated by year 2000,'' Kyte said. ``We still
have to wait and see whether under full load, doing all of their
transactions, they can cope with normal business'' in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   John Gantz, chief researcher for Project Magellan, the Y2K
research arm of International Data Corp., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that most of the companies in the country are
small businesses and that two-thirds of them hadn't finished Y2K
remediation as of last night, I believe plenty of Y2K glitches have
yet to appear,'' Gantz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of one big flood, we're going to see a lot of leaky
basements.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those urging caution Saturday was Peter de Jager, a
Canadian Y2K expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very premature at this point in time to declare
victory,'' de Jager said. ``We expected the infrastructure to be
OK, but wait until next week to start drawing conclusions about how
successful or unsuccessful we've been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Year 2000 committee will continue to mop up those
leaks until Feb. 29, a leap-year date that computers may not
recognize. Day 1, Year 2000
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, in Washington and across the world, technicians
spent New Year's Day scouring computer systems and checking office
buildings looking for snags caused by the Year 2000 computer
problem.
</P>
<P>
   They found surprisingly little.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along our concern was the unknown,'' said Dean Katerndahl,
the Mid-America Regional Council's Y2K point man. ``And we still
don't know about some of the things that may be coming up in the
next weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that there were not hundreds or even thousands of
minor glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Six American nuclear power plants, including one in Little Rock,
Ark., had minor reporting problems that were fixed quickly. A
system used to track Amtrak trains had to be reset manually.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment used at two Swedish hospitals to analyze
electrocardiogram data malfunctioned. The doors in a federal
building under renovation in Omaha, Neb., would not lock.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. spy satellite was knocked off line for a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil machines at three toll roads issued receipts with the
wrong date. A hospital in Sao Paulo was unable to use its
computerized patient registration system, and another hospital in
Recife had trouble using its internal record system.
</P>
<P>
   In France the Syracuse II military satellite system was running
on a software patch while technicians worked on a permanent fix.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the world's largest software company, reported two
glitches. One caused the company's MoneyCentral Web site to vastly
overestimate the worth of some customers' portfolios. Microsoft
Hotmail users who left old mail in their online mailbox found that
it appeared to have been sent in 2099.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Saturday, Koskinen said he was pleased with
the transition from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been able to find anything of great
significance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could officials in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw nothing. We saw absolutely nothing,'' said Gary Brown,
the emergency services manager for the Mid-America Regional
Council. ``Not a single reported Y2K problem.'' Model of planning
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who coordinated the region's Information Coordination
Center, attributed the quiet evening to planning and to public and
private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   What we got for the investment was a quiet evening and a
blueprint for future disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he would have liked to have seen a Y2Klike emergency
network several years ago when an October surprise dumped a pile of
snow on Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, telephone lines were jammed, key officials did not
have the proper information, and emergency responses were delayed.
With the lessons learned from Y2K, a disaster response squad can be
established without reinventing the wheel, Brown said.

 BOWL-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Arkansas overpowers Texas for Cotton Bowl win &HT;     &HT;     By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ The motto for Texas during the week leading up to the
Cotton Bowl was 1-10-10, meaning a Jan. 1 game for a 10th win and
possibly a Top 10 ranking. &HT;    Instead of 1-10-10, Texas should have had a different motto _
9-1-1. Only emergency assistance could have saved the Longhorns
from the Arkansas Razorbacks on Saturday in the first meeting
between the former rivals in more than eight years.
 &HT;    A dominating Arkansas defense and several big plays by the Hogs'
offense in the second half enabled the 24th-ranked Razorbacks to
earn a convincing 27-6 victory over 14th-ranked Texas in front of
72,723 spectators.
 &HT;    ``Today we played with a lot of emotion, passion and fanatical
effort,'' said Arkansas coach Houston Nutt. ``After ending the
(regular) season on a bad note (a 35-10 loss at LSU), I love the
way our team came together today. We wanted to send a message that
we were better than we showed that day.''
 &HT;    Arkansas freshman tailback Cedric Cobbs, who didn't start
Saturday because he missed a team meeting Thursday night, was the
Offensive Most Valuable Player. He rushed for 98 yards and a
touchdown on 15 carries and scored another TD on a 30-yard
catch-and-run.
 &HT;    ``To win the MVP in my first bowl game is as good as it gets,''
Cobbs said. ``It's a great way to start the new year.''
 &HT;    Senior defensive tackle D.J. Cooper of Mesquite was the
defensive MVP, contributing two sacks and three other unassisted
tackles to the Razorbacks' cause.
 &HT;    ``I thought Arkansas played with a lot of energy and tenacity on
defense, and we were inept on offense,'' said Texas coach Mack
Brown, whose team ended the season at 9-5 after three consecutive
losses. ``The bottom line is their guys whipped our guys. They got
off their blocks better than we got on ours.''
 &HT;    The Arkansas defense controlled the line of scrimmage, holding
Texas to minus-27 yards rushing on 25 carries. But the real reason
the Longhorns finished in the red on the ground was eight sacks by
the Hogs that accounted for minus-64 yards.
 &HT;    The news may get worse for Texas in a couple days when the
Longhorns learn the extent of an injury to the left knee of
starting quarterback Major Applewhite, who was hurt on a
non-contact play in the fourth quarter. He is scheduled to have a
Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan on Monday.
 &HT;    ``We probably won't know until then what his situation is,''
Brown said. ``But I think everyone can see now why we think we need
two quarterbacks who are able to play.''
 &HT;    Freshman Chris Simms, who played one series in the first
quarter, replaced Applewhite in the fourth, but he also was
constantly pressured by the blitzing Razorbacks.
 &HT;    ``They didn't do anything unexpected,'' Simms said. ``They just
beat us man-on-man and played harder than we did.''
 &HT;    The Texas players may have been affected by the loss of four
teammates, including All-Big 12 wide receiver Kwame Cavil and
senior defensive end Aaron Humphrey. They were suspended Thursday
night, along with backup defensive end J.J. Kelly and reserve
linebacker Jamal Joyner, for an undisclosed violation of team
rules.
 &HT;    ``That shouldn't have affected us at all,'' said Texas guard
Roger Roesler. ``We have plenty of talent on this team. We missed
their leadership, but we have plenty of athletes here to get the
job done.''
 &HT;    The score was tied at 3 at the half, with the first 30 minutes
of play almost devoid of offense. Texas had 44 yards on 27 plays,
and Arkansas had 127 yards on 30 plays, but 45 of those yards came
on a post route on the last play before halftime.
 &HT;    The turning point came in the third quarter on what amounted to
a nine-point swing. Arkansas took possession on its three before
the UT defense came close to recording a safety on back-to-back
plays. But the Razorbacks were ruled down just beyond the end zone
on both.
 &HT;    ``That took some of the wind out of our sails,'' said Texas
receiver Ryan Nunez. ``I was looking at the Jumbotron, and it sure
looked like we had two safeties in a row.''
 &HT;    Just missing proved costly, because the Hogs would tie a Cotton
Bowl record with a 97-yard touchdown drive.
 &HT;    The Razorbacks got out of the hole on third down with a 47-yard
pass from quarterback Clint Stoerner to receiver Anthony Lucas, who
beat Ervis Hill on a hitch-and go down the sideline.
 &HT;    ``It was a huge play,'' Nutt said. ``After the first two plays,
I said, `That's enough of that. Let's throw it to our best player
on the field.' You have to hand it to Anthony. He had (knee)
surgery three weeks ago, and he was out there giving it everything
he had.''
 &HT;    The Razorbacks would score the first touchdown of the game six
plays later when Stoerner avoided a sack and lobbed a swing pass to
Cobbs that became a 30-yard score to make it 10-3.
 &HT;    Texas had a chance to tie the score when the Longhorns finally
moved the ball on offense and drove to the Arkansas one. But Texas
couldn't get the ball in the end zone and had to settle for a
22-yard field goal by Kris Stockton.
 &HT;    ``I thought those two situations in the third quarter were the
difference in the game,'' Brown said. ``They came up with the big
pass from their own one, and we couldn't score from the one. If you
can't do that, you're probably not going to win the football game.
It should have been 10-10. Instead, it was 10-6. They had all the
momentum and drove 86 yards for another score.''
 &HT;    Arkansas took a 17-6 lead when running back Michael Jenkins
broke free up the middle for a 42-yard TD run with 12:48 left in
the fourth quarter.
 &HT;    ``They took the momentum, and we couldn't get it back,'' Brown
said. ``Our guys didn't quit, but they did get discouraged.
Defensively, we hung in there and gave ourselves a chance to win.
But we ran out of gas in the fourth quarter, and they made a couple
of big plays.''
 &HT;    Cobbs' second TD put the game out of reach with 10:19 to go. He
bounced outside on a running play up the middle and raced 37 yards
down the sideline after breaking Ahmad Brooks' attempted tackle.
 &HT;    The win was Arkansas' first bowl victory since 1985, and having
it come against the Longhorns made it even sweeter for the fans and
players.
 &HT;    ``To beat Texas in the first game of the new millennium is
something I will always remember,'' said Arkansas senior safety
Kenoy Kennedy. ``We played with our hear NO CARRIER

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANADA HILLS, Calif. _ If all goes according to plan, by the
end of this calendar year Maurice Greene will have a new, indelible
nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   This year Greene can win Olympic gold on the world stage in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   This year Greene can take the baton from Tom Watson as Kansas
City's one-man sports franchise and replace Carl Lewis as the
jaw-dropping, breathtaking sprinter who makes track and field
relevant, important and television-friendly in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of 2000, a Kansas City, Kansan, could be the
Michael Jordan of track and field. Greene has the potential to be
an athletic and commercial endorsement force strong enough to leap
Kansas City's Brush Creek with a single bound and polished enough
to hawk sneakers, cologne and men's briefs in the same
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is Maurice's oyster,'' says Greene's agent, Emanuel
Hudson, a Los Angeles-based lawyer and co-founder of HSI, the
Y2K-compatible track-and-field sports agency group that is not
afraid to be flamboyant and controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maurice is the beginning of the resurgence of track and field
in America. The last person to do anything for track and field was
probably Carl Lewis. Maurice is the next man. He's the next man to
raise the level of track-and-field consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical agent hyperbole? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Greene shattered the 100-meter dash world record. He
clocked an incredible 9.79, shaving 0.05 off Canadian Donovan
Bailey's old standard and regaining the world's-fastest-man title
for American sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first man ever to hold the 50-meter, the 60-meter and
the 100-meter records at the same time. He is the first man to pull
off the 100-meter, 200-meter double at the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   At age 25, Greene has already recorded more sub-10-second-flat
100-meter dashes than Lewis, Bailey, Leroy Burrell and Linford
Christie, four of the best sprinters in track-and-field history.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Maurice, we're talking about a guy who could go down as the
greatest sprinter ever,'' says John Smith, Greene's trainer and
co-founder of HSI, which stands for Hudson Smith International or
Handling Speed Intelligently, a partnership of Hudson's marketing
and Smith's coaching. ``I'm talking about greater than Carl Lewis.
Maurice is just a baby, and he's already ahead of Carl. All he
needs is the gold medals.''
</P>
<P>
   The gold medals should come in September, at the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing of Greene will begin in April. That is when Nike,
the shoe company that showers Greene with endorsement dollars, will
kick off its pre-Olympic hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maurice will be a major focus for Nike,'' says Dave Mingey,
Nike's manager of U.S. communications. ``He'll get a lot of
visibility. We at Nike certainly believe Maurice will be around for
many years to come. We also believe he's someone who transcends the
sport.'' A level of success
</P>
<P>
   Man, life is good for Mo Greene.
</P>
<P>
   You pull up to his two-level, five-bedroom home in a well-kept
suburb just north of Los Angeles, and as Greene opens his two-car
garage to welcome you, your eyes widen as you lust after Greene's
two favorite house guests.
</P>
<P>
   Black Mercedes-Benz 500SL 1999. Blue Mercedes-Benz S500 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke the world record. I'm the fastest man in the world,''
Greene smiles. ``Oh, I have no concerns at all. I'm doing very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene shares his home with his brother, Ernest Greene Jr., 29,
the original sprint king in the family, and Greene's two dogs, who
spend most days lounging around the in-ground pool or taking in the
action on the backyard basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   The financial rewards for being the fastest man in the world are
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Greene has basically seen his income quadruple and triple in
each of the last three years. In 1997 he earned about $300,000. In
1998 he brought in $1.2 million. In 1999 he expected to pull in $3
million-plus.
</P>
<P>
   He commands $100,000 a race in Europe. Nike provides him an
incentive-laden contract. Video-game maker Konami just gave him
$30,000 to plaster his likeness on the cover of its new Track and
Field 2000 game. Powerade is recruiting him. So is Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Greene splits his money with the U.S. government, HSI, John
Smith and a masseuse. Taxes eat up 40 percent of his income. HSI
claims 15 percent. That fee does not include Smith's coaching
services, which are an additional $2,000 to $3,000 a month, nor
does it include the services of the masseuse HSI has on call for
its athletes 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's expenses are nearly as abundant as his income. Yet he
is quite comfortable. A little more than a year ago he bought his
parents, Ernest and Jackie Greene, a home a stone's throw away from
a high school parking lot back in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   And Greene says he has already outgrown his current
3,100-square-foot, half-million-dollar home that is complete with a
120-inch projection screen home theater, an upstairs game room and
an office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking at some land,'' Greene says. ``It's about 3
acres about 10 minutes from here. I want to build my own crib. I
just need to find a contractor who will work with me. They want
$135 a square foot. I want something about 8,000 square feet.''

<P>
   Greene's excesses are limited to his cars and his house. He
wears little or no jewelry. He still buys his clothes off the rack.
And he has avoided getting caught up in the Hollywood night life.
For the most part he socializes in the comfort of his own home, the
unofficial official meeting place of HSI athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like going to clubs. That's not me,'' says Greene,
whose ex-girlfriend delivered his first child _ a girl, Ryan _ in
December. ``I'm not in the Hollywood life. I've met Toni Braxton. I
see Vivica Fox all the time, Halle Berry all the time. I've got
pictures with all of them. But as far as dating one of them? Naw,
they want too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who know Greene well say he has not changed since he
was a shy kid who played football and ran track in high school,
never had time for a serious girlfriend and was known as a serial
practical joker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize God has given me this talent for however
long he wants me to have it,'' Greene says. ``It can all be gone
tomorrow. And you know what? I'm going to say, `I'm the same person
I was before I had everything.' '' Beginnings
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Greene delivered baby Maurice at the University of Kansas
Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan., after the worst nine-month
stretch of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick the whole nine months I carried him,'' Jackie says.
``I wasn't bedridden or anything. I was just totally sick....I
don't think anybody should have been that sick for that long. But
somehow we made it through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Maurice was just determined to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, Maurice found he was the baby boy of
working-class parents who already had two sons, Michael and Ernest
Jr., and one daughter, Kelly. Maurice's father works for the Kansas
Department of Corrections. His mother is a supervisor in a garment
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Sr.'s job required quite a bit of travel. So Jackie
Greene, a Sunday school teacher, ran the house. Maurice grew up
attending the Third Street Church of God in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   He also grew up tagging along to his older brothers' sporting
events. Michael, 35, and now an accountant, was a pretty good
football player. Ernest Jr. was a childhood sprint star, and as a
teen-ager he began working with Kansas City Kansas Community
College track coach Al Hobson. It was at those practices that
Maurice was introduced to sprinting and Hobson. Both would change
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maurice would run rabbit for us as a 9-year-old,'' says
Hobson, a retired General Motors employee. ``Ernest would drag
Maurice to practice, and we'd stick Maurice out there 15 to 20
meters, and he thought he could beat them. Maurice always had a
strong mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Hobson's tutelage, Greene went on to win three straight
Kansas high school state championships in the 100- and 200-meter
dashes. He was a hot college prospect as both a football player and
a sprinter. But he struggled academically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports was his life,'' Jackie says. ``He'd just slop in his
homework, throw some things underneath his bed and say, `It's time
for me to go to practice.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Late in Greene's teen-age years, Jackie agreed to raise a
niece's five children. It was a sacrifice she felt she had to make
for her family. Her home became too crowded and too hectic for her
youngest son to live comfortably. Maurice basically moved in with
Hobson and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al has been like a father to me,'' Greene says.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson persuaded Greene to give up his dream of becoming a
college football star and pursue a sprint career full time. Greene
enrolled in Park College and Kansas City Kansas Community College
and continued working with Hobson. Greene attended school during
the morning, worked an assortment of odd jobs during the day _ from
walking greyhounds at The Woodlands racetrack to serving Big Macs _
and trained with Hobson in the evening. Sprinting to the top
</P>
<P>
   His decision to follow Hobson's advice didn't pay off in a big
way for a couple of years, until Hobson placed him in the 1995
Texas Relays 100-meter dash, which featured Carl Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was just 20 at the time. Lewis was still his idol. The
field included several other veteran sprinters. Hobson just hoped
Greene would not get embarrassed and lose confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Greene ran a wind-aided 9.88, beating Lewis by 0.02 and the
second-place runner by 0.01. Greene's previous fastest hundred _
and keep in mind he missed the 1994 season because of a pulled
hamstring _ had been around 10.40.
</P>
<P>
   ``He introduced himself to the world at the Texas Relays,''
Hobson says. ``You can talk about wind-aided all you want, but
Maurice beat Carl Lewis that day. And he did it out of lane eight!
People like to act like Maurice came out of nowhere. But he didn't.
He ran 9.88 in 1995. Maurice has been here since 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   The next week Greene backed up his Texas Relays run with a 10.11
at a different meet. Maurice Greene was for real. He was a
legitimate threat to make the 1996 U.S. Olympic team. But an
injured hamstring delayed his coming-out party.
</P>
<P>
   That is the funny thing about track and field: Its margin for
error is the most minuscule in sports. You cannot play hurt in
track. A pulled hamstring, a sprained ankle, and you are done.
</P>
<P>
   Injury may be the only thing that can stop Greene this year as
he runs a gauntlet of meets leading up to the Games. And the pain
of missing the Olympics again would be immeasurable for Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Greene went to the '96 U.S. trials lame. He managed one 10.08
clocking and then faded early in the meet. He attended the Atlanta
Olympics for a couple of days and then left depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I should've been there,'' Greene says. ``I
couldn't take it, so I just came home and thought about what I'd
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   He also contemplated ending his working relationship with
Hobson. He had long been intrigued about the idea of working with
John Smith. Hobson had actually introduced Greene to Smith at a
track meet.

   ... to Smith at a track meet.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Atlanta Olympics, Greene went to Hobson's
house and told him he was moving to Los Angeles to work with Smith
and HSI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional,'' Greene remembers. ``I cried. He
cried. I guess it was like he sees me as a son, and I see him as a
father figure. Sometimes, though, when you're growing up, you have
to leave home someday to become a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson sees it much differently. He sees a slick lawyer and a
conniving coach manipulating a phenom who can carry a sports agency
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Smith is a better recruiter than coach,'' Hobson says.
``That's no secret. If you go out there and run good, you're fine.
If you don't, they put you out. ... I remember we went down to San
Diego to train, and I drove Maurice up to Orange County. Emanuel
didn't have too much to say to me. But he managed to take Maurice
for a ride in his Mercedes-Benz and took him by his big old fancy
house, and told him, `This is what you can have.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Hudson says he did not recruit Greene _ or anyone else,
for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't recruit,'' he says. ``Athletes come to us. John Smith
is the best sprint coach in the world. In 1996, HSI won more medals
in track and field than all but five countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene and Hobson have patched up their nonworking relationship.
When Greene goes home, he and Hobson hit the casinos together. They
talk about everything except track and field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Maurice now,'' Hobson says from his cramped office at
Kansas City Kansas Community College, ``watching Maurice break the
world record is like painting Picasso and someone else gets to sign
their name to the picture.'' Paying his dues
</P>
<P>
   Greene's move to Los Angeles came at considerable sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   He and his father packed up Greene's 1995 GMC Jimmy and drove it
out to the West Coast. Greene moved in with J.B. Hill, a childhood
friend of Hobson's. At that time Nike supported Greene with a
$20,000-a-year income. On that, and money lent to him by HSI
teammates, Greene made his $300-a-month car payment, fed and
clothed himself and socialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was kind of a joke,'' says Jackie Greene. ``I
thought he was teasing. I thought he was going to go out to
California and not really make it. I kept telling him that if it
doesn't work out, you can always come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene stuck it out. In January of 1997 he moved into an HSI
teammate's one-bedroom apartment, which was closer to the UCLA
track where Smith trained his sprinters. Greene slept on a couch in
the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's training regimen exhausted Greene. The three-hour
sessions _ one hour lifting weights and two hours running _ took
another three hours to recover from. By the time Greene recovered,
he had spent countless hours watching film of his running style
with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``John basically made me learn my race,'' Greene says.
``Everyone can get out there and run fast, but it's the way you do
it. You must have a plan. We figured out the best way for me to run
100 meters. I had been just running all out from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I understand it's how you get to top-end speed that's
important. You try to get there as easy as possible. And you can
only hold it for about 10 or 15 meters. Then you decelerate. The
reason why it seems like at the end of the race I'm pulling away
from everybody is because when they're at top-end speed I haven't
even hit mine. I hit top-end speed around 70 to 75 meters.
Everybody else hits it around 45 to 50 meters.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene was a quick study. In 1997 he won the 100-meter U.S.
nationals and the world championships. His earning potential
skyrocketed. He moved off the teammate's couch and out of his
apartment. He set his sights on becoming the fastest man in the
world and on the riches and fame that go along with it. The road
ahead
</P>
<P>
   HSI, which was founded in early 1996, may be the perfect
launching pad for Greene's bid for sprint immortality. Hudson, who,
among other things, represents a Saudi Arabian royal family, and
Smith, who has traveled the world as a sprinter and coach since
1970, dream on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   They want to rule the world. And they know how to communicate
and connect with the brash, young, excitable Generation X athlete.
HSI's sprinters have been criticized for their over-the-top
on-track exuberance. Green loves to wag his tongue. Some of his
teammates love to strip their tops and flex their ripped upper
bodies. HSI sprinters have their own flag.
</P>
<P>
   HSI's critics say the group may as well be rapper Master P's No
Limit army.
</P>
<P>
   The critics will not argue, however, that HSI is the strongest
track and field management entity since Carl Lewis, manager Joe
Douglas and the Santa Monica Track Club completely controlled
international track and field. Using Lewis' star appeal and
leverage in the 1980s and early 1990s, Santa Monica dictated who
ran when, where and (some would argue) how fast.
</P>
<P>
   HSI _ which also represents sprinters Ato Bolden, Jon Drummond,
Marie-Jose Perec, Inger Miller, pole vaulter Jeff Hartwig and
hurdler Larry Wade _ would like to use Greene in the same fashion.
</P>
<P>
   If you want the world's fastest man at your televised track
meet, pay him $100,000 to show up and also pay six or seven of his
teammates $25,000 to compete against him and in other events.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's value to HSI is incalculable. His success at the Sydney
Olympics, where he probably will compete for three gold medals
(100, 200 and 4-by-100 relay), is vital to HSI's rise.
</P>
<P>
   Barring injury, great sprinters can have long careers. They
generally peak in their late 20s, which means Greene's best
Olympics might not be until 2004. He could still be running well in
2008.
</P>
<P>
   HSI is preparing Greene for the long haul. In the middle of this
month Hudson, Smith and their athletes will fly to Las Vegas for a
weekend seminar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have breakout sessions on every subject,'' Hudson says.
``I'll bring in a certified public accountant, a financial manager
from Dean Witter to talk about investments. A guy from ESPN will
come in, and so will NBC's producer for the Olympic Games. They'll
talk about how to handle the media. We'll prepare them to handle
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Franchise'' is being made Y2K ready. The world awaits.

   PARTIES-FIZZLE (Los Angeles) -- As the world's greatest cities
celebrated the New Year into Saturday morning at spectacular and
ornate events, the entertainment capital of the world's official
millennium extravaganza fizzled and flopped like a third-rate
suburban dinner theater show. The lighting of the famed Hollywood
sign had been sold for months by Mayor Richard Riordan and the
city's cultural commissioner as a once-in-a-lifetime blockbuster
event, featuring fireworks, lasers, skywriters, and even
parachuting daredevils. By Greg Gittrich and Rick Orlov (Will move

   Y2KCOPS-QUIET (Los Angeles)-- The steaming hot pizzas and cold

rushed to their cars, but before they could even leave the parking
lot, the officer canceled the call. It was the same across Los

CHARLOTTE CAUGHT IN WEB OF ETHICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ They begin NBA and NFL contests here with a
pregame invocation. They invite people of all faiths to lead,
including pastors, priests, and rabbis. And though officials for
the Charlotte Hornets and Carolina Panthers don't encourage a
certain type of prayer, they must approve all prayers beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The two pro sports venues here are as loud and raucous as any in
the country, but it isn't surprising that Leslie Matz, director of
entertainment and special events for the Panthers, says that no one
ever has objected to the invocations, the venues are
you-could-hear-a-pin-drop silent during the prayer, and patrons
consider it ``a nice touch'' to begin a game.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, as they bow their heads and close their eyes, and the
intercessions sail off into the heavens, one message, intended or
not, stays with those proud Carolinians: Charlotte is rapidly
becoming a metropolis _ a diverse, cosmopolitan city capable of
standing tall and flexing its muscles with any major locale _ but
there is still a Bible Belt secure around its waist.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as mayor Pat McCrory put it: ``I think it's a reflection of
us putting things in proper perspective. It's just a game, and
there are a lot bigger issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the games and the issues have blended here in
two separate stories, _ one a terribly tragic tale that has struck
a chord locally and nationally, prompting intercessions and
outcries across the country. Another is a bizarre,
movie-of-the-week-like story most folks here are glad is all but
over.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, during what should have been one of the more
enjoyable times in the city's short history as a professional
sports town _ the Hornets being first in the NBA Central Division
for the first time in franchise history and the once-struggling
Panthers moving a step close to a possible NFL postseason berth _
both teams' feats were upstaged by stories off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Former Panthers wide receiver Rae Carruth was apprehended in the
trunk of a Toyota Camry in a motel parking lot in Wildersville,
Tenn., some eight hours away from Charlotte and charged with
first-degree murder of his girlfriend. He was the first active NFL
player charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 first-round draft pick had been out on $3 million bail
on charges stemming from the drive-by shooting of Cherica Adams,
who at the time was 6 1/2 months pregnant with a child DNA tests
proved is Carruth's. Prosecutors allege Carruth arranged to have
her killed.
</P>
<P>
   When Adams, who reportedly called 911 and gave an account of the
shooting after taking four bullets to the neck, chest, and abdomen,
died Dec. 14, Carruth was supposed to turn himself in to
authorities. Instead, he fled, and three other men arrested for
taking part in the crime had their requests for bond revoked.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 18 _ the day the Panthers beat the San Francisco 49ers
to keep their playoff hopes alive _ Adams's family buried its
24-year-old daughter. Her baby, a boy named Chancellor Lee Adams
who was delivered via caesarean section hours after the shooting,
remained in fair condition in a local hospital, and people in
Charlotte waited to see when Carruth would be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte police brought him back one day later. Prosecutors
have said they plan to seek the death penalty against Carruth and
the other three. The Panthers waived him two days before the 49ers
game.
</P>
<P>
   One local reporter called the Carruth story, ``the talk around
water coolers everywhere.'' Each day, reports on the tragedy led
the newscasts, dominated the front page of newspapers, and was the
hottest topic on radio talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   But on the day before Carruth's return, the story got upstaged.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, a Richland County, S.C., jury rejected a claim by a
woman who had accused George Shinn, owner of the Hornets, of having
sexually assaulted her.
</P>
<P>
   While the ruling all but ended the year-long battle between
Shinn and Leslie Price, it probably came too late to salvage the
public image of a man who supposedly had pledged to conduct his
franchise with a demeanor consistent with the Bible Belt venue it
occupies.
</P>
<P>
   Price, who reportedly met Shinn in a drug rehabilitation center
while she was receiving treatment and he was visiting a relative,
alleged he lured her to his home, grabbed her by the shoulders and
head, and forced her to perform oral sex Sept. 5, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn, who in a separate incident was accused of having an
affair with a Hornets cheerleader (he and his wife have since
divorced), said the sex with Price was consensual.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was broadcast on Court TV, and reportedly drew some of
the cable network's highest ratings ever.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not surprising. Among the more poignant moments in
the trial: Reportedly, Shinn's attorney Bill Diehl, while sharply
criticizing his own client for his infidelity, asked if the sex
wasn't consensual, why didn't Price bite Shinn to stop the act.
</P>
<P>
   His final words to jurors: ``If she ain't biting, she ain't
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all magnified
</P>
<P>
   Both stories reflect, in general terms, how senseless and
lawless a society can be, but they are magnified when they involve
sports figures, and occur at the same time in the same city. When
the city is one that boldly declares its eagerness to uphold
morality and family values, then it is further amplified.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the first headlines to come out of here involving
sports figures who have run afoul of the law, but they are the most
eye-catching, and it will be interesting to see whether the folks
in this city _ which is trying to lure Major League Baseball _
continue their love affair with pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great questions continually asked here within
Charlotte is are we really a major league town,'' said Brad Kranz,
a talk show co-host on WBT radio, ``and that is really interesting
since we already have two major league teams.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrory, who just got elected to his third term, answers phone
requests personally. He is as approachable as many other people in
city government, some of whom make home and cell phone numbers
readily available.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the reasons the city is one of the nation's best
blends of big-city economics and small-town charm: With a
population that almost rivals Boston's (539,000), it is the
country's second-largest financial center and home of the largest
bank (Bank of America, which relocated from San Francisco) and
First Union (which relocated from Philadelphia).
</P>
<P>
   Yet you still can park in the downtown government lots all day
for $1.50, and $20 still will buy a decent amount of groceries.
Religious programming dominates the FM radio dial. The local paper,
the Observer, reported that ``the faith community hopes to make
prayer as powerful a part of New Year's Eve as partying.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte is one of several Southern cities that have aimed to
be a major player nationally. They have garnered professional
sports franchises during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for
the most part, they have benefited from the exposure and national
status the teams bring.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, it would have been inconceivable to see professional
sports in Southern areas other than cosmopolitan cities like
Atlanta, Dallas, New Orleans, Houston, or Miami. Now, in addition
to Charlotte, there are franchises in Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa,
and Raleigh, N.C., and minor league hockey franchises throughout an
area once known for minor league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, when we sought an NBA franchise, we were laughed at
and scorned by cities in the Northeast,'' said McCrory. ``One New
York newspaper writer said the only thing we would get is a
McDonald's franchise. This was totally unrealistic 12 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did win an NBA expansion team, and for the first few
years of their existence the Hornets led the league in attendance.
The Panthers became the talk of the league by reaching the NFC
Championship game in their second year. Both have helped fuel the
city's image.
</P>
<P>
   Similar fortunes were experienced by the Orlando Magic and
Jacksonville Jaguars. ``The basketball franchise, the Hornets, put
Charlotte on the map nationally,'' said McCrory. ``It has been a
large factor in the decision-making process of major corporations''
relocating to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining its roots
</P>
<P>
   But while it makes big strides as a national player, Charlotte
residents aim to make certain newcomers don't spoil the area's
charm, and most folks are made aware _ on no uncertain terms _ that
it is not New York or LA.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year or two ago, we had a Panther player who used to do
gyrations out on the field, and word got out that that's not what
we want here,'' said McCrory, who said he was referring to
Charlotte's Fred Lane. ``He hasn't done that since, and he's been
an outstanding person for this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Carruth hired new representation last week, and one of his
lawyers said Thursday that Carruth will plead innocent and won't
try to move his trial out of Charlotte despite intense media
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no questions in my mind that the citizens there will
wait and hear both sides of the issue, and that there are very good
people there,'' Carruth's lawyer, Kenneth Spaulding, said.
</P>
<P>
   The day the jury in Price's suit ruled in Shinn's favor, he
received an ovation from the crowd at a Hornets game.
</P>
<P>
   He said in a prepared statement: ``I am personally sorry for the
embarrassment that these absurd accusations caused my family,
friends, employees, and the people of Charlotte. We have all made
mistakes during our lifetime, and this is one I hope everyone will
allow me to put in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Will they?
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the two stories will turn the city sour on pro sports,
McCrory said, ``I don't think the Rae Carruth (tragedy) has been a
factor at all. I think most people see that as one individual and
not a trend. If it became a trend, it would have a much more
negative impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see it as an isolated event, and football players do
not have as much name visibility or picture visibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Panthers analyst and former NFL standout quarterback Roman
Gabriel agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so with the Carruth case,'' he said, adding that
the events were so unusual it has even surprised many in the
Panthers organization. ``Rae was aloof from teammates, he was
friendly but quiet, and he didn't have a lot of friends on the
team. A lot of players didn't know much about Rae.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gabriel said the Shinn case served only to ``reinforce
opinions people already had'' about the owner.
</P>
<P>
   That might not bode well for someone who hopes to move the
Hornets (who currently play near the airport) to a downtown arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not a specific trend. I would not separate a
sports franchise from a corporation or a politician,'' said McCrory
about Shinn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlotte has a norm that's been around for years in the
corporate world, and this community is actively known for being
very clean and ethical and having a caring commitment to community.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a norm held at high standards for all corporations, and
it's not acceptable to break away from that norm. When you come
into our community you must know there are certain standards you
have to uphold. If not, the community will turn on you.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest woes aren't the first for the city's pro athletes.
``The Panthers have had five first-round draft picks,'' said WBT
radio talk show co-host Richard Spiers, ``and three have been
arrested: Kerry Collins (DWI), Jason Peter (DWI), and Rae
Carruth.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Panthers linebacker Kevin Greene's skirmish with an
assistant coach on the sideline a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets' move to acquire Derrick Coleman didn't go over well
here, in large part because of his checkered past, and because the
team let go of popular center Vlade Divac.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season began, Coleman was involved in an automobile
accident in which he was said to be at fault. He and two passengers
were injured, including teammate Eldridge Recasner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet such incidents may not reflect a problem in Charlotte but
rather may reflect issues in all of big-time professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have 100 athletes, the chances that all of them will be
candidates for the priesthood is not good,'' said Krantz.
</P>
<P>
   A societal problem?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lapchick, director of Northeastern's Center for the
Study of Sport in Society, said it is indicative of the ills of
society in general, something that can be seen in any profession
but is magnified in sports because of the high visibility of
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the recent events in Charlotte would have created as
much a stir inside the Capital Beltway as in the Bible Belt. ``This
(Carruth matter) reveals an everyday problem, something which
happens in every city and every line of work. These are big
societal issues,'' said Lapchick.
</P>
<P>
   But the exception is that Charlotte aims to make talk of
upholding standards more than lip service, and it expects the same
of others who come here. ``When the Panthers were started, the big
thing was, `We're going to be the class of the NFL,' '' said
Spiers. ``They said, `We're going to take people with character.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They made an effort to be the Dallas Cowboys incarnate, back
to the Tom Landry days. They went all out, but you could see the
bloom coming off the rose with the Kerry Collins thing. (in
addition to his DWI, Collins was called a racist by some
teammates.)''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that is that the innocence is lost,'' said Krantz.
``They all loved the original Hornets and it didn't matter if they
lost. They loved Muggsy Bogues, and when he left it was `To hell
with the Hornets.' And the thing about Charlotte is that it's a
small-town big city, so when something happens, everyone and his
brother knows about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Gabriel summed it up best. ``This is the Bible Belt, and
they want a certain type of player who is top-notch,'' he said.
``But you and I know if you bring in 50 players, knowing what
players do . . . players will get in trouble. Just like people who
live in the so-called Bible Belt get in trouble.''

DAWN OF A NEW BAY IN TAMPA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the 1999 season fades into history, one thing becomes clear:
The rich have no problem getting richer. No one should be surprised
if the same cast of characters shows up for baseball's final four
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what many had thought before the 1995 season when the
Colorado Rockies made the National League playoffs and in 1997 when
the Florida Marlins stunned the world by ousting the Atlanta Braves
and then upsetting the Cleveland Indians in the World Series. With
those results, the traditional view of building a pennant winner
changed, perhaps forever.
</P>
<P>
   Since that year, expansion means more than an infusion of cash
for existing clubs, which admittedly was a prime motivation for
placing major league franchises in Arizona and northern Florida.
Last season _ only their third _ the Diamondbacks won the NL West
by 14 games. You could see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo _ Mr. Get Things Done Now of
the NBA _ made it happen by authorizing the kind of selective
spending that could bring a Cy Young winner like Randy Johnson to
the Valley of the Sun. He got a bargain. Arizona's determination to
have and build a new stadium helped create not only a powerful
backing but also a level of success that would cost more than $100
million in places like New York, Boston, Cleveland, or Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Long-suffering East Coast fans and those in the have-not cities
have to realize that none of this was by accident. In Tampa Bay, a
last-place team in the AL East in 1999, the Devil Rays officially
have called a halt to the dog days of expansion in a manner similar
to Florida and Arizona. The Devil Rays have added powerful hitters
like Greg Vaughn, Vinny Castilla, and Gerald Williams to a lineup
that already includes Fred McGriff and Jose Canseco. No longer will
Tampa be known as Wade Boggs and a Cast of Unknowns. The 3,000-hit
man is now just part of the Devil Ray front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set a distinct five-year plan in place two years ago,''
says Tampa general manager Chuck LaMar, ``and we've been able to
stick to that plan. We told fans from the very start that we want
to be as competitive as we can be as quickly as we can be, but at
the same time not let that get in the way of long-term
development.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays won 63 games in 1998 and 69 last season. Believe
it or not, that placed Tampa (132-192) fourth among the 14
expansion franchises after two years. Arizona is first (165-159),
followed by the 1961-62 Los Angeles Angels (156-167), and the
1969-70 Kansas City Royals (134-190). Among them, only the
Diamondbacks put together teams in the so-called ``Big Money Era''
when budgets, salaries, and the ballparks were everyday community
assets managed by corporate executives rather than baseball men.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, modern owners seem to be more conservative than
their predecessors in terms of facing certain realities. But to put
together a franchise, make it grow and encompass all that is new
and fresh, puts more financial pressures on owners today than the
old guard ever felt.
</P>
<P>
   Who recalls salary caps and revenue sharing, the issues that
nearly shut the game down in 1994-95? Does it even matter what
league Tampa or Arizona are in anymore? Their success helps the
league. If Tampa is successful, it will help erase the memory of
the mess the Marlins made of their championship team. If Arizona
can go all the way, it would help restore respect for the
franchises out West, which no longer can count on the Dodgers,
Giants, Marlins, or A's to lead the way.
</P>
<P>
   Could Tampa Bay and Arizona meet in the World Series soon? It's
possible. Tampa Bay's signing of several veteran players helps, but
support for the Devil Rays dropped off after the first season, and
those are the people who must show up faithfully to make it all
work financially. Tampa Bay drew 1,696,294 in its second year after
attracting 2,261,158 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out and signed a couple of veteran players to make us
competitive next year,'' says LaMar. ``But overall this does not
change what we've done or what we're going to do in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, attendance is not what we'd like it to be. But the
moves we made recently are strictly from our desire to improve the
club. We feel like the fans of Tampa Bay will come when we have a
winning product that can be more competitive on the field. Our job
is to bring a championship to the Tampa Bay area.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays have a natural advantage and hope to exploit it.
Many players want to live year-round in a warm climate and Tampa
Bay enjoys the reputation as an ideal place to live, play, and
raise children. Arizonans say the same thing, although they
acknowledge that it does get very hot sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the veteran players feel that way,'' says LaMar. ``So many
of them who come here have deferred money, which allows us to go
out and get some of the players you've seen in the recent moves.
They like the area; they like raising their families here. We're
the only team in baseball that spring trains and plays their
baseball in the same city. Even for those who don't live here all
year it's pleasant to come here, rent a house on Feb. 15, and stay
in it all season. I think it's one of our advantages when it comes
to signing free agent players.''
</P>
<P>
   In other baseball cities, the talk is of trades and free agent
signings. The same teams do figure to battle for the pennant. To be
realistic, Arizona probably won't be sneaking up on teams in the
National League in 2000. Tampa Bay has pitching problems and looks
more like an old-fashioned power-hitting Red Sox team of the 1970s
than a solid contender.
</P>
<P>
   However, some positive impressions have been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't forget what having Wade for the first two years meant
to us,'' says LaMar. ``The chase for 3,000 hits and his last
moments were as exciting as any of us will be involved with.
Especially since he ended it with a home run, before a hometown
crowd, and before his family. He'll do well as my assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's time to move on. We're a better team. But we have to
prove we're better.''

<P>
   ``Thus says the Lord, set your house in order!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Isaiah 38.1 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Robert Kraft is a man seeking counsel this morning as his
team prepares to unravel for the last time this season, he does not
need to turn to Jerry Jones for it. He can turn to the Old
Testament instead, which frankly is a considerably more reliable
source of advice and inspiration than the Dallas Cowboys' sly owner
ever will be.
</P>
<P>
   The prophet Isaiah never ran a football team, but then his is a
higher power and his advice to the Patriots' beleaguered owner is
clear. If he does not set his house in order by making the hardest
of decisions _ firing incompetent people he likes personally _ what
will follow long ago was described in other pages of the same book
from which Isaiah spoke to so many church-goers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; for
emptiness will be his recompense.'' _ Job 15.31
</P>
<P>
   Empty is the Patriots' locker room this morning. Empty of hope,
empty of trust, empty of faith, empty of answers, empty of the
confidence brought by victory. Win or lose Sunday against the
Baltimore Ravens, Kraft's football team is in disarray, beaten down
by three years of rudderless leadership and blind trust in men who
have failed him.
</P>
<P>
   The players know better than anyone how far they are from what
they seemed to be four years ago when they unexpectedly marched to
the Super Bowl. Far from it on the field. Farther from it on the
sideline. Farthest from it of all in the front office.
</P>
<P>
   They have no faith anymore. No faith in the substitute teacher
who has been trying his best to lead them but was not up to the
task. And no faith in the backstabber who has been selecting less
and less fruitful talent for him to coach every year while
undermining him time and again with those players.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of good cheer and bad losses, The Terminator
suddenly appeared with a whistle around his neck on Wednesday and
suspended a guy who long ago may have deserved it, but he suspended
him for catching the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Of all Terry Glenn's transgressions, catching the flu was the
worst reason for him to be sent to the sideline, yet only when he
had a temperature of 102 did Carroll decide to flex his muscle.
When he did, the reaction of Glenn's teammates was to wander from
the team's practice facility on Wednesday like lost sheep in search
of Little Bo Peep, broken men who knew Glenn deserved to be stood
up to long ago, but well aware Carroll's action came too late and
for the most absurd of transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   They also knew that although Carroll seldom has had the stomach
for such discipline, his hands also were tied by personnel director
Bobby Grier, who all but adopted Glenn and several other players
after Bill Parcells left town. What this led to was a final act of
frustration by Carroll, while Grier refused to say if he supported
it or not.
</P>
<P>
   That is not leadership. That is helplessness, final acts of
self-destruction by two men sinking as if weights were tied to
their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Above Carroll sat Grier, once a silent man but now one striking
out at the coaches beneath him to try and save his own skin. As one
of those assistants said last week, ``The rats are deserting the
ship now.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier's silence often has been mistaken for wisdom by Kraft,
although the two are not the same. Now, after three years of
picking the groceries, he has infected his team with a terminal
case of botulism.
</P>
<P>
   This is no longer a team with young talent. It is a team falling
apart, age overcoming some of its best players in critical areas,
with few signs that the men behind them are dangerous anywhere but
at a party.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft will be told differently this week, as he tries to sort
out the mess he has helped create. He will be told to listen only
to the men whose jobs are on the line. He will be assured and
reassured that his team is not what it appears _ one in steady
decline _ but rather one that has been unlucky, two missed field
goals from this year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He will be told that by Carroll while Grier tries to reassure
him that there is talent here, the same thing he said last week as
he ran from microphone to microphone declaring there was enough
talent to win in New England if his coaches played the younger
players. He went on to say he wanted only to be judged by his
record.
</P>
<P>
   And so he shall be.
</P>
<P>
   Since Grier first reached big-time college football as an
assistant coach on an 0-11 Boston College team in 1978, he has
spent his life either at BC, in various capacities with the
Patriots, or for one season as the offensive coordinator at
Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the aggregate record of the teams with which he has been
associated: 145-185.
</P>
<P>
   Since Carroll arrived in Foxborough and Grier took over the
personnel department, Kraft's football team has gone from the Super
Bowl, to 1 point from making the AFC Championship Game, to out of
the playoffs in one game, to out of the playoffs before the
playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's teams are 11-29 against teams with winning records
when he has been the head coach, a winning percentage of .275
against the kind of teams that make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Grier and Carroll have screamed for the truth to be told time
and again as if somehow it has now, and so there it is. The truth.
The sad truth told not by words but by the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This is no one's fault, of course. Merely an accident. Bad luck.
Injuries. Acts of God and absences of tender mercies.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft can believe that if he wants, or he can recall another
philosopher king he once knew, one he doesn't like much anymore but
one he grudgingly acknowledged once to be ``the greatest coach of
modern times.'' That coach, Parcells, loved to say, ``In
professional sports, you are what you are. Whatever you finish,
that's what you are. If you're 1-15, you're a 1-15 team. If you're
2-14, you're 2-14, no better, no worse. You can look in the
brochure and see that the team is 5-9 but it only lost six games by
a total of 9 points. You follow me? The reason the team is 5-9 is
because it wasn't any good in close games. With all those sports PR
guys, the implication is that the team just ran into some bad luck,
really should have finished 9-5. That isn't the way it is in my
mind. If you're 2-14, you're 2-14.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft won't find that quote in the Bible, but he carries it
somewhere inside him because he heard it often enough. Much as he
might hate to do it, he needs to hear it once more. If he heeds
those words and ignores others that are more self-serving, the rest
of what he has to do will be clear to him.
</P>
<P>
   So now what?
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft changes his management team, where is he likely to
head? That is the million-dollar question, and who knows what his
final answer will be?
</P>
<P>
   No one, but if he's smart he'll turn first to a guy he wanted to
hire when this all began three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He'll turn to Bill Belichick, the Jets' assistant head coach and
defensive coordinator and a man Kraft got along well with until
Belichick defected to New York with Parcells and began beating the
Patriots' brains in three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is 4-2 against the Patriots' offense and he has pushed
and trapped Drew Bledsoe into some of the worst performances of his
career. Ending his time with the Jets would be addition by
subtraction for the Patriots, but there are other reasons for Kraft
to give him a second chance as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that according to sources familiar with his
contract, Belichick has an out clause that will go into effect for
a brief period after the Jets are sold to Cablevision mogul Chuck
Dolan. That means Kraft could not be forced to hand over
compensation of any sort to the Jets for hiring him and perhaps
explains why this week Parcells declared he would not stand in the
way of Belichick getting a head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick reportedly turned down even considering similar
opportunities with Oakland, Chicago, and Kansas City last year in
part because he has a contract that guarantees he will replace
Parcells when the Tuna finally leaves the sideline. But he also has
told friends he is only interested in taking over a competitive
team.
</P>
<P>
   The two he had in mind were Washington and New England because
both have talented young quarterbacks and owners willing to spend
to the cap limit and beyond to win. The organization would have to
be rebuilt here for Belichick to take over, but he could use his
leverage as arguably the leading available candidate to bring in
his own people as both coaches and in personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick always got along with Kraft, which remains a key to
survival for any head coach, and Bledsoe often has praised him
during the years he has been trying to find ways to beat his
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Belichick reportedly has learned from his
public relations gaffes in Cleveland, mistakes that ultimately
doomed him more than anything his Browns did on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those factors, Belichick is the leading candidate on
Kraft's list, although he is not the only one. Word is St. Louis
offensive coordinator Mike Martz is not on Kraft's list, which
probably means his name is just below Belichick's, but there is one
problem there. Because the Patriots were in the Super Bowl the year
Parcells quit, Kraft did not get to even look for a replacement
until the top candidates and many of the best assistants had been
hired.
</P>
<P>
   Picking at him
</P>
<P>
   Here's one last cautionary note to Kraft before he makes his
final decision. Bengals owner Mike Brown declared this week he
would not make head coach Bruce Coslet or his staff ``the
scapegoat'' for a team that is 4-11 entering Sunday's final game.
He said Coslet and his staff had done a good job of coaching and
motivating the Bengals despite the fact Coslet has the worst
winning percentage of any active NFL coach, never has beaten a team
with a winning record on the road since he took over Oct. 21, 1996,
and leads the losingest team of the decade. Brown mistakenly called
this loyalty. Star wide receiver Carl Pickens said he couldn't
believe it when he heard the news because ``Bruce has never had a
winning record anywhere.'' After a closed-door session in which
Brown may have threatened to suspend Pickens without his $265,000
weekly paycheck, the chastened receiver apologized through the
Bengals' PR department, saying, ``Contrary to what I said earlier
today, I believe this team can be a winner next year if we all pull
together, suport one another, and keep a positive attitude.'' . . .
One NFC personnel director looked up his scouting report on Chris
Canty Thursday. ``We had him rated 5.42,'' he said. ``That's a
fourth-round pick. I couldn't believe he went 29th.'' . . . Glenn
isn't the only guy who doesn't learn from his mistakes. Steelers
safety Lee Flowers was fined $7,500 for punching Carolina tight end
Wesley Walls following a hit on an incomplete pass. Flowers at
first said he was sorry. Then he apologized to any kids who were
Steeler fans and might have witnessed it. Then he stuck his foot in
his mouth. ``I don't want to send the wrong message to the younger
kids who love the Steelers and everything, but to be honest, if I
had to do it all over, I'd do the same thing,'' Flowers said.
``That's just how I play. It was foolish. I put the team in a bad
position. We could have lost the game. In that aspect, you have to
pick and choose to do stupid things like that and that was the
wrong time to do it.'' . . . The unlikely rise of Ray Lucas from
unknown special teams player in New England to a starting
quarterback in New York has been only slightly more remarkable than
his rise to the elite club of Parcells Guys. It is obvious Lucas
has become one of them and he has a theory on how that happened:
``Probably because when he told me to do something, you don't ask
questions,'' Lucas said. ``You kill yourself trying even if you
can't do it. If you put 150 percent behind it, you know, he kind of
respects that. Especially if you're a quarterback. I think Coach
has a tendency to think of quarterbacks as being soft a little bit.
I'm not saying that we are or anything but when you take a kid from
college who is a quarterback and you tell him to run down on
special teams, run into the wedge, and you do it and knock yourself
out, then get up and go back down and do it again, I think you have
a mutual respect for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross him off
</P>
<P>
   If you hear Marty Schottenheimer's name on the Patriots'
shopping list (if there is one), don't count on it. Anyone who
signs Schottenheimer as their head coach will be forced to
compensate the Kansas City Chiefs, who are still paying him.
Schottenheimer has said he doesn't want to coach next year and
Chiefs president Carl Peterson has made clear he will seek draft
picks if someone does . . . Here's an assessment of Bledsoe's
problems by a recently retired NFL offensive coordinator with a
long track record of producing high-powered offenses. ``Drew
Bledsoe and Jeff George have the most ability to throw the football
of any quarterbacks in the league,'' he said. ``But quarterbacks
are only as good as the guys around them. Look at Steve Young when
he was at Tampa. He didn't look anything like Steve Young in San
Francisco. Drew is one of the two or three best quarterbacks in the
league, although you wouldn't know it off of this year. If you told
me Drew was going to have the kind of second half he's had I would
have told you no way, but I'll tell you this, too. There's been an
erosion of talent there. I told people before the season they could
go 12-4 but it was more likely they'd be what they are right now.
When a great quarterback goes down the way Drew has it's usually
because the team around him isn't very good. Then it snowballs from
there. You lose a little confidence and then you try and make a few
too many plays and then you're throwing it too quick and it all
compounds itself. But Drew will end up being the player he's always
been. This last half-season is not the kind of quarterback he is or
the kind he will be.'' . . . Remember James B. Orthwein? The former
owner of the Patriots just found out bringing pro football to St.
Louis may cost him $6.25 million. That's what the IRS says he owes
in back taxes from 1994, the year he thought he took a
``charitable'' deduction of $17 million for giving a charity formed
to help bring pro football back to St. Louis 6,500 shares of stock
in what is now the Trans World Dome. According to the IRS, the
75-year-old beer heir overvalued the stock, claiming it was worth
$22.25 million when the IRS says it's worth $5.24 million. See you
back in court, Orthwein says . . . Although the Jaguars have the
best record in the AFC at 13-2, the Titans may be the conference's
best team if the Colts aren't. They've made that point by twice
beating the Jaguars silly. After three straight 8-8 years they
finally have lived up to their potential for the simplest of
reasons, according to Pro Bowl running back Eddie George. ``We got
tired of being a mediocre team and wanted to make that next move
forward,'' he said. ``It was either going to get worse or it was
going to get better. We decided we wanted to get better.'' Remember
the old ``NY'' logo on the Giants' helmets? Word is it's coming
back next season.

HEADSTART FOR NEW ZEALAND 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ As racing gets underway in the
semifinals of the Louis Vuitton Cup, the bitter aftertaste of the
rancor between Nippon and the rest of the challengers lingers like
a Y2K/bad wine hangover.
</P>
<P>
   What Peter Gilmour did, said Paul Cayard, head of the San
Francisco-based AmericaOne syndicate Saturday as he looked over the
pairings for the rest of the week's matches, ``is make it very easy
for New Zealand to tell how fast any challenger is and where its
strengths and weaknesses are.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Gilmour, an Australian skippering for the Nippon
Challenge, accepted Team New Zealand's invitation to do some
practice racing, which included long side by side ``drag racing''
and four practice starts.
</P>
<P>
   Under a long-standing Cup tradition, and by an unwritten
agreement among the 11 challengers last September, no challenger is
to help the defender by practice racing, which amounts to sharing
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, New Zealand first used its more experimental
boat against Nippon, then brought out its more conventional boat
and soundly thrashed Gilmour and the Japanese boat, which placed
second on the challengers' list during the first half of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand downplays the performance. Said the Kiwis' Tom
Schnackenberg, ``It would take a good two weeks in perfect
conditions to truly compare performances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nippon/New Zealand scrimmage occurred on a day of light
flukey air and shifty conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Cayard and others pointed out, self-confidence is a
huge factor in America's Cup racing, and there's a world of
difference between New Zealand not quite knowing if it is up to the
challengers' pace or feeling somewhat paranoid that it may be well
off it, especially after a season in which the challengers beat up
each other daily while New Zealand raced intramurally.
</P>
<P>
   The two warring syndicates _ Dennis Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes and
Gilmour's Nippon _ are paired for the first day of racing.
</P>
<P>
   If prerace handicapping proves to be as accurate as it was
before the first three rounds, then the prerace talk is worth less
than nothing. The New York Yacht Club's Young America campaign is
the best proof of that. Thought to be a preseason favorite, it was
out of the game surprisingly early.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential dark horses _ Nippon and Stars &AMP; Stripes _ rose
meteorically. According to Conner, the most experienced racer in
New Zealand, the extremely variable and shifty winds in Hauraki
Gulf make any race, in any round, a matter of a lucky draw.
</P>
<P>
   That said, here is a glance at the six challengers, in order of
finish in the trials:
</P>
<P>
   (FR) PRADA from Italy: An extremely good team with two of the
fastest boats in the regatta, developed out of Bill Koch's 1995
boats and technology. The teamwork is solid and skipper Francesco
de Angelis has shown no weakness.
</P>
<P>
   The only negative with Prada is theoretical. Having sailed here
the longest, its early dominance over the later-arriving teams may
have peaked, with the other teams catching up later in the trials.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) NIPPON from Japan: A team that has improved greatly over
the three months of trials. Gilmour, the skipper, is one of the
world's top match racers. The campaign seems to be on a steady rise
in speed and sailing ability.
</P>
<P>
   The negative is that one boat, Idaten, seems steady but slower
than Asura, which is fast but erratic. It will use Asura in this
round.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) AMERICA TRUE from San Francisco: This has been a steadily
improving boat with a thoroughly motivated mixed-gender team led by
syndicate boss Dawn Riley. Its huge success, especially in the last
round, gives it real momentum as the semis begin.
</P>
<P>
   Helmsman John Cutler from New Zealand is a true world-class
journeyman who is a proven winner in any boat, any water. Syndicate
general manager Chris Coffin knows how to run a lean, efficient
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The only negative is America True's single-boat program. To date
that has not been a factor, but could be a potential hindrance,
especially in heavy weather.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) AMERICAONE from San Francisco: A top team in a new, faster
boat is a powerful combination. Add the most formidable skipper in
the regatta, Cayard, and this package has got to rate as a
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) TEAM DENNIS CONNER from San Diego: The most experienced
team on the water got even better in midseason as Tom Whidden
joined the afterguard calling tactics. Whidden has sailed with
Conner for 20 years and brings not only his wisdom, but a sense of
order. He knows how to keep skipper Ken Read in his comfort zone.
Conner calling syndicate shots _ enough said.
</P>
<P>
   Its potential negative is its one boat geared toward heavy
weather. But on heavy days, vice becomes a virtue. If November's
weather repeats itself, watch out for Stars &AMP; Stripes.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) LE DEFI FRANCAIS from France: Helmsman Bertrand Pace knows
it. The team knows it. Everyone knows it. The French are dangling
by a miracle.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Am I the only one who has trouble with Michael Jordan being
ESPN's Athlete of the Century, or the only one wondering whether he
should even have been the top basketball player?
</P>
<P>
   That designation should go, inarguably, to Bill Russell. And I'm
not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the game all about? Is it for a team to win? Or a guy
to score a lot of points,'' said former Celtics great Tom Heinsohn.
``Nobody won more than Russell did.''
</P>
<P>
   He's absolutely correct. That Russell ranked behind Jordan,
Magic Johnson, and Wilt Chamberlain on ESPN's list is a travesty.
Not only did he win 11 NBA titles in 13 years, he revolutionized
the game at both ends. He also never lost a so-called
``winner-take-all'' game, whether at San Francisco, the Olympics,
or in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was worth 60 points a night to us,'' Heinsohn said. ``He
made teams change their offensive game plans and he made them
change their defensive game plans. Did Michael Jordan ever do that?
The answer is nobody did, except Russell.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinsohn has several Russell stories, but one of his favorites
is the time he, Russell, and some other NBA All-Stars were touring
overseas and scheduled to play against the Yugoslav National Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had this redheaded kid who they said was the world's
greatest scorer,'' Heinsohn said. ``Well, they got us mad when they
wouldn't play our anthem or put up our flag. Then Red (Auerbach)
went to Russell and said, `See that kid? They say he's the world's
greatest scorer. I don't want him to score.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell blocked every single shot that kid took and he finally
was ejected for throwing the ball at Russ after he blocked another
of his shots.''
</P>
<P>
   My friend and colleague, Sam Smith of the Chicago Tribune, once
tried to convince me that if David Robinson had joined the Celtics
in 1956, and if Russell had joined the Spurs in 1990, there would
be no difference in the number of rings. I passed that along to
Heinsohn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has David Robinson ever done? He's not even as good as
Walt Bellamy,'' Heinsohn sniffed.
</P>
<P>
   Rumbling along
</P>
<P>
   Random ramblings as a new year dawns and we consider the single
most inexplicable phenomenon of the 1999-2000 NBA season: What
possesses more than 20,000 people to regularly attend Bulls games?
. . . The 10-member committee charged with the burdensome task of
selecting the final three members of the 2000 Olympic Team will
meet via conference call Tuesday to throw names about and get some
needed levity from committee member Kevin McHale. You listen to Rod
Thorn, the committee overseer, and it almost sounds like it really
matters which players they choose. ``We need a big guy, a slasher
who can play a couple positions, and a shooter, because we're going
to see a lot of zones,'' Thorn says, trying to sound earnest. The
leading candidates are the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal for the big
man, the Pistons' Grant Hill for the slasher, and, depending on the
time of day, Milwaukee's Ray Allen, Toronto's Vince Carter, or
Charlotte's Eddie Jones for the shooter's job. Shaq has told
reporters he's not interested, but, Thorn says, ``He says a lot of
things. He hasn't told any of us.'' Wonder if Shaq knows that
training camp is in Maui and that, save for a brief swing through
Tokyo, USA Basketball is allowing ``guests'' to join the players on
their six-week Olympic experience? ``It's going to be a lot more
comparable to 1992, (when the Dream Team ``practiced'' in Monaco)
than to 1996,'' says Craig Miller of USA Basketball. The nine
members already on the team are Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Tom
Gugliotta, Vin Baker, Allan Houston, Gary Payton, Tim Hardaway,
Steve Smith, and Jason Kidd. Yup, they need three more biggies to
keep the gold . . . Gugliotta, meanwhile, has been cleared to
return to practice after his frightening seizure Dec. 17. Doctors
now say that Googs took an over-the-counter dietary supplement that
does not have FDA approval. He did it, he says, to help him sleep.
(Ever hear of Tylenol PM?) Googs sounded thankful, grateful, lucky,
in talking to reporters after his first workout. ``What burns me is
that I took something I didn't know too much about. That's just not
right to do and it nearly cost me my life,'' he said. The Suns are
trying to stay afloat despite a coaching change and the losses of
three starters. Googs, Shawn Marion (pre-Christmas knee surgery),
and Penny Hardaway (plantar fascia) are all out. Penny just had a
soft cast put on his right foot. But what he has is incredibly
painful and disabling. The Suns feel he could be out three more
weeks, which could mean he'll miss the Suns' lone Boston appearance
later this month (Jan. 28). Marion is out indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc comes back
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of returning to practice, Toni Kukoc, who has had the
worst case of either back spasms or Croatia Dreaming, is practicing
again. The Bulls are hoping he'll play well enough and long enough
to get them to four wins by the All-Star break . . . For years,
Utah was the rock of NBA franchises. In addition to the John
Stockton/Karl Malone tandem, the Jazz have had the same coach since
December of 1988, the same owner since 1985, and the same franchise
icon (Frank Layden) seemingly forever. Well, now Layden, age 68, is
retiring, making him the third Utah exec to bolt this season. His
son, Scott, left the Jazz as their chief basketball man to take
over the general manager's job with the Knicks. Tim Howells, who
was the general manager, also left to go into private business.
We'll know if things are really bad when Hot Rod Hundley and Ron
Boone leave the broadcast booth . . . RIP Miami Arena. It was in
existence for all of 11 years, which must be some sort of record
for obsolescence. ``Within a year or two, it became obsolete,''
said Miami coach/president Pat Riley, who was decidedly
unsentimental about leaving the building. ``We're all happy to
leave Miami Arena.'' How's this for turnover? The Timberwolves have
been in the Target Center since 1990 and already it's the
ninth-oldest building in the league. And they remain the only one
of the four expansion teams from the late 1980s that either hasn't
moved to a new building or isn't planning to move. The oldest arena
continues to be Madison Square Garden, but it has been modernized.
Houston (1975), Dallas (1980), and New Jersey (1981) now are the
oldest, non-improved venues. The Rockets may have to move after
voters turned down an arena referendum (but that was before they
had a chance to see Steve Francis) while Dallas has plans for a new
building. The Nets ought to blow up Continental Airlines Arena and
start over.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley bears gifts
</P>
<P>
   So, did the NBA Christmas Party this year lack for finger food
because Charles Barkley had to unexpectedly retire? ``Not at all,''
cracked Thorn. ``Charles was kind enough to send us two substantial
donations before he retired.'' Thorn was referring to Barkley's
fines for fighting with Shaq and dissing referee Mike Mathis . . .
Keep an eye on the Hornets. Their Thursday loss to Indiana left
them two games behind the Pacers and they have what can only be
called a brutal Western swing starting Tuesday. They play four
games in five days against the Suns, Jazz, Lakers, and Nuggets.
Then, before returning home, they stop off in Milwaukee. ``I think
we can do some damage out there,'' says coach Paul Silas. They'll
be doing all this, more than likely, without Jones, although he's
ahead of schedule in recovering from an elbow injury . . . Through
the wonders of satellite technology, I have discovered that the
last name of the Mavericks' second-year forward, Dirk Nowitzki,
coveted at draft time 1998 by Rick Pitino, is actually pronounced
No-vitz-ki. (Anyone with a passing knowledge of German could, of
course, have told me that.) However you say it, the kid can stroke
it. He hit the Lakers for 19 in the fourth quarter alone in a
2-point loss at the Staples Center. The Mavericks, while undeniably
abysmal, have had their share of bad luck. In addition to injuries,
they had to play 17 of their first 29 on the road. That might help
to put their record somewhat in perspective. JR Rider, suspended
indefinitely. Plus ca change, etc.

OLD WAYS COULD CURE LEAGUE'S STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Always and forever a shooter, Brett Hull took aim again last
week, this time with his second most reliable weapon: his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, now with 601 goals and inching closer to breaking his
father's career total of 610, said in a conference call Thursday
that ``the game isn't a whole bunch of fun to play anymore'' and
that he wishes the Lords of the Boards would make the moves
necessary to bring back the game's offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to the rink every day,'' said the glib Hull, the NHL's
top goal scorer of the '90s (494 after a pair in the Dallas Stars'
5-4 victory over Anaheim Friday night) , ``hoping that it will
change back to the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Once was the time, and not long ago, that virtually every team
in the league had a scorer or two who averaged better than a point
per game. One hundred-point scorers were commonplace. Sometimes a
dozen or more shooters totaled 100 points in a season. Witness: the
No. 10 scorer in 1995-96, Sergei Fedorov, finished 39-68_107, and
that was 54 points off Mario Lemieux's league-leading mark.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the last three seasons, the 100-point plateau has
been broken only six times _ twice by Jaromir Jagr, twice by Teemu
Selanne, and once each by Peter Forsberg and Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   As midseason approaches in the first week of January, Jagr looks
like the only certainty to get 100 again, with Owen Nolan and maybe
Mark Recchi and Jeremy Roenick flirting with what has become the
game's invisible ceiling. As of Thursday morning, only 11 players
league-wide averaged a point-per-game or more.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what change he might make to get the scoring kick started,
Hull said he felt the change had to be more philosophical than
fundamental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the chip-in, chip-out, the dump-in, dump-out,'' said
Hull, describing the dull, metronomic approach most clubs have
adopted in recent seasons. ``No one drop-passes. But I don't see
that you've got to make changes _ just go back to the way it was.
The rink's the same dimension. We have the same lines. It was wide
open before, and things were just fine. It's the same game, and it
can be entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   But in too many rinks and for too many nights, today's NHL
brings together clubs that care more about how to avoid losing
rather than creating ways to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't entertain the fans,'' said Hull, hitting upon the
most salient issue, ``then the fans will stop coming. And if you
don't entertain, they won't watch TV. It's this philosophy of being
afraid _ well, I don't know if I'd say afraid _ but there's got to
be some reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching back to the era of his father, Bobby Hull, Brett would
give back the curved blades to the shooters. In his view, there was
nothing wrong with the banana blades we saw in the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, the goalies have so much equipment,'' he said, ``you
couldn't hurt 'em with a cannon.''
</P>
<P>
   A marketing coup
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan the No. 1 athlete of the century? I realized, oh,
10 years ago that marketing is the message. It took me until last
week to realize that it's the only message . . . The Rangers' Petr
Nedved (still rumored to be on the trade block) recently considered
renting an Upper East Side apartment in a building where magician
David Copperfield resides. The owners eventually pulled the flat
from the market, but Nedved had qualms about taking it anyway. Said
the sleight-of-hand forward: ``I wouldn't want him to make me
disappear.'' . . . Gee, if only the NZT (neutral zone trap) hadn't
been Y2K compliant . . . Buffalo's flashy rookie, Maxim Afinogenov,
has a 12-year-old sister, Katia, who is on course to be the next
sensation in the tennis world. Katia has trained for three years at
Rick Macci's Tennis Academy in Delray Beach, Fla., (stomping
grounds of Jennifer Capriati and the Williams sisters, Venus and
Serena). Macci to the Buffalo News: ``She's one in a million. She's
going to be the Moscow Magician.'' She may be the former, but she
won't be the latter until Bud Collins says so . . . If the Bruins
have to go three months with Jason Allison in mothballs, then I'd
say it's time to pencil them in for a Top 10 pick in the June 10
draft. That's the good news. You already know the bad news . . .
How much longer before the Jerry Springer Show features distraught
parents who live in a hell created by their childrens' overexposure
to sports talk radio? . . . New trio in Manhattan has Theo Fleury
lined up with rookie Mike York (ex- of Michigan State) and Adam
Graves. York was a Michigan State freshman in '95-96, which was
Anson Carter's senior season . . . Pat Verbeek has turned into a
decent pickup for the Red Wings. As of late last week, the
ex-Whaler, who has a Cup ring from his Dallas days, had 8 goals and
18 points in 23 games and was an impressive plus-21, riding on the
No. 1 line with Brendan Shanahan and Steve Yzerman . . . Keep this
in mind, hockey parents, while you're draining that next cup of
gourmet coffee from a filthy arena vending machine: Walter Gretzky
was adamant about not allowing his son, Wayne, to play hockey
year-round. The ice was off-limits for a good portion of the year
at the Great One's house. If you find yourself sipping that same
cup of coffee in July, then it may be time to drop the cup, look in
the mirror, and come out of the rink with your arms up . . . Former
Bruin Gord Kluzak, who splits his time between Goldman Sachs and
the Bruins broadcast booth, isn't so sure that there are more
concussions in today's NHL. It could be, he believes, that there is
just more attention paid to knocks on the head. ``I can remember
being knocked out _ and I mean knocked cold _ when Kraig Nienhuis
and I collided one day in practice. Next day, we had a game, I was
in there. I'm sure I had some of the lingering symptoms _
definitely nausea. But a bad stomach didn't keep you out of the
lineup. Your arm had to be hanging off before something like that
happened.'' . . . Kirk Muller, recently signed in Dallas, spent
months with a personal trainer in the offseason, and he was running
a mile in less than 5 1/2 minutes. ``I'm not going to blow this
chance,'' he said, prior to inking his new deal . . . Goaded on by
general manager Glen Sather, Oiler tough guy Georges Laraque
squared off in a boxing match with Daryl Duke, the club's fitness
guru, who also happens to be a former world champion kick boxer.
With Ping-Pong table pushed aside in the Oiler dressing room, the
wee Duke (165 pounds) and the 230-pound Laraque got into a tussle
that ended with the Oiler winger out with a scratched cornea . . .
If the IIHF buys it and it wins political support across Canada,
former Sabres coach Ted Nolan, under the auspices of the Canadian
Hockey Association, will coach a Native North American hockey club
formed to compete internationally, including in the World
Championships and the Olympics. The 41-year-old Nolan hasn't worked
in the NHL since departing Buffalo in the summer of '97, only weeks
after he was named the NHL's coach of the year and then turned down
a lukewarm offer to remain behind the Buffalo bench. Nolan recently
told the Toronto Globe and Mail: ``I'm going to put an ad in the
Yellow Pages: Coach for hire. Maybe it will work.'' . . . The
Golden State Warriors last week bounced their coach, P.J.
Carlesimo, who was only halfway through his five-year, $15 million
deal. Top NHL coaches make only $1 million a year, and there are a
handful in the $300,000-$500,000 range. All in all, with their
players banking an average $1.3 million per man, NHL head coaches
remain vastly underpaid compared to coaches in the three other
major sports.
</P>
<P>
   Catching a break
</P>
<P>
   The league is investigating the rash of hand injuries
goaltenders have suffered this season. Most of the focus is on the
catching glove, which the league downsized (two inches off the
circumference) in recent moves aimed at giving netminders less of
an advantage . . . No doubt Eric Lindros will have his name on the
Stanley Cup someday. But from here, he looks like hockey's answer
to Roger Clemens. To wit: He'll be in his early- or mid-30s, and
probably with his second or third NHL club, when he finally gets
his hands on the big prize . . . The Hockey News' final edition of
1999 named Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs as the game's most powerful
team owner and fourth overall on its power-and-influence depth
chart. The top three: commissioner Gary Bettman, union boss Bob
Goodenow, and Wayne Gretzky. Boston GM/president Harry Sinden
ranked No. 14 . . . Monday night, when the Bruins again were
listless in a 3-0 loss on Long Island, three of their alums were
busy banging in pucks for other NHL clubs. Cam Stewart potted a
pair (his fourth and fifth) for the Panthers in a 6-1 victory over
Tampa Bay; Sergei Zholtok knocked in two (9, 10) for the Canadiens
in their 4-4 tie with the Senators, who got help from Shawn
McEachern (No. 11) . . . Monday's drop-dead date came and went
without Keith Primeau taking the Hurricanes' offer of two years at
$3 million per, and management now says it is done with him for the
year. As the witching hour expired, 'Canes GM Jim Rutherford made a
deal, flipping Primeau to Phoenix for Keith Tkachuk. But 'Canes
owner Peter Karmanos put the kibosh on the deal at the 11th hour,
the third time he has vetoed a Primeau deal executed by Rutherford.
In prior deals Primeau would have ended up either a Ranger or a
Flyer . . . Former Maine pivot Bob Corkum, without a contract since
departing Phoenix after last season, finally agreed to a two-year
pact in Anaheim that will bring him a pro-rated $700,000 this
season and $800,000 in 2000-01. The Rangers had a keen interest in
signing Corkum before inking ex-Bruin Tim Taylor, but word around
Manhattan was that he didn't like the Rangers' offer (believed to
be close to the $1.4 million a year Taylor got). In the meantime,
the market corrected dramatically and Corkum, now 32, finally took
what he could get. He would have been a nice fit in the Boston
lineup, especially with the club's lingering faceoff woes . . . You
love the feel of frostbite between your toes if you can't wait for
the next score to pop up on-line from the World Junior tournament
in Skelleftea, Sweden. Two names to file away on your rinkodex,
however: Jason Spezza and Jay Bouwmeester, both are suiting up for
Canada's junior squad. They're both 16 years old, following in the
footsteps of Lindros ('91) and Gretzky ('78) as the only sweet-16
juniors to pull on the Team Maple Leaf sweater. Spezza, a winger,
won't be drafted until 2001 and Bouwmeester isn't eligible until
2002 . . . Jagr, from the main office of the brutally honest: ``I
cannot play defense. I cannot fight, but I have some talent to
score goals.'' A coach caring about Jagr's defense would be like a
math teacher wondering why Bill Gates didn't come to class with one
of those plastic pencil holders tucked into his shirt pocket . . .
Note to boss: just over a week to go before the Let's Play Hockey
International Expo begins its three-day run (Jan. 10-12) in Las
Vegas, bringing together game-related manufacturers. Sounds like
the ideal time to blow the lid off the dirty secrets of the dead
puck era . . . Ray Bourque, on track Saturday to become only the
fifth NHLer to play in four decades, should be joined in that elite
club this afternoon by Mark Messier when the Canucks play in
Calgary. The others: George Armstrong ('49-'71), Gordie Howe
('46-'80), Carl Brewer ('57-'80), and Bobby Hull ('57-'80) . . .
Derek Sanderson had pretty good legs and a sharp mind for the game.
But if the Turk had Geoff Sanderson's legs and steaming slapper, he
might have left the game with 500 goals (vs. 202) . . . The Czech
Republic national junior team went to Sweden without one of its top
wingers, Michal Travnicek (3-2_5 in last year's junior tournament).
A Maple Leaf draft pick, Travnicek is serving a three-year
suspension from international hockey for sticking Sweden's Mattias
Weinhandl in the eye during a junior tournament last November.
Weinhandl, a '99 Islander draft pick, lost 90 percent of the vision
in his left eye and will need surgery . . . Maybe it's just the
season, but in a sentimental swoon last week I found myself missing
the Whale, and even the 1:30 a.m. drives back up I-84, with window
down and blasts of chilled air keeping me from falling asleep at
the wheel . . . Where have you gone, Risto Siltanen?

LOOKING AHEAD 100 YEARS

<P>
   Had enough of the ``end of the century'' carpet bombing of
recent weeks? Let's look forward instead. Assuming I live to be 146
years old (hopefully they'll update this little pencil drawing of
my big head by then), this is what the column should look like 100
years from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 2, 2100 . . .
</P>
<P>
   Good morning New England sports fans. As we enter a new century,
it's a good time to examine the current state of the Red Sox,
Patriots, Celtics, and Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Boston's American League baseball entry is the first team in pro
sports to go 182 years without winning a championship. There were
several near misses in the 21st century when the Sox lost 11 World
Series, all in the seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought we were going to do it in the last century,''
said J.J. Harrington, great-grandson of John Harrington, the last
link to the Thomas Yawkey era.
</P>
<P>
   The Harringtons have been trustees of the Yawkey Foundation for
almost 110 years and J.J. says he plans to sell the team when it
will be most beneficial to the Yawkey Trust. ``I know that's what
Jean Yawkey would have wanted me to do,'' said J.J.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are hoping that the 2100 season will be the one in which
they'll snap the Curse of the Bambino. They're also hoping to open
their new Fenway Park. The ``Save Fenway'' zealots successfully
preserved the original, 188-year-old Fenway for the entire 21st
century, but the Sox finally have acquired the last of the acreage
they need to build the new park.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights ago _ under cover of darkness in the middle of New
Year's Eve celebrations _ the Sox announced their annual ticket
price increase. Bleachers will go for $850 a pop this year.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As the Patriots enter a new century, there is turmoil on the
field, off the field, and in the front office. And there is traffic
on Route 1, despite the 16 special access roads that were part of
the new stadium built at the start of the last century. One new
access road goes directly from Kraft Stadium to the State Police
barracks and Patriots players have been issued EZ Passes for this
road.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots finish their 2099-2100 season today with a home
game against the Jets. Dating back to November 1999, New England
has lost 201 consecutive games to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are still owned by the Kraft family, which kept the
team from moving out of New England at least 40 times in the last
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned down offers from Hartford, Providence, Los Angeles,
Houston, Nashua, Banff, you name it,'' said J.J. Kraft, who serves
as owner, head coach, and general manager of the Patriots. ``My
family's legacy in the community is what's important to me. Oh, did
I mention we turned down an offer from Hartford?''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said he thought the Patriots could upgrade through the
draft this year. ``We've still got some extra picks left from the
Jets and I've got my eye on some nifty press corners in the Big
East this year,'' said J.J., who plans to oversee his 17 cousins
and uncles in the Patriots war room on draft day.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There are now 49 retired Celtic numbers in the Old New Garden
rafters (it's rumored Cedric Maxwell might finally get the honor
this year), but still no championship banners in the last 114
years.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime coach Rick Pitino never won a championship in Boston,
but is still revered for leading the Celtics into the 21st century.
Pitino left a legacy of banks, books, and wellness centers in his
trail. And it was his regime that led to the installation of
polygraph machines at every coach's press conference. No one ever
will forget when he reinstated franchise icon Red Auerbach as club
president back in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner J.J. Gaston, also known as ``Thanks Great-Great
Granddad,'' said, ``We'd have won a couple dozen more flags if Len
Bias hadn't died. The league never compensated us for that pick and
they've been putting the screws to us ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Ho hum. Bruins fans continue to fill the Old New Garden,
settling for annual one-and-out playoff appearances. Owner J.J.
Jacobs, the latest in a long line of hot dog men from Buffalo, is
more concerned with beer cups than Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Thornton and Co. almost delivered a Stanley Cup to Boston
after the turn of the century, but the team dissolved in a hail of
arbitrations and holdouts. Harry Sinden made the agents cry and the
Bruins saw a window of opportunity slam shut.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same for the rest of the 21st century. The Black and
Gold made it to the Cup finals four times, but lost to teams with
higher payrolls. A recording of Rene Rancourt singing both anthems
still is played before every game.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it goes in Boston sports. Nothing ever changes.
Just when you think the Red Sox have reversed the Curse, they lose
to the Yankees again. Just when you think the Patriots have
achieved NFL respectability, they revert to the laughingstock days
of Billy Sullivan and Clive Rush.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? . . . I really think 2100 could be the year
for the Red Sox.

SEASON OF CHANGE BEGINS AT GAME'S END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The Patriots' future will begin at approximately 4
o'clock Sunday afternoon. That is when the season will end with the
team 7-9 or 8-8. It's when coaches cross their fingers and hope for
the best. It's when players who have suddenly become free agents
begin to say goodbye to teammates and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way it's always been after a year like this,'' said
offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese. ``If you don't win, there's a
chance changes will be made. I think those of us who have been in
the game for this long understand it. I think we all understand it.
I think in this situation, I've never seen so much professionalism
from a staff of coaches. We spent the week preparing for this game.
We prepared to win the game. Anything that happens afterward, we'll
deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Zampese's future is very much in doubt. If coach Pete Carroll is
fired, obviously Zampese and the other coaches probably will go
with him. Given the problems with the offense, if Carroll is not
gone, Zampese could be.
</P>
<P>
   At 63, Zampese said he has no intentions of retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'd definitely like to continue,'' said Zampese. ``You
never know what can happen in this game. There's always a lot of
rumors that fly around. Sometimes they're true. Sometimes they're
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Zampese has one more year left on his contract, and he said all
of the coaches have that cushion. Carroll has two years remaining
in what could be an escalating deal of five years at $5 million.
It's not known how much Carroll would pocket if he's fired or if
Robert Kraft left himself an out.
</P>
<P>
   As for the players, the ones fans would like to see return
include Troy Brown, Shawn Jefferson, Tedy Bruschi, and Steve
Israel, all unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this game, you step out of the helmet and pads and into
a three-piece suit and wing-tip shoes, and that's what I'm gonna
have to do,'' said Jefferson. ``There's a lot of factors. I want to
play for a winning team and these guys in this locker room are
winners. It's hard to get away from that. I look forward to being
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Brown, ``You never know what's going to happen. There are a
lot of guys who go and come in every year. When you see people who
go, it hurts you a little bit. There are always going to be guys
who leave. I'm anxious to see what's going to happen in free
agency. You'd like to be associated with winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety Lawyer Milloy said he will have fulfilled his contractual
obligation with this game, then he will consider the Patriots'
offer until March 1, when he can become a free agent. He reiterated
he will not play for the Patriots if a franchise label is put on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Israel would like to stay with the Patriots because he's
comfortable here, and he doesn't want to move his family. Bruschi
is on record as saying he's not looking to break the bank.
</P>
<P>
   A look at what's ahead:
</P>
<P>
   COACHES &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The coach with the most security is strength coach Johnny
Parker, who signed a seven-year deal when Bill Parcells left for
New York. Most of the other coaches have deals that pay them
through next season. Zampese would appear to be gone regardless of
what happens to Carroll. Steve Sidwell may be retained because of
his success with the defense, although, naturally, if the Patriots
hire a new coach with complete power, the entire staff may be wiped
out. It'll be interesting to see whether longtime Patriots
assistant Dante Scarnecchia survives another regime. Scarnecchia
has served under Ron Meyer, Raymond Berry, Dick MacPherson,
Parcells, and Carroll. Defensive line coach Ray Hamilton also has a
Patriots background and could be retained.
</P>
<P>
   QUARTERBACKS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing should change with the threesome of Bledsoe, John
Friesz, and Michael Bishop. Friesz has another year remaining on
his two-year deal, while Bishop will be in the second year of a
three-year deal. Look for the Patriots to renegotiate Bledsoe's
deal to make it more cap friendly and free up some serious cap
space. Bledsoe's cap number is $8.66 million for next season and he
conceivably could sign a deal that could reduce that number by $3
million-$4 million.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING BACKS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This isn't exactly a stable position. Terry Allen needs 130
yards Sunday to gain 1,000, which would kick in big incentives. The
Patriots would keep Allen if he remains a bargain, but if he's
making too much money because of rollover incentives it may not be
worth their while. Rookie Kevin Faulk, before breaking his right
ankle, proved only that he can return kicks and punts and that he
can catch the football. He did not show he could carry the ball
20-25 times a game. The Patriots are now trying to see if Harold
Shaw can be a back for them down the road, but it would appear they
will either draft another back or sign a free agent (Baltimore's
Priest Holmes?). Despite optimism that Robert Edwards may be able
to return, it's not something the Patriots can count on for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   WIDE RECEIVERS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When you have a drop-back passer who can't move, his receivers
must be able to get open. They must be of the highest quality.
Terry Glenn will be back. Despite the piling on while he's been
down, Glenn stayed healthy all season, and worked hard until he had
some personal issues. He's very competitive and is irked that
Marvin Harrison caught more balls than he did this year. The
Patriots have to make decisions on Brown and Jefferson. It does not
appear that both will be back, but one of them probably will be.
Second-year player Tony Simmons didn't step up. There's always
Vincent Brisby, who will make $1.5 million next season. Who knows
about Sean Morey?
</P>
<P>
   TIGHT ENDS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots would be insane to even think about getting rid of
Ben Coates. There's nobody else who can replace him at a very
difficult position. A new offensive coordinator may feature him
again. Rod Rutledge made strides and showed he might be able to
catch the ball adequately, but with zone blitzes getting more
sophisticated, a team must have two very good tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSIVE LINEMEN &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The most likely lineman to go is Zefross Moss, who will be in
the final year of his deal. He's due to earn $1 million, plus a
$100,00 roster bonus by March 1. The Patriots would have $450,000
of his signing bonus counted against the cap. Todd Rucci and Max
Lane would require too much of a salary cap hit to cut either
player. Both contracts run through 2002. It would cost the Patriots
about $1.7 million to part company with Rucci and about $1.9
million to part with Lane. That doesn't include some guaranteed
bonuses in both deals. The interesting one is Heath Irwin, who made
$429,000 in 1999. An unrestricted free agent, Irwin could get
decent money in the open market. It would appear the Patriots will
subtract at least one player, and perhaps two (Irwin), and add a
free agent at tackle or guard.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE LINEMEN &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It's not known how the defense will change, because it depends
on what the coaching staff will look like. If Sidwell remains,
there is a possibility the Patriots will move to a 3-4. Regardless,
the Patriots will seek a defensive lineman in the first or second
round knowing Henry Thomas is 36 years old and likely at the end of
his career and Chad Eaton needs some help in the middle. The
Patriots are trying to tie Chris Sullivan to a long-term deal that
is team-friendly. They also would like to do the same with Brandon
Mitchell and Ferric Collons. Willie McGinest is set at the end
position.
</P>
<P>
   LINEBACKERS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Signing Bruschi will be a priority. The Patriots like the way he
plays, the attitude he brings, and the reasonable money he'll be
looking for when he represents himself in negotiations. If he
returns, the Patriots have four pretty decent linebackers with Ted
Johnson and Andy Katzenmoyer together for at least three more years
and Chris Slade back for two more. There's a growing sentiment to
get Vernon Crawford more playing time.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE BACKS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Milloy is the top priority. Or is he? While the Patriots have
circled the wagons and made Milloy feel as if they'd sign him after
the season ended, the question is, should they let Milloy go and
re-sign their other unrestricted free agents? The recent pattern of
signing the big star and letting go the middle-range player hasn't
worked out in terms of depth. The Patriots already have a
cornerback making $50 million and they have another effective
corner, Israel, also up at the end of the year who won't come cheap
either. It seems the team wants to make a commitment to getting
Tebucky Jones on the field full time next season, but where? Could
Tony George handle Milloy's strong safety spot if Milloy leaves?
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TEAMS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing two kicks that could have landed the Patriots in
the playoffs, the Patriots won't change Adam Vinatieri as the
kicker and will go with punter Lee Johnson again.

FORTSON LOOKING TO REBOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM _ Motivation was never an issue. To keep focused on
rehabilitating a stress fracture in his right foot, Danny Fortson
did not have to leave his living room. A dose of NBA highlights on
``SportsCenter'' was enough to speed the healing process. When the
video clips featured a win by his former team, the Denver Nuggets,
it was tough to sit still.
</P>
<P>
   Fortson remained on the injured list for the Celtics' first
meeting with the Nuggets. Before the rematch last Thursday, he
could barely contain his excitement. He relished the opportunity to
play the third game of his season in Denver. The power forward
spoke more like the professional boxers he so admires when he
predicted a Boston victory.
</P>
<P>
   But most evident in Fortson's return to the Mile High City was
emotion. He prides himself on the energy he can bring to his new
team, hoping the Celtics will feed off his physical play. Denver
brought out Fortson's passion which lay dormant through 25 games of
inactivity and the first two games of his comeback. In the city he
used to call home, Fortson pushed himself for the first time since
returning to action. The game offered Fortson a true test of where
he stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a game like this with a lot of emotion so I could
push the limits,'' said Fortson. ``I needed a game like this to get
myself together because I haven't felt that type of emotion in
awhile. It was very important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to get better and better each game. I should.
I'm just staying positive. I love to play basketball. I hate to sit
and watch, but I understand the situation so I just have to wait
until my time comes and I'm able to play a certain amount of
minutes without getting tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortson checked in against the Nuggets in the second quarter,
leaping above the rim to grab a defensive rebound and then
extending the Celtics' lead with a leaning layup. Although known
more for his rebounding skills than his scoring, the power forward
led the Celtics with 6 points in the quarter to go with four
rebounds in seven minutes. He would go on to collect another basket
and two more boards. But it was his performance in the second
quarter, before a lack of conditioning started to show, that
provided a glimpse of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think per minute played, I think he's going to be one of the
best rebounders in the game,'' said coach Rick Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Fortson called the outing the best of his three-game
Boston career. He was not talking about statistics, although he had
just one rebound and no points against the Clippers and 9 points
and five rebounds playing the Kings. Before undergoing surgery for
the stress fracture in late October, Fortson led the Celtics with
11.5 rebounds in two preseason games. Still, the forward claimed
that against Denver he felt more comfortable on the court than he
has in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out and played hard,'' he said. ``I just feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7-inch rebounder hopes to improve by leaps and
bounds. In addition to getting into better shape and gaining a
better feel for the flow of the Celtics' games, he must continue to
familiarize himself with new plays. Two months of watching Boston
play and practice was helpful, but time on the sidelines did not
make Fortson's adjustment to his new team easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I got a little confused now and then with the plays,
but that's going to come,'' said Fortson after the 102-94 verdict
in Denver. ``I thought I did a pretty good job in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fortson will not shy away from hard work. Known for being
the last man off the practice court when he played for the Nuggets,
the injury made Fortson change his approach to practice, but did
not diminish his work ethic. He now prefers to arrive early to
workouts, rather than continue pounding his right foot after an
exhausting session under Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   Fortson called coming back from surgery ``the toughest thing I
ever had to do'' and the 8 pounds he lost during his rehabilitation
support his claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy road,'' said Fortson of his late start with
Boston, ``but you've got to play with the cards you've been
dealt.''

ROUGH ROUT ALSO A FUTURE BUILDING BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ At halftime of Boston College's debacle.com against the
University of Colorado Friday in the Insight.com Bowl, coach Tom
O'Brien told his players to forget about the score. Though the
Eagles trailed, 45-7, O'Brien admonished them not to look at the
scoreboard, not to look at the clock, and to keep playing football
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   That explained why, as he jogged off the field at Arizona
Stadium at game's end and made his way to BC's locker room, O'Brien
looked up and took one last peek at the scoreboard. It glared back
at him with the final score:
</P>
<P>
   Colorado 62, BC 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them we were just going to play and see what (the
score) was at the end of the game, so I was just checking it out,''
O'Brien admitted. ``I had looked up before, but consciously I made
the effort to look because I had no idea what the score was at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   And as much as he wanted to turn back the clock on New Year's
Eve and erase the 62 points and 523 yards of total offense Colorado
rolled up, O'Brien knew his team's first bowl appearance in five
years _ as flawed as it was _ in no way tarnished the overall
achievement of an 8-4 season. While he tried to get his players to
forget the score at halftime, he wanted them to remember what it
felt like, hoping to use it as a springboard for the underclassmen
who will return next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it to carry over, I do,'' O'Brien said. ``I want it to
carry over for the young kids who played in this football game. I
want them to understand that this is the level we've got to get to
(in order) to play here. We have to be a much better football team
than we were today.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only regret was that we didn't do a better job in these
last two games for these seniors who played so hard and had done so
well this year,'' added O'Brien of the 13 departing seniors,
including six on defense led by All-America tackle Chris Hovan.
``But we're still 8-4 and there aren't a ton of eight-win teams out
there. I don't know how many Boston College teams have beaten
Syracuse, West Virginia, and Notre Dame three games in a row. So we
still have got a lot of proud (accomplishments).''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the season, when BC was picked by the media to finish
fifth in the Big East, O'Brien said he thought the Eagles were
capable of going 6-5. Emboldened by the indefatigable spirit and
hard work of a senior class that had lived through the gambling
scandal of 1996, the Eagles exceeded O'Brien's expectations by
reeling off victories over the Orangemen (24-23), Mountaineers
(34-17), and Fighting Irish (31-29) for their sixth, seventh, and
eighth triumphs of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was, as O'Brien suggested, the first time a BC team had
recorded consecutive victories over those three opponents. In 1993
and 1994, BC beat Syracuse and Notre Dame only to be thwarted by
West Virginia. Next season, the Eagles will be hard pressed to
duplicate the feat.
</P>
<P>
   While the offense will return most of its key players, with the
notable exception of center Butch Palaza, right tackle Darnell
Alford, tight end Bryan Arndt, wideout Derrick Crittenden, and
running back Carlton Rowe, BC's defense will need to be
reconstructed after the losses of linemen Hovan, Mike Willetts, and
Adam Newman, linebacker Frank Chamberlin, and safeties Pedro Cirino
and George White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about the seniors on this football team and
what they've meant to this program and what they've been through,''
O'Brien said. ``It was probably one last time to impress upon the
young kids and point to the fact that guys like Willetts and
Crittenden and Chamberlin, they don't miss practice. They're out
there every day. They're tough, hard-nosed people, which is what we
need to have in this program. I just can't wait to start spring
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many losses on defense, quarterback Tim Hasselbeck _
who, like several of his teammates, played against Colorado feeling
under the weather with a 102-degree temperature _ knows BC's
offense will have to carry the team next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, because we lose some great players on defense,'' said
Hasselbeck, who will be surrounded by several promising returnees,
including running backs Cedric Washington and William Green,
receivers Dedrick Dewalt and Jamal Burke, tight end Robert Ellis,
and linemen Paul LaQuerre, Paul Zukauskas, and Michael Cook. ``We
know you're not going to replace those guys in one year. But it's
just like anything, people need to step up and make plays for us
like Cedric did when Mike Cloud left. That's what we need to count
on, and hopefully we can get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, almost all of the departing seniors seemed to agree
that _ despite so many losses in the front seven _ the Eagles would
be in good hands with the return of linebackers Scott Bradley and
Jerome Ledbetter, tackle Antonio Garay, and cornerbacks Jonathan
Ordway and RaMon Johnson. Doug Bessette and Ralph Parent, who
combined for BC's final touchdown as Bessette returned a Parent
blocked punt 9 yards, will likely step in as replacements for White
and Cirino at strong and free safety, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   On special teams, the Eagles lose four-year starting kicker John
Matich, but return Sandro Sciortino, who redshirted this season.
Punter Kevin McMyler, who emerged at the end of the season, is also
expected back along with return men Green, Dewalt, and DuJuan
Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good football team,'' O'Brien said of the Eagles.
``And, as I said to the team afterward, `If you want to be a great
football team, you have to get to this point.' Not that they're a
great football team now, but they might be in another year or so.
They're disappointed now, but when it all settles we've still got a
lot to be proud of, especially these seniors. The bar is set at
seven, and we'll see what the 2000 football team can do.''

VICK'S FUTURE IS WOW

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Who could know?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they had a hunch when he came out of high school, with lots
of schools chasing him. But he was still more a development for the
new millennium than something you could count on right away.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why his coach chose to redshirt him last year and let
him season from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Even when this season started, there was all that talk of
potential. ``We had a plan,'' said his offensive coordinator. ``But
I didn't know how he would play or how he would run. I knew he was
going to make a lot of big plays. I just hoped it would be for us.
I knew the potential was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why even he wasn't sure of what he could do or how
quick he could do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything surprised me,'' he said. ``The speed of the
players, winning games, all the attention. Getting here.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the Sugar Bowl. The time is Tuesday night in the Bowl
Championship Series title game when No. 1 Florida State will meet
No. 2 Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   And the player is Michael Vick, Tech's precocious redshirt
freshman quarterback who is a star so bright that Florida State
coach Bobby Bowden calls him the quarterback of the present and the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia Tech's single greatest threat is Vick,'' said Bowden,
who must find a way to stop Vick's running, passing, and
improvisation if he wants to complete his first unbeaten season and
win his second national championship. ``That's a starting place.
He's like Peter (Warrick) at wide receiver. When he escapes, it's
illegal. Against Florida, you saw Peter. We put him at quarterback
and Florida had the play stopped. I'm sure their coaches were
applauding. Then he reverses field and scores a touchdown. You
don't coach that. That's what Vick can do. Vick is very much the
same as Charlie Ward. He's as dangerous as Charlie. That's the
quarterback of the future. In a few years, Vicks will be running
around everyone's campus.''
</P>
<P>
   That Vick is running around the Tech campus surprised lots of
people, even Vick _ at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I idolized (former Syracuse QB) Donovan McNabb,'' said Vick,
who whittled his college choices to Syracuse and Tech. ``He was my
idol in high school. That's the only other school I really
considered.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vick, who came out of the talent-laden area of Newport News,
Va., didn't want to be compared to McNabb in the context of
replacing him. ``I wanted to make a name for myself on my own,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, that's all anyone knew _ his name. He redshirted last
season in a move planned by coach Frank Beamer, Vick, and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to take a year to get used to college,'' said Vick,
who was virtually handed the starting job during spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the season started, all Vick was to most people around
the country, and even on the Tech campus, was this kid with
potential who might be something special some time in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped after the first two games, I would have a feel for
where Michael was,'' said Ricky Bustle, Tech's offensive
coordinator. ``I had a plan for him. Then he misses 30 snaps in his
first game (because of a left leg contusion) and the whole second
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick reemerged in the third game against Clemson and hardly
looked like anything special. ``He made some poor decisions,'' said
Bustle. ``He tried to make things happen. He tried to force things
down the field and got picked off three times.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick figured the timeline in his head was right. On-the-job
training this season and maybe something good would happen next
year. The students at Tech didn't seem that excited, either.
``After the first two games, I could walk all over the place and no
one bothered me,'' he said. ``After the Syracuse game, I couldn't
walk around at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed of the change has astounded almost everyone. So has
Vick's skill and poise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without him, we're not here,'' says Tech running back Shyrone
Stith, Tech's leading rusher with 1,119 yards and 13 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   No one is arguing. It was Vick who brought the Hokies into
scoring range in four quick plays, including one highlight-film
26-yard run in a 22-20 last-second victory over West Virginia. It
was Vick who took apart Miami and Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I'll look at a play and say, `How did I do that?'
'' said Vick.
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing about Vick, who passed for 1,840 yards and 12
touchdowns and rushed for 585 yards and eight scores. He embraces
the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm doing is having fun,'' said Vick, who finished third
in the Heisman voting, matching the best finish of any freshman in
Heisman history. ``All of this is amazing. There's no way I
expected this to happen this year. I thought maybe it would be
three or four years down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of his youth. Freshmen don't compete for the
Heisman on an equal basis, and they don't lead their teams to the
national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Vick laughs, agrees, and says that might be true, but he's here
anyway. ``I'm not a type of player who gets flustered,'' he said.
``It takes a lot to get to me. I love pressure situations. I
haven't gone out and played like a freshman yet and hopefully I
won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's plan is obviously to make that happen. ``We're
going to do different things,'' said Seminoles defensive
coordinator Mickey Andrews. ``You've got to get him out of his
rhythm. If he ever gets his rhythm, he's a tough kid to keep under
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamer says the Seminoles can take their shots the way Miami
did, the way Syracuse did, the way BC did. ``He's got a great poise
about him, a great confidence level about him, and as a result he
has great leadership ability. He's not an ego guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now the package is still shiny and new. What happens
Tuesday night could change that.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could make Bowden's prophecy about the Quarterback of the
Future come true.

WISCONSIN BEATS STANFORD, 17-9  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEN GURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The 86th Rose Bowl was billed as a potential
offensive shootout, but it turned into a defensive battle decided
in large part by injuries and by the kicking game.
</P>
<P>
   And, ultimately, by Ron Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, the National Collegiate Athletic Association's career
rushing leader, gained 200 yards Saturday on 34 carries, set a Rose
Bowl career scoring record with a touchdown and captured the most
valuable player honor for the second consecutive year as Wisconsin
wore down and defeated outmanned but stubborn Stanford, 17-9, in
the lowest-scoring Rose Bowl in 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne ran for 154 yards in the second half. He finished his
career with 728 yards in bowl games and 6,397 in the regular season
_ a total of 7,125. He set up his 4-yard touchdown run with a
64-yard rumble up the middle on the second play of the third
quarter that put the Badgers ahead for good at 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal, inspired by the play of the injured stars Troy
Walters and Willie Howard, was victimized by a first-half ankle
injury to its long snapper, Jon Sande. Two errant snaps by his
replacement, Anthony Gabriel, resulted in a missed extra point and
a blocked field goal, the only turnover of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford led by 9-3 at halftime. But Wisconsin held the
Cardinal, the Pacific-10 champion, to minus-5 yards rushing over
all and was able to contain its big-play offense throughout the
second half. Stanford averaged 467 yards during the season, but was
held to 264 yards by Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers' redshirt freshman quarterback, Brooks Bollinger,
completed two critical passes to tight end John Sigmund late in the
game, leading to Bollinger's 1-yard touchdown sneak with 7 minutes
22 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (8-4) was making its first Rose Bowl appearance in 28
years and had a last-gasp chance to tie the score, but its drive
was snuffed out with 1:11 left when quarterback Todd Husak slipped
and fell with Ben Herbert bearing down on him on fourth-and-12 from
his 46-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin (10-2), which beat UCLA last year, became the first
Big Ten school to win consecutive Rose Bowl games (the conference
had a no-repeat rule from 1946-60). The Big Ten has won seven of
the last eight Rose Bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we found out we had a chance to make history, it became
one of the goals I addressed with the team,'' said Wisconsin Coach
Barry Alvarez, who had knee replacement surgery earlier this season
and manned the sidelines with a cane. ``There's nothing like doing
something no one else has done.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an equally historic game for Dayne, the Heisman Trophy
winner, who was held to 46 yards in the first half. Dayne had four
touchdowns last year, and his total of 30 points is a Rose Bowl
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a nice talk at halftime and everybody got motivated,''
said Dayne, who ran for 246 yards against UCLA in last year's Rose
Bowl. ``On the long run, I saw the hole and I just ran through it.
It really gave us momentum and we carried it on. It would have been
nice if we could have kept scoring so we wouldn't have had to bite
our nails to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford opened the game with a disregard for injury reports. It
started Walters, its all-American receiver, despite a dislocated
wrist; Howard, the mainstay defensive lineman, despite a torn knee
ligament; and center Mike McLaughlin despite a knee injury.
McLaughlin lasted only one play, but Walters and Howard were key
elements in a surprisingly effective game plan.
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, Wisconsin's offense averaged 35.6
points a game and Stanford averaged 37.2. So the two teams looked
as if they were impostors during a scoreless first quarter that had
punters Sean Tolpinrud of Stanford and Kevin Stemke of Wisconsin
vying for most valuable player honors.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal defense, ranked 110th in the nation, swarmed around
Dayne and sniffed out every rollout pass play by Bollinger,
limiting Wisconsin to 12 yards over the first 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't played since early November and we didn't have our
rhythm,'' Alvarez said. ``They had a very good scheme and they did
a great job with our tendencies, anticipating what we would call.''
</P>
<P>
   But late in the first quarter with Stanford backed up against
its goal line, Husak got breathing room when he hit Howard with a
play-action 28-yard completion. Kerry Carter scored Stanford's only
touchdown on a 1-yard run in the second quarter. &QL;

Vick flashes skills galore
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW ORLEANS _ Florida State coach Bobby Bowden says forget Y2K, V2K
should present more of a problem for the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   That's V2K as in Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bowden, the talents Vick will display when the
country's two top-rated teams meet Tuesday in the Sugar Bowl are
not just special, they are revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the quarterback of the future,'' Bowden said. ``In a few
years, Vicks will be running around everybody's campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he can do with the football is not something that can be
taught. There have always been guys who could run and there have
always been guys who can throw, but that complete package is not
very common. Especially when we're talking about not just a good
runner but a great one, and not just a good passer, but a very good
one with arm strength that ought to be outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so dangerous, we could know what play they are running,
defense it perfectly the way we want to, and he could do the
opposite of what the play calls for and make a big play. He is that
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   What is just as scary to Big East foes, who watched Vick claim
the league's Offensive Player of the Year honor, and other teams
around the country with national championship hopes over the next
few years, is that Vick is only a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   He has three more seasons to put his stamp on the game as Bowden
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great compliment coming from one of the greatest
coaches ever,'' Vick said. ``It makes me think he really sees
something in me and he thinks I'm going to be a great player.
Hopefully, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick has played quarterback since he began playing football at
age 7, but he had to be pushed into the position. His youth league
coach asked his team who wanted to play quarterback, and after a
few moments with no volunteers, a couple of teammates gave Vick a
shove in the back and a quarterback was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had something pretty special when he was redshirting
last year,'' Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Rickey Bustle
said. ``He was as natural a quarterback as I have seen during
workouts, but I had no idea he would step right in and get the job
done as well as he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Bustle is not the only one surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``If before the season you had told me I was going to be invited
to the Heisman Trophy presentation, I would have said, `Yeah right,
tell me anything,''' Vick said. ``When they told me I was going I
was walking around campus in shock all that day. There's no way I
thought I would have this kind of success this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The success Vicks speaks of is an 11-0 run through the regular
season and a No. 2 ranking, with the national championship in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Vick let it be known early this season what he had to offer,
rushing for three touchdowns, including a 54-yard run, in the
season opener against James Madison before leaving with an ankle
injury early in the second quarter. (He sat out the second game
with the same injury.)
</P>
<P>
   At times on the field, Vick looks smaller than his listed
measurements of 6-1, 212 pounds because of his uncanny ability to
make would-be tacklers miss. He scoots around like a puny return
man, but believe it, his chiseled frame carries the full 212-pound
load.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, his arm strength, which he said he honed while
throwing rocks and shells on the beach in his hometown of Newport
News, Va., is well above average. Toss in a quick release, quiet
leadership and poise under pressure, and you can see why Vick was
an Associated Press second team All-America selection.
</P>
<P>
   Vick led the country in pass efficiency, completing nearly 60
percent of his attempts with 12 touchdowns and only five
interceptions. He threw for 1,840 yards and averaged 20.4 yards per
completion for the Hokies' big-play offense.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech has 10 touchdowns this season that covered 50 or
more yards, and Vick's favorite target, Andre Davis, averages a
whopping 27.5 yards a catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the kind of arm that stretches a defense out,'' Florida
State defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews said. ``Their receivers
can't outrun his arm, no matter how fast they are.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Hokies do have a deadly vertical passing game, Vick is
even more dangerous on the option. He rushed for 585 yards this
season, averaged 5.4 yards a carry and scored eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to make plays any way I can, especially big
plays,'' said Vick, who was the first freshman invited to the
Heisman ceremony in 18 years. He finished third in the voting,
matching Herschel Walker's best-ever finish by a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Vick improved on as the season progressed was
accepting his mortality, realizing he couldn't make a spectacular
play every down.
</P>
<P>
   ``My decision making has gotten better,'' Vick said. ``In the
beginning of the season, I was out there trying to make a very big
play every play. Now I just let things happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you have two or three plays that don't gain any yards,
all you want to do is explode down the field, but I had to trust
that it would come and not try to force things.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick is not one to accept failure without quickly bouncing back,
and he can recall just one time being rattled in a football game _
when he opened the season and started his first varsity game as a
freshman in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were out there killing me and I couldn't do anything,''
Vick said. ``I was about 4-for-20 for 34 yards. It was a good
learning experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The next question was if that game made him doubt himself and
his ability.
</P>

   ORLANDO _ Just when the Florida football team finally found the
offense that had been missing much of this season, the Gators
discovered it wasn't enough to overcome a couple of players they
long ago lost along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Plaxico Burress, who desperately wanted to be a Gator, yet
couldn't gain admission, and Paul Edinger, who grew up in Gator
land, but saw a better opportunity elsewhere, led Michigan State to
a 37-34 win over Florida Saturday here in the Florida Citrus Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Burress, a junior likely to be heading to the NFL, caught 13
passes for 185 yards and three touchdowns. Edinger, a senior from
Lakeland, kicked three field goals, including the game-winner as
time ran out, as the Spartans won in the head coaching debut of
Bobby Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators' loss was their third straight, a first in the 10
years Steve Spurrier has been coach. It also ended a three-game
bowl winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the Gators rediscovered the pizzazz in their offense,
they ran into a team they couldn't slow down.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans made the most of their final possession of the game
to give Edinger the opportunity of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best feeling I've ever had in my life, beating the
Gators in my home place,'' said Edinger, who grew up about 50 miles
from the Citrus Bowl. ``You can't beat this. It's the best ever. I
just had to go out there and do a job, come back after a miss, and
I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Edinger missed a 45-yarder earlier in the fourth quarter after
hitting a pair of field goals in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   He was perfect on a 39-yard kick as time ran out to touch off a
wild celebration by Michigan State players.
</P>
<P>
   The kick, coupled with Burress' heroics, ruined a high-powered
performance by the Florida offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it is never good enough ... never good enough,''
shrugged Florida quarterback Doug Johnson, who ended his career by
completing 24 of 50 passes for 288 yards and three touchdown passes
to Travis Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the offensive outburst, the Gators lost their third game
in a row for the first time since 1988 and finished with their
worst record since going an identical 9-4 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost three in a row, we're 9-4. We're not going to be in
the top 10, we're not going to win 10 games this year,'' Spurrier
said. ``That's the way life is in 1999. I don't know what else to
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators finally got back to playing the type of football that
made the team one of the most exciting programs of the 1990s. That
turned into 367 yards of offense, but not enough to keep up with
the Spartans, who finished with 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players played their hearts out,'' Spurrier said. ``I
don't think there was any give up in us. They hit a few more plays
than we did. That's about what you can say when they won by three
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it was a game where both teams had chances to win
but they made a play or two more in the fourth quarter than we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting just six first downs against Alabama in the SEC
Championship game, the Gators racked up 27 against Michigan State
and had three scoring drives of 80 yards or more.
</P>
<P>
   They did it by using formations and plays that had been missing
much of the season as the Gator offense ground almost to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fun game to be a part of,'' Johnson said. ``We lost
but at least it wasn't a boring game. I had a lot of fun out there
today until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little more wide open this game than in the past. We
ran some trick plays, typical Florida offense. It was fun being
able to do that. At least we went out playing our kind of
football.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators also went out fighting. Florida offensive lineman
Kenyatta Walker and Michigan State defensive end Hubert Thompson
were ejected for fighting at the end of a play in which Johnson
connected with Taylor for their third TD.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing kickoff, Florida's Demetrius Lewis was ejected
for shoving a Michigan State player.
</P>
<P>
   Florida was also penalized 10 times for 100 yards, including a
pair of unsportsmanlike penalties. One was called on safety
Marquand Manual when he ran around taunting Michigan State players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what was going on,'' Spurrier said. ``I'm
disappointed in some of our players. We haven't had that kind of
ruckus all year. It's sad it had to happen, sad some of our guys
were dancing around out there acting foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They watched the NFL guys do this and it's perfectly legal in
the NFL. They think they can do it, and you can't do that in
college. We thought we had coached them better but at times we had
too much dancin' and prancin' out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, who trailed 17-7 before leading 34-26, got a
bowl-record-tying three TD catches by Taylor, who caught 11 passes
for 136 yards. They also got a 1-yard TD run by Johnson and a
2-yard run by Robert Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   The run by Gillespie gave the Gators the 34-26 lead with 13:27
left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans came back with a 30-yard scoring pass from Bill
Burke to Burress and a two-point conversion pass to Gari Scott to
tie the game at 34-34.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State then went 33 yards in six plays to give Edinger
his chance to be the hero. Edinger, who said a major reason he
chose Michigan State over Florida was because the Gators didn't put
a premium on field goals, drilled the one that broke a four-game
bowl losing streak for the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems something always happens to the Gators,'' Johnson said.
``It was a weird year.''
</P>
<P>
   It also ended Johnson's career, one that never lived up to
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually a quarterback is remembered by his wins,'' Johnson
said, his voice trailing off. ``I know I wasn't the most successful
quarterback here but I did the best I could.''

DEVILS TIE BRUINS, 2-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When he ended his streak without a goal in 12 games
just over two weeks ago, Patrik Elias of the Devils said that the
goals would start to come more frequently. They have indeed come at
a rate that even Elias failed to predict.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Bruins have been Elias' biggest victim. After scoring
the game-winner in overtime against the Bruins in New Jersey on
Wednesday night, Elias scored again Saturday night in a 2-2 tie
with the Bruins at the Fleet Center.
</P>
<P>
   Elias' goal put the Devils in the lead, but Jason Allison's
second goal of the night tied the game for the Bruins, who have
only two victories in their last 16 games (2-9-5). This was a
National Hockey League-high 13th overtime game for the Bruins, who
are 13-16-10-2 over all.
</P>
<P>
   Elias' goal was his eighth in the last 10 games after scoring
just twice in his first 18 games. After missing all of training
camp and the first nine games of the season as an unsigned
restricted free agent, Elias has combined with Jason Arnott and
Petr Sykora to bring the line back to where it was last season as
the Devils' most productive combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting a lot of chances and it was a matter of time
before they started going into the net,'' Elias said. ``Our line is
working really well right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias' play has helped the Devils (21-12-5-2) to their seventh
victory in the last 10 games (7-2-1).
</P>
<P>
   His goal came on a marvelous individual effort 10 minutes 3
seconds into the second period, and it gave the Devils a 2-1 lead.
He muscled his way through the left side behind Kyle McLaren of the
Bruins and found goalie Byron Dafoe's far corner with a backhand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't just nice, it was unbelievable,'' Bobby Holik said
of the goal by Elias. ``It was another highlight goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The way things have been going for the Bruins lately was
demonstrated just 22 seconds into the game. The Devils scored at
that point, the first time they entered Boston's zone, when Scott
Niedermayer stepped in front of Dafoe and deflected Holik's shot
from the left side for his fourth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer's goal discouraged the Bruins to such a degree that
they did not take their first shot at Martin Brodeur until the 8:06
mark of the first period. Once they took that first shot, however,
the Bruins took control of the game for the rest of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's domination was translated into Allison's eighth goal of
the season with 4:15 left in the third period. It was the first
game for Allison after missing three with a wrist injury. He got
his goal when he deflected McLaren's shot to the left of the
screened Brodeur.

<P>
   (PHOENIX0 - The 21st century has barely begun, but the signs of
what it portends for the Phoenix area are already evident:
</P>
<P>
   In a north-central Phoenix strip mall, a Russian market is
sandwiched between a Hispanic salon and a Vietnamese restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area has at least nine Spanish-language radio
stations, two Spanish-language television stations, and too many
Hispanic magazines, newspapers and newsletters to count.
Spanish-language billboards are springing up throughout Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In east Phoenix, a sprawling Chinese cultural center beckons
freeway drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of small or home-based businesses owned by
African-Americans is thought to have doubled in less than 10 years,
to as many as 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles edition of Korea Times has opened a branch
office in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County is second only to Los Angeles County for the
largest population of Indians in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Barring unforeseen changes in migration and birth trends,
Arizona minorities, led by Hispanics, are likely to become a
majority within 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the ethnic and racial composition of the Phoenix
area, under way for more than a decade, are transforming what was
once a mainly Anglo community into a place of many hues.
</P>
<P>
   The change has been speeded in recent years by a variety of
factors: the lure of steady job growth; an influx of foreign
refugees; the continuing urbanization of Native Americans; and
historically high fertility rates among Hispanic women.
</P>
<P>
   And the process will continue well into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the new economy, the changing demographics,
there's no question . . . our Valley will change, and it will
change dramatically,'' said Loui Olivas, assistant vice president
of academic affairs at Arizona State University and a professor in
the ASU College of Business.
</P>
<P>
   The change will be measured not simply in numbers, but by
cultural shifts affecting media, language, the arts and
institutions such as schools and government.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, one major engine driving these changes is rapid
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   John Cox, 44, an Irish computer consultant, moved to the Phoenix
from Spain 1 1/2 years ago because he saw in the region ``more
possibilities for growth and access to technologies in a shorter
time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Arizona growth patterns also are linked to the area's
unique demographic characteristics. The most visible growth during
the next few decades will take place in the Hispanic community,
which in the Phoenix area grew by roughly 60 percent in the past
decade. Roughly 1 million Hispanics live in Arizona, more than half
in Maricopa County.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of 1990 and 1995 census tract head counts shows
Hispanics posting gains in every corner of the Phoenix area. The
largest often occurred in neighborhoods ringing the metro area,
defying stereotypes about minority concentrations in the inner
city.
</P>
<P>
   This rapid growth is not surprising, given the region's Hispanic
roots and traditionally strong ties to Mexico. If anything,
officials believe, the size of the Hispanic community is
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rex, research manager at ASU's Center for Business Research,
said the census routinely undercounts Hispanics in the region. It
occurs in part because illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central
America, whose number is unknown, avoid contact with census
enumerators.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about 11 percent of Arizona's population is believed
to be foreign-born, ranking it eighth in the nation. The majority
are Mexicans, and they will keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign immigration tells only part of the story, however.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanic families have been in Arizona for generations.
Others were lured from elsewhere in the Southwest by jobs and
opportunity. The larger the community becomes, the more opportunity
it offers.
</P>
<P>
   It is also distinctive: The median age among Arizona Hispanics
is 23, and they are having more children than other racial or
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-fourths of Hispanic households in the state have
children, most ages 6 to 12, one study for the Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce says. In Maricopa County, which has the state's most
affluent Hispanic community, Hispanic households average more than
four people each, well above the state average of 2.6.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of births per 1,000 Hispanic women in
Arizona increased by 143.5 percent from 1983 to 1997, while births
among White non-Hispanic women dropped by about 16 percent over the
same span. In 1997, the birth rate for Arizona Hispanic women was
twice the rate of White non-Hispanic women.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors will propel the Hispanic community's growth for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at a community that is young and vibrant,''
Olivas said.
</P>
<P>
   Projections suggest Arizona's Hispanic population will grow by
93 percent through 2025, compared with 13 percent for the White,
non-Hispanic community. Although Rex cautions against predicting
demographic and migration trends too far into the future, the U.S.
census projects Hispanics alone will be a majority in Arizona by
2045.
</P>
<P>
   This year's first-graders, the graduating Class of 2011, is
expected to be the state's first in which a majority of high school
graduates will be Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It behooves us to make sure all the investments are made in
education,'' Olivas said.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic access to health care and medical insurance will be a
major issue ahead. Labor and pay-equity issues also will move to
the fore as minorities demand economic equality. Spanish-language
advertising and media will expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the constituency here matures, they'll elect more
(Hispanic) people to be council members and in the Legislature,''
predicted Pete Garcia, executive director of Chicanos Por La Causa.
``In the political spectrum, you'll see Hispanics on both sides of
the fence. You'll see many more individuals involved in business
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Hispanic community won't be alone in its emergence.
Phoenix's combination of jobs, weather and growth is attracting
people of all backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1998, the census estimates, the county's population
grew by nearly a third, to 2.7 million. More than half a million
newcomers were White. More than 200,000 were Hispanic, roughly
40,000 were Black, nearly 30,000 were Asian, and 12,000 were Native
American.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Phoenix African-American community is comparatively
small _ an estimated 117,000 Blacks lived in the Phoenix area in
1998 _ its economic clout is growing. That, in turn, is attracting
more African-American residents. One study placed Arizona among the
Top 10 states with the largest increases in Black buying power
during the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The metro area's Asian-American community is growing the fastest
_ by an estimated 75 percent in the past eight years _ but it, too,
is comparatively small, with fewer than 70,000 members in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Korean-American community here is the fastest-growing
among the Asian communities,'' said Michelle Kim, a businesswoman
who helped create the non-profit Korean Cultural Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   She estimates the Phoenix area Korean-American population has
tripled in the past dozen years, and she believes the trend will
continue as the community gains more visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That number started growing, beginning from when Los Angeles
had its riots,'' Kim said. ``After that, people started looking
around, trying to get out of California.''
</P>
<P>
   Tram Chu, another Phoenix area businesswoman, said the
Vietnamese community has blossomed nearly as quickly, mostly
through the efforts of church-based refugee relocation programs.
Vietnamese communities hosting mom-and-pop businesses have cropped
up in several parts of the Phoenix, and Chu anticipates the pace
will accelerate in the next decade. &QL;

Tough rebuilding job stokes fire in Rockets' Tomjanovich
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would have been easy. Very easy.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Tomjanovich had his championships. He was the next Dream
Team coach. His legacy was secure and Tomjanovich could have taken
his resume pretty much anywhere he pleased and landed a
high-profile job.
</P>
<P>
   So why is he still here?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there were a couple of veterans _ Hakeem Olajuwon and
Charles Barkley _ remaining, but they were past their primes, able
to dominate certain nights or even a stretch of games, but no
longer able to dominate the NBA as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets in the rebuilding process, why would
Tomjanovich stick around and subject himself to the inevitable
pressures and questions that come with such an endeavor when he
could just walk away with the satisfaction of the two rings from
the Rockets' 1994 and '95 NBA titles?
</P>
<P>
   Ask Tomjanovich the question, even casually, and he'll stare at
you with a genuine lack of comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a coach, that's what you do,'' said Tomjanovich, as
if every coach in the league would be sifting through the rubble of
the Rockets' 1999-2000 season, still panning for gold. ``It's
really, I guess, the fun part of this job. With eight new guys,
that's a heck of a lot of people to put in. What's exciting about
it is finding things that they can do on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nope, Tomjanovich isn't going anywhere, even though his barely
shaving Rockets carry a 10-20 record into the new year. And when
Tomjanovich speaks, he doesn't have the look of a fugitive who can
hear the bloodhounds on his trail. He means it, so any conjecture
about his future is little more than a tempest in a Rudy T-pot.
</P>
<P>
   And Tomjanovich says it in such a matter-of-fact manner that you
might believe every coach in the league thought the same way.
</P>
<P>
   They don't. You need look no further than the Los Angeles Lakers
or Chicago Bulls for the necessary proof.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite the end of the Lakers' world in 1990, but Pat
Riley could see it from there. After winning back-to-back titles in
1987 and '88, Riley's Lakers were swept by Detroit in the 1989
Finals and dismantled by Phoenix (4-1) in the 1990 Western
Conference semifinals. So Riley took a year off, working as a
broadcaster for NBC Sports, before jumping at the opportunity to
take over the talented, but underachieving, New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   And in Chicago, Phil Jackson was practically kicked out by Bulls
management, but Jackson had the door open and was halfway through
it anyway. After winning his sixth NBA championship in 1998,
Michael Jordan announced his retirement, and to team chairman Jerry
Reinsdorf and vice president Jerry Krause, that signaled
housecleaning time, including Jackson, who wasn't about to stick
around.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, like Riley before him, Jackson sat out a year and weighed
his options _ no doubt keeping a keen eye on the Los Angeles
Lakers, who went on to one of the biggest playoff fold jobs of all
time, getting swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the Western
Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Presto! Jackson had his opportunity, replacing Kurt Rambis as
coach of the talented, yet underachieving, team.
</P>
<P>
   See a pattern here?
</P>
<P>
   But Tomjanovich is from a different mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen myself as a (free-agent) coach,'' Tomjanovich,
51, said. ``I've been with Houston my whole career. I don't know if
I would ever go somewhere else. If I was forced to do it, I guess I
would, but that's not my intention, so I don't think that I have to
really prove myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very fortunate. After one full year (on the job), we
won the championship the next year. So I guess that erased some of
those doubts that I guess everybody else had, and I know I had,
things like, `Are these things we're talking about valid?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed in them. We got a group of guys to believe in them
and we hit the peak. So that kind of knocks all that doubt out so
there isn't this issue of self-worth as a coach that I would
probably be feeling right now just looking at the (current) record.
In some respects there was a lot more work to do in our
championship years than there is now. So I look at this as a case
where every day I'm going to go out and try to add something to
this team. And when you see some of those results, that's a great
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever judge how I'm doing my job by that win-loss
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston coach Rick Pitino, who rebuilt the Knicks from 24-win
losers to 52-win contenders in two seasons, and is in the process
of rebuilding the Boston Celtics, understands Tomjanovich's
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have what I call `destination' coaches and then there are
the `journey' coaches,'' Pitino said. ``Rudy, to me, is a journey
coach. What I mean by that is that personally, all I've taken over
in my life were rebuilding situations because I think the journey
is extremely difficult. It's about acquiring talent, building a
foundation of hustle, creating discipline, creating camaraderie,
and so many things have to (happen) for it to go well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along the way, when you build you're going to lose in the
beginning _ there's no way around that. But the best part about it
is that the ultimate destination is when you turn it around and get
to the championship level. Then you look back on all the struggles
and it's the greatest feeling in the world. It's euphoria at its
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you take over a talented team right away, immediately
you're on top and there never was a journey. You've arrived at the
stop. But it (rebuilding) is difficult, especially at the
professional level, because there is so much criticism while you're
building. And people who are conditioned to winning don't like
seeing the building process.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   Making the transition all the more difficult is that the Rockets
_ at least for now _ have no veterans to help ease the transition.
Game after game, Tomjanovich and his basketball operations staff
have had to go to war using rookies Steve Francis and Kenny Thomas,
second-year players Cuttino Mobley, Bryce Drew and Thomas Hamilton,
and relatively inexperienced veterans such as Carlos Rogers and
Kelvin Cato.
</P>
<P>
   But Tomjanovich, a guy who practically had to be pushed into
taking the job in 1992, couldn't be dragged away from the position
now, when he thinks the organization needs him the most. Besides,
this is when Tomjanovich loves his job the most, when the odds are
against him and when everyone seems to doubt he can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tomjanovich still feeds off the doubts surrounding the
Rockets' first title, when they turned ``Choke City'' into their
trademark ``Clutch City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of like the idea of being backed into a corner and
having to fight your way out,'' Tomjanovich said. ``You know, when
you're sort of down and all the doubters are giving you more
incentive to go out and do it.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a player, I waited for that article that had that
negative twist about it. That really used to fire me up _ `OK, so
that's what they think.' So now all I have to do is turn on a talk
show, but that's part of this business.''
</P>
<P>
   What's hard to figure about that, though, is the origin of such
an underdog complex. Tomjanovich was a top high school prospect out
of Hamtramck (Mich.) High (not nearly as highly sought as a kid
from Norwalk, Conn., named Calvin Murphy, though), and signed with
Michigan, then one of the top basketball schools in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He was a second-team All-American after his junior year, and
made first-team All-American as a senior after averaging 30.1
points and 15.7 rebounds for the Wolverines. Because of that,
Tomjanovich was a first-round NBA pick, going to the San Diego
Rockets as the second pick in the 1970 draft, and was named to five
All-Star teams over the course of his 11-year career.
</P>
<P>
   That resume says anything but ``underdog,'' so what gives?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you an example of when I felt like I got backed into
a corner,'' Tomjanovich said. ``After being drafted I drove cross
country, and when I got to San Diego the headlines read, `Rudy
Who?' The media coverage of basketball back then was nowhere near
what it is now. Michigan? Back then that was just that state that
looks like a mitten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people are like that (enjoy the underdog role).
Well, maybe I shouldn't say that. Some people get knocked down and
they just quit and say, `Hey, this isn't going to work.' But that's

Arkansas defense crunches Texas quarterbacks
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DALLAS _ In 107 years of football, the Texas Longhorns never have
had two rushing performances worse than the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   The total of six yards rushing in the Big 12 championship loss
to Nebraska was a school worst. But the minus-27 yards rushing in
the Cotton Bowl on Saturday quickly replaced that as the lowest
total for any game ever played by the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Eight sacks by the Razorbacks accounted for minus-64 yards in
what was another miserable game for the UT offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 11 games this season, the Texas offensive line
allowed 19 sacks. In the last three games, the men up front have
allowed 20 sacks, including seven against Nebraska and five against
Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why Texas lost
all three of those games.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the eight sacks allowed Saturday, the offensive line
also was whistled for four false starts. It's easy to see why Texas
did not score an offensive touchdown in the last 10 quarters of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's clear that we have to do a better job of running
the football,'' said Texas coach Mack Brown. ``In games where we
ran well, we were pretty good. When we didn't rush the ball well,
our quarterbacks haven't had time to throw the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas had four new starters on the offensive line this season,
so things should improve in the future. Two of the starters _
junior tackle Leonard Davis (6-6, 365 pounds) and sophomore guard
Antwan Kirk-Hughes (6-3, 320) _ were two of the most highly
recruited players in the state after their senior years in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Every man on the offensive line has looked bad at times in the
last three games, but part of the problem Saturday was an
exceptional effort by the Arkansas defensive line. The eight sacks
were a season high for the Razorbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the talk all week was how good the Texas defensive line
was and how much bigger they were than us,'' said Arkansas
defensive tackle D.J. Cooper, who was voted the game's Defensive
Most Valuable Player. ``We may be a little smaller, but than
doesn't mean we aren't good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper (6-3, 280) had five unassisted tackles, including two
sacks and one other tackle for a loss. It was a meaningful day for
the senior from Mesquite, who had been accused of wrongdoing
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   In a pending divorce complaint, a Dallas woman named Karey
Harrod claimed Cooper was paid for work he did not perform at J&AMP;H
Trucking Co., which is owned by her husband and father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all false allegations from a woman who is trying to get
back at that family,'' Cooper said. ``I remember she used to always
cause problems when I was working there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was cleared by Arkansas officials, who said all the money
he was paid came from work he performed. Cooper said he didn't let
the accusations affect his play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to let something like that cause me to lose my
focus, but it did motivate me,'' he said. ``If someone slanders
your name like that, you want to show they can't get to NO CARRIER

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Texas' off-season of discontent began when the final
gun sounded at Saturday's Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl, sealing a
27-6 loss to former Southwest Conference rival Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   While the 24th-ranked Razorbacks walked away from the
much-heralded reunion with their first bowl victory in 15 years and
a handful of Cotton Bowl records, the 14th-ranked Longhorns left
with less desirable souvenirs. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   A three-game losing streak to close the season for the first
time since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   A school record for fewest rushing yards in a game (minus-27).
</P>
<P>
   A stretch of 10 consecutive quarters without an offensive
touchdown.

   A sprained left knee for quarterback Major Applewhite, the Big
12's offensive player of the year, that will be re-examined Monday

</P>
<P>
   Factor in the public-relations black eye from four player
suspensions announced on the eve of the game and the recruiting
implications of losing to an aggressive raider of Texas-based
talent and it's easy to see why Texas coach Mack Brown summed up
Saturday as ``a bad day at the ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas players, who arrived in Dallas with designs on recording a
victory that could jump-start a national championship run in 2000,
spent crunch time pointing fingers at one another for missed
assignments as the Razorbacks outscored the Longhorns, 24-3, over
the final 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started laughing at them,'' said Arkansas defensive end
Sacha Lancaster, a San Antonio native. ``Frustration set in, and
they just didn't hold their poise and confidence like they should
have. They started bickering with each other ... and doing a lot of
finger-pointing (after missed blocks).
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't out of the game until that happened. But that was
like throwing gasoline on a fire. Everything just snowballed on
them, and we took advantage of everything they gave us.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who last saw his players score an offensive touchdown in
the second quarter of a 20-16 loss to Texas A&AMP;M on Nov. 26,
described his offense as ``inept.'' Texas averaged 2.9 yards per
play and, for the first time in school history, posted negative
rushing yards. The previous low had been 6, set during the team's
last outing, a 22-6 loss to Nebraska in the Big 12 title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can't run the ball, you can't protect the passer.
When you can't protect, you can't throw it or do a real good job at
anything,'' Brown said. ``Their defense was the biggest part of the
ball game. Their guys whipped our guys on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Longhorns remained within striking distance until a
12-minute stretch of the second half. Arkansas scored touchdowns on
drives of 97 and 86 yards. The drives were sandwiched around a
Texas drive for a field goal. The Longhorns (9-5) settled for three
points after losing 5 yards on three snaps following a
first-and-goal at the Arkansas 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum derived from those three drives allowed Arkansas to
turn a 3-3 deadlock into a 17-6 cakewalk. It began when Razorbacks
quarterback Clint Stoerner connected with Anthony Lucas for 47
yards on a third-and-12 play from the Arkansas 1-yard line.
Stoerner ended the drive by connecting on 4-of-4 passes for 99
yards, including a 30-yard strike to tailback Cedric Cobbs for the
game's first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   After the Razorbacks turned away Texas' best chance to score a
touchdown, Arkansas responded with a seven-play, 86-yard march that
ended with Michael Jenkins' 42-yard sprint to the end zone. Texas
never regrouped, running nine plays and losing 2 yards on its next
two possessions while watching Arkansas extend its lead to 27-6
with scoring drives of 37 and 38 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played harder than we did. They wanted it more than we
did,'' said Texas quarterback Chris Simms, who completed 9-of-18
passes for 91 yards in relief of Applewhite. ``Their engine was
running at 100 percent the whole game, and ours only went for about
21/2 quarters. That's something we need to work on next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Longhorns have eight months to tune their engine before
trying to break a 10-quarter touchdown drought. Arkansas, on the
other hand, will have eight months to reflect on a dream conclusion
to an up-and-down season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the way our team came together,'' said Arkansas coach
Houston Nutt, whose squad earned its first postseason victory since
the 1985 Holiday Bowl. ``Very few Arkansas teams have beaten Texas.
To beat Texas in the Cotton Bowl is something our team and fans
won't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, Texas fans won't forget, either. Their team will
be the one carrying the Cotton Bowl baggage throughout the
off-season. nn

It's evident Longhorns still have shortcomings
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Back in the dog days of August, nine victories, a
championship in the southern half of the Big 12, and an encore New
Year's Day invitation to Dallas might have sounded pretty cool to
the Texas Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Sight unseen, they would have taken such an autumn, no questions
asked. This season, after all, was supposed to have been one of
transition, a baby step backward before the big leap forward in
2000, the year the properly matured Horns would be ready to compete
seriously with the big boys for national glory.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, even after a stupid loss in the opener
against North Carolina State, expectations got badly out of sync
with reality. At 9-2, Texas found itself ranked seventh in the
country and being feted by the press at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Horns had begun to believe the stuff they were
reading.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, the harsh truth would be driven home. In
painful succession, Texas A&AMP;M, Nebraska and Arkansas showed that
Texas wasn't Y2K ready. The Longhorns were so full of millennium
bugs Saturday in the Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl Classic that
Bill Gates himself, or Orkin, couldn't have saved them from the
27-6 mauling.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ended a week from hell. At least nobody could blame the
four players _ record-setting receiver Kwame Cavil most conspicuous
among them _ who had been suspended for unspecified rules
violations late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto is `no excuses,''' UT coach Mack Brown said. ``We
had every opportunity to win the game today, but we didn't get the
job done. We won't talk about anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavil, who caught 100 passes in 1999 and routinely enhanced
quarterback Major Applewhite's rank, surely could have helped,
although he had never provided the Longhorns and Applewhite with
what they most needed vs. a pack of wild Hogs going Hog wild.
</P>
<P>
   Protection, both the proactive and reactive kind.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' most glaring shortcoming, again, was picking up the
blitz. Sixty-four of the Horns' 72 lost rushing yards were the
result of eight sacks, increasing their three-game sum to 20 _
compared with only 19 in the previous 11 games. Somebody somewhere
obviously figured out that UT's offensive line, for all its girth
and hype, presented as solid a front as would a thin slice of Swiss
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   However, when you can't run the football, you are probably not
going to pass it very well, either. And the Longhorns found scant
daylight with their churning feet. Hodges Mitchell's 13 carries
produced a mere 36 yards.
</P>
<P>
   UT's blocking, then, was a far greater shortcoming than its
tackling. If the Texas defense collapsed in the second half _ after
21 plays, Arkansas had 43 total yards _ it was because of
frustration and exhaustion. The Horns' offense ended the season
having failed to give their defenders a touchdown to work with over
the last 10 quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten quarters?'' freshman quarterback Chris Simms said. ``Yeah,
I guess that's right. That's not good. We've got a lot of work to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Thanksgiving, with UT riding a 5-0 run and averaging 37.6
points per game, sophomore quarterback Major Applewhite was already
on the short list of Heisman Trophy candidates for '00. But by
early afternoon here, after he had been Hogtied, both his
once-indomitable confidence and his left knee were badly hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The former has been fading for some time now, ever since
Applewhite heroically left sick bay against the Aggies and was
unable to muster a late rally. The latter gave out early in the
fourth quarter as he tried to elude another bull rush, forcing his
callous understudy Simms to deal on short notice with a
third-and-30 at his 16.
</P>
<P>
   As you may have guessed, the Hogs came a-callin' again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got crushed,'' Simms said.
</P>
<P>
   His three full series of action, which included, as promised by
Brown, one in the first half, did nothing to swing the pendulum
Simms' way. The blueblooded blue-chipper from New Jersey, whose
arrival in Austin gave Brown the mythical national recruiting
championship last spring, will report for spring drills as still
the No. 2 guy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Applewhite's once-entrenched status as the starter
now hinges on the extent of the damage to his knee and whether he
is able to pull himself back together mentally. Kansas State,
Nebraska and Arkansas _ only a middling 4-4 finisher in the
Southeastern Conference, each proved the 6-1, slightly built
Applewhite is easily blitzed into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Cornhuskers coach Frank Solich earned dummy-of-the-year honors
for needing a second encounter with him to figure this out, given
that before the first Texas-Nebraska meeting _ won by the Horns _
K-State had forced Major into a three-interception,
three-fumbles-lost outing that portended the doom to eventually
befall him.
</P>
<P>
   The Horns and their once-unflappable quarterback didn't simply
hit the wall at year's end. They vaporized themselves on it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was their relative youth or the length of the season
_ 14 games _ that finally threw them into reverse gear. Whatever
the reason for the 0-3 finish, it didn't exactly jump-start their
bid for a No. 1 ranking in what is really the final year of the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go into the offseason knowing we have to get better in a
lot of ways,'' sophomore cornerback Ahmad Brooks admitted. ``If we
can't, forget about the national championship. We won't even win

JACKSON WOULD RATHER PASS ON ALL-STAR OBLIGATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Come Feb. 13, at least one member of the Los
Angeles Lakers might be a reluctant All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson is leading the race for coach of the Western
Conference All-Star team, by virtue of the Lakers' best-in-the-West
record. But it's not an honor he covets, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dislike the whole venture,'' he said Saturday. ``I dislike
the concept. I like baseball's All-Star game that's an individual
sport, where you just go out and a guy hits against the pitcher. .
. . But basketball, I don't like it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the NBA All-Star game encourages ``all the wrong
things'' about the sport, ``and I don't need that kind of a
weekend, when you could take a break and get away from the game to
have to go and participate in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he'll have much choice in the matter, so long as the
25-5 Lakers maintain their lead over the rest of the conference.
They have a 2-game lead on the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, despite guiding the Chicago Bulls to six
championships in the 1990s, Jackson coached the Eastern Conference
All-Stars only twice, in '92 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``My coaches always said I lost games right at the end before
the All- Star game, so Pat Riley would have to go and coach the
All-Star game,'' Jackson said. ``I hate 'em. I absolutely abhor it.
. . .``
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy if we can go for the (Lakers assistant) coaches' sake,
there's always money involved in it, it's great for them, it's a
lot of fun for family.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Not a holiday: The Lakers held an abbreviated practice at
Southwest College on Saturday, their first in three days. Jackson
has made a tradition of holding New Year's Day practices (though he
wisely scheduled this one for 3 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were fine, under the situation, which I'm sure
they didn't get a whole lot of sleep and they were out late last
night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil's a smart guy. He just wanted to get the non-Gatorade
beverages sweated out of us,'' Shaquille O'Neal quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wanted to hold an instructional practice, but a cold gym
precluded it. Instead, he went heavy on conditioning and ran
players through scrimmages to keep them loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was running with their tongues hanging out of their
mouths, everybody was just kind of dead tired,'' said Kobe Bryant.
``But it was just fun being around one another. I think it builds a
little camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are taking today off but will practice Monday before
playing a pair of games against the Clippers, on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Worm watch: Jackson said he was unaware of a report in a New
York tabloid that former Bull Dennis Rodman would sign with the
Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't heard that. I hear he's on (Jay) Leno's show on
Monday, so we'll fnd out more about that I guess then.''

EDITORIAL: THAT ELUSIVE SURPLUS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Jan. 2:
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, American politics were defined by what David
Stockman, the Reagan-era budget director, memorably proclaimed to
be deficits as far as the eye could see. With the arrival of this
new year, the U.S. economy will shortly break the record set in the
1960s and achieve the longest boom in history. As a result,
political candidates are now debating how to spend surpluses rather
than how to reduce deficits. But the new game can be as tricky as
the old one. The true size of any surplus is debatable. Even its
existence is provisional, depending on yet unrealized spending
cuts. So far the presidential candidates are more interested in
talking about what a surplus might buy than in the painful choices
that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   All four major presidential candidates agree that $2 trillion of
a projected $3 trillion in budget surpluses should be used to pay
down the national debt or otherwise set aside for Social Security.
All of them also have ambitious schemes for the remaining $1
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore would use the money for health care,
education, military spending and other initiatives. Former Sen.
Bill Bradley would focus most of it on health. Gov. George W. Bush
would use most of the money for a tax cut and military spending,
and Sen. John McCain would spread it out for spending and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the candidates emphasize what Congress will have to
do to make these dollars materialize. These figures assume that
Congress and the president will agree to steep budget cuts in
domestic and military programs as envisioned in the Budget Act of
1997, with its notoriously tight caps on expenditures. In fact, the
caps from that law have been circumvented in each of the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   If current spending levels are not cut this year and are instead
allowed to rise at the rate of inflation, the 10-year surplus
shrinks to $250 billion, according to the Congressional Budget
Office. If Congress sets aside as much for ``emergency'' spending
as it has in the last two years, the projected 10-year surplus
would shrink to less than $50 billion. These numbers could improve
later this month, when new economic forecasts are due, but the hard
reality remains. Producing trillion-dollar surpluses will require
cuts in existing domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that discretionary domestic spending has been
shrinking. In theory, there ought to be room for the next president
to advocate some increased spending for anti-poverty programs,
schools, environmental improvement, law enforcement and other
areas, without provoking a political firestorm. But the costs of
federal retirement programs and health care are exploding. The
Congressional Budget Office projects that Social Security, Medicare
and Medicaid, now 45 percent of the federal budget, will grow to 65
percent by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   With the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary only a few
weeks away, voters must start demanding that all the presidential
candidates face up to these realities when they talk about using
the surplus for either tax reductions or new health plans. But
voters may turn out to be less interested in these subjects than in
the question of who can keep the economy cooking.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson from the Clinton years is that an expanding economy
can do more than any social program or tax cut to improve the lives
of Americans. An enduring lesson of the Reagan years, of course, is
that it really does take smoke and mirrors to produce tax cuts,
spending initiatives and a balanced budget at the same time.

FRED SAIGH, 94, KEPT BASEBALL'S CARDINALS IN ST. LOUIS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fred Saigh, a former owner of the St. Louis Cardinals who was
forced out of baseball in 1953 when he was sentenced to federal
prison for income-tax evasion but kept the team in St. Louis by
selling it to the locally based Anheuser-Busch brewery, died
Wednesday at a hospital in Chesterfield, Mo. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   A small, dapper man with an eye for big business deals, having
owned prime real estate in downtown St. Louis during the 1940s,
Saigh bridged two longtime Cardinal ownerships. Sam Breadon, who
sold the club to Saigh in November 1947, had been the team
president for 27 years. Anheuser-Busch, whose owner, August A.
Busch Jr., bought the franchise from Saigh in February 1953, would
run it for 43 years.
</P>
<P>
   When Saigh departed the ownership ranks three months before
heading to the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. _ the Mark
Harris baseball novel ``The Southpaw'' under his arm _ Saigh acted
to preserve National League baseball for St. Louis. Although he
said the $3.75-million bid he received from Anheuser-Busch was
lower than offers from interests in Milwaukee and Houston, he
accepted it to insure continuing local control.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Michael Saigh Jr. (pronounced sigh), a native of
Springfield, Ill., grew up in Kewanee, Ill., the son of a
grocery-chain owner. He attended Bradley University and
Northwestern, became a lawyer, moved to St. Louis and eventually
bought office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He purchased the Cardinals from Breadon for an estimated $4
million, taking control with Robert E. Hannegan, who resigned as
the U.S. postmaster general to join baseball. Two years later,
Saigh bought out Hannegan.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had won four pennants during the 1940s, but their
farm system, established by Branch Rickey two decades earlier, was
drying up when Saigh bought the team. He never had a pennant-winner
in his five seasons as owner, but he was generous with his players,
giving a dozen of them raises in midsummer 1949 as the team battled
for a pennant, only to be beaten out by the Brooklyn Dodgers. Saigh
freely expressed his opinions about his team, always remaining
optimistic, though he knew little about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Dyer, who managed the Cardinals in Saigh's first three
seasons as their owner, confided dryly to a sports columnist that
``in his very first year he has learned more baseball than John
McGraw ever knew in a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Saigh maneuvered, meanwhile, in baseball's ownership ranks, and
was a leader in the club owners' revolt that ousted commissioner
Happy Chandler in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1952, Saigh was indicted on federal charges of evading
$49,260 in income taxes between 1946 and 1949. He pleaded no
contest in January 1953 to two counts involving more than $19,000
in tax underpayments, was sentenced to 15 months in prison and then
sold the team in February under pressure from Commissioner Ford
Frick.
</P>
<P>
   Saigh was released from prison in November 1953 after serving
six months and soon began buying shares in Anheuser-Busch. He was
said to have become the largest single owner of the brewery's stock
outside the Busch family, at one point with holdings worth about
$60million.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a brother, William, and a sister, Rose Saigh,
both of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his large stock holdings, Saigh was long angry with
Anheuser-Busch over who deserved credit for keeping the team in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want the Cardinals to leave St. Louis,'' Saigh told
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1992. ``Anheuser-Busch's publicity
department turned it around that Mr. Busch was a savior. But it was
sort of a mutual thing. I was bitter and I was hurt _ still am.''
</P>
<P>
   He never attended a Cardinal game while the brewery owned the
club. But in 1996, the new owners, Bill DeWitt Jr., Drew Baur and
Fred Hanser, having bought the team from Anheuser-Busch, persuaded
Saigh to go to the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   More than four decades after he last saw the Cardinals, then
playing in Sportsman's Park, Saigh got a look at his old franchise
_ at Busch Stadium.

COPELAND MARKS, 78, AUTHOR O BOOKS ON EXOTIC CUISINE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Copeland H. Marks, the author of 16 cookbooks who
traveled the world in search of remote and exotic cuisines, died
last week in his apartment in Brooklyn Heights. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Marks had been in the Foreign Service and the import-export
business before getting a late start writing about food. He began
in 1981 with ``The Indonesian Kitchen'' (Atheneum). His last book
was ``The Exotic Kitchens of Peru'' (M. Evans &AMP; Co., 1999), and he
had recently been working on a book about the foods of the
Senegalese coast. In between, he explored the cooking of Sephardic
Jews and the Jewish community of Calcutta, offered recipes from
Guatemala and the Himalayan rim and brought home the cuisines of
Malaysia, Korea, Burma and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everybody else was busy writing safe books on pasta, he
was pursuing the exotic and the unusual,'' said Nach Waxman, owner
of Kitchen Arts and Letters, a culinary bookshop on the Upper East
Side.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland Harris Marks was born in Burlington, Vt., in 1921.
After getting a degree in agriculture from the University of
Vermont, he served in World War II, accompanying supplies over the
Burmese hump to Chiang Kai-shek's forces in central China, said
Lawrence Kunin, Marks' cousin. After the war, he joined the Foreign
Service but left after eight years to go into business, importing
and exporting textiles and works of art. He lived for stretches in
Mexico, Guatemala, India and South Africa, and developed his
passion for remote cuisines and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he settled in Brooklyn Heights and devoted himself to
writing, cooking and lecturing about cuisines he regarded as
unrecognized and underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Marks was never trained as a cook, historian or anthropologist,
but he was a quick study. Typically, he would select a region, then
spend anywhere from several weeks to several months there, cooking
with people in their houses. On returning to New York, he would
seek out people from the area he was studying and cook extensively
with them. It was a method that raised doubts among many food
professionals about the depth of his scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did stuff that nobody else did, and that made it
valuable,'' said Cara de Silva, a food writer. ``But when you go
someplace for a brief period of time and then you're writing about
it, it's necessarily going to be somewhat superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks himself was the first one to play down his credentials,
said Angela Schuster, a fellow of the Explorers' Club, a New York
organization devoted to preserving the spirit of exploration. Marks
was the chef-in-residence for a series of dinners exploring ancient
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Marks never married. Along with his cousin, he leaves two
sisters, Doris Becker and Charlotte Raboy, and a brother, Norman
Marks, all of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While Marks' eternal search for the exotic led him around the
world, he also hoped that one day it would lead him home, said
David Karp, a food writer. ``The joke was always that the next book
would be `The Jewish Cooking of Vermont,''' Karp said.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   &UR; ERRATA: An Examined Life &LR;  By George Steiner. Yale University,
$11.95. In this memoir, the scholar, author and literary critic
portrays himself as a polyglot polymath who has rarely received the
respect he deserves. ``Steiner worships smartness,'' Anthony
Gottlieb wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1998. ``The
book is primarily a tour of ideas, not of places or people.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TESSERACT &LR;  By Alex Garland. Riverhead, $13. The author's
follow-up to his hugely popular first novel, ``The Beach,'' is a
four-part narrative mosaic, set in the Philippines, that unfolds
through the points of view of many unrelated characters, including
a young, paranoid Englishman, a murderous gangster, his driver and
an innocent family stung hard by sudden disaster. All of them are
haunted by events they can't see coming that utterly change their
lives. Last year the reviewer Elizabeth Schmidt called this a
``complex, virtuosic'' book highlighted by ``cinematic, poetic,
terrifyingly precise'' passages.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCING NAKED IN THE MIND FIELD &LR;  By Kary Mullis. Vintage, $13.
The eccentric winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
chronicles his invention of ``DNA fingerprinting'' and his
unorthodox theories about the ozone layer, HIV, global warming and
other issues. ``This is a darkly joyous work, an autobiography of
the nervous system of an extraordinary chemist,'' Dick Teresi wrote
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; WHAT REMAINS TO BE DISCOVERED: Mapping the Secrets of the
Universe, the Origins of Life, and the Future of the Human Race &LR; ,
by John Maddox (Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15), the former
editor in chief of the British journal Nature reviews the major
scientific breakthroughs so far and sets forth an agenda for
mathematics, physics, climate research and other fields. ``Maddox
makes a persuasive case that science has far to go,'' Paul Raeburn
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE INTUITIONIST &LR;  By Colson Whitehead. Anchor, $11.95. In a
skewed parallel universe, two rival factions struggle for control
of the Department of Elevator Inspectors: the Empiricists and the
Intuitionists, who sense psychic vibrations rather than examine
machines. Last year the reviewer Gary Krist called this a ``starkly
original first novel'' and ``an ambitious, wide-ranging exploration
of racial struggle and the dynamics of social progress.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JOHANNES BRAHMS: A Biography &LR;  By Jan Swafford. Vintage, $18.
This meticulous portrait shows Brahms (1833-97) as the first (and
perhaps last) truly bourgeois composer and the first Western
composer to feel humbled by the achievements of those before him.
``Swafford retains the genre's requisite wonder ... tempered with a
skeptical imagination,'' Edward Rothstein wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SHADOW OF KILIMANJARO: On Foot Across East Africa &LR;  By Rick
Ridgeway. Owl/Holt, $14. A celebrated adventurer chronicles his
three-week, 300-mile trek from the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro
through Kenya to the Indian Ocean. ``Ridgeway is a graceful and
engaging companion, and East Africa ... teems with danger,
challenge and excitement,'' Bill Bryson wrote in 1998. In addition,
he ``deftly weaves compact and absorbing interludes'' about the
history of conservation, big-game hunting and colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SILENT THUNDER: In the Presence of Elephants &LR; , by Katy Payne
(Penguin, $13.95), describes a different kind of journey, that of a
scientist into the world of elephant communication. Her research
among the free-ranging herds of Africa awakened her to the animals'
rich lives and to the horrors of ``culling'' populations. ``Payne
offers the opportunity for a rare experience ... that will change
our view of ourselves, elephants and all living things,'' Roger
Fouts wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HUNGER: A Novella and Stories &LR;  By Lan Samantha Chang. Penguin,
$12.95. This graceful collection tracks the mixed fortunes of
Chinese-American families from Iowa to Brooklyn. The result is ``a
delicately calculated balance sheet of the losses and gains of
immigrants whose lives are stretched between two radically
different cultures,'' Claire Messud wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRIAGE &LR;  By Scott Anderson. Scribner, $12. This first novel
explores the unlikely bond between an American war-zone journalist
paralyzed by guilt and his girlfriend's grandfather, who worked for
Franco during the Spanish Civil War. ``It is a story of war, the
photographers who cover it and the people they leave behind,''
Christopher Dickey wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SILENT DUCHESS &LR;  By Dacia Maraini. Feminist Press/City
University of New York, $14.95. Set in 18th-century Sicily, this
novel revolves around an aristocrat's daughter who is rendered deaf
and mute by a childhood rape. The result is ``a story of grace and
endurance,'' Kathryn Harrison wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AN AMERICAN KILLING &LR;  By Mary-Ann Tirone Smith. Fawcett Crest,
$6.99. This thriller about a true-crime writer investigating the
death of a congressman with whom she was having an affair probes
the chilling neighborliness of modern evil. ``Smith paces herself
perfectly and takes the time to ferret beneath the surface of
character and incident,'' Ellen Feldman wrote in 1998.
