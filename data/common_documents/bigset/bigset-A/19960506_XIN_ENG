<HEADLINE> More UK Men Claim Sexual Discrimination in Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The battle of the sexes in Britain
has been reversed since more men than women are claiming sexual
discrimination in the search for jobs for the first time,
according to a report in the Sunday Times weekly.
</P>
<P>
Figures to be published by the Equal Opportunities Commission
(EOC) were quoted as showing that more than half the complaints
the commission received from job applicants last year were from
men.
</P>
<P>
A total of 820 alleged that potential employers had
discriminated against them as compared with 803 from women.
</P>
<P>
Employment experts explained that such a shift was caused by
the decline in traditional "male" jobs in manufacturing
industries.
</P>
<P>
EOC chairwoman Kamlesh Bahl said that this was a significant
departure as men were facing discrimination when they attempted to
move into jobs and professions traditionally held by women.
</P>
<P>
Men have faced increasing competition for jobs as more women
come out to work.
</P>
<P>
While male unemployment stands at 10.5 percent, women have
prospered, with only 4.3 percent unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Men also claim to have been excluded because male bosses
believe an attractive woman is more appealing to customers.
</P>
<P>
Some employment experts maintained that the EOC findings meant
that feminist thinking should be reappraised, meanwhile others
pointed out that women were still underpaid compared with men.

ISLAMABAD, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government today
started to send 17 tons of relief goods to Lebanon as a
humanitarian gesture towards Lebanese victims of the Israeli
aggression.
</P>

The first consignment of the relief goods, including medicines,

The Lebanese ambassador thanked the Pakistani government for
the generous assistance and expressed the hope that it would help
mitigate the sufferings of the Lebanese people.

issue of the Israeli aggression against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pakistani National Assembly today adopted a
resolution condemning the Israeli aggression on South Lebanon and
deplored failure of the international community to safeguard the
territorial integrity of a sovereign state of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the National Assembly "taking a
serious note of the killing of defenseless civilians of Lebanon
strongly condemns the barbaric" act of Israel.
</P>
<P>
While expressing solidarity with the people and government of
Lebanon, the resolution urged Islamic countries to promote the
cause of oppressed Muslims else where in the world.

BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Current pace-setter Dalian Wanda
clinched its fourth straight victory as it edged out Yanbian
Hyunda 2-1 at a fourth rounder of the 12-team Chinese soccer
league in Yanbian on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dalian, the 1994-1995 league champion, jumped to lead as Zhang

it home at the 23rd minute. 15 minutes later, Wang Tao put Dalian
2-0 ahead.

<P>
With five minutes remaining, Jin Guangzhu hit a consolation

</P>
<P>
Defending champions Shanghai Shenhua handed a 2-0 defeat to
visiting Shenzhen, a newcomer to the league.
</P>
<P>
Playing in the packed 30,000-seat Hongkou stadium, Shanghai
wore out their rivals with close-marking and constant running.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen goalie put up some brilliant saves to keep the
scoreline 0-0 at the first half.
</P>
<P>
At the 87th minute, Wu Bing put Shanghai into lead as he caught
up to kick home a deflecting ball.
</P>
<P>
With three minutes to go, Fan Zhiyi, the Chinese footballer of
1995, converted a penalty kick after a Shenzhen defender

</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Apollo humiliated its cross-town rival Songri 4-1 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Feng Feng opened the account for Apollo seven minutes into
action. Songri had a chance to tie the score as a player was
tripped down in Apollo's penalty box, but Apollo goalie Huang
Hongtao palmed the spot kick out after a dare-devil jump.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Songri's Yugolavian striker Vladan Radosvhevic,
who had played for Yugoslovia's top club Belgrade Red Stars,
headed it home for 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Apollo took lead again as Peng Changying found the net at the

Su Maozheng.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Guo'an, runner-up last season, routed Tianjin Samsung
4-0, while Sichuan Quanxing came from behind to hold the Chinese
Army to a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, which lost a total of eight goals in their two clashes
against Beijing last season, vowed before the match to break the
Guo'an jinx. But they failed to do so.

After a goalless first half, Gao Hongbo hit the first goal for

<HEADLINE> Blood Stocks Lack In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Blood Transfusion Services (BTS) of
Zimbabwe is meeting only 50 percent of its blood stock requirements,
BTS Information and Research Manager Rodwell Shamu said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the shortage was mostly experienced during school holidays
since 60 to 70 percent of blood donors were students.
</P>
<P>
''During the school term the situation improves due to the larger
contribution of school donors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Shamu said the current stocks were not enough to be used in
emergency cases.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the current blood stocks were better and
had increased by 30 percent compared to other years.

<HEADLINE> Asian Rocket Car World Record Attempt Plans Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- An ambitious plan was announced
here Sunday to bring for the first time ever the sport of drag
racing to Asia.
</P>
<P>
The adventure was planned by the Monte Carlo International
Motor Club Association, the Harley Davidson Owners Group (Hong
Kong) and the Harley Davidson Club of Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
And the key players of the attempt are the Rocket Car and Jet
Dragster, cars built with ultra-modern technologies, and someone
with an unbelievable courage.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers, they are negotiating with
officials in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, looking for a site big
enough to host the record-breaking attempt.
</P>
<P>
The Rocket Car, built in 1986 by the Research Bureau of the
(US) National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) in Los
Angeles. It is powered by the lunar Apollo type rocket, the same
engine which brought the Apollo 13 astronauts safely back to the
earth.
</P>
<P>
They will also be driving the F15 Jet Dragster and a Harley
Davidson Classic Motorbike Dragster.
</P>
<P>
The Jet Dragster is powered by the F15 US Air Force jet
engine. And Harley Davidson has been linked with drag racing since
their motorbikes became the most powerful ones in the world after
World War Two.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for a site for the attempts are going on well,
according to Sylvain Gozes, President of the Harley Davidson Club
of Monaco, who has been involved in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side has shown a lot of interests in staging such
an event," he said. "I hope we could make an official announcement
about the agreement sometime in June this year."
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai of South China's Guangdong Province had been targeted by
the organizers and an airport runway would be the most ideal site
for the attempt, Gonzes said.
</P>
<P>
American Bob Feeler and French Vincent Perrot, champions in the
sport, are to be the drivers in the attempts.
</P>
<P>
Feeler, 39, held French champion titles from 1984-86 and the
European titles from 1986-89. As world runner-up, he set in 1987
two world records - 328 kilometers per hour over 400 meters and
277 kilometers per hour over 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
He is the current world dragster champion in the 400 meters
category. He reached an unbelievable mark of 621 kilometers per
hour in 400 meters in 3.53 seconds while enduring great stress of
acceleration.
</P>
<P>
Perrot, 34, is well-known in France with his record breaking
conquests in the NASA-built rocket car. He is the current world
champion rocket car driver over 250 meters.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, he achieved an acceleration of 375 kilometers per hour
 in 2.6 seconds in France.
</P>
<P>
He will attempt to reach a speed of 400 kilometers per hour
over 250 meters in less than 3.5 seconds in the rocket car.
</P>
<P>
Saying this would be his last world record effort, Perrot has
set his mind on achieving this in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Japan's New Frontier Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) Jiang Zemin met Ozawa Ichiro, leader of
Japan's New Frontier Party (NFP) in Beijing today. The two talked
about building a more trusted sino-japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting at the Great Hall of the People, Jiang
welcomed Ichiro and the NFP friends on behalf of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"CPC is developing exchanges and cooperative ties with all
friendly parties in all countries, including Japan, and it pays
special attention to face-to-face talks and direct exchanges with
state and party leaders of other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ichiro's China visit soon after becoming NFP
leader indicates that NFP attaches importance to Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
"I fully appreciate this," added Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sino-Japanese relations in general have been
developing smoothly, which not only accords with the fundamental
interests of the Chinese and Japanese peoples, but also has
positive influences on peace, stability and development in Asia
and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
There are only a few years before the 21st century ends, he
noted. He stressed that the political leaders of the two
countries, with strategic foresight, should take a broad and
long-term view, learn from historical lessons, and face the
future, to steer bilateral relations in the right direction and
enable their neighborly and friendly ties to grow smoothly into
the next century. The two sides should enable their ties achieve
"long-term, stable and a healthy development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ichiro expressed thanks to CPC for its invitation and
hospitality.
</P>
<P>
"With the efforts of the older generation, Japanese-Chinese
relations have smoothly gone through a quarter century," he
said. "It is necessary to build and develop more trusted
Japanese-Chinese relations, which is also the desire of the
Japanese people."
</P>
<P>
He pledged to make the visit a juncture for furthering
understanding and trust between political figures and people of
the two countries and pushing forward their friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also exchanged views with the Japanese visitor over
issues in the Asia-Pacific region and on the world situation.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Li Shuzheng, head of the Liaison
Department of the CPC Central Committee and Yoshiyusu Sato,
Japanese ambassador to China.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- President of Cyprus Glafkos Clerides
arrived here today for talks with Greek President Kostis
Stephanopoulos and Prime Minister Kostas Simitis on the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Clerides said substantial amendments would
have to be made to existing conventions regarding alliances and
guarantees if progress was to be made on the island's security
issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an east Mediterranean island, has remained divided since
1974 when Turkey landed its troops in the northern part of the
country following an anti-Makarios coup engineered by the then
Greek junta.
</P>
<P>
He added that at this stage, the question of security was a
separate issue, and other issues, such as the constitution and
freedom of movement and settlement, would be considered when the
time came.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Athens, President Clerides is to be awarded
an honorary doctorate from Athens University Law School, as well
as the gold medal of honor from the municipality of Athens.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM on Success of Iraqi-UN Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz stressed here today that the chances of success for the
fourth round of Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food talks due to start Monday
depend on the non-interference of the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, Aziz said chances of
success of the fourth round talks depend on how ready the
U.N. Security Council is to keep away interference and to let the
Iraqi and U.N. delegations reach an acceptable agreement.
</P>
<P>
Aziz blamed the U.S. and Britain for their interference in the
third round of talks which has led to the failure of reaching an
agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The interference by the U.S. and Britain in the previous rounds
of talks has been strongly criticized inside the Security Council
and it is an illegal behavior that has wilful political aims and
runs contrary to the unanimous understanding by the Security
Council member states not to interference in the course of the
talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted that the U.S. and Britain will be held responsible
for the failure of the forthcoming talks if they continue their
interference during the talks. He said Iraq has shown balanced
seriousness and flexibility in handling the issue.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, he said, took part in the talks with the U.N. in
anticipation of putting para 22 of U.N. resolution 687 into
effect, which provides for a total lifting of the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Major Pledges to Win Back Disaffected Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
sought to reassure the Eurosceptics within his Conservative party
with a strong attack on the European Union over its worldwide ban
on Britain's beef exports.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Sunday Times weekly, the prime
minister said, "What has happened on beef has caused great offense
across the country."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that he would not allow Britain to be sucked into a
new version of the European exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) at a
summit of EU leaders in Florence, Italy, next month.
</P>
<P>
Major and his Conservative government suffered a disastrous
defeat in the local elections last week. His Tory party, betrayed
by voters from the middle class across England, a traditional
region of the Conservatives, lost 560 seats of the 1,092 they had
defended and the control of one of the just four councils they had
held.
</P>
<P>
In order to win back disaffected voters, the embattled prime
minister indicated an important change of his government's
strategy, when he admitted that his government has "taken economic
measures that have hurt."
</P>
<P>
"Many people have been hurt and they have punished us," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Major renewed his appeal for an end to the in-fighting within
his party and urged the party to work for a Tory general election
victory.
</P>
<P>
But Eurosceptics would shatter the hopes of a truce on Europe.
</P>
<P>
John Townend, chairman of the right-wing "92 Group" of the
Conservative members of parliament, urged Major today to take a
tougher stance on Europe.
</P>
<P>
In a TV interview, Townend said that he wanted Major to take a
retaliation action against the EU unless the EU dropped its ban on
Britain's beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Another staunch Conservative Eurosceptic, Teresa Gorman, said
that she would introduce a bill in parliament demanding a
referendum on Britain's relations with Europe.
</P>
<P>
John Redwood, former Welsh secretary and defeated leadership
challenger last June, argued that Britain should reintrude a
200-mile fishing exclusion zone unless the EU gave Britain a new
deal on fishing quotas.

<HEADLINE> Heseltine Dismisses Tory Disunity as Fatal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Premier Michael
Heseltine stressed today the success of the economy, not divisions
within his ruling Conservative party on Europe, would decide
whether the government wins the general election scheduled for
next May.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the BBC radio, Heseltine argued that party
disunity was an issue with the electorate, but not the main one.
</P>
<P>
He said all the political parties had a Eurosceptic wing, and
there was no suggestion that significant numbers of Tories opposed
government policy.
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier defended his government's position on
Europe, saying that it was in Britain's best interest to remain in
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
But Defense Secretary Michael Portillor expressed a different
opinion, saying that Eurosceptic Britain would vote Tory in the
next general election.
</P>
<P>
Portillor, seen as a backbone Eurosceptic in the cabinet, said
that the electorate's caution over Europe "bodes very well" for
the Conservative party, according to a BBC TV report.

<HEADLINE> Iran Endorses Capital Punishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran today endorsed capital
punishment on those who are involved in disclosing classified
information to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The evening paper Kayhan reported that the capital punishment
was approved at today's open session of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the death sentence will be given to those
who disclose classified information covering military, politics,
national security, economy, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
However, the report is too short to reveal any detail of the
new law.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the new law serves as a signal that
Tehran is taking tough measures to suppress any dangerous
elements inside the country in a bid to thwart spying activities
backed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Iran has already approved some tough punishments, including
execution, for those who spy for foreign countries, especially
the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to a bill passed last October, those charged with
spying for any foreign country will get up to 10-years'
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
On January 6, the Supreme Court sentenced three Iranians to
death on charges of spying for the United States.
</P>
<P>
The observers noted that the sentences have been the severest
punishment for those accused of espionage in the country in the
past decade.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Invest Heavily in Northern Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government announced today
plans to develop the country's northern regions by pouring a large
amount of money into that part of the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 223 billion drachmas (about 970 million U.S.
dollars) will be invested in public works and infrastructure
construction, including gas projects for power plant, submarine
electricity cable and hydroelectricity projects.
</P>
<P>
The plans, announced by Development Minister Vasso Papandreou
today in Xanthi, northern Greece, cover Eastern Macedonia and
Thrace, the relatively undeveloped areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Another major project is to make use of the Nestos River. The
project, consisting of three hydroelectric stations, is expected
to begin operation next spring when some 80,000 hectares of
agricultural land in the area will be irrigated.
</P>
<P>
With regard to tourism development, Papandreou said the
government intended to develop the ski resort at Falakro, Drama,
to complete the marina on the island of Thassos, to operate the
mineral baths at Kessani, and to exploit the cave at Maronia.

<HEADLINE> Faction Fighting Continues In Liberia Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Faction fighting for territories of
streets in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, continued today despite
talks of a truce ahead of a summit peace talk in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today from Monrovia, the
country's two rival warlords both denied earlier reports that
they had reached a new ceasefire to prepare for a new round of
peace talks to be held in Accra, capital of Ghana, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
''I don't know of any ceasefire that has been agreed to and the
transitional government has not spoken to anyone officially,''
said Charles Taylor, leader of the National Patriotic Front of
Liberia (NPFL) which is the largest faction in the country.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who is also member of the interim cabinet set up last
September following the signing of the Abuja peace accord, said
Wilton Sankawulo, chairman of the government, would represent him
at the Accra meeting.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources from Monrovia said earlier that Roosevelt
Johnson, leader of the Krahn faction which is NPFL's rival, had
agreed to a ceasefire, a new development that was welcomed by
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of the United States government, Taylor
changed his tough stance and said he would try all peaceful ways
so as to bring peace to the West African country torn apart by
six years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's men bombarded the Krahn base at Monrovia's main army
barracks occupied by John's soldiers, but the city was quieter
today and bridges from the city center to Bushroads came back to
the hands of Taylor's men.
</P>
<P>
''The government forces are trying to contain the situation
and as soon as that happens I'm sure there will be ceasefire in
the city,'' he said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the US government has sped up its pressure over
warring factions of the country, trying to pull leaders of the
factions together in the Accra talks.
</P>
<P>
The new round of battle occurred as the interim government
tried to arrest Johnson for murder charges. And a 10-day
ceasefire collapsed on Monday when Taylor led his men and
launched a new attack against the barracks of Johnson's men.
</P>
<P>
The Accra summit peace talks are expected to map out a new
time table for a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
And disarmament and military assembly camping of the rival
factional soldiers will also be rearranged before the general
elections are held as scheduled on August 20.

<HEADLINE> Peres Will Not Allow Jewish Settlers to Occupy More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said here today that he will not allow Jewish settlers to
take over more buildings in Hebron, according to an Israel Radio
report.
</P>
<P>
Peres, speaking during a heated debate on the redeployment of
the Israeli army in Hebron in today's cabinet meeting, said that
he would not permit the settlers to change the current status of
the West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers in Hebron said Saturday that they would occupy
ten additional buildings in the town's old Jewish neighborhood
and bring 100 more settlers into the town.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in reaction, the Peace Now movement, an Israeli
left wing organization, has called on the Israeli government to
block such attempt by the Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the peace group said Saturday that the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict will only be resolved and true peace
achieved with the evacuation of the Jewish settlers in Hebron,
not just with the redeployment of Israeli army in the town.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the last West Bank town to be handed over to the
Palestinian National Authority, in accordance with the Oslo peace
accords between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army had already completed its redeployments in
other major Palestinian towns of Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah,
Bethlehem, Kalikilya and Tulkarm in the West Bank by the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel postponed the withdrawal of its troops from
Hebron, which was scheduled to be concluded on May 28, on the
grounds of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
During today's cabinet meeting, Peres announced that within a
week, a discussion will be held by the cabinet or by the
Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs on the issue
of the redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported that the Israeli premier, after meeting
with top army and security officials last Friday, apparently
decided to further delay the redeployment in Hebron until after
Israel's May 29 national elections.
</P>
<P>
The decision has drawn sharp criticism from Palestinian
officials, who said that a further delay of the redeployment
clearly violates the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over the town from
the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 200,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts of
the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan of the redeployment, Israeli army is
expected to leave 85 percent of Hebron's municipal area, and then
to redeploy in the remaining 15 percent of the city.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes Europe Plays Active Role in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today that Egypt is "interested in an active European role in
the Middle East peace process," noting that Europe's role over the
past months has certainly been less effective than it should.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to newsmen reported by the Egyptian Middle East
News Agency, Moussa said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had
reviewed during his meeting with the visiting European Union (EU)
troika delegation the immense military support Israel was
obtaining, describing it as creating an unbalanced grave situation
that would undermine the credibility of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the postponement of Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian
West Bank town of Hebron and the prospects of European pressure
on Israel to pull out its troops from the town, Moussa said Egypt
had called upon the EU to play a more active role to effect a
balanced situation.
</P>
<P>
Such a balance will help entrench the peace process and create
an appropriate climate for the establishment of just and lasting
peace, he said, indicating that Egypt supports a more active
European role in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. role was extremely important, but,
generally speaking, there was unbalance in the Arab-Israeli
equation and in the arrangements for the future status of region.
</P>
<P>
Any lack of balance or alignment in favor of one party will
affect the stability in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to reports about new Israeli plans to confiscate
more Palestinian land in Jerusalem, Moussa said he "prefers to
consider such reports within the context of the upcoming Israeli
elections, but, should they go beyond that, the matter will then
be grave."

<P>
AMMAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A European troika delegation arrived
here today from Egypt for a two-day visit to Jordan to express the
European Union's (EU) support for the opening of the final phase
of the peace negotiations between Israel and the palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
The troika, headed by Italian Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli,
representing the current Italian presidency of the EU, includes
Irish Deputy Foreign Minister Gay Mitchell, representing the
future Irish presidency, and Spanish Secretary of State Emilio
Fernandez Castano, representing the previous Spanish presidency.
</P>
<P>
The visit is part of a Middle East tour which also took them
to Cairo and Beirut "to reaffirm the EU's commitment for the
peace process," according to a statement released recently by the
Italian Embassy in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The European troika is scheduled to meet with Jordan's Crown
Prince Hassan and Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
"The visit will have a strictly political character and is a
proof of the constant dialogue between Jordan and EU," a
spokesman for the Italian Embassy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Besides the revitalization of the peace process, on the
agenda of the high-level meetings scheduled here in Amman with
the Jordanian government there will also be the current
negotiations for the (Jordan-EU) partnership agreement," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to institutionalized cooperation in the economic,
political and security sectors, the partnership agreement is meant
to establish free trade between the EU and the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose, in this case, is to foster the dialogue between
Jordan and Europe in all fields -- political, economic, financial
and cultural -- and to increase interaction and integration,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The troika's visit came following April 27 cease-fire between
the Moslem guerrilla group Hezbollah (Party of God) and Israel
after 17 days of Israeli attacks against south Lebanon and last
week's Palestine National Council's decision to abrogate from its
charter articles calling for the destruction of the State of
Israel.

<P>
The PLO and Israel opened the final stage of their peace talks
at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba today.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) Sadako Ogata said today that the international community
faced the huge task of confidence-building in the Serb region of
Eastern Slavonia in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Ogata made the remarks in Vukovar after meeting with U.N.
Administrator in the region Jacques Klein at the headquarters of
the U.N. Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES)
in the town.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between Croatian officials and Serbs
in the region late last year, the region, bordering Yugoslavia and
dominated by the Serb population, was placed under a U.N.
transitional administration for one year which can be extended for
another year.
</P>
<P>
Ogata told reporters she had come to Vukovar to discuss the
prospect of joint cooperation between the UNHCR and the UNTAES. It
was the two U.N. bodies that should help refugees return home and
should "do all they could to enable the people who remained in the
region to feel well," the Tanjug news agency quoted the high
commissioner as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said she had also discussed projects for pilot
settlements to enable Croats to return home in Eastern Slavonia
and for providing similar facilities for Serbs who wanted to
return to Western Slavonia.
</P>
<P>
Serbs fled Western Slavonia massively after Croatian government
troops launched an offensive on the region in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President of the Serb region of Eastern Slavonia
Goran Hadzic said today the Serbs in this region had completely
stopped moving out of the area.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Radio Kragujevac in central Serbia, Hadzic
said the Serbs in this region had received guarantees from U.N.
Administrator Klein and from the Zagreb-based ambassadors of the
European Union and the United States, that they would be completely
safe.
</P>
<P>
"Their aim is to have Serbs remain in these areas and the
relations normalized not only regionally but also between the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia," Hadzic said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S'pore PM Visits Brunei to Strengthen Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong left today for Brunei on a three-day informal working visit
with an aim to reinforce relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is accompanied by Mrs. Goh, and his
delegation members include Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar, Minister
for Communications Mah Bow Tan and other senior government
officials, the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement issued
today.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Goh will have an audience with Sultan Haji
Hassanal Bolkiah and meet with Brunei ministers and senior
officials, it said, adding that the prime minister will also meet
with members of the Singapore community in Brunei.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers noted today that the prime minister's visit
comes hot on the heels of a trip by Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Tony Tan to Brunei last month.
Besides, Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng visited the country
in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times said in its report that ties between
Singapore and Brunei "are said to be very warm and friendly". Both
countries share similar views on a number of strategic issues and
regional developments, such as the progress of the ASEAN Free
Trade Area (AFTA), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Asia-Europe
Summit meetings, it observed.
</P>
<P>
The Lianhe Zaobao, the major Chinese newspaper published here,
said that during his visit there, Goh was expected to discuss with
Brunei leaders on the progress in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Economic ties between Singapore and Brunei have been developing
steadily in the past years. Singapore is now Brunei's second
largest trading partner. Bilateral trade grew 14.6 percent a year
between 1990 and 1995. Total trade amounted to about 1.7 billion
US dollars last year, marking a 53 percent increase over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Areas of economic cooperation between the two countries include
infrastructure development, oil processing, computerization and
communications projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two countries have been enjoying good
relations in military cooperation since the 1970s. The Singapore
armed forces have been using the military training facilities in
Brunei for training since 1976. And there have been regular joint
military exercises between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times report said that during Goh's current visit,
there will also be opportunities for Singapore officials to meet
with their Brunei counterparts to broaden the ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Goh and his party will return home Wednesday. During his trip
overseas, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will serve as
acting prime minister, the Prime Minister's Office statement said.

<HEADLINE> India's Auto Exports Record Negative Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Automobile exports from India
witnessed a fall of two percent during the fiscal year of 1995-96
compared with an impressive 50 percent growth achieved in 1994-95,
the Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest industry figures, total vehicle exports
came down to 174,674 units during 1995-96 compared with 178,066
units during 1994-95, registering a two percent fall.
</P>
<P>
This negative growth occurred despite the fact that the export
of passenger cars and motorcycles showed an impressive growth
during the year, Indian automobile industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the bad performance of the industry in
March, or the last month of the fiscal year 1995-96, resulted in
the negative growth.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the export of commercial vehicles fell 12 percent
in March this year compared with the same month last year. The
two wheeler segment witnessed a negative growth of five percent
while the three-wheeler segment also saw exports falling a
whooping 59 percent.

<P>
WELLINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the New Zealand
Ministry of Agriculture (MAF) have found 14 more Mediterranean
fruit flies in the country's largest city Auckland, reported Radio
NZ today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the flies pose a threat to NZ's 1.4
billion-dollar (950 million US dollars) horticulture industry.
</P>
<P>
The pest was first discovered last week, possibly brought in by
illegally imported fruits.
</P>
<P>
MAF staff said the six females found among the 14 flies were
not yet mature enough to breed and so there was no evidence yet of
an established population.
</P>
<P>
A 3 km-wide circle around the location where the pest has been
found is being sprayed with a poison bait.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  Kenyan Economic Reforms Well Paid (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economy recovered
impressively in 1995, scoring a 5.2 percent growth in
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and bringing the annual inflation
rate down to 6.6 percent, as against 45.6 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
This was due mainly to a broad range of economic reforms
undertaken by the Kenyan government in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Kenya first announced its implementation of the Structural
Adjustment Program, sponsored by the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank, in the mid 1980s, but drastic and effective
moves were taken only after mid 1993 when it fell into severe
economic straits.
</P>
<P>
Once, after independence in 1963, Kenya maintained political
stability and its economy performed fairly well, with agriculture
and tourism as its backbone.
</P>
<P>
Its growth in GDP averaged 6.5 percent over the early years of
independence from 1964 to 1971, and this was considered
exceptional for a developing country at that time.
</P>
<P>
Although its economy sometimes hit snags in the following two
decades, Kenya, on the whole, secured a comparative rapid
economic development among the sub-Saharan states.
</P>
<P>
A wind of a multi-party system blew through the continent in
the wake of a drastic change in the east European situation in
the late 1980s and the early 1990s, when some west countries
suspended financial aid to Kenya to force out a multi-partism.
</P>
<P>
A domestic turmoil followed, sending the country's economy
into a tailspin. Industrialists started hoarding foreign
currency, manufacturing output fell and inflation shot up from 30
percentage to about 100 percentage in three months in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth in that year plummeted to 0.2 percent from 5.2
percent in 1989. In agriculture, a crop failure left Kenya short
of 1.4 million tons of grain. The government had to make repeated
appeals to the world community for food assistance.
</P>
<P>
In the face of unparalleled difficulties, the Kenyan
government put into practice a broad range of reforms as of mid
1993, to check the economy from further falling down. The moves
include:
</P>
<P>
1. Liberalization of prices;
</P>
<P>
2. Removal of foreign currency control and of all trade
restrictions, except for a short list of a few products
controlled for health and security reasons;
</P>
<P>
3. Reduction of tariffs rates and of income taxes from foreign
companies with an aim to encourage foreign investment;
</P>
<P>
4. Privatization of state-owned enterprises and parastatals
which have recorded a unsatisfied performances; of over 200
companies listed for privatization, one-fifth have been
privatized and other 40 companies will be privatized before the
end of this year, and
</P>
<P>
5. Big cuts have been made in public spending and in the
number of civil service staff in order to ease the government's
financial burden. According to the Policy Framework Paper issued
by the government this year, a total of 33,000 civil staff have
been trimmed since July 1993 and another 16,000 positions will be
reduced from 1995/96 to 1996/97.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim today received visiting China's Jiangsu Provincial
Economic Delegation led by Chen Huanyou, secretary of the Jiangsu
Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Anwar said relations between Malaysia and

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  Kenya's Economic Reforms Well Paid (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The reform moves prove to be a
payoff. 1994 saw a remarkable pick-up in Kenay's economic growth,
export and tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
The year registered a real GDP growth of 3 percent from 0.2
percent in 1993. The figure jumped to 5.2 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth made an impressive contribution to average income
per head, which rose from 270 U.S. Dollars in 1993 to 300 U.S.
Dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the economic momentum has been experiencing a
gaining power from a record low in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The progress, however, is yet to be furthered to deal with
what local analysts say the problems facing Kenya's economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
The country remains substantially dependent on foreign donors'
aid, according to the analysts.
</P>
<P>
But future aid has become uncertain since financial aid to
Africa has been drastically reduced and it will be dependent on the
recipients satisfying a number of political and economic
conditions, including the progress in structural reforms and the
request for improvement in human rights record.
</P>
<P>
The over-growth of population has been another impediment to
the economic development in the country. Kenya, with a total
population of around 25 million, is going through an annual
population gowth of 3.4 percent, one of the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
It has been a pressing agenda for the government to create
jobs for about 0.5 million people entering the labor market each
year.
</P>
<P>
The number of the unemployed is currently confirmed at a level
of 2.5 million, with at least 10 million believed living in
poverty. The government says, in its Policy Framework Paper, that
it will put specific emphasis on the reduction of unemployment
and poverty in the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Feature:  Economic Revitalization In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Political stability and
sustained economic development in Uganda have brought about
thriving free markets, where various agricutural products and
daily necessities are accessible to consumers at fair prices.
</P>
<P>
Uganda saw a mushroom growth in the number of free markets in
recent years which has brought about great convenience to the
people's daily life and promoted economic prosperity in the
country.
</P>
<P>
At the Nakasero Market in central Kampala, every thing thrives
in a spectacular way, ranging from maize, rice, beans, sesame,
peanuts, hot pepper, beefsteaks, mutton lamb chops, to aquatic
products and daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Nakasero Market, which was built in 1927 with an occupation of
1,700 square metres, is one of the biggest free markets in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Imported fruits and vegetables from temperate countries
across the high seas and oceans are also ample in the market.
Apple, grape, dates, asparagus, almonds, Chinese cabbages and
cauliflowers are all here and fresh at about 630 stalls and shops
at the market.
</P>
<P>
Soseph Mugwanya, an official from the Nakasero Market
Management and Vendors Association Limited, told Xinhua that
about 300 live chicken, 3,000 kg of vegetables, 2,000 kg of rice
and 6,000 kg of fruits can be sold a day in the market.
</P>
<P>
To support more than 20 free markets in the capital, over 20
chicken farms, capable to produce 20,000 chicken a month, and
serveral piggeries have been established in the city.
</P>
<P>
Talking about importation of fruits, Mugwanya said Kenyan
dealers imported fruits from France, Israel and South Africa and
stored the fruits in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya from where
Ugandan dealers purchased them and bring them to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
One kilo of apple from France, known as "the golden delicious
yellow", is sell at 4,000 Uganda Shillings ( about four
U.S.Dollars), grapes from South Africa fetch 10,000 shilings per
kilo, while rice imported from Japan and India is sold at 2,000
shillings per kilo.
</P>
<P>
Suwedi Tebandeke, a Ugandan dealer engaging in fruits business
at the market, said: "Business is good. I can sell five or eight
kg of imported fruits a day at my stall." " Not only foreign
customers like my fruits, also indigenous Ugandans buy the fruits
every day," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the present government, led by President Yoweri
Museveni, took power in 1986, it has made great efforts in the
development of national economy, while attaching importance to
the maintenance of political stability in the country. Uganda has
made great achievements in economic development in the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is an agricultural country with 95 percent of its
exports coming from agriculture. The output of coffee, tea,
cotton and soybeans has been considerably increased in recent
years. Coffee remains the country's biggest foreign exchange
earner, its exports earned 290 million U.S. Dollars in 1995
against 273.7 million Dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Uganda began its sustained economic growth in 1988 when it
started its implementation of the economic recovery program.
During the period from 1988 to 1994, the country's economy had
been growing at an annual average of six percent. It went up to
10 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The economic development has led to the prosperity of markets.
The government has allocated 4.7 million U.S. Dollars for
erection of another three markets with a total occupation of
16,000 square metres.

<HEADLINE> African Economy Experiences Highest Annual Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) said today that the African economy
experienced its highest annual growth rate in 1995 since the
beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
In its "1996 report on the economic and social situation in
Africa", the ECA said the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the African
region grew by 2.3 percent in 1995, compared to the revised figures
of 2.1 percent for 1994 and 0.7 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It said, Africa's least developed countries (LDCS) also experienced
an improvement in income performance for the first time since 1992,
adding that the real GDP growth rate for the 33 African LDCS stood
at 2.4 percent in 1995, against -2.4 and -1.6 percent in 1993 and
1994, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The report said only three countries experienced negative growth
in 1995 compared to 14 in the previous year, while eight countries
exceeded six percent growth in 1995. 19 African countries registered
GDP growth rates between three percent and six percent while
23 countries recorded growth rates from zero to three percent, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that 27 African countries experienced GDP
growth rates in excess of population growth rates in 1995 and it
indicated that overall growth trends in africa are beginning to
gather momentum towards the recovery evident in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The report said, the growth in GDP was related mostly to the
good performance of the manufacturing sector and a modest rebound
in the mining sector. Growth rate of agriculture, the mainstay of
the African economy, recorded only 1.5 percent and food production in
sub-Saharan Africa as a whole fell by 1.4 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said there were improvements in Africa's trade
performance in 1995, adding that export earnings increased by 11.1
percent compared to 4.9 percent in 1994 while the value of imports
rose on the other hand by 12.8 percent compared to 7.3 percent in

<HEADLINE> International Jute Organization Faces Fund Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Dhaka-based International Jute
Organization (IJO) has faced serious fund constraints following
the recent withdrawal of the United States and Australia from the
IJO.
</P>
<P>
The IJO was set up in 1984 to mobilize collective global
support to promote the use of jute and jute goods. After the
United States and Australia withdrew from the organization, the
current 27 members include five jute exporting countries --
Bangladesh, China, India, Nepal and Thailand, 21 jute importing
countries and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The US and Australia were two major contributors to the
administrative budget of the IJO and Australia's decision this
year to leave was a major blow to the existence of the
organization, IJO sources said.
</P>
<P>
The continuing financial constraints have been preventing the
IJO from playing a more dynamic and effective role, the sources
said, adding that the situation has reached such a stage that the
projects may be stalled any time.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that most of the participants to the recent 24th
session of the International Jute Council, the highest
policy-making body of the IJO, expressed their utter frustration
over the past 12 years' performance of the IJO to the development
of the jute economy. Some of them even described the present IJO
management as "inefficient."
</P>
<P>
"Unless adequate fund is made available to this world body, its
normal activities may suffer and the existence of the organization
may be at stake," an IJO official said, adding that the IJO
secretariat has been making efforts to secure funds from some
other non-traditional sources.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Partition Would Lead to More Wars in Bosnia: Bildt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's ethnic partition must be
prevented if a costly series of Balkan wars is to be avoided in
the years to come, international mediator Carl Bildt said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the press here, Bildt said the ethic
partition in Bosnia would lead to endless wars in the region.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia's ethnic partition is "a recipe for long-term turmoil in
an important part of Europe and an important part of the world,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the partition would lead to new wars in Bosnia,
as well as between Croatia and Serbia and even in Serbia's Kosovo
region.
</P>
<P>
Bildt, the international community's High Representative to
Bosnia, blamed all the three factions involved in the war for
playing politics of ethic partition.
</P>
<P>
The international mediator is in charge of implementing the
civilian aspects of the Dayton peace accord which brought an end
to the 43-month war in Bosnia late last year.
</P>
<P>
The war broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 in what is the worst
conflict in Europe since the end of World War II.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Iraq to Resume Talks on POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 6 (Xinhua)-- Kuwaiti and Iraqi officials meet

of war allegedly detained in Iraq since the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
They will meet under the auspices of the Technical Committee

<HEADLINE> China's Integrated Circuit Industry Making Improvements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's IC industry has developed
production capacity of 560 million chips annually over the past
five years, making it a new IC manufacturing base in the world.
</P>
<P>
For a relative newcomer to the industry, China had a staggering
growth rate since the beginning of 1990s. Last year saw the
country's IC sales reaching three billion yuan, and profits of 473
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Telephone, switching, and CPU circuits are the biggest
moneymakers, according to Beijing-based "People's Posts and
Telecommunications Daily".
</P>
<P>
The production capacity of Sino-foreign joint ventures is in
the lead in the industry. In 1995, NEC Shougang, a Sino-Japanese
IC joint venture, and Motorola China turned out 914 million yuan
and 857 million yuan worth of goods, respectively, holding the top
two places in the country.
</P>
<P>
China's Huajing Micro-Electronics generated 571.5 million yuan
worth of output value, putting it in the third place. Meanwhile,
Sino-Belgian Shanghai Belling registered an output value of 428

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka to Develop Fishing Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is set to tap its fish
resources and develop the fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by rich fishing grounds, the island country's
coastal waters can bring in a catch of about 170,000 tons
annually.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the 13-year northeast ethnic war and agitation
by Buddhist clergy against inland fish breeding, Sri Lanka has to
import 80,000 tons of fish items valued at 4.6 million US dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
To overcome this situation, the government has taken measures
to develop the fishing industry, the inland fishing industry in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Under a five-year inland fishing development plan, the Ministry
of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has drawn up new strategies to
revamp the inland fishing industry with an output target of 50,000
tons annually up to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Another step to be taken is to provide infrastructure
facilities for large-scale breeding of tilapias, Chinese carp and
the popular Indian cuttle fish and cutlas.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has received a total of 27.4 million US dollars in
aid from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for its fishing industry
program from 1993 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of harbor anchorage and fish landing centers
is another area. This includes sand nourishment, dredging and
removal of sedimentation.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's efforts to modernize its fishing industry seek to
convert it from a hunting activity where fishermen are compelled
to explore the ocean for fish to a more meaningful industry where
fishing grounds have been previously identified.
</P>
<P>
A major breakthrough in the price and availability of fish has
to come mainly through the rapid development of the offshore and
deep-sea fisheries.
</P>
<P>
There are only about six ocean-going trawlers operating in Sri
Lanka. If properly organized, trawler fishing can be made very
profitable given the large unexploited fishing banks around the
island country.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Province Using Foreign Funds for Forestry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
introduced 550 million US dollars in foreign funds for eleven
forestry projects since the early 1990s, three of which have been
completed.
</P>
<P>
An official with the local forestry department said that
foreign funds are being used to build forestry research
institutes, plant trees, and monitor tree diseases and insects. A
poplar research and development project aided by the UNDP started
in 1990, and a 1,000-hectare poplar research center was built
after the project was completed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A UNDP-assisted tree disease and insect monitoring network is
scheduled to go into operation later this year, he said, that
"will bring Anhui's forest disease and insect monitoring technique
up to the standards of developed countries."
</P>
<P>
A project to plant trees along the Yangtze River in Anhui was
launched last March, to improve the ecology of the river.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year a Singaporean company decided to spend 120
million US dollars in building four fiber board factories in four
areas in Anhui, and negotiations are under way with Singaporean
companies for planting trees on 400,000 to 670,000 hectares and
building a pulp factory with annual production capacity of 600,000
tons.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Turkey's Government Trapped in Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A crisis of confidence has brought
the coalition government headed by Motherland Party (ANAP)
Chairman and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz into a difficult
position.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began on April 24 as 76 ANAP deputies voted in favor
of a Welfare Party (RP) motion urging a parliamentary inquiry into
alleged irregularities committed in the awarding of electricity
contracts when True Path Party (DYP) Chairwoman Tansu Ciller was
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
At present, Yilmaz is not only facing the DYP's threat of
withdrawing from the coalition government after the ANAP deputies
voted against Ciller on the Turkish Electricity Distribution
Company (TEDAS) issue, but also facing the difficult task of
taking economic austerity measures, a very hard step for a
minority government.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will vote on the second RP motion raised
against Ciller for her alleged corruption in the automotive
concern TOFAS on May 9. If the ANAP deputies again turn their back
on their coalition partner in the vote, the only two-month-old
coalition government will face danger.
</P>
<P>
The RP demands an investigation into the privatization of state
shares in TOFAS.
</P>
<P>
On many occasions, DYP deputies have shown their great anger at
ANAP deputies' vote for the TEDAS inquiry.
</P>
<P>
DYP ministers boycotted the first Cabinet meeting after the
parliament passed the RP motion and have refused to sign any
decree which requires the approval of the government.
</P>
<P>
Against Yilmaz's written instruction, DYP State Minister Yaman
Toruner decided to participate in the general assembly of the
Central Bank (CB), saying that he would not take any order from
Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz had asked ANAP State Minister Rustu Saracoglu to
represent the government at the CB assembly. The CB assembly has
been postponed until May 16.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, DYP Transportation Minister Omer Barutcu has
entered into an open conflict with State Airports Operations
Director General Onder Karaduman. Yilmaz has refused Barutcu's
demand for Karaduman's dismissal from his post.
</P>
<P>
Barutcu has canceled the bidding for the construction of a
foreign lines terminal for the Istanbul Ataturk Airport. As a
result, this 250-million U.S.-dollar tender has been annulled for
the third time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Ciller has openly stated that her DYP coalition partner has
been unable to achieve anything in its work for two months and
accused Yilmaz of merely wasting time during this period.
</P>
<P>
She also criticized Yilmaz's government for not taking strict
measures against the May Day violent incidents in Istanbul, which
left three people dead and scores of policemen and demonstrators
injured.
</P>
<P>
After the parliamentary passage of the RP motion on April 24,
Yilmaz only phoned Ciller last week, saying that the ANAP
deputies would continue to cast their votes as they wish on
parliamentary investigations.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz is expected to announce the economic austerity measures
at a press conference in Ankara today. The measures include the
taxation of state debenture bonds and quests for new financial
sources, which would draw criticism from businessmen and bankers.
</P>
<P>
Other measures such as increasing the retirement age and
raising insurance premiums are expected to be opposed by trade
unions.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israeli Army May Start Redeployment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The initial stage of the Israeli
army's redeployment in Hebron may take place next week, if the
Israeli and Palestinian officials finalize the details, Israel
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The first stage will involve a small scale of military
withdrawal from one of the Arab areas in the disputed West Bank
town, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli civil administrations reportedly have
already transferred most of their offices to the Har Manoa
military base outside Hebron, preparing for the long expected
withdrawal from the city.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that they are ready to hand over the
full civilian controls to the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) at short notice.
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, Jewish settlers apparently dropped their
idea of occupying more buildings in Hebron's old Jewish
neighborhood, after Prime Minister Shimon Peres said he would not
allow settlers to do so.
</P>
<P>
During a weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday in Jerusalem, Peres
said, "there will be no changes in the status quo in Hebron, and
I will not allow additions to buildings."
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers in Hebron said Saturday that they would
occupy ten additional buildings in the town's old Jewish
neighborhood, and bring 100 more settlers into the town.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the last West Bank town to be handed over to
the Palestinian National Authority, in accordance with the Oslo
peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army had already completed its redeployments in
other major Palestinian towns of Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah,
Bethlehem, Kalikilya and Tulkarm in the West Bank by the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel postponed the withdrawal of its troops from
Hebron, which was scheduled to be concluded on May 28, due
to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's cabinet meeting, Peres announced that within
a week, a discussion will be held by the cabinet or by
the Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs on the
issue of the redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment will be coordinated with the Palestinians,
Peres added, saying Foreign Ministry Director-General Uri Savir
and the army's OC Central Command Uzi Dayan would discuss
the situation in Hebron with the PNA officials.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported that the Israeli premier, after meeting
with top army and security officials last Friday, apparently
decided to further delay the redeployment in Hebron until after
Israel's May 29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
The decision has drawn sharp criticism from the Palestinian
officials, who claimed that a further delay of the redeployment
clearly violates the Oslo peace accords signed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Hebron Mayor Mustafa Al-Natsheh Saturday said that the
Palestinians are insisting on the Israeli troops' withdrawal,
adding the arrival of the Palestinian police will put an end of
violence in the city.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Moslems alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over the town from
the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 100,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts of
the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan of the redeployment, Israeli army is
expected to leave 85 percent of Hebron's municipal area, and
then to redeploy in the remaining 15 percent of the city.

<HEADLINE> No Conflict Over Party Leadership: Indian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha
Rao, who is also president of the ruling Congress party, has ruled
out the possibility of any power struggle in the party after the
general elections, the Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see the possibility of any succession struggle as
there is no conflict over the leadership," Rao told reporters
Sunday on board his special plane while flying back to New Delhi
after an election tour of the India-held Jammu.
</P>
<P>
Rao's clarification came in the wake of remarks by senior
Congress party leader and Industry Minister K. Karunakaran that
the posts of party president and prime minister would be separated
after the elections as the present arrangement had weakened the
Congress party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior Congress party leaders came to Rao's aid on
Sunday by expressing confidence in the leadership of the prime
minister and saying there was no need for a change.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, 11 cabinet ministers, chief ministers of
10 Congress party-ruled states and some other senior party leaders
said the Congress party was capable of sorting out "intra-party
issues within the respective and appropriate party fora without
any unsolicited and exgratia advice from outside."
</P>
<P>
"In its long history the Indian National Congress (official
name of the Congress party) had never deserted its leader and more
so at the time of crisis," the leader said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Karunakaran clarified that he was not opposed
to the leadership of Rao but only expressed the view that the same
person should not hold the office of the party president and prime
minister as Rao had done.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy To Brake Harder: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Budget cuts and high interest rates
would reduce Australia's economic growth rate to 2.5 percent in
the next fiscal year, though world economy showed signs of
accelerating, local economists said.
</P>
<P>
Access Economics, one of the most prestigious non-governmental
forecast house in the country, said in its latest five-year
projections that the economy was to slow down to an annual growth
rate of 2.5 percent in 1996-97, even lower than the down-revised
3.25 percent forecasted by the Federal Treasury.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition Government is to cut eight billion Australian
dollars (6.32 billion US dollars) from the Commonwealth government
spending in the next two years. The move is expected to have
contractional effect on the economy, because the government is a
major purchaser of goods and services in Australian market.
</P>
<P>
The planned budget cut is also expected to affect employment.
Trade unions warned that tens of thousands of government employees
would lose their jobs as the government streamlined public
functions and services.
</P>
<P>
Access Economics predicted that unemployment rate would rise to
nine percent next year from the present 8.5 percent.
Labor-intensive sectors such as public services and housing would
suffer most from the pain of job losses, while workers were
expected to shift to capital-intensive sectors such as mining and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Business confidence remained low compared with previous years,
largely because the 7.5 percent official interest rate had
discouraged business investment.
</P>
<P>
Though official figures showed that inflation rate and wage
growth rate dropped to 3.7 percent respectively in the past 12
months, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has ruled out an
interest rate cut in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Local economists expressed concern that the Australian economy
might already be in surplus after six consecutive years of
recovery from the 1990 recession.
</P>
<P>
Some feared that the contractional effect of the budget cut
would plunge the economy into a recession. But others said that a
tight budget was necessary to boost business confidence and reduce
long-term budget interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Access Economics also expected the economy to gather more speed
in 1997-98, as the housing industry revived and both the U.S. and
Japan enjoyed periods of stronger growth.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) showed that Australia's current account deficit
shrank in May due to improved conditions of trade. A booming world
economy is expected to ease domestic pressures on economy,
improving the country's competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Cameroon leaders To Meet Over Bakassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- An African solution to the land dispute
of the Bakassi Peninsula between Nigeria and Cameroon is underway
as leaders of the two West African countries are expected to
negotiate a way out.
</P>
<P>
According to a report carried today by Nigeria's local
newspaper "Third Eye", Nigerian head of state General Sani Abacha
and Cameroon President Paul Biya will meet during the forthcoming
four-nation Lake Chad Basin Commission summit slated for late May
this year.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which has suffered a fourth postponement since
February this year, has been rescheduled to enable the inclusion
of the Bakassi crisis at the instance of chad and niger who are
also member of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Souces from Nigeria's Foreign Ministry were quoted by the
report as saying that the governments of Nigeria and Cameroon
have decided to put the Bakassi dispute on top of the agenda of
the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Abacha and Biya will personally attend the meeting to manage a
truce between the two warring countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The summit is intended to find a solution to the thorough
issue of demarcating the Lake Chad Basin, its success depends to
a large extent on the resolution of the Nigeria-Cameroon
dispute," according to a government source who declined to be
named.
</P>
<P>
Another government official in Abuja said that with the latest
outbreak of violence in Bakassi, the two other members of the
Lake Chad Commission, Chad and Niger, have become uneasy and are
eager to join the ceasefire talks between Nigeria and Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
He said Niger and Chad would use the forum of the commission
to resolve the Bakassi issue to give a lee-way to an easy
agreement over the demarcation of the basin which is not being
administered by the four countries.
</P>
<P>
The renewed hostilities between Nigeria and Cameroon are
reported to have a devastating impact on the economies of
Niger and Chad.
</P>
<P>
Niger and Chad, both land-locked countries, depend heavily
on Nigeria and Cameroon for import and expoert.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Likud Party hardliner
has declared that a Likud-led government will not be able to
recognize the Oslo peace agreement signed with the PLO in 1993,
reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Ariel Sharon, Member of Knesset (parliament) and former defense
minister, was responding to statements made by Likud leader
Binyamin Netanyahu that the Oslo agreement has established facts
which have to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, known for his hawkish views in the Likud, was elected
to the third place during the Likud primary election, only after
Netanyahu and Yitzak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Election Committee (CEC) has approved
21 parties to participate in the May 29 elections. Nine of the
parties are veterans of the outgoing Knesset. The others are
either new parties or ones created by Members of Knesset who broke
away from their factions.
</P>
<P>
Election campaigns for various parties or party blocs have
already begun and will reach climax in the middle of the
month. Prime Minister Shimon Peres and his challenger Netanyahu
have agreed to engage in a television debate on May 26, three days

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Launch Tourist Promotion Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to launch a massive
international promotion campaign to revive the tourist industry
which has been affected by the ongoing ethnic war, Tourist Board
Sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Tourist Board is to spend 5 million
US dollars on this campaign which will be conducted by an
international public relations and communications firm.
</P>
<P>
The country's tourist industry had been particularly affected
after Tamil rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
recently attacked key installations in Colombo including the
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, tourist arrivals in the country
dropped 31 percent in February to 29,550 from 42,591 a year
earlier. This is mainly due to adverse publicity given by the
international media, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation has returned to normal and tourists are
absolutely safe in Colombo and other resort areas, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
To counter the adverse publicity, the Tourist Board is hosting
150 journalists from all over the world on a seven-day
familiarization and educational tour, so that they can see and
experience the normal life in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The country's political image, trade and commerce and
investments will also be projected, said the sources, adding that
the Tourist Board expects tourist traffic to return to normal
levels next year.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Environment Seminar Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on sustained development
and environmental issues, jointly sponsored by China and Japan,
was held here today in the newly completed China-Japan Friendship
Environment Protection Center.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 people, including Qu Geping, chairman of the
environmental protection committee under China's National People's
Congress, and former Japanese prime minister Noboru Takeshita,
attended the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Qu said that Sino-Japanese cooperation in sustained development
and environmental issues is an important link in efforts in the
Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world. Over the past
several years, he added, the two countries have had close
environmental cooperation in environment technology, management,
and policies.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that governments, enterprises, and
non-governmental bodies of the two countries will continue to
expand areas of cooperation, open new ways to cooperate, and give
active support to cooperation in funding and technology for local
government and industry so that the cooperation can reach a higher
stage.
</P>
<P>
Noboru Takeshita said that the cooperation on environmental
issues is not only a concern of the two countries but also
significant for the prosperity of Asia and the whole world. He
hoped that the two countries will continue their cooperation on
the environment.
</P>
<P>
Takeshita also attended a ceremony today for the fifth
anniversary of the inauguration of the China-Japan Youth Exchange
Center, a joint effort of the Chinese and Japanese
governments. Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress, attended.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Takeshita said that Japanese-Chinese relations
catering to future needs are conducive to peace and stability in
Asia and the world, and the responsibility for the development of
the two countries' relations lies with the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the center will develop into a center of
interpersonal and cultural exchanges in Asia and the world to
greet the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
Japanese-Chinese diplomatic relations next year.
</P>
<P>
The youth exchange center opened in May 1991 and has had nearly
one million visitors from Japan and other countries and regions.

KUWAIT CITY, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Javier Solana has called for
establishing ties of cooperation and dialogue between Europe and
the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
NATO will spare no efforts to improve relations between Europe
and Islamic and Arab states, Solana told the local Arabic-language
daily Al-Watan (Motherland) in an interview published today.
</P>

European nations to consider Islam a potential enemy, the paper
said.

<P>
The paper did not say where and when the interview was

<P>
Apparently in an effort to dispel a possible misunderstanding,
the NATO secretary general said it was possible that Claes'
remarks were misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that NATO was keen on establishing constructive
relations with Arab and Moslem nations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kaunda Launches Election Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Qiu Xiaoyi)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- President of Zambia's largest
opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) Keneeth
Kaunda launched his election campaign on Saturday by unveiling a
four-point manifesto.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of people at a public rally here, Kaunda,
the former state president, placed special emphasis on creating
a foundation for clean plural politics, building of a strong
economy that would create wealth and equal opportunities for all
the people and "not just leaders".
</P>
<P>
While accusing the present government of pursuing tribal
politics, Kaunda said UNIP would promote national unity through
the one Zambia, one nation concept.
</P>
<P>
On the economic sphere, the former president said his party
would continue the on-going privatization exercise, "but what we
want to do is to ensure that it is done in a clean manner".
</P>
<P>
His party would attach more importance to development of
agriculture and improvement of people's welfare at grass roots,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The former president also promised to bring about universal
primary education, quality health care, low inflation and more
jobs for the Zambian people once UNIP was voted into power.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here believed that the unveiling of
Kaunda's campaign manifesto has drawn open the curtain of
contention for the presidential and parliamentary elections
scheduled for October this year.
</P>
<P>
But the analysts held that there was little new in Kaunda's
manifesto except for his U-turn on the privatization and his
emphasis on welfare of the poor people at the grass roots.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kaunda was reported to threaten to nationalize the
privatized companies again when his party was in office.
</P>
<P>
The complaints by the poor people under the current hard
economic hardship might be employed by Kaunda as means to fight
the present government, some news analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda and his party, who ruled the nation for 27 years, were
defeated in the 1991 general elections. He was elected UNIP
president in June 1995, returning to active politics after his
three-year retirement.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Kaunda declared repeatedly his decision to contest
presidency in the 1996 general elections.
</P>
<P>
As chief of the largest opposition party and former republic
president, Kaunda is still a real rival to incumbent president
Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
However, recent constitutional developments in the country has
cast shadow on Kaunda's qualification to stand as presidential
candidate in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
One of the clauses of the draft constitution, which was
presented at parliament for debate on April 30, stipulates that
only a second generation Zambian is qualified for presidential
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Once the draft constitution adopted, Kaunda will be barred
from standing as presidential candidate because his parents are
Malawians.
</P>
<P>
Tension has emerged after Kaunda claimed that he was ready to
break the law should the government stop him from contesting this
year's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that only the Zambian people have power to
stop him from becoming the president of the country and not the
ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
The ruling MMD and the government have insisted that the
clause of the presidential qualification has expressed the common
view of the majority Zambians who believe that only an indigenous
Zambian should rule the nation.
</P>
<P>
Other opposition parties and some civic organizations appealed
to the government to postpone the adoption of the draft
constitution or to be approved by a broad based constituent
assembly so that some contorversial clauses can be deleted.
</P>
<P>
To ease the tension, an inter-party summit is expected to open
today to discuss some burning national issues.
</P>
<P>
All the Zambian people and well-wishers the world over have
expressed hope that the positive results will come out from the
inter-party summit so that Zambia can remain peace and stability
during the period of the general elections.

<HEADLINE> Australian Retail Trade Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian domestic demands are
still growing despite a slow-down in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Retail trade rose by 0.3 percent to 10.22 billion Australian
dollars (8.07 billion U.S. dollars) in March from 10.18 billion
Australian dollars (8.04 billion U.S. dollars) in February, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
In the March quarter, retail trade turnover rose to 25.9
billion Australian dollars (20.47 billion U.S. dollars), 1.4
percent higher than the previous quarter and 8.1 percent higher
than that of one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase followed a rise of 0.2 percent in
February, showing that domestic demands are still growing at a
healthy rate.
</P>
<P>
Local economic forecasting house Access Economics predicted
that Australian economy would slow down further to an annual
growth rate of 2.5 percent in 1996-97, compared with the Federal
Treasury's target of an annual rate of 3.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Today's ABS figures indicated that consumers' confidence was
still high as inflation rate began dropping.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Australian economy will resurge in 1997-98

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets Japan's New Frontier Party Leader in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, member of the Politburo
Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) and Chinese premier, met with Ichiro Ozawa, leader
of Japan's New Frontier Party (NFP), here today. They had a candid
and friendly conversation.
</P>
<P>
Li said that focusing on economic construction is China's
long-term policy and that we need a peaceful international
environment, especially one with neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the world becomes more polarized, long-term
friendly relations between China and Japan, close neighbors
separated by only a narrow strip of water, are in accordance with
their fundamental interests.
</P>
<P>
"Political leaders of the two countries should be practical and
forward-looking to carry healthy and friendly Sino-Japanese
relations into the next century," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that maintaining Sino-Japanese friendship calls
for continued efforts of young political figures in both countries.
</P>
<P>
"China is an important force for peace. China has not posed,
and will not pose a threat to any other country. China's
development will only benefit peace and stability in Asia and the
world at large," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa said that he was very glad to talk with President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Li Peng and that the talks were very helpful.
</P>
<P>
He said he was deeply impressed with China's
development. "China is a large country, its influence and role
should not be overlooked," he added.
</P>
<P>
Next year will be the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
Japanese-Chinese diplomatic relations, Ozawa said, adding that he
and the NFP are determined to continue efforts to push relations
to a new phase of development and to build future-oriented, solid
ties of mutual trusting.
</P>
<P>
The NFP delegation left here this afternoon to visit other
cities, such as Chongqing, Wuhan, and Shanghai in the company of
Li Shuzheng, head of the Liaison Department of the CPC Central
Committee.

<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Police will be able to enter private property and plant
bugging devices against targeted criminals under the legislation
to be introduced by the British government this fall.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Several of Eurotunnel's largest banks have strongly
criticized an outline refinancing programme for the operator of
the Channel tunnel and they are demanding a bigger share of the
the company's equity in return.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair, the Labor leader, is believed by his senior
colleagues to have softened his support for the idea of scrapping
child benefit for children over 16, in the face of growing
resistance to the idea in the shadow cabinet and a fierce backlash
among Labor MPs.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- A dramatic amateur videotape of the Israeli shelling of the
United Nations base at Qana, southern Lebanon, last month, in

the U.N. investigators that the Israelis deliberately targeted the
U.N. compound and were well aware that it was packed with refugees
when they fired at it.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor plans to abolish the government's controversial Job
Seeker's Allowance will be unveiled later this month, in a rare

<HEADLINE> Australian Job Vacancies Fall In April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Slower economic growth in Australia
had led to a decrease in the creation of new jobs, a survey
showed.
</P>
<P>
The ANZ job advertisements series, a widely cited indicator of
future movement in the labor market, dropped by 8.0 percent
seasonally adjusted in April from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The indicator was composed by the Calculation Job
Advertisements in major newspapers in all big cities. It lead the
official employment figure by six months.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the job advertisements indicated that unemployment
would rise to the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Access Economics, a local forecasting house, expected that
unemployment rate would rise above nine percent in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The rate of decrease in new job creation had been accelerating
in the past two months. The ANZ indicator fell by an monthly
average of 1.6 percent in trend terms in April and March, compared
with the 0.5 percent monthly fall in the last three months of
1995.
</P>
<P>
April's job vacancy figure was 14.8 percent lower than that of
one year ago, the steepest annual fall since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Economists warned that the Coalition Government's
8-billion-Australian-dollar (6.32-billion-U.S.-dollar) budget cut
in the next two years would further dampen the weakening economy
and push up unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) will release the
official employment figures for April on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Manufacturers Urged To Go to World Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today urged local manufacturers to look to the
world as a market instead of confining themselves to the small
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a three-hour dialogue with more than 700 private
sector representatives here today, Mahathir said local
manufacturers must emulate foreign companies which invest in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that in Malaysia, some big foreign
corporations that target the world market were taking full
advantages of Malaysia's incentives, low inflation and low labor
costs to manufacture and export their products.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian manufacturers, Mahathir said, were still eyeing the
local market and asking for protection and incentives from the
government.
</P>
<P>
He urged the local companies to cut down the use of labor by
using more automation in view of the existing labor shortage in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Malaysia is already one of the leading trade
nations in the world, he said local manufacturers must realize
that the domestic market would never be big enough.
</P>
<P>
The big number of foreign workers working in Malaysia, he said,
would create more social problems once these foreign workers
stayed here for a long period.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than one million foreign workers,
mainly from Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines, are legally
working in various fields in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"We have to reduce our dependence on labor and use more
automation and yet to maintain quality of our products," Mahathir
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Occupation Forces Shell Southern Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli occupation forces shelled at
noon today Iglim Al-Toffah, a ridge opposite to the
Israeli-occupied buffer zone in south Lebanon, security sources in
south said.
</P>
<P>
The ridge is often used by Lebanese Moslem guerrillas as a
springboard to launch attacks on the Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces in the buffer enclave fired artilleries at the
vicinities of the villages of Sejoud and Rihan, causing no
casualties, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli forces also strafed the basin of Litani
river with intensive machine gun fire, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Both the Israeli forces and Shiite Moslem guerrillas of the
Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, had refrained
from launching direct ground attacks against each other since the
two sides reached a cease-fire understanding on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The understanding put an end to 16 days of Israeli bombardments
and air strikes at southern Lebanese villages, where more than 160
civilians were killed and some 400 others wounded before the
cease-fire took effect on April 27.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Holds Talks with European Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said here today that his talks with a European Troika
delegation concentrated on the Middle East peace process and a
recent cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by Italian Foreign Minister Susanna
Agnelli, arrived here earlier today. It also includes Irish and
Spanish officials.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the one-hour talks in the Beirut Foreign
Ministry, Boueiz told a press conference that they discussed the
general situations related to the peace process and particular
situations related to results of recent Israeli agressions against
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz added that the talks dealt with the April
understanding, which put an end to 16 days of Israeli military
operation in south Lebanon last month, and the ways to set up
"special mechanism" to implement the understanding.
</P>
<P>
"In this respect, we informed Agnelli contents of the U.S. and
French proposals and we listened to the delegation Europe's view
points on this issue," the Lebanese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the discussions also dealt with cooperations
between Lebanon and Europe in all fields as a result of a
Euro-Mediterranean conference in Barcelona last year.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz described the role of Europe in Lebanon as "important
and effective," saying that the geographic approach and the
common interests between Europe and Lebanon justified this kind of
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli, on the other hand, said that consultations on the
formation of a five-state committee monitoring the cease-fire in
southern Lebanon were still under way, noting that the Lebanese
foreign minister would pay a visit to Damascus soon for this
purpose.
</P>
<P>
'"We will see what a role Europe can play in this
regard," said the Italian foreign minister, who is also the
current chairman of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Europe was always ready to offer help since
"it believes that the (European) Union has a useful role in the
peace process which we want it to be permanent and not limited
to a cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
Underlining a support for U.N. Security Council Resolution
425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon, Agnelli confirmed that the European Union has
asked Israel "for one thousand times" to implement that
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The proposed monitoring committee will include representatives
from the United States, France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon. It was
provided for by a cease-fire understanding reached on April 26,
which put an end to 16 days of continuous Israeli bombardments
and air-raids in southern Lebanon in which over 160 civilians
were killed and some 400 others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks in the Foreign Ministry, the European
delegation is scheduled to have a meeting with President Elias
Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik Al
Hariri, in the Presidential Palace.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Police Urges to Curb Internet's Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Tighter measures should be taken to
curb the expansion of the "double-edged" Internet, a Vietnamese
police newspaper said here today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest edition, the weekly "People's Public Security"
said it was a good development that Vietnam is connected with the
global network of the Internet. But the paper warned that while
the Internet has the advantage of handling information, it has
also brought along negative influences, especially in the cultural
and social fields.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has a lot of merits, but its harm should not be
underestimated," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It called on the authorities in the cultural, social,
political, ideological and national security fields to work out
strict rules to control the expansion of the Internet in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Internet has been connected with 150 countries
across the world, with 30 million personal computers having access
to it.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Negotiations Resume in Taba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations
for a final settlement resumed this morning at the Egyptian Red
Sea resort of Taba.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held a second working session co-chaired by
Mahmoud Abbas, the chief Palestinian negotiator, and his Israeli
counterpart Uri Savir.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were expected to determine, during today's
session, how the key issues should be negotiated, whether by
forming subcommittees each of which is to work on one particular
issue, or by getting all issues tackled by one committee.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were also expected to set a date for the next
resumption of their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The final stage of the Palestinian-Israeli talks, which began
in Taba Sunday, would deal with the future of Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements in Palestinian self-rule
areas, delineating borders and sharing water.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators would also discuss a number
of outstanding "interim stage" issues, namely the withdrawal of
Israeli troops from the West Bank town of Hebron, the release of
Palestinian detainees and the passage between the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Before the start of today's session, Savir told reporters that
the two sides would examine ways of making progress in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We have a long period, three years, to come to an agreement on
the issues offered for consideration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following Sunday's session, Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen,
said that the Palestinian side does not want the final-stage
negotiations to be suspended until after the coming Israeli
general elections scheduled for May 29.
</P>
<P>
But he affirmed that the negotiations would go faster after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Savir told reporters Sunday that there was still a wide gap
between the two sides over the issue of Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Ex-President Accused of Suppressing Civil Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution said
today that former President Chun Doo-hwan "ordered the military
suppression of civil uprising" in Kwangju in 1980 when he was the
defense security commander, but Chun denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution made the accusation at the seventh trial
session on mutiny and treason charges, which involved Chun, his
successor Roh Tae-woo and some of Chun's fellow generals and
colonels, at the Seoul District Court here.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial at the court today were Chun, Roh and Chun's
nine close aides, including Hwang Young-shi, former first army
corps commander.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution told the court it found that at the army
general luncheon on May 18, 1980, Chun practically ordered the
bloody suppression, by saying that "since the Kwangju
demonstration is creating a very dangerous situation, the military
must put down it with early hard-line suppression."
</P>
<P>
Chun was at the luncheon meeting along with senior generals
including Lee Hui-sung, then martial law commander, Chung Ho-yong,
then special warfare commander, and Hwang Young-shi, the
prosecution said.
</P>
<P>
However, Chun denied the accusation, saying that "it is true
that we had a luncheon meeting on May 18, 1980, but we never
discussed ways to suppress the Kwangju demonstration."
</P>
<P>
About 200 people were killed in the military crackdown on the
student demonstration in the southwestern city of Kwangju.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers including Chun
and Roh have been indicted for mutiny and treason. The mutiny and
treason charges respectively stem from their roles in the military
revolt on December 12, 1979 and in the bloody crackdown of the
Kwangju demonstration on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who led a military coup in December 1979, was an army
strongman in 1980 until he took the presidency in August that
year. He was succeeded in February 1988 by Roh, who stepped down
in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the mutiny and treason charges, the two
ex-presidents, who were arrested last year, also faced charges of
corruption for amassing hundreds of millions of dollars while in
office.
</P>
<P>
Both Chun and Roh have already stood trial three times each
respectively on the graft charges.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces New 5-Year Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today announced the seventh Five-Year National
Development Plan that will lead the country into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which entails 162 billion Malaysian ringgit (about
64.8 billion US dollars) for Malaysia's economic development from
1996 to 2000, sets the country's annual economic growth at a
sustained rate of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
It focuses on further improving the quality of life by
providing better health, education and housing services for the
population, which is estimated to rise to 23 million by the year
2000 from the present 20 million.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to parliament, Mahathir stressed that health is
crucial in improving the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged major changes aimed at better education and
housing for low and lower-middle income groups in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the government would put more emphasis
on productivity and quality by offering massive training programs
on skills and entrepreneurship with a faster shift to higher
value-added, labor-saving and capital- and technology-intensive
industries.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir cautioned the nation against taking the seventh plan
as an easy task, noting that many countries planned their
economies but not many of them could achieve the desired results.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Pre-election Unease Hits Kampala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Gao Shixing)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- As the presidential elections draw
near, many residents of the Ugandan capital Kampala are stocking
food, with some even sending their children to hometowns in fear
of more political violence.
</P>
<P>
There have been cases of frictions since the election campaign
was kicked off at the end of March. Rival parties are
intensifying the exchange of accusations to be coupled, over
often, with intimidation and harassment, heightening the fear of
uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
Panic purchasing of consumer goods is prevailing. Rice, maize
flour, wheat flour, sugar and cooking oil are being bought in
large quantities.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I will take a bag of rice home because my family are all
afraid of election violence," a buyer in Owino market in central
Kampala said.
</P>
<P>
"Truly," another shop-goer, Kazin Michael, said, "I do not buy
much as a rule, but this time I will."
</P>
<P>
So far prices have remained stable with one kilogram of local
rice sold at about 1,000 Uganda Shillings (about one U.S. Dollar).
</P>
<P>
One dealer said the uncertainty over the elections has pushed
import demand down to an all time low.
</P>
<P>
Some others said that they would close down their business
during the elections and keep themselves at home.
</P>
<P>
A woman, who rented a stall at the market to sell eggs,
soybeans and mung beans, said she would soon go to her home
village with her 10-year-old daughter and stay there until the
elections proved peace and calm.
</P>
<P>
Local travel agencies, one the other hand, have confirmed more
and more people are travelling abroad around the time of
elections.
</P>
<P>
The agencies are experiencing a remarkably higher number of
bookings to Nairobi, the capital of neighboring Kenya, travel
agency sources said.
</P>
<P>
In order to soothe the citizens, Ugandan Minister of
Local Government Bidandi Ssali has been calling for peace and
calm, warning to punish the trouble-makers.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has also pledged to deploy
more police to beef up security.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interim Electoral Commission, the three
presidential candidates, Yoweri Museveni, Paul Ssemogerere and
Mohammed Mayanja, will end their campaigns on May 7 and the
elections will take place on May 9.
</P>
<P>
Results of the elections will be announced on May 11.

<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin told
visiting former Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita today
that leaders and statesmen from both China and Japan should make
concerted efforts to ensure that friendship between the two
countries passes from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that at the turn of the 20th century, leaders and
statesmen of the two countries should take a distant and broad
view in the handling of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
As neighbours, China and Japan shared much in common
historically and culturally, Jiang said, and the people of the two
countries have enjoyed time-honored friendly exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Japanese relations have developed greatly, Jiang said, and
such developments should be attributed to the joint efforts of the
statesmen and people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
What is important in the way of bilateral relations is to have
a right attitude towards history, and open the future with major
efforts, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The president, referring to the former Japanese prime minister
as an old friend of the Chinese people, said that Noboru Takeshita
has always devoted himself to the growth of Sino-Japanese
relations, both during his term as prime minister and after
leaving the post.
</P>
<P>
Noboru Takeshita, who arrived in China to attend the
inauguration ceremony of a Sino-Japanese center for environmental
protection, said that many of those well-diggers, the Japanese who
had made contributions to the growth of Japanese-Chinese
relations, have passed away. The younger generation in Japan
should carry out the behest of their older generation to make
fresh contributions to the long-term and stable development of the
relations between Japan and China, he added.

<HEADLINE> Otto Orders Aidid's Deputy To Leave Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader Osman
Hassan Ali Atto has ordered General Aidid's "deputy president"
Abdurahman Ahmed Ali Tuur to leave the Somali captial Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
In an ultimatum broadcast on Sunday night, Atto asked Tuur to
leave within a week, accusing him of being responsible for the
continuing hostility in South Mogadishu between his supporters
and those of General Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tuur recently told the local "Horn of Africa" newspaper
that Atto and his supporters were continuing unrightful and
meaningless fighting against General Aidid, who controls most
of South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The ultimatum dismissed the remarks by Mr. Tuur as baseless
and misguided.
</P>
<P>
The security of such provocative elements would not be
guaranteed in South Mogadishu, the ultimatum said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tuur became the first president of the break away
republic of Somali Land before he was replaced by Mr. Mohamed
Haji Ibrahim in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In April 1994, Mr. Tuur renounced the secessionist policy
and joined the South Mogadishu conference sponsored by General
Aidid, who chose him later as the "first deputy president".
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tuur is being hosted by General Aidid in a heavily
fortified residence in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Atto used to be Aidid's financier. Since they turned against
each other a year ago, more than 120 people have been killed in
the fighting between the militiamen loyal respectively to the two
South Mogadishu faction leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Qu Yunxia, who
failed to qualify for the 800 meter final two days ago, looked
better in her specialty 1,500-meter Monday at the Chinese track
and field trials for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
There were no impressive results in four finals Monday, third
day of the trials, when a consistant rain effected the women's
discus and triple jump.
</P>
<P>
Qu, who is holding the women's 800 meters world record with
3:50.46, advanced to Tuesday's final in an easy run of 4:21.09 in
the heat race.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuan, world junior records holder for both the 800 and
1,500 meters who also failed to qualify for the 800m, got a berth
in the final in 4:19.44. Liu Dong, world 800m champion in 1993
ran a faster time in the heat with 4:18.18.
</P>
<P>
It was the first 1,500 race for Qu and Liu, who want to make a
comeback in the Olympic year.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Qu and Wang can do better in the 1,500m final, because
it will be their last chance if they want to go to Atlanda," said
Guo Jinfeng, an assisant coach of the "Ma's Army."
</P>
<P>
Guo said that Ma Junren, who is lying at a hospital in Beijing
due to an illness, contacted Guo through telephone last night, and
expressed his surprise at the poor showings of his talented girls.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Jiang Bo, the ace runner of Ma's group who ran the
fourth fastest time in the 5,000m last year, stopped and pulled
out of the 5,000m final when she was dropped behind after seven
laps. The girl weeped and told media to ask her coach for the
reason.
</P>
<P>
"Ma said the poor results were unbelieable. He was shocked and
upset," Guo revealed of Ma's response.
</P>
<P>
But there are some whispers here among the Chinese journalists
that Ma is playing another trick to fool the media and his
opponents, because he knew the results at the current trials are
not the decisive factor to seal who will go to Atlanda.

"Ma is very cunning. Even we got no idea what cards he is
playing," said Shang Xiutang, an official of the Chinese Athletic
Association.
</P>
<P>
"But we do want the best athletes who have best potentials to
make the team. Our selection system is not like that of the United
States. The results here will be accounted as one factor. We have
to consider many other factors before making the final decision, "
Shang added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the final list of the Olympic squad would not
be announced before July 4, the date of the deadline for the
registeration.
</P>
<P>
Shang said a 30-person seletion group will be formed and
discuss who will be the member of the team.
</P>
<P>
"It is made up of experienced coaches, officials and team
leaders," Shang told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
That means even if Jiang, Qu and Liu fail to clock good times
at the meet, they still have chances to make the team later.
</P>
<P>
"But they have to back up the decision with impressive results
during the coming two months," Shang said.
</P>
<P>
In the day's women's discus, Xiao Yanling, who completed a
two-year-suspension on May 1, returned to competition and
tossed 63.70 meters during the rain.
</P>
<P>
The mark was the 12th world best last year and was about
three meters short of Xiao's personal best.
</P>
<P>
Run Ruiping, former world triple jump record setter but injured
last year, jumped 14.19 meters to win the gold through the wet
weather.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 3,000m steeplechase, Qin Gang finished first in
8:32.89, ahead of Sun Ripeng, one of Ma Junren's men's
runners. Sun clocked 8:34.96.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Taba Talks Suffer Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The second session of the Palestinian-
Israel final stage negotiations today suffered a crisis when the
Palestinian side protested against leaking news by the Israeli
delegation, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported from
Taba.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation said the Israeli-leaked news claimed
that due to Israel's pressure, the speech of the head of the
Palestinian delegation did not refer to the U.N. resolution
calling for the return of Palestinian refugees or the dismantling
of Israeli settlements.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Palestinian delegation emphasized their
rejection of the Israeli practice based on fraud and deceit, as
the Palestinian side rejects any pressure from the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the Palestinian delegation, including Hassan
Assfour and Mohammed Dajlan, walked out of the meeting hall.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Palestinian delegation Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen),
also member of the PLO Executive Committee, met with his Israeli
counterpart Uri Savir, urging him to deny what was rumored about
the Israeli pressure and to ensure the non-recurrence of such
leakage of rumors in the future.
</P>
<P>
After one hour, the Palestinian delegation returned back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Assfour said the Palestinians who were compelled to
leave their homeland in 1948 are entitled to be repatriated,
adding that the Palestinian side also calls for setting up an
independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital
and dismantling Israeli settlements, not removing them, so that
the Palestinians can use them.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel started the final stage of their
peace negotiations in the Egyptian Red Sea town of Taba
Sunday. The Taba round of talks is due to be concluded later
today.

MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Exposure to lead, a major pollutant

<P>
The studies, reviewing the country's environmental health
assessment from February 1995 to February 1996, said that lead
from gasoline, fumes from gas and paints also affect children's

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met here
today with visiting Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and his
party.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Ter-Petrosyan is the first Armenian head of state
to visit China since it gained independence and this visit will
spur new development of Sino-Armenian friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Although far away from each other, Li said, China and Armenia
have continuously strengthened exchanges in various levels and
fields, which is helpful to deepen mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan said he was very glad to pay state visit to
China, which has achieved positive results. Armenia and China had,
and have, many common points, he said. Armenia can learn a lot of
experience from China, which started early to implement the policy
of reform and opening up and has made great achievements.
</P>
<P>
Li said China and Armenia have their own economic advantages
and are complimentary to each other, which forms the basis for
bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Our two governments should take a practical approach and
foresight, to create good conditions for equal and beneficial
cooperation in the light of the rules of market economy, and to
explore more cooperative channels and fields.
</P>
<P>

states after the integration of the former Soviet Union. "We hold
that people in every country have the right to choose their own
road of development, and we respect the choice of the Armenian
people and support their efforts to become an equal member of the
international community," Li emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He briefed the guests on the situation of China's reform and
opening up, saying that political and social stability are the
preconditions for smooth reform and opening-up, and a good
international environment is also an important factor.

willing to develop friendly and cooperative ties with all
countries in the world on the basis of equality, mutual benefit
and mutual respect," Li added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Sets up Market-Oriented Employment System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China will hopefully become a nation
of jobhunters by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Almost half a century of 'jobs for life' with giant state-owned
operations is to be swept away as part of the country's drive for
employment reform.
</P>
<P>
Just as in the case of industrial reform, the Chinese
government is planning to set up a market-oriented employment
system, ending the days of the government-planned one of the past
40-odd years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor has announced that the new system will be
set up before the year 2000, under which Chinese people will be
held responsible for finding jobs themselves.
</P>
<P>
Job opportunities, which used to be provided mainly by the
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, are expected to
come from more non-state-owned small businesses and the booming
service sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a contract labor system will be in place across
the country by the end of this year, marking an end to the
40-year-old "iron rice bowl" guarantee of lifelong employment for
125 million Chinese workers.
</P>
<P>
Labor contracts are to be signed before next year between
employers and employees in all enterprises except those in a few
remote regions, according to officials with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Chinese sociologists and officials with labor departments
believe that the ongoing reforms have been, and will continue to
be, a great challenge to the outdated employment concept among the
population.
</P>
<P>
Under the old system, the workers were assigned jobs by the
government and they relied on their employers not only for jobs,
but also a "cradle-to-grave" welfare system, such as housing,
medical care and retirement insurance.
</P>
<P>
These benefits, encouraging workers to "be faithful to their
jobs to the end", were provided at the expense of economic
efficiency and competitiveness of many enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The new market-oriented system will encourage job seekers to
choose professions according to their own abilities and demands of
job markets," said Wang Cheng, an official with the Labor Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The government and social organizations, such as job placement
agencies, will provide counselling services and other help to job
seekers as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government urges private enterprises, individually-owned
companies, Sino-foreign joint ventures and foreign-funded firms to
absorb laborers," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition to full-time jobs, job seekers will have more
choice in job markets, such as part-time jobs, temporary jobs and
piecework, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sociologists held that China's reform of its employment system
is an inevitable product while the country steps up its economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has announced its economic development
goals in the Ninth Five-Year plan period (1996-2000), vowing to
achieve shifts of economic structure from a planned one to a
market-oriented one.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises, particularly state-owned large and
medium-sized ones, have been urged to sharpen edges in market
competition.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises, many of which are troubled by redundant
personnel, outdated equipment and poor efficiency, have to cut
down on employees in an effort to raise efficiency, the experts
said.
</P>
<P>
So businesses of different economic sectors, growing up in the
recent decade, are expected to provide a huge market for millions
of laborers, the experts suggested.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government encouraged the development of private
and collectively-owned businesses, as well as Sino-foreign joint
ventures and foreign-funded firms, as supplementary to the
state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
Non-state-owned firms in the service sector, for example, will
play a key role in absorbing laborers in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics available showed that small enterprises and service
sector businesses have employed 20 percent of the total job
seekers in the past decade. They also provided jobs for many
displaced workers from poorly-run enterprises in recent years.
</P>
<P>
China is further improving its social security system, which is
thought necessary for building the market-oriented employment
system.
</P>
<P>
China will ensure more jobless people benefit from unemployment
insurance, and will set up unemployment relief funds and a
re-employment system, according to the government's economic
development plan for the 1996-2000 period.

<HEADLINE> Telephone Hotline to Track Down Budget Cheats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Finance today
announced a special confidential telephone hot line to enable the
public to report people cheating the system.
</P>
<P>
Targets are cheats who have used extra-budget funds to buy
luxury goods such as cars and houses.
</P>
<P>
The three special telephone numbers will let the public report
irregularities in the handling of extra-budgetary funds.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Finance welcomes reports from the general
public, and will keep their names secret," the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a recent announcement that China will
launch a national campaign to clean up and tighten supervision of
extra-budgetary funds between May and September.
</P>
<P>
Jin Lianshu, a senior official with the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China said that
"it's very important to soundly manage and make use of
extra-budgetary funds."
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China's total amount of
extra-budgetary funds have grown a great deal since the late
1970s, to more than 300 billion yuan (about 35.7 billion US
dollars) at present.
</P>
<P>
"Because of lax management, illegal and irregular activities
have occured in the use of extra-budgetary funds," Jin said.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, work units have used the funds to buy luxury
cars and houses or to speculate in real estate and stocks, Jin
said, adding that worse still, some of the funds have been
embezzled.
</P>
<P>
The official admitted that irregularities in extra-budgetary
funds have played havoc with the financial order. He said that
good supervision of the such funds will also be helpful to China's
anti-corruption drive.

</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local Arabic-language daily Al-Anbaa
(News) published today, Suwaidan said discussions with the United
States to purchase a number of these weapons are currently under
way. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Patriot missiles were used effectively by the Israelis to
intercept the former Soviet Union-made Scud missiles launched by
the Iraqis against the Israeli targets during the Gulf War in
1991.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest effort by the small emirate to strengthen
its defense capabilities after it was liberated from the Iraqi
seven-month occupation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The Kuwaiti Air Force is executing programs with timetables
to modernize its equipment and devices to stay abreast of the
developments in the 20th century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Suwaidan said Kuwait is also holding negotiations with the
U.S. to purchase Black Hawk and Apache aircraft. Meanwhile, the
Kuwaiti early-warning system will be upgraded with most up-to-date
devices, radars and computers, he added.
</P>
<P>
His statement coincided with the ongoing joint military
exercises conducted by the Kuwaiti, U.S. and French navies in the
Gulf which lasts from May 4 to 8.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait signed a military cooperation agreement with Washington
following the liberation of the Gulf state from the Iraqi
occupation in 1991. Under the accord, Kuwait obtains military
equipment necessary for the defense of the country and its
military troops hold exercises with U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
Five years later, Kuwait is still trying to rebuild its
military, which lost more than 90 percent of its equipment and
installations in the Iraqi invasion.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait spent about 300 million Dinars (1 billion U.S. dollars)
on defense last year, according to official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping Meets Hong Kong Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The future Provisional Legislative
Council will not infringe upon the power of the Legislative
Council of the British Hong Kong government, a leading government
official said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
the State Council, added that there will not be a case of two
legislatures existing in Hong Kong at the same time.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he met a delegation from the Hong Kong
General Chamber of Commerce, headed by its chairman James P C Tien.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the Legislative Council of the British Hong Kong
government will cease to exist on June 30, 1997, and the laws made
by the Provisional legislative Council will be put into effect on
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
When asked on the schedule for the establishment of the
Provisional Legislature, Lu said this matter has so far not been
discussed by the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
He personally thought that it should not be set up too early,
so as to avoid any doubts among Hong Kong residents of having two
legislatures at the same time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu pledged that any laws made by the Provisional Legislative
Council must be absolutely necessary and urgent.
</P>
<P>
Some less urgent laws can be left for the first SAR Legislative
Council that will be set up later, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong visitors told Lu that many foreign nationals
living in Hong Kong hope to obtain the status of permanent Hong
Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
However, they cannot become permanent Hong Kong residents
unless they become British nationals, the visitors said, adding
that many of them hope this issue can be resolved before July 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
Lu promised the Provisional Legislative Council will study the
problem and formulate legal ordinances for resolving the issue
after it is established.
</P>
<P>
On the development of the China-funded enterprises in Hong
Kong, Lu said those enterprises will not enjoy any privileges and
must abide by the laws there.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Chairman Meets British Labor Party Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- British businesses will be welcomed
in China if they have the ability to compete, Robin Cook,
spokesman on foreign affairs of the British Labor Party, was told
in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
China's Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, met with Cook in the Great Hall of the
People today.
</P>
<P>
They had a friendly conversation on strengthening economic
relations and trade between the two countries, while exchanging
views on issues of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to develop economic ties with Britain and all
other countries, Qiao said. China does not have any prejudices in
the development of economic ties with the rest of the world. So
long as British enterprises have the ability to compete, the
bilateral economic ties between the two countries could be greatly
developed.
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of China's economic growth, Qiao said, it is
entirely possible for the country to have a sustained, healthy and
stable economic development as China is adhering to its reform and
opening policies, while mobilizing the initiatives of the masses
and tapping the economic potentials.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Hong Kong, Qiao said Hong Kong could become a
bridge in Sino-British long-term and friendly
cooperation. However, this depends on the efforts of both sides.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Cook said, he was deeply impressed by China's
economic achievements over the past years. The British Labor Party
wished to enhance exchanges with China in various fields with a
view to establishing constructive and partnership relations, he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Gross Domestic Product
 (GDP) rose 3.2 percent in real terms in the fourth quarter of
last year over the same quarter in 1994, according to an official
 release today.
</P>
<P>
The release said that this modest growth was brought about by
continued sluggish consumer spending, a slow-down in private
sector investment expenditure and a decelerated growth in exports.
</P>
<P>
For 1995 as a whole, the GDP grew 4.6 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Among the major GDP components, re-exports registered a slower
growth of 9.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995 in real terms
over the same quarter of 1994, while domestic exports fell 5.2
percent in real terms after recording increases for four
consecutive quarters, according to the release.

</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both sides reviewed ties of friendship and
cooperation between the two countries and agreed on the need to
reactivate them to serve the common interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
They also reviewed attempts by dominating states, and the U.S.
in particular, to sabotage relations between states and peoples
under the cover of a false international legitimacy to impose
hegemony on these states, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides stressed the need to maintain contacts to probe
means of cooperation despite difficulties faced by the two countries
at the current circumstances, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Health Omed Medhat Mubarak also met with the
Bulgarian minister. The two health ministers discussed the
suffering brought about by the over five-year U.N. embargo imposed
on iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The embargo has led to a rise in mortality rates as a result of
acute shortages of medicine and medical services. The Bulgarian
minister expressed her country's readiness to broaden bilateral
medical cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets EU's Sir Leon Brittan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen held talks in Beijing today with Sir Leon
Brittan, vice-president of European Union (EU) Commission.
</P>
<P>
They both voiced satisfaction over the development of Sino-EU
ties in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Citing his current China visit, taking place after the EU adopted
a long-term policy on its ties with China last year, Brittan told
Qian that EU held that there are two characteristics in EU-China
relations: comprehensiveness and independence.
</P>
<P>
The EU is willing to promote its ties with China in the fields
of politics, strategies, economy and cooperation, which is in line
with EU's interests, Brittan noted, adding that such ties would
not be affected by any other factors.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his appreciation towards the EU's long-term
policy on its ties with China as well as its positive manner of
promoting EU-China relations.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation in every field between China and the EU, both
major forces in current world politics and economy, would not
only benefit the two sides, but also serve world peace, stability
and development, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China and the EU share many common interests while having their
own characteristics and differences, Qian noted, adding that
instead of being antagonistic, these differences could be used to
promote bilateral cooperation through complementing each other.
</P>
<P>
It is quite natural for China and the EU to have some
divergences since there exist differences in their social systems,
cultures, histories and geographies, Qian said, stating that so
long as the two sides sought more common ground while preserving
differences, they would maintain a favorable atmosphere of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Touching on bilateral economic and trade ties, Qian said that
Sino-EU trade volume last year hit 40 billion US dollars for the
first time, which totally conforms to the interests of the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that the council of the EU has recently
decided to call off the quota restrictions on the two of the seven
kinds of Chinese products, and raise the quota level of the other
five kinds. We welcome such a positive step taken by the EU and we
hope that the EU would adopt even more positive measures to
totally abolish the unreasonable restrictions on China's export
products", Qian told Brittan.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of China's access to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Qian noted that China appreciated that the EU
had stated on many occasions that it would support China becoming
a member of the WTO at an early date. China welcomes the view that
the EU would strengthen its cooperation with China in this
multilateral field, and hopes that the request made by EU in this
regard would be in a more practical manner, Qian added.
</P>
<P>
Brittan reaffirmed the EU's position that it supports China to
accede to the WTO as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Qian and Brittan also exchanged views on
international and regional issues of common interests.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this afternoon, Chinese Vice-minister Sun Zhenyu of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation also confer with Brittan,
who arrived in China's capital yesterday as guest of Qian Qichen.

<HEADLINE> 50 Sent to Hospital in HK after Tube Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- About 50 passengers suffering from
 suffocation were sent to hospital this morning soon after a
two-minute delay of a regular train plunged Hong Kong's
underground railway into chaos.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened at the morning rush hour when a breakdown
 signal system delayed a train for two minutes, triggering a spate
 of suspension in other stations.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of impatient passengers jammed railroad
carriages and the platform for about an hour -- the most serious
accident since the Mass Transit Railway started its operation 18
years ago, reported the New Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of fresh air and a jam of people, some 50
passengers felt sick and dizzy, and need medical treatment in
hospital. Some blamed the ventilation system at the stations.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that more Hong Kong people chose the underground
 transport means to steer away from the bad weather, with
thunderstorms forecast today.
</P>
<P>
The Mass Transit Railway is one of the busiest underground
railways in the world, carrying 2.4 million passengers a
day.

<HEADLINE> Saving Deposits Structure Changes in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The structure of saving deposits in
Shanghai has undergone changes since an interest subsidy was
cancelled on April 1, according to financial sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the total amount of saving deposits has
grown despite the withdrawal of the subsidy on top of normal
interest rates, but the growth of fixed deposits has slowed down.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that saving deposits in state-owned
banks in China's largest city increased by 4.1 billion yuan (about
488 million US dollars) in the first half of April, about 1.9
billion yuan more than in the same period of March.
</P>
<P>
Other banks saw their volume of saving deposits rose by 65
million yuan, a rise of 44 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"This fact demonstrates that the cancellation of the interest
subsidy has not produced a marked impact on the growth of the
overall size of saving deposits in Shanghai," an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the structure of saving deposits has
changed. He noted that time saving deposits grew by 1.4 billion
yuan in the first half of April, 900 million yuan less than a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
The general trend is short-term deposits increasing faster than
long-term ones, added the analyst.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that fixed saving deposits will continue to
grow steadily, but at a lower pace than demand deposits.
</P>
<P>
China reimposed subsidies on bank interest in July 1993 and
abolished it on April 1 in response to declining inflation.

<HEADLINE> China to Raise 4.5 Billion US Dollars for Nuclear Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China plans to raise 4.5 billion US
dollars in foreign funds for the construction of the Ling'ao
Nuclear Power Plant in south China's Guangdong Province over the
next seven years.
</P>
<P>
"The State Development Bank has started to raise those funds by
signing agreements with parties concerned to use about 2.3 billion
US dollars in export credit provided by the British and French
governments last October," said Yao Zhenyan, president of the
bank, at the opening ceremony of a representative office in the
special economic zone in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
China will organize international syndicate loans and issue
bonds on overseas markets to take in the rest of the funds, said
Yu Xiaoping from the bank's International Finance Department.
</P>
<P>
The Ling'ao Nuclear Power Plant is the second of its kind in
Guangdong and will have two generating units, each with a capacity
of 900,000 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Its construction is scheduled to start in July and be completed
in the year 2000, and will be wholly financed with foreign
capital. Guangdong's first nuclear power plant is in Daya Bay.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the representative office is part of the bank's
efforts to provide better services for key state projects in
Guangdong and Hainan Province, also in south China.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994 Guangdong has received 9.16 billion yuan in loans
from the bank, which has arranged 4.2 billion yuan in loans for 11
large and medium-sized projects in the province so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The bank extended loans to help build a new airport in Haikou,
capital of Hainan, and a natural-gas-made fertilizer plant in
Hainan.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Monday it would expel
several British diplomats after it had busted a British spy ring
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Krylov summoned British
Ambassador Andrew Wood after the arrest of a Russian citizen in
Moscow who was accused of spying for Britain, the Interfax news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The spy was caught when he was contacting the resident agents
of the British Secret Intelligence Center (SIC), the Itar-Tass
news agency quoted Alexander Zdanovich, acting chief of the
Federal Security Service (FSB) Public Relations Center, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zdanovich said the detained Russian, who was found with
espionage equipment, had admitted his criminal acts and given
details of his recruitment and his collaboration with the SIC.
</P>
<P>
Russia had made a "stern protest" at Britain's use of its
embassy as cover for "spying activities," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Foreign Ministry told the British ambassador,
"a number of English intelligence agents...are being expelled from
Russia for activities incompatible with diplomatic status."
</P>
<P>
According to reports from London, a British Foreign
Office spokesman in London said that "we regard the kind of
allegations that are being reported in the media as completely
unjustified."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to establish a
satellite-based meteorological information system in the Tibet
Autonomous Region by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed as "the roof of the world," Tibet is known for its rough
climate and terrains, bringing much trouble to meteorological
research in the area.
</P>
<P>
The information system will largely promote the research, and
turn out abundant economic benefits for Tibetan people, said
People's Posts and Telecommunications Daily.
</P>
<P>
The system will adopt the latest information technologies such
as satellite telecommunications, data bases and program-controlled
switching. When it is operational the new system will enable all
the local meteorological bodies to be linked by a single network,
providing the latest weather information from any corner of Tibet
at the earliest moment.
</P>
<P>
 The network's transport speed will be 100 times of the
present one.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the network will be connected with Beijing through
a number of satellite ground stations.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Strives for Grain Self-Sufficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Southwestern frontier province
of Yunnan has drawn up a ten-point plan to ensure that the area
becomes self-sufficient in its grain production.
</P>
<P>
Poorly educated farmers and a massive mountainous terrain have
conspired to hit grain output in the province.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of grain output has long been an embarrassment to
southwest Yunnan, but now the province is striving to hold its
head high by carrying out a grain self-sufficiency programme.
</P>
<P>
The current consumption of grain in Yunnan is around 13 million
tons annually, against an annual production of 11.89 million
tons. Every year, the province imports over one million tons of
grain from Hunan, Sichuan provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has recently raised a goal that by
2000 the province's grain output must climb to 13.4 million tons
so that the demand and supply of grain is basically balanced.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the end of this century the population
of the province will reach 43 million, with a grain demand of 13.5
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Poor geological conditions have for a long time curbed the
development of agriculture. The mountainous region accounts for 93
percent of the province's territory, making mechanized cultivation
difficult.
</P>
<P>
Although the climate is pleasant for humans, low temperatures
in the July-September period is disadvantageous to the growth of
crops. Worse is the poor education of farmers. All of these
factors contribute to the province's low grain output.
</P>
<P>
In response to the unfavorable factors, the province has worked
out ten strategies, such as using modern farming techniques in 50
counties or cities which have better cultivation conditions,
applying advanced planting techniques in order to raise per unit
yield, increasing the multi-cropping index in the tropical and
sub-tropical regions, building of water conservancy projects,
spread of science and technology by training farmers, building
facilities for the supplying of capital goods to agricultural
production, comprehensively developing agriculture, putting
greater input in less-developed mountainous region.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the grain self-sufficiency plan needs an investment
of 1.8 billion yuan (about 217 million US dollars), a tough job
for a frontier province. Provincial officials have expressed the
hope to solicit support from the central government.

<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Romance and love has survived the
massive earthquake which rocked parts of north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Just hours after the quake, which measured 6.4 on the Richter
scale, couples were exchanging their vows at wedding ceremonies in
urban areas of Baotou city.
</P>
<P>
Most of the city dwellers are living in emergency shelters
because of aftershocks. But many couples decided that their
weddings should go on as planned -- cupid defeating fear in quake
city.
</P>
<P>
Officials say people in the quake-hit area have recovered from
the shock and society is in good order.
</P>
<P>
Government organs, institutions and factories in Baotou city
were today operating normally.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale struck the
Baotou-Guyang area in Inner Mongolia on May 3.
</P>
<P>
In Hoyor Hudag town, located in the epicenter area, damaged and
collapsed houses are testimony to the force of the quake, but
local residents have recovered from the shock, and many of them
resumed work on their farmland.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Yang Ercai said, "Regional officials of different levels
have visited us time and again after the quake, and sent injured
residents to urban hospitals. We believe that the government can
help us defeat any difficulty."
</P>
<P>
At present, there is still possibility of aftershocks. In
Baotou city, 70 percent of the residents are living in anti-quake
shelters and they are living peacefully and safely under the
protection of local police and community-organized guards.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, in the quake-hit area, business in
department stores, public traffic, supply of foodstuffs and
vegetables have all continued to operate as normal. There are no
reports of panic-buying in the quake-hit area due to sufficient

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- In a pre-election campaign to
crack down on suspected terrorists, the Israeli army has arrested
a total of 14 Palestinians in the West bank, according to an
army spokesman's announcement today.
</P>
<P>
The move, which took place Sunday night is aimed at picking up
activists suspected of belonging to and supporting hostile
organizations. Eleven of them were arrested in the Dahariye
Refugee Camp in the Hebron region, two in the village of
Jin-safut, Tulkarm region and one in Amratah Village, Nablus
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Israel Radio, the Palestinian security
service has asked Israel to help locate two residents in the
Hebron region who are believed to be on their way to carry out
suicide attacks.
</P>
<P>
The two Palestinian youths disappeared from their homes over
the weekend. Both were detained in Israeli jail last year for
allegedly being active in Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Israel fears that radical Islamic groups would launch a new
round of terrorist attacks as the election day is drawing
near. General Security Service head Ami Ayalon told the weekly
cabinet Sunday that there are signs indicating so, but he
discounted a report in the Ma'ariv newspaper that some half a
dozen suicide bombers are already inside the Israeli territory
waiting to act.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Urges Developing Modern Chain Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China should develop chain stores to
speed up reforms in the commercial sector, said Li Lanqing, vice
premier, during an inspection tour in Tianjin in north China.
</P>
<P>
Li, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee
of the Communist Part of China, pointed out that chain stores,
through large-scale purchase and helping producers directly sell
goods to consumers, can upgrade China's retail network.
</P>
<P>
"The chain stores will spur industries producing modern daily
consumer goods, lower retail prices by reducing intermediary
costs, effectively clear shoddy products from the market, and put
in place scientific management mechanisms by separating purchasing
and marketing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Distribution centers must be set up, otherwise there can be no
modern chain stores," he emphasised.
</P>
<P>
"Top priority should be given to establishing chain stores
providing convenient services for residents," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Luxurious department stores and super-markets should not be
the pillar in China's chain-store commerce sector."
</P>
<P>
Li visited several non-profit-seeking consumer cooperatives,
which set up chain stores in idle workshops, purchased goods
directly from factories and sold them at discount prices to
members of the trade unions in Tianjin, especially those in need.
</P>
<P>
He praised the practice, which combined improving employees'
lives with developing modern chain stores.

ATHENS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- An Italian sculptor was arrested and
15.5 kilograms of heroin seized today at a frontier post on the
Greek-Turkish border.
</P>
<P>
The smuggler was identified as Leonardo Bianchi, 48, an
alabaster sculptor from Volterra in central Italy.
</P>
<P>
After searching Bianchi's car for two hours, customs officers
found the heroin, packed in 30 airtight bags, in a specially

According to the suspect, the special compartment in the patrol
tank was fitted in Istanbul by a Turkish member of the trafficking
ring whom Bianchi named as Guldekin.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Lures 3 Billion Dollars in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government had permitted
169 projects with a total foreign investment of 3.23 billion US
dollars from 19 countries and regions by the end of March this
year, according to latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The country has quickened its pace of economic development with
the foreign capital inflow in recent years and achieved an annual
growth rate of 8.2 percent in the last four-year plan which ended
on March 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
Among the nine sectors that are the focuses of foreign
investment, the oil and gas sector holds the largest volume of
foreign investment with over 1.43 billion US dollars in 24
projects, and the second is the sector of hotels and tourism with
647 million US dollars in 34 projects, followed by fisheries, real
estate development, mining, manufacturing, transport, agriculture
and industrial estate.
</P>
<P>
Of the top-seven countries investing in Myanmar, Britain ranks
the first with a total investment of 792 million US dollars in 19
projects ranging from manufacturing to oil and gas, followed by
Singapore, which dominates investment in hotels and tourism, and
then France, Thailand, the United States, Malaysia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been luring foreign investment since late 1988 when
it launched its reform policy by moving its centrally-planned
economic system towards a market-oriented one.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the country promulgated the foreign investment law and
formed the Foreign Investment Commission (FIC) with the aim of
promoting and expanding exports, exploiting natural resources,
acquiring high technology, supporting production and services
involving large capital, and creating more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In order to attract more foreign investment, Myanmar has
offered some privileges to foreign investors. They have been
assured that their investment shall not be nationalized and
expropriated and their rightful entitlement in foreign currency
could be repatriated after termination of their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in natural and human resources on account of
its vast cultivable land, long coastline, navigable river system,
lush forests, abundant minerals, gems and literate population.

<HEADLINE> Improvements in Sichuan's Education Level Recent Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics show that the
level of illiteracy in southwest China's Sichuan Province has
dropped markedly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The survey was based on one percent of the province's 110
million people, 80 percent of whom living in rural areas. It
showed that, by the end of 1995, the number of people at or above
the age of six who could read accounted for 84.97 percent of its
total population, an increase of 4.8 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Wang Kezhi, an official with the provincial education
department, explained that, "primary education has become
universal in 98 percent of the counties and prefectures of the
province."
</P>
<P>
The rate of illiteracy among the young and the middle-aged in
the province has been held below five percent so far, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that 1,386 of every 100,000 people have
received at least two years of college education, an increase of
425 persons since 1990.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, more than 35 percent of Sichuan's
population had received an education at or above the junior
middle-school level. Nearly 6,000 of every 100,000 people had a
senior middle school education, and nearly 25,000 a junior middle
school, up 600 and 2,910 respectively from 1990 figures.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Lance Armstrong won the fifth
stage of the Tour Dupont cycling race, his third stage and
extended his race overall advantage by 26 seconds Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While heavy rain during the final 15 kilometers, Armstrong
burst onto the leading position with about 100 meters left and won
the 181.1-km stage from Mt Airy to Roanoke road race in four hours
41 minutes 19 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Jean Cyril Robin of France was second and Federico Echave of
Spain placed third, both in the same time.
</P>
<P>
The rain caused several crashes in the warning miles,
including one suffered by Tony Rominger of Switzerland. The
reigning Tour of Italy winner fell with two other cyclists with
about 1.6 km left and eventually finished one minute eight seconds
behind the leading American.
</P>
<P>
Rominger began the day in second place, trailing the defending
champion by 35 seconds while Rominger now trails Armstrong by one
minute one second. Daniele Nardello of Italy is third, 1:09 behind.
</P>
<P>
The race continues Monday with the 216.4-km stage from Salem to

<HEADLINE> Shandong Develops Its Second Largest Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province will
invest 770 million yuan in developing Dongping Lake, the second
largest of the province's lakes.
</P>
<P>
With an area of 655 sq. km, the lake has been used both for
storage and diversion, during dry or flood seasons, from the
Yellow River, China's second longest.
</P>
<P>
The massive development program is considered an anti-poverty
project because 100,000 people living near the lake lead fairly
poor lives because of large tracts of low-lying farmland being
under water during the flood season.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial plan, the development will be
completed in five years and will cover six areas: agriculture,
water conservation, aquatic production, prospecting,
infrastructure, and welfare.
</P>
<P>
An expansion project will raise the lake's water storage
capacity to 800 million cubic meters, and some 1,330 ha of
low-lying land will be improved before the high-water season this
year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Suspend Purchase of Jet Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has instructed
the Royal Thai Air Force to suspend the acquisition of the second
batch of eight F-18 jet fighters for one or two years because of
budgetary constraints.
</P>
<P>
Air Force Chief-of-Staff ACM Amorn Naewmalee, in his capacity
as chairman of the procurement committee, said the Budget Bureau
recently informed the Air Force of the decision to suspend the
acquisition of the second batch of the aircraft because the
government thought it would not have enough budget to finance the
procurement in the next one or two years.
</P>
<P>
There would be no problem for the first batch of eight F-18s,
likely to be delivered in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force plans to acquire a squadron of 16 F-18s to be
purchased in two batches of eight each.
</P>
<P>
The budget for the first batch, amounting to about 10 billion
baht (400 million US dollars) and to be spread over five years
beginning 1996, is yet to be finalized by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Amorn said the Thai Air Force was negotiating with the United
States for the purchase of the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air
Missiles (AMRAAM) for the fighters.
</P>
<P>
The second batch will cost another eight billion baht (320
million dollars).

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Karim Alami became the first
Moroccan to win an ATP title on Sunday with a 6-3, 6-4 victory
over Nicklas Kulti of Sweden in the final of the Atlanta Tennis
tournament.
</P>
<P>
The closest he had come to a title win previously was to be
runner-up in Casablanca in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Kulti, a winner at Adelaide in 1991 and 1993, had reached his
first final since 1993 in Copenhagen. But the effort of ousting
second-seed Richey Reneberg on Saturday, slowed him for the final.
</P>
<P>
Alami, who eliminated 1995 champion Michael Chang in the
semi-finals, was aggressive after being broken at love in the
opening game, and he rallied to break Kulti and level at 3-3. He
then broke the Swede again and held serve to take the first set.
</P>
<P>
Kulti recovered in the second, but was forced to save three
break points in the seventh game to go 4-3 clear but then lost his
third break point to fall behind 5-4.
</P>
<P>
Alami held to win the match, although Kulti pushed him to four
match points before succumbing.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi to End Iodine-deficient Diets By 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
has 34.8 million people in its 107 municipalities, prefectures and
counties who are threatened by iodine deficiency, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi is one of the provinces in China with the highest rates
of iodine deficiency. Incomplete statistics show that 300,000
people are suffering from goiter, 20,000 are suffering from
pretinism and more than 500,000 from mental retardation caused by
iodine deficiency.
</P>
<P>
A province-wide campaign to add iodine to the diet of people in
the province started yesterday, with the aim of eradicating
diseases caused by iodine deficiency by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, which will carry through the entire year,
800,000 women including those newly-married and ready to bear
children, and pregnant and nursing mothers, as well as babies
under two years of age, and also 2.5 million children aged from
three to 14, will be provided with iodine pills, according to Fan
Xiaomei, deputy governor in charge of the task.
</P>
<P>
"Over 80 percent of the salt on the market by the end of the
year must meet iodization standards," Fan said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that in 1995, only 24.71 percent of the
salt in Shaanxi reached iodization standards and only 43.26
percent of the iodized salt from provincial producers was up to
required standards. In some counties only 35 percent of the people
used iodized salt.
</P>
<P>
In order to solve these problems, the province's concerned
departments stepped up supervision of the manufacture and sale of
iodized salt. In 1995, 869 cases of illegal salt were seized for a
total of over 1,201 tons of bellow standard salt. The provincial
government has ordered that sales of bulk salt be stopped, and
that salt be packed in small, clearly labeled bags, Fan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Conservative leader Jose Maria Aznar
took office as Spain's prime minister and named the new cabinet
here today.
</P>
<P>
``This is a government of the center, and with a profound
spirit of reform,'' Aznar told a news conference after taking the
oath of office before King Juan Carlos in a ceremony at the
Zarzuela Palace.
</P>
<P>
Aznar, 43, said his government was determined to cut public
spending, the budget deficit and bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Stimulating the economy to fight unemployment would be a
primary goal, he said. At 22 percent of the active labor force,
Spain has the highest unemployment rate in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Aznar appointed four women to his slimmed-down cabinet of 12
ministers, two fewer than in the former administration of Felipe
Gonzalez. The new cabinet will be sworn in on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aznar's center-right Popular Party won 156 seats in the 350
seat Chamber of Deputies in general elections two months ago. An
informal coalition with nationalist parties gives him a five-vote
parliamentary majority.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Police Making Efforts to Crack down on Major Crimes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Police in south China's booming
Guangdong Province have turned to sophisticated detection methods
to net major criminals who have brought terror and misery to the
area.
</P>
<P>
They are determined to keep one step ahead of robbers,
kidnappers and criminal gangs.
</P>
<P>
With its police force accounting for one 17th of the nation's
total, the province has to deal with one 5th of China's criminal
cases.
</P>
<P>
As soon as a major case occurs, police and special police
officers are immediately mobilized into action.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of over 10,000 police in all strategic places of
the province within one to two hours weaves an enormous net which
makes it impossible for offenders to escape, said Zhu Mingjian,
deputy director of Guangdong's Provincial Public Security
Department.
</P>
<P>
Liao Yongxiang, who killed four people and robbed a bank at
gunpoint in Zhongshan City on April 15 was one bird caught by the
net.
</P>
<P>
Liao was arrested 54 hours after committing the crime.
</P>
<P>
Other major cases include the serial killer of 17 people in the
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, a robbery on Dongxing Liner last
June which was masterminded by a Macao police officer, and the
biggest bank robbery in the history of New China in Fanyu City
last December, involving a total of 15 million yuan (some 1.8
million U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zhu attributes the cracking of those major cases to a basically
perfect investigation mechanism which the provincial police force
has been establishing since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, modern crimes, mostly spanning various
borders of the region, rely more on state-of-the-art
telecommunications and transportation instruments which "could
only be effectively curbed by a quick-response command system,
that is, mobilizing all forces to bring the situation under
control as soon as possible, so that criminals will not have
enought time to escape.
</P>
<P>
Detectives in Guangdong have signed agreements with their
colleagues in neighboring provinces and autonomous regions in
order to enable them to weave an even bigger net to catch
criminals.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong police have reached an understanding with their
colleagues in Hong Kong and Macao. An "urgent meeting" system, a
telephone hot line and an information exchange system between the
two sides have been introduced.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Win Five Titles at Olympic Boxing Tuneup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Super-heavyweight Alexis
Rubalcaba stopped Russia's Maxim Olgin in the first round to lead
other four Cubans to take five crowns at the Atlanta Boxing
Classic, an Olympic tuneup event on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Other Cuban champions included Hector Barrientos Stable at 51
kilograms, Lorenzo Aragon at 57 kg, Hector Vinent Charon at 63.5
kg and Ariel Hernandez Azcuuy at 75 kg.
</P>
<P>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The system demonstrated its efficiency in cracking the Dongxing
Liner Case, which was committed by a Macao police officer and
gangsters in Zhongshan City.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the crime occurred, police in Guangdong, Hong
Kong and Macao joined hands to search for the
suspects. Seventy-two hours later, Liang Bingzhao, the principal
culprit, was arrested at Hong Kong Airport. A total of 10 million
Hong Kong dollars stolen by the gangsters was discovered in
several hidden places soon after.
</P>
<P>
Zhu regarded modern criminal investigation as a contest of
high-tech and intelligence between police and criminal.
</P>
<P>
"We are stronger than most criminals in terms of transport and
telecommunications, as well as in firearm capability," he said,
"More importantly, we have the advantage of an advanced criminal
investigation system."
</P>
<P>
At a time when crimes tend to be committed in more complicated
ways than before and rely more on intelligence, leading police
officers in Guangdong believe that the era of a new generation of
commanders of criminal investigation has arrived.
</P>
<P>
The new generation of commanders, they believe, should not only
have outstanding investigation capabilities, but also the ability
to make wiser judgements, and organize and co-operate more
effectively than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, the police authorities in Guangdong have
stepped up the education of police officers in modern science and
technology, as well as in criminal investigation skills.
</P>
<P>
As crimes in futures trading increase more financial experts
have been invited to give lectures to the police to improve their
ability to cope with commercial crime.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Guangdong has witnessed more than 100
kidnappings a year. While 95 percent of the cases have been
cracked no hostages have been killed as a result of inappropriate
handling by police.

<HEADLINE> Depressed Major Gains Comfort From Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Conservatives have less
chance of winning the next general election if they dump their
leader Prime Minister John Major, said a poll published here
today.
</P>
<P>
The ICM survey conducted for the Sunday Express weekly warned
the Conservatives that nearly one in four people indicated that
they would be less likely to vote Tory if they pick a new leader.
</P>
<P>
And most of Major's potential successors are so unpopular that,
if elected to the post, they would virtually guarantee not just
victory for Labor, but for a Labor landslide, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, made after local Tory council leaders blamed Major
and his government for the disastrous defeat in the local
elections last week, showed that only Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine came close to matching Major among the possible
contenders for the Conservative leadership.
</P>
<P>
The poll also mirrored growing public opposition to a single
European currency.
</P>
<P>
It showed that 79 percent of people would against a single
European currency if a referendum was held now.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which was based on interviews of 1,000 adults through
telephone call between last Wednesday and Friday across Britain,
also found that 43 percent of people would vote to pull out of the
European Union, with 57 percent wanting to stay in.
